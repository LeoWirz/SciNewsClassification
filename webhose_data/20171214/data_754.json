It\u2019s also a particularly challenging time of the year financially.\nIt\u2019s so easy to overspend during the festive season, as we get caught up in the excitement and celebrations at the end of the year.\nIn 2016 the National credit regulator reported that the South African consumer was collectively in debt to the tune of R1.66 trillion. This includes mortgages, vehicle finance, secured as well as unsecured credit. Of the 23.88 million active consumers 60% (14.32 million) were in good standing while 40% (9.56 million) had impaired records.\nDecember is no different from any other time of the year. You do not necessarily have more money to spend, but if you are lucky enough to get a bonus, you should consider using this to prioritise debt, save and spend wisely over the festive season to avoid a financial hangover in the new year.\nHere are a few helpful tips to plan and keep track of your spending to achieve this:\nAssess each purchase \u2013 You are your own finance minister and must therefore assess all purchases on merit. The best way to do this is to ask yourself the following questions:\nIs it necessary? Is this an impulse purchase? Most importantly, can I afford it? Set a holiday budget \u2013 Consider setting a cap for general spending on your TOTAL holiday expenses. This would include travel, gifts and entertainment. But be realistic about your budget. Setting your cap too high will defeat the purpose of your budget and too low a budget will result in frustration and overspending. Allow for some flexibility, but try and stick to your budget as best you can. Some ways to save costs and stay within your budget could be:\nEntertain at home instead of going out. Travel locally instead of internationally. Predetermined gift values for each person you buy for and stick to it. Save a portion of your bonus \u2013 If you lucky enough to have a job and have earned a bonus save a portion of this into a money market fund or unit trust immediately. By saving first, before you spend automatically reduces the disposable income in your bank account and ensures accessibility to funds later for emergencies and/or the longest month of the year aka January. Preferably of course, I suggest avoiding access to these funds all together if possible. Instead I suggest creating a healthy habit of regular savings contributions via debit order and not just once off in December.\nLook for sales \u2013 online shopping and annual sales such as Black Friday or new year\u2019s sales can offer value for money. Discounted sales are good ways to reduce the cost of your Christmas shopping, but be aware of misleading marketing ploys \u2013 do your homework and shop around first before purchasing. This may require a little more of your time, but can benefit your pocket handsomely. These savings in turn can be used for other expenses such as entertainment.\nKeep track of spending \u2013 It\u2019s not necessary after every purchase to review your bank account, but its very easy to lose track of your spending and go over budget if you don\u2019t review what you\u2019ve spent. My suggestion is to keep tabs of what you spend daily with your TOTAL budget in mind.\nAvoid incurring bad debt \u2013 where possible avoid using credit cards to pay for a holiday, or gifts for friends and family. Debt is the biggest destroyer of wealth. There is, however, good and bad debt. \u2018Good\u2019 debt is used to purchase assets which will appreciate over time or provide an income, such as property or a business. Credit card debt offers no growth and incurs high costs which is detrimental to financial well-being. Start living within your means and reduce this kind of \u2018bad\u2019 debt where possible.\nTake responsibility for your financial decisions \u2013 We live in world of instant gratification. We want it all now! You know if you can afford to buy that luxury gift or new car or a trip to the Maldives. Lavish spending on credit especially if you can\u2019t afford it should be avoided.\nBe wary of criminals \u2013 the festive season is notorious for criminals trying to exploit people who are away from their businesses and homes. Make sure you are adequately insured to protect yourself and your assets.\nStart the new year with a healthy attitude towards long term saving \u2013 Retiring comfortably is dependent on your saving habits and the life choices you make years before retirement. Get into the habit of regularly saving a portion of your salary every month which is a good start! The longer you do this, the more you save, the better off you will be in retirement.\nConsider consulting an advisor \u2013 with the extra time available over the holidays, invest in yourself and consider consulting with a financial advisor.We all need to put into perspective where we are financially from time to time in order to ensure we are on track to reach our financial objectives.The festive season is a great time to do this and if you don\u2019t have a financial plan or don\u2019t know where to start, speak to a professional financial advisor who can assist you.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian butchart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cfp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "maldives", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:43.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "490cf7c1b34f6fc85d2de6619fcfa6b79ac89c9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_DRNYNHvKGwBXjWTOM6I0DqkaNuiAPwTQMyaigeTwXG5slxKROe6N", "site_full": "www.55188.com", "site": "55188.com", "site_section": "http://www.55188.com/forum-8-2.html", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "\u0104\u017e\u0161\u00c9\u0118\u0110\u0118\u013e\u0150\u02dd\u0110\u0139\u010e\u02d8\u02dd\u0165\u00c1\u00f7\u00c7\u0159\u0104\u017c -

"Capito Calls for Action on CHIP", "text": "Thursday, December 7, 2017 - 05:10 Updated 1 day ago Edited from a Press Release WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 In a letter to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) is urging swift action to extend funding for the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) before the end of the year. In the letter, Senator Capito outlines her long-standing support for the CHIP program, including to help implement the program in West Virginia when she was a state legislator. Since then, Senator Capito has consistently voted to fund and expand the CHIP program. The Senate Finance Committee advanced a five-year CHIP funding extension in October. \u201cThroughout my time serving the state of West Virginia, I have supported CHIP. In the state legislature, I served on the committee charged with implementing the CHIP program in West Virginia. As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and as a United States Senator, I have voted for bipartisan legislation to reauthorize and expand the CHIP program,\u201d said Senator Capito in the letter . \u201cThe CHIP program remains essential for working families in West Virginia and across the nation.\u201d Click here or read the full letter below: The Honorable Orrin Hatch 219 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Dear Chairman Hatch, I applaud the bipartisan work being done by the Finance Committee to reauthorize the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Under your leadership, the program began and over the years has provided working families across the nation health insurance coverage options they would not have otherwise. I share your passion for this program and will continue to work with the Committee and Senate Leadership to move the reauthorization forward as soon as possible. Throughout my time serving the state of West Virginia, I have supported CHIP. In the state legislature, I served on the committee charged with implementing the CHIP program in West Virginia. As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and as a United States Senator, I have voted for bipartisan legislation to reauthorize and expand the CHIP program. As you know, each year CHIP benefits approximately 9 million children and 370,000 pregnant women throughout the country, including approximately 22,000 children or 14,000 families in West Virginia. These families earn too much to be eligible for Medicaid, but often have no other coverage options.

Just two months ago, the employees of the cooperating parties and the students who have been acquainted with VivaCell-MTS business activities owing to different programs, voluntarily participated in the concreting of sidewalks adjacent to the Manukyans\u2019 house. Due to the joint efforts and the value system anchored on responsibility, new opportunities have been created for the young family. Only in the current year, in Aragatsotn region six families benefitied from the project. They all have different stories, but share the same problem: years of futile efforts to build their own house. Now the situation is different: having a safe roof ahead of winter is the solution to the most crucial problem. For years, the Manukyans, a family of 15, had lived in the family\u2019s father, Hrach\u2019s, paternal house. Later, in connection with Hrach\u2019s military service, he and his family moved into a rented apartment. \u201cWithout your help, I don't know how many years my children would continue living in foreign, rented houses. It\u2019s a true happiness to host the people who fulfilled our cherished and seemingly-impossible dream. I am so grateful,\u201d said the family father, Hrach. Owing to the six-year partnership, only in Aragatsotn region 21 families have completed the construction or renovation of their half-built houses. In the same village another family renovated the roof of their house with VivaCell-MTS General Manager Ralph Yirikian's personal donation.\u201cTogether with our employees, students have participated in the construction works of this house. The initiative of engaging students in the program was aimed at demonstrating to the youth the importance of volunteering, the joy of achieving success with joint efforts, and the necessity to be caring and simple, irrespective of one\u2019s position. I think we have reached our goal. These young people will propagate the same values among their peers. And today we have an important message for the hosts: we want them to be confident in themselves, set new goals and strive to achieve them as well,\u201d said VivaCell-MTS General Manager Ralph Yirikian.\u201cEach generation has its own difficulties in life, but elementary comfort, especially for children, is a priority.

The example of VivaCell-MTS is the best manifestation of fighting against homelessness and making a better future in Armenia,\u201d shared \u201cFuller Center for Housing\u201d Armenia President Ashot Yeghiazaryan.

But the city\u2019s fire legacy goes back much further. \nIn 1875, at Fargo\u2019s first government meeting, the city\u2019s mayor and aldermen appointed two fire wardens to patrol the city. Bucket brigades fought fires in those early years. A fire ordinance in 1877 set the stage for a volunteer fire department, the Pioneer Fire Company, led by a chief engineer and equipped with the city\u2019s first hook-and-ladder fire rig. But the company wasn\u2019t officially organized or chartered until 1880 when it became the Continental Hose Company Number One. Hose Company Number Two followed two years later. \nOn this date in 1883, the Yerxa Hose Company Number Three was established, named after Fargo Mayor Woodford Yerxa. Local businessmen comprised the company, which was called \u201cthe most dedicated and effective of Fargo\u2019s volunteer fire companies.\u201d \nVolunteer firefighters served Fargo until 1903 when the city opted for a paid, professional department. The first professional fire chief was appointed from Continental Hose Company Number One. By 1904, the department had 10 professionals who earned sixty dollars a month, on duty twenty-four seven, with on- and off-duty shifts to come in later years. The firefighters used horse-drawn rigs until 1919. \nBy 1904, the city no longer had volunteer firefighters, though many North Dakota towns still do, and sorely need more. \nDakota Datebook by Jack

The New York Times is the paper of record, but the Post is under the control of Kay Graham, whose father left the family publishing empire to her husband, who later died by suicide. That left Kay in charge, a lone woman among grey men in grey rooms in great, grey buildings. Kay is trying to fit in, trying to live up to the legacy of her father and her husband, whom everyone loved. The men surrounding her don\u2019t even pretend to have faith in her as a businesswoman, a publisher, or a leader. And Kay struggles, barely speaking\u2014if at all\u2014in meetings despite extensive preparation, and when she does talk, her voice wibbles and wafts like birdsong. Her hands tremble, she fidgets, she can\u2019t hold eye contact. She is a sparrow among carrion. \nBut Kay is SMART. She knows her sh*t even if life didn\u2019t prepare her to lead a publishing empire in her middle age. Kay has hired Ben Bradlee, a fiery and dogged newspaperman, serving as her editor in chief, meant to shake up the Post and turn it into more than just a little local paper. Their town is America\u2019s town, after all, shouldn\u2019t they have something to say to the country about that? And Ben Bradlee is determined to do just that, and Kay becomes his surprising ally when the leak of the Pentagon Papers\u2014thousands of pages detailing government malfeasance regarding the Vietnam War\u2014puts the Post in the position of standing up to the Nixon administration, and a president who is already black-balling them after unflattering (read: gossipy) coverage. \nWatching The Post, it\u2019s easy to understand why director Steven Spielberg rushed it into production after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election. Is it a little on the nose? Yes. Are there a couple scenes that were OBVIOUSLY inserted to meet the moment? Again, yes, and they\u2019re not hard to spot, either. In the hands of a lesser filmmaker, The Post would probably be untenably cheesy and melodramatic. But Steven Spielberg is NOT a lesser filmmaker, and he is especially good at calculating how to provoke reaction and inspire audiences, so in his hands, The Post is a cathartic experience, and a kind of wish fulfillment as we watch the fourth estate check the power of the president. \nWorking with regular collaborators Januz Kaminski (cinematography) and John Williams (score), Spielberg turns in a strong, if slightly under-developed effort. This group is incapable of making a bad movie, but The Post does feel a little undercooked, like it could have used more time firming up the script, particularly around Kay\u2019s character. Tom Hanks stars as Ben Bradlee, and Meryl Streep stars as Kay, and she is doing heavy lifting fleshing out a role not given as much depth as should be allowed. That\u2019s because The Post is torn between two things: one being a biopic of Kay Graham, a groundbreaking female boss, and the other a procedural about the breaking of the Pentagon Papers. \n(Given everyone involved, The Post is an instant Oscar favorite, and is sure to garner lots of nominations, including Best Picture. But it\u2019s not a perfect film, and in a year where early voting has been all over the place, right now the best bet for a sure thing is Meryl Streep for another Best Actress win. It\u2019s redundant to say \u201cMeryl Streep is good\u201d, but she is REALLY good, even by her own excellent standard.) \nScreenwriters Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, who produced Spotlight, get detailed about the process of journalism and how the staff at the Post worked tirelessly to report on the Pentagon Papers, and the first amendment legal battle that ensued, but they skim on character. The cast is loaded with tremendous talent, from Hanks and Streep to Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, Carrie Coon, Bradley Whitford, and Bruce Greenwood, and all of them are working at their top level for Spielberg. These are such excellent, seasoned actors, they know how to suggest more character than really exists, and really it\u2019s only the script\u2019s tendency to state the obvious that gives away the weak spots around the human beings in the story. If it just ran as a straight journalism procedural\u2014like Spotlight\u2014you\u2019d never notice the lack of characterization because it wouldn\u2019t matter, they\u2019re not the point. But The Post has a strain of an earlier version that was more specifically about Kay Graham that betrays it. \nHowever, thanks to Spielberg, Hanks, and Streep, The Post works anyway. It\u2019s enormously satisfying to see journalists declare that a president doesn\u2019t get to decide what the news is\u2014people burst into applause\u2014and it\u2019s a vicarious thrill to watch as the fallout begins spreading, and the gears start turning on the mechanisms that would end Nixon\u2019s toxic administration. It provides a ray of hope that, finding ourselves here once again, we can get through it this time, too. The Post is at once reassuring and warning, a reminder that we have survived democracy\u2019s test before, but also a prod to stay alert. Constant vigilance! \n\n(Lainey PS. One of my favourite books of all time is Kay Graham\u2019s Personal History. Sometimes I wonder if Show Your Work started the moment I finished reading it. If you haven\u2019t already, definitely consider it as a gift either for yourself or someone else this holiday season.) \n\nAttached - Meryl at the International Press Freedom Awards last month.

I'm Brilliant. I'm Beautiful.", "text": "           This past Sunday I was watching CBS Sunday Morning. A segment on Turkish baklava made me salivate (I'm determined to have some baklava if I go back to Istanbul). A story about a previously-unknown sailor (he saved 6 soldiers from the burning USS Arizona) inspired me. But it was a piece about a 2017 Sports Illustrated model (Ashley Graham) that made me think about what I do as a writer.\n\n           Let me give you the gist. Ashley Graham is successful model. She's a size 14. Some sadists call her \"plus size.\" Fashion people told her, \"You'll never be a model,\" \"You're too fat for the clothes,\" and \"You'll never be on a magazine cover.\"\n\n\n\n           They were wrong. They were so, so wrong.\n\n           Instead of listening to the denigrating remarks and sabotaging herself, Ashley either got naked or in her granny panties and her bra, looked in the mirror and told herself three things:\n\nYou're bold. You're brilliant. You're beautiful. \n\n          It made me think about the self-sabotage we do to ourselves as writers. What if we sent ourselves an affirming message every day? What if we silenced the negative comments we fill our own heads with? What if we stopped fixating on the criticism we get during feedback? \n          What if?  \n\n\n\n         Don't get me wrong. I love getting constructive feedback. Recently, I sent my NaNoWriMo from 2015 (a steaming turdpile) to a poet and blogging friend, Shay Simmons . She told me what every other writer friend had told me: One story line is interesting. The other one? Not so much... (which translates into \"You can smell this manuscript from a thousand miles away... and it ain't a good aroma, neither.\") \n         However, after I licked my wounds and ate lots of milk chocolate and mashed potatoes (not together, of course)  refocused, I set that project aside to gather dust forever: you're welcome, world  to perhaps someday reexamine it... and then I moved forward on a different WIP. \n         Not getting a response from the markets I usually submit to means bad news. Chicken Soup for the Soul and Sasee only respond when they're interested in publishing something, so when months have passed and I've gotten no email, I momentarily start the self-doubt train. Maybe I should stop submitting to them altogether? Why waste my time sending pieces to them? What was I even thinking, sending them a submission? After all, they don't like my stuff anymore. \n       What if I looked at myself in a mirror and told myself things that would help (not hinder) me? What if I filled my head with messages like: \nI am a talented writer. I am working on something that has loads of potential. I can and do craft clever phrases. I embrace revision and remember it is a process... Sometimes the product is a long time coming. I write on a regular basis. If I miss a day here or there, I refuse to beat myself up over it. I make readers laugh/cry/reflect. \n         What if you looked in the mirror and built yourself up through self-affirming messages... What would you say? \n         Sometimes-Self-Doubting minds want to know. \n\nSioux Roslawski is a self-doubter (sometimes) but a hopeful writer (most of the time). She teaches middle-schoolers full time and in her spare time dreams of someday having a book published.

Of course, in these days you cannot just go to any house that you like and knock their door asking if they are giving for rent or if they wish to sell their house.            Once you're done with selecting a few properties that suits your interest the most, contact their representatives or choose a property dealer. If you're still not able to find a property that meets your criteria, find a realtor. There are a few better properties which are available from the realtors only than those available on property ad sites in Virginia. \nThere are various tips for finding the  \nperfect Military Rental Homes in  \nVirginia : \n1. Define your Priorities:                 The moment you have an inkling of an upcoming move, you should start researching your proposed duty station. Talk to friends and search the Internet for information on desired areas to live surrounding the military installation. As we all know, it is dangerous to make any firm plans prior to having orders in hand, but the legwork can begin long before you have confirmation that you are moving. \n2. Start early and search often:           The early bird gets the worm, is particularly true when it comes to the rental market. Start searching for a rental home as soon as you are certain of your relocation, which again for military, is typically when you have orders in hand. Search sites such as Military Homes for rental properties near your next duty station. \n3. Utilize a Professional:               If you do not have the time or energy to devote to finding your next home in Virginia , then consider hiring a broker in the new area to assist you. This may involve fees, but in the end it could make the process easier and more enjoyable than trying to do it yourself. Another route is to contact a property manager near your new military base to assist you. \n4. Be Prepared to Submit an Application:               If you have found the perfect home inVirginia and have set up communication with the advertiser, then the next step will likely be to submit a rental application. Most rental applications will ask for information on your previous residence, addresses, dates of occupancy, rent, or own, names of landlords and employment information.   5 . Be Upfront and Honest:          If you are forthcoming with marks on your credit, bad references or experiences with previous landlords, or the fact that you breed pit bulls, you are establishing a relationship of trust with the landlord. Many of these factors can be overcome if you are willing to share and discuss As we know, military life is anything but stable. The three-year orders you received 6 months ago have suddenly been changed and you are on the move yet again. 6. Military Clause Option :          As we know, military life is anything but stable. The three-year orders you received 6 months ago have suddenly been changed and you are on the move yet again. This can send anyone into a state of panic, but particularly when you have a signed a lease agreement for an extended period.

Live webcams and surveillance applications are the key to monitoring the activity inside your house, your shop and virtually, anywhere you\u2019ve got a webcam. Streaming and recording the content that\u2019s being captured by such devices requires the assistance of software such as ContaCam. ContaCam makes an impression through the impressive set of webcam monitoring features, as well as through ease of use and accessibility. It comes wrapped inside a simple, yet convenient design that gathers all of the goodies inside a few menus, which are easy to explore and navigate. It connects itself to a host where you have the webcam up and running and captures the stream, displaying it accurately and in live mode. The actions you can perform on live webcam images are numerous, including the possibility to rotate, resize and flip them, as well as to adjust the brightness and the contrast or to apply various effects such as grayscale, negative, sharpen and soften to name just a few. You can also gather all the images inside a slideshow, or scan the graphics and convert them to TIFF or PDF, as well as attach them to an email. A special feature is the motion detection option that monitors a stream for changes inside the captured content and can take immediate action (FTP uploads, email notifications or running an external program) once a breach has been detected. In a nutshell, ContaCam makes the time you spend with it worthwhile, being ease to configure despite its complex purpose. It\u2019s a must for anyone who wants to keep tabs on a surveillance system.

Late on Tuesday evening, there was no indication that the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was hurrying to meet the Prime Minister.\nDavid Davis assured the DUP that Northern Ireland would not be \u201cleft behind\u201d in the single market and that \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d would apply across the UK post Brexit . This would also alleviate a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\nBut will it? What will be aligned? It does not automatically mean remaining in the single market and customs union, does it? And will the four freedoms apply?\nHow will those aspects outwith the regulatory alignment be dealt with at the border between the UK and the EU and across the Irish \u201cdivide\u201d? And if the regulatory alignment is minimal in extent and other trade deals outwith in the \u201cwider world\u201d come into being, there will surely be \u201chard\u201d border checks of some description. And where the UK \u201cdiverges\u201d from the EU, how is that to be regulated at the \u201cborders\u201d? Messy.\nRegulatory alignment does not encompass everything and the EU said no cherry picking is to be allowed especially for passporting financial services. Or was Mr Davis making it up as he was placating his MPs? So a degree of \u201chardness\u201d is inevitable. Labour and the Tories and the DUP are firm on leaving the single market and customs union.\nAlthough Labour is beginning to soften, yet nothing official or definitive has come from Jeremy Corbyn , who seems to have gone silent. That red line cannot be got round other than with full compliance in line with the Norwegian model. Regulatory alignment is a smokescreen. The devil is in the detail. One can see the EU walking away in frustration and leaving Westminster to World Trade Organisation mayhem.\nJohn Edgar,\n4 Merrygreen Place,\nStewarton.\nIT is time for those negotiating Brexit to sit down around the table and decide what requirements are essential for the UK in the post-Brexit world. If these conditions are acceptable to the EU then these prerequisites will determine what subsidiary conditions must apply.\nIt appears that the first requirement is that the UK should leave the EU (\u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d) while the second is that there should be no hard border in Ireland and that the same conditions should apply in Northern Ireland as in the rest of the UK.\nConsequently, we have no option but to agree that the UK should leave the EU and remain in the single market and customs union.\nAt present, we have only had a referendum which has determined that we leave the EU. If the consequences of the need to maintain an open Irish border are unacceptable then there has to be another referendum.\nSince Northern Ireland does not have a land border with the rest of the UK, the electorate in the province could, at the same time, be asked if they wish to remain within the single market and customs union if the rest of the UK decides not to do so.\nSandy Gemmill,\n40 Warriston Gardens,\nEdinburgh .\nIT is time to stop this Brexit shambles as Article 50 can still be revoked.\nAll it needs is a Labour leadership that has, instead, been whipping its MPs to support a hard Brexit, against a customs union and single market.\nUnlike Ruth Davidson , Nicola Sturgeon has been the only leader in the UK with a consistent and coherent Brexit plan as outlined in Scotland \u2019s Place in Europe, with minimal damage to the UK and Scottish economies along the lines of the Norway position.\nMs Davidson is putting DUP interests ahead of Scotland\u2019s vote to remain and specifically opposes a deal that protects Scotland\u2019s businesses and economy.\nOn Monday, all of the Scottish Tories voted in the House of Commons to allow Westminster\u2019s power-grab over 100 devolved policy.\nThese include powers over farming support, fisheries, fracking , genetically modified crops, railway franchising, cooperation between Scotland\u2019s justice system and EU counterparts and environmental regulations.\nNot one opposition amendment was accepted but it is not too late for the UK Government to make the necessary amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill to respect the devolution settlement.\nScotland\u2019s share of the UK\u2019s Brexit bill will remove \u00a34.25 billion from our budget over 10 years, which is much greater than the \u00a3600 million to \u00a31.5bn over a decade that the No campaign told us would be the \u201cunaffordable\u201d independence transition\ncosts.\nWith support for independence standing at 47 per cent, Theresa\\ May will want to avoid another Scottish referendum but she needs to come up with a bespoke customs union and single market deal for Scotland on similar lines to the one she has been striving to secure for Ireland.\nMary Thomas,\nWatson Crescent,\nEdinburgh.\nI BELIEVE that Ed Archer (Letters, December 4) is being extremely optimistic if he believes that useful reform of the EU could occur should the UK decided to ditch Brexit and work for change from within.\nMargaret Thatcher negotiated a rebate for the UK in the 1980s. Tony Blair sacrificed a significant proportion of this in anticipation of improvements in the Common Agricultural Policy. I think we\u2019re still waiting.\nIn the run up to the referendum campaign, then prime minister David Cameron and his government ministers made several trips to various European cities to meet European national political leaders and EU functionaries, all of whom, we were assured, shared that government\u2019s views of the need for structural and functional reform of the EU.\nOnly they didn\u2019t, and eventually all Mr Cameron had to show were a few trivial concessions that were related to peripheral issues.\nEven these were grudgingly offered and could be rescinded at the whim of the relevant EU governing bodies.\nThere are a number of Balkan nations in negotiations to join the EU in the not too distant future.\nThey will all be supplicants for cash, and I fear that our chances of seeking reform in the future will be even less than they are now.\nChristopher W Ide,\n25 Riverside Road,\nWaterfoot,\nEast Renfrewshire.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "davidson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john edgar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watson crescent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy gemmill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewarton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed archer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruth davidson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicola sturgeon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony blair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy corbyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret thatcher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher w ide", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "house of commons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic unionist party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east renfrewshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world trade organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merrygreen place", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dup", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brexit theresa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warriston gardens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waterfoot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riverside road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:46.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc6002b572f4a21efad1a1e17c46f28234be75fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QhcjOmepol_EreIBKUyACAZiRwKMGOSJ04MV7ndMSmN6Jv9KxMKUIzoz1bbYF9Zg8Gkz1EJp1k6SvPv.8C.zH.Rg5Qx8H3_pw-", "site_full": "allsoftmac.com", "site": "allsoftmac.com", "site_section": "http://allsoftmac.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Allsoftmac.com Free Download Rapidgator.net Nitroflare.com Uploaded.net Mediafire.com", "title": "Crash Pad 2017 DVDRip x264-PSYCHD", "title_full": "Crash Pad 2017 DVDRip x264-PSYCHD", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i102.fastpic.ru/big/2017/1207/89/4f4e7faef149b3f6d986eae73a6ad889.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bc6002b572f4a21efad1a1e17c46f28234be75fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QhcjOmepol_EreIBKUyACAZiRwKMGOSJ04MV7ndMSmN6Jv9KxMKUIzoz1bbYF9Zg8Gkz1EJp1k6SvPv.8C.zH.Rg5Qx8H3_pw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "thaijameupload", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Crash Pad 2017 DVDRip x264-PSYCHD", "text": "  Crash Pad 2017 DVDRip x264-PSYCHD Crash Pad 2017 DVDRip x264-PSYCHD   22:00 , Views: 0 Genre: Comedy IMDB Rating: 5.6/10 from 738 Users Directed by: Kevin Tent Starring: Nina Dobrev, Domhnall Gleeson, Christina Applegate Release Name: Crash.Pad.2017.DVDRip.x264-PSYCHD Links: iMDB Description: A hopeless romantic (Domhnall Gleeson) thinks he's found true love with an older woman (Christina Applegate), only to learn that she's married and their encounter was merely an instrument of revenge against her neglectful husband (Thomas Haden Church).

He was a member of the Italian progressive pioneering band Aktuala in the early 70\u2019s whose eponymous debut album (1973) featured a multitude of instruments offering a groundbreaking fusion of different styles including free improvisation.\nWhile his first solo work was released in 1978 (Antico Adagio) his discography is far from lengthy. His follow-up to his debut, L\u2019Attesa, wouldn\u2019t surface until 1992. The slim number of releases that have surfaced to date means that news of a new album is always well-received. This absence of prolific output lends these releases the weight of musical statements and his latest offering, Metafisiche del suono , has been described as a masterpiece.\nThe album is to be released on Italian label Dark Companion , a label which prides itself on high-end audiophile quality recordings.\nThe label feature a number focused outputs including one called Ephemerals which offers \u201c peculiar and magical albums, recorded live or in a recording studio, in handcrafted and numbered editions.\u201d Their first Ephemeral release (DCE001) featured English rural dark folk collaboration between Michael Tanner ( Plinth , The Cloisters , United Bible Studies ) and Alison Cotton ( The Left Outsides , Trimdon Grange Explosion , The Eighteenth Day of May ). For this new release, Vaccina who performs on Vibraphone, Grand Piano, Gong, Metallophone, Percussion, Tabla, Wind Chimes, Bells, Cymbal, Strings and Timpani called upon Tanner and Cotton for contributions. Tanner plays Autoharp, Psaltery, Dulcimer, E-bowed Electric Guitar and Cotton plays viola. Listen to Policromie Sospese below on which they both contribute. The album also features Camillo Mozzoni on Oboe, Oboe d\u2019Amore, English Horn. \nMetafisiche del suono by Dark Companion Records The album was produced by Massimo Marchini who is quoted as saying \u201cMany asked how he could go further.

After all, there is no God but God, and no earthly things - whether people, statues, or cathedrals - can substitute for the Eternal and Infinite nature of a God that always eludes the conscious understanding of our finite minds. Everything in this world remains imperfect, and it's good to be reminded of that. Likewise, the same applies to spiritual experiences and the mysticism that I often discuss in this blog. Whether being filled with the Holy Spirit in ecstatic reverie or resting in the Presence of God during centering prayer, one's experience of the divine is never completely pure. The Spirit enters through the tainted vessel of our humanity, and if one takes original sin seriously, then it obviously follows that our own understanding of God will be distorted by our own mortal imperfections. Humility. Rarely, though, do we hear this mentality applied to doctrine or to the Bible itself. The fact that orthodox theology and holy scripture entered existence through groups of imperfect humans is not something we want to emphasize. The fear is that doing so will undercut the power of the Bible and doctrine: first, we admit it's not perfect, and gradually, it's reduced to mere literature and philosophy. However, I think there is a middle ground between treating the Bible as if it is God (which many churches can do) and reducing it to mere \"wisdom literature\"( which some churches also do). Humility is this middle ground. Taking original sin seriously means that we cannot make our own perspectives too important, whether in understanding scripture or in determining our own value systems. We must remember that our own vehicle, \"us,\" is broken. How can an imperfect human understand a Perfect God? Seeing the ludicrous nature of this proposition is the beginning of humility. St. Thomas Aquinas , upon finishing his Summa Theologica , supposedly had a mystical experience where he glimpsed the Vast Infinity of God. After the experience, he claimed that everything he had just written (which came to be regarded as the pillar of Orthodox Catholic Theology) was \"mere straw compared to what I've seen.\" The Doctor of the church knew better than to place theological doctrine over an Infinite God. Theological doctrine and biblical studies can help us grow and understand God better, but we must remember that our own understandings, however devout and well-studied, will always be scratching the surface at best. As Jesus reminds us in John, \u201cI have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now\u201d (Jn. 16:12). Clint Sabom is an award-winning writer and former aspirant monk.

But it has actually been simmering for years, decades, centuries. \n\u201cThese silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced. In some cases, criminal charges have been brought.\u201d \nThe Person of the Year announcement came as The New York Times published a report detailing a widespread \u201ccomplicity machine\u201d of powerful relationships that enabled Weinstein to silence or intimidate his accusers for years. \nWeinstein has denied via his lawyers and spokespeople that he engaged in any non-consensual behavior. He has not been charged with any crimes, though investigations have been launched in London, Los Angeles and New York. \n\u2013\u2018Open secrets\u2019\u2013 \nA number of men also have revealed they were victims of sexual abuse, including Anthony Rapp, who accused Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey of making sexual advances on him when he was a teenager. \nMore than a dozen men have since come forward with similar accusations against Spacey, some of whom were teens at the time of the alleged abuse. \nThe wave of allegations has also hit the US Congress, where the longest serving member of the House, Democrat John Conyers, announced his retirement Tuesday and pressure is mounting on Democratic Senator Al Franken to resign. Both men have been accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct. \nThe scope of the problem nationwide is reflected in a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday: it said 47 percent of American women say they have been sexually assaulted. \nOn Time\u2019s cover is a composite group photograph featuring Judd, along with singer Taylor Swift and ex-Uber engineer Susan Fowler. \n\u201cThe galvanizing actions of the women on our cover\u2026 along with those of hundreds of others, and of many men as well, have unleashed one of the highest-velocity shifts in our culture since the 1960s,\u201d Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal said in a statement. \nCalling #MeToo a \u201cpowerful accelerant,\u201d Felsenthal noted that the hashtag has been used millions of times in at least 85 countries. \n\u201cThe idea that influential, inspirational individuals shape the world could not be more apt this year,\u201d Felsenthal said. \n\u201cFor giving voice to open secrets, for moving whisper networks onto social networks, for pushing us all to stop accepting the unacceptable, The Silence Breakers are the 2017 Person of the Year.\u201d \nTime has designated an individual or group who has most influenced the year\u2019s news and events as Person of the Year since 1927. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, who won the Time honor in 2015 at the height of the refugee influx into her country, paid tribute to the \u201cSilence Breakers.\u201d \n\u201cWe must thank them for their courage in breaking the silence about sexual assault and for the global discussion they sparked,\u201d she said, according to her spokesman Steffen Seibert on Twitter.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

Both books follow Malayan leftists back in the 1950s and 60s and in modern times. And both deal more with personal relationships than political events. State of Emergency centers around one family and some ancillary characters, whereas Unrest follows four teenaged activists in the 1950s and 60 and their encounters with one another 30 years later. \nUnrest is only 220 pages, so a quick read, but it\u2019s also dense and the structure is complicated and told in alternating points of view, sometimes with the author interjecting. It\u2019s the kind of book one needs to read again for everything to sink in and because it\u2019s that powerful. \nBack in 1950s Malaya, Daming, Guoliang, and Weikang were male student activists involved in the leftist movement. Ziqin is the main female protagonist and also a student activist back in the day. She was admired by quite a few of the male activists, including Guoliang and Daming. While they were still in their teens, Daming won over Ziqin and the two moved to Hong Kong when they told everyone they were heading to China to be one with Mao. \nWeikang was the only one of the four to move to China back in the early 1960s, just after the Great Leap Forward (in which 45 million people starved from a man-made famine). Weikang saw Hong Kong when his boat docked there to let off some passengers, and he thought Swatow in China couldn\u2019t be much worse than what he saw in 1961 Hong Kong. He soon realized his mistake. \nBack during their student days, Weikang and Guoliang had a romantic tryst, about which the two never spoke again. They meet again in Guangzhou 30 years later, when Guoliang visits from Singapore for business. (Guoliang is the only one of the four who stays in Singapore in early 60s.) But the two never talk about what happened that night many years ago. \nFrom Guoliang\u2019s trip to Guangzhou, he learns that Ziqin is in Hong Kong and gets her number from Weikang, who had it because he had some business dealings with Daming, Ziqin\u2019s husband. As the years passed, Daming and Ziqin\u2019s marriage unraveled after he started sleeping with countless women, sometimes not returning home at night. \nFor years Guoliang wondered what could have happened had he and Ziqin ended up together. Guoliang married another woman in Singapore, yet still thinks about Ziqin. When Ziqin and Guoliang are reunited in Hong Kong in 1987, they end up going back to her place (Daming is in Vancouver, where he plans move with his family; the couple has a son) and sleep together. And it\u2019s this affair around which the novel centers. \nThe story bounces back in time and point of view, sometimes naming the characters and sometimes not. I like the structure and it keeps me thinking about the characters and the sub-stories. What stands out the most and\u2013what\u2019s very timely\u2013is Yeng Pway Ngon\u2019s attack on the patriarchy. Men like Daming are seen as manipulative predators, not just when he cheats on Ziqin, but also in his relationship with her, even from the beginning. \nUnrest certainly deserves a second and probably third read. It\u2019s a rich and complex story and one that is timely with the #MeToo movement and the changing climate in the US.
