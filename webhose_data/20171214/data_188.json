Well done :) You can only do so much before it catches up with you. When you opt out doing something, think that you are doing the best you can right now and it's okay to say no. I wonder if you can work on getting a regular bedtime and get up time sorted. This routine means you will get enough good quality sleep and you might feel a little better.

(Photo by Jason Miller/Getty Images) \nAfter starting the year 5-7, the Cleveland Cavaliers have rattled off a 12-game winning streak, one away from a franchise record. \nAnd the Cavs have executed that turnaround without guard Isaiah Thomas, who was acquired from the Boston Celtics in the Kyrie Irving trade. Thomas averaged 28.9 points per game in Boston last year, but is still on the mend from May\u2019s season-ending hip injury. \nThomas is inching his way back to action, and was reportedly able to participate in scrimmages this week. LeBron James is anxious to play with his fellow All-Star and is combating those feelings the same way any fan would. \nBy playing \u201cNBA 2K18,\u201d of course. \nESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin reported Wednesday that James is using the video game to \u201cvisualize\u201d how Thomas will fit in with the Cavs. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the most realistic basketball game you could ever play,\u201d James said. \u201cI mix and match a lot of lineup changes to see how we can be really good. I\u2019ve done that.\u201d \nLeBron is just like you and me! \nThe addition of Thomas could provide quite a spark to an already-thriving Cavs team while taking some of the scoring weight off James\u2019 shoulders. James is averaging 28 points, 8.5 assists and 7.9 rebounds per game while shooting a career-high 41.6 percent from long distance. \nThere will undoubtedly be some growing pains whenever Thomas does finally does make his Cleveland debut. But once those kinks are worked out, the Cavs are going to be even more fun to watch. \n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \nSam Cooper is a writer for the Yahoo Sports blogs.

A new set of Ionising Radiation Regulations come into force on 1 January and if you work with ionising radiation one of the biggest changes is the way you submit information to HSE. Work with ionising radiation is carried out across a broad range of industries and includes: the use of X-ray devices, radioactive substances and devices containing radioactive substances ; working in atmospheres containing radon gas The Ionising Radiations Regulations (IRR) are being revised, and a new set of Regulations (IRR17) will come into force on 1 January 2018. One of the changes introduced by these revised Regulations is the introduction of a risk-based approach to telling HSE of your work with ionising radiation. Rather than just notifications, there will be three distinct tiers: Notification Registration Consent If you are already working with ionising radiation, you will need to submit this information to HSE between 1 January 2018 and 5 February 2018, even if you have previously provided information There may be a fee associated with re-submitting this information to HSE. For more information on the new risk-based tiers, and the associated fees involved, please visit the HSE webpage on the new changes . Further, more detailed, guidance is being developed and will be shared via our webpages when the new Regulations come into force.

With so much soul-searching about how classical music can reach a new young audience it is worth remembering that David Munrow's BBC Radio 3 Pied Piper programme was broadcast four times a week for five years and introduced a huge audience to the riches of early music. He also presented the TV series Ancestral Voices, a title described as sounding like the greatest Led Zeppelin album never recorded; which may help explain why Munrow's popularity peaked in the early 1970s, when the young and alternative dominated the zeitgeist . \n\nDavid Munrow was truly multi-talented , and much of his appeal came from his advocacy of composers such as Guillaume de Machaut, Gilles Binchois and Guillaume Dufay, who were totally unknown and alien in style to the wider public in the 1970s. Today Simon Rattle, Mirga Gra\u017einyt\u0117-Tyla and Gustavo Dudamel are undoubtedly immensely talented conductors, but they are also essentially single-dimensional musicians whose reputations rest on superior interpretations of familiar mainstream repertoire. David Munrow scorned building better mousetraps from familiar repertoire, instead he reached a huge new audience by literally playing the role of music maverick. There is more on mavericks, technologists and other agents of change in my interview with David Munrow's mentor and recording producer Christopher Bishop, which can be read via this link or heard on SoundCloud . \n\nAlso on Facebook and Twitter .

I'm looking for a woman to spend time with, both in public and private. I'm in an open relationship, but I'm not looking for a threesome or anything like that. I want to find a woman I can be best friends with, hang out and do fun things together! But also be intimate with, emotionally and physically. I love the feel of girls and I miss being with them! I believe in honesty and communication. My partner knows about this. I'm pretty laid back! I like to go out and I like to stay in. I tend to be submissive and have a pretty loud inner child. I do have a thing for older women but that's not super important.

Picture taken December 6, 2017. REUTERS/Ciro De Luca \nDecember 7, 2017 \nJEJU, South Korea (Reuters) \u2013 The art of Neapolitan pizza making won world heritage status on Thursday, joining a horse-riding game from Iran and Dutch wind mills on UNESCO\u2019s culture list. \nUNESCO accepted the art of Neapolitan \u201cpizzaiuolo\u201d on the world body\u2019s list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. \n\u201cCongratulations #Italy!\u201d it said in a tweet after a meeting in Jeju, South Korea where the decision was made. \nItaly had argued the practice of pizzaiuolo \u2013 from preparing and flipping the pizza dough to baking it in a wood-fired oven \u2013 was part of the country\u2019s cultural and gastronomic tradition. \nTraditional Neapolitan pizza has a relatively thin crust with the exception of the rim, which, when baked, bloats like a tiny bicycle tyre. \nIt is rigorously made in a wood-burning brick oven and has two classic versions: Marinara (tomato, garlic, oregano and oil) and, the most famous, Margherita (tomato, mozzarella, oil and basil). \nTradition holds the Margherita pizza was created in 1889 by a local chef in honor of Queen Margherita, who was visiting the city. It has the red, white and green colors of the Italian flag. \nUNESCO also accepted Chogan, an Iranian horse-riding game accompanied by music and storytelling, and the craft of millers operating windmills and watermills in the Netherlands. \nTraditional boat making on the Indonesian island of South Sulawesi, and Nsima, a maize-based culinary tradition from the African country of Malawi, also joined the list. \nFood culture already on the UNESCO list includes Turkish coffee culture and tradition, the gingerbread craft of northern Croatia and the traditional ancient Georgian method of Qvevri wine-making. \n(Reporting by Reuters Television;

When I last did this activity, I cut out some gingerbread-man shapes out of paper, but you don\u2019t need to do that as any piece of paper will do! Alternately, any Christmas shape will do!   \nTo create your \u2018paints\u2019 just mix whatever spice you fancy, with some slightly watered down PVA glue. My spice suggestions include: ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, and cinnamon, but you can use whatever you like (or whatever you have in your cupboards!) \n\n\nI also usually allow my children to sniff the spice jar, so that they can tell me if they like it or not. It\u2019s also a great opportunity for some lovely language. \nMix a good helping of the spice into the glue mixture, and start painting!

A wide top opening allows easy access for your cat, and the space inside is large enough for her to turn around. No matter how much she digs or paws through the litter, the high walls will keep it from spilling over the edge and onto the floor. And in multi-pet households, they'll keep out curious doggy noses. When kitty jumps out, the litter is trapped by the non-slip, textured lid and then falls back into the pan through grates that are large enough for most litter types. The rounded edges and molded bottom handle help you lift the box easily, even when it's full of litter. Plus, there's a built-in hook for hanging a litter scoop. The Petmate Top Entry Litter Pan is made in the USA from 95% pre-consumer recyclable materials, making it an eco-friendly litter box option.

The Key of Solomon is considered as the most enduring, influential, and notorious Solomonic book ever found. \nThese two ancient compilations of magic and incantations are said to have been written by the biblical King Solomon. \nKing Solomon possessed a knowledge inspired by the teachings of an angel, who appeared to him very submissive and obedient offering wisdom and many other gifts. \nThe Magical Treatise of Solomon is commonly known as the Little Key of the Whole Art of Hygromancy Found by Several Craftsmen and by the Holy Prophet Solomon , or simply as the Hygromanteia . \nThese Byzantine-era magic spells allegedly were instructions written by Solomon to his son Rehoboam , offering knowledge on divination, the uses of plants and herbs, and astrology, as well as principles of magic. \nThe English version of the Magical Treatise of Solomon was made available for the first time in 2011 when it was edited by Ioannis Marathakis.

Furthermore, it offers detailed instructions on how to forge a magic sword, vessels for divination and conjuration, a series of vax figures, scrolls written in the blood of a bat, a magical ring, magic clothing, a garland, and how to control summoned spirits. \nFurthermore, The Magical Treatise also offers details on how to perform Angelic conjurations, general prayers to God, and prayers to control planetary influences. \nAmong other things, this ancient collection of spells details a number of astrological belies, and explains the relationship that exists among different planets and specific plants. \nThe ancient texts names different angels and demons over different planets, days and hours, and what functions they perform. \nThere are three main editions: The Magical Treatise of Solomon, or Hygromanteia ; Trans. & Ed.

REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne \nDecember 7, 2017 \nDUBLIN (Reuters) \u2013 Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar\u2019s Fine Gael party surged into an 11-point lead in a poll on Thursday, gaining credit for the government\u2019s Brexit negotiating stance and indicating its recent near-collapse had not hurt his popularity. \nVaradkar has played a key role in negotiations over Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union this week, insisting that a tentative deal struck on the Irish border on Monday must be fulfilled if talks are to move onto the next phase, as London wants. \nThat was in sharp contrast to a week earlier when his deputy prime minister had to resign to avert a government collapse and election before Christmas, an episode that members of Fine Gael feared would damage both the party and its leader. \nYet support for Fine Gael rose by five points to 36 percent in the Irish Times/MRBI poll, while fellow centre-right rival Fianna Fail has fallen four points to 25 percent since October. The left-wing Sinn Fein party was unchanged on 19 percent. \nThe most recent survey taken by another polling company, conducted during the government crisis, showed that the two main parties were almost neck and neck. The number of undecided voters was far higher in the MRBI sample. \nSatisfaction with the government also rose by five points to 41 percent in Thursday\u2019s poll, the highest level achieved by any government in almost a decade. \n\u201cToday\u2019s poll proves that timing is everything,\u201d said MRBI director Aisling Corcoran. \n\u201cInterviewing took place on Monday and Tuesday against the backdrop of Brexit negotiations and the government has been credited with approaching the negotiations with clarity and determination.\u201d \n(Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Angus MacSwan)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leo varad", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leo varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aisling corcoran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angus macswan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "padraic halpin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "government buildings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish times/mrbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sinn fein", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brexit row ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:47.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "182a392a07c8c16367e7c2a4d5f91850d32ba930", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdvhed5Dkyl2mJ3SI2LWzd4vlo3SxXYEui3WW2mO8TeJqKWe9zszPM77XXDNn2X9UkrZkCiWEZEhgafJ5TsaAQ42NtFedDfLoA-", "site_full": "collegegamesonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://collegegamesonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "College Games Online", "title": "Google Alert - college", "title_full": "Google Alert - college", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "182a392a07c8c16367e7c2a4d5f91850d32ba930", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdvhed5Dkyl2mJ3SI2LWzd4vlo3SxXYEui3WW2mO8TeJqKWe9zszPM77XXDNn2X9UkrZkCiWEZEhgafJ5TsaAQ42NtFedDfLoA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whaidegind (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - college", "text": "college As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS 4 shot in Uptown near Wilson CTA station, Truman College Chicago Tribune 4 shot in Uptown near Wilson CTA station, Truman College .

CST December 06, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nNeighbors of a man who regularly operates heavy machinery and dumps soil and scrap on his residential property say they have been forced to flee Jefferson Parish because Code Enforcement officials can\u2019t stop him. \nThe parish has opened 20 Code Enforcement cases against Thomas Centanni since 2005, all citing him for keeping scrap and heavy industrial equipment, such as back hoes, stump grinders, bobcats, boats and junk vehicles, in the yard and the broken-down shed behind his home in Metairie. \nCentanni and his wife Tracey own a lot in Kenner where they also keep piles of debris and heavy equipment. But that is a commercial property near the airport, not the neighborhood of modest ranch houses off West Metairie Road where surveillance videos have captured Centanni and various workers using the noisy machinery day and night. \nIt\u2019s unclear why Centanni keeps doing such industrial work at his residential property. He told WWL-TV he is disabled, doesn\u2019t have a job and \u201cnever owned a business.\u201d \nNext-door neighbor Woodrow Mulkey said he filed only two code enforcement complaints against Centanni over the last seven years, but claims he has, along with his live-in girlfriend, felt \u201cterrorized\u201d and \u201charassed\u201d by Centanni in a series of incidents this year. \nThe neighbor who owns the house on the other side of Centanni, Donna Nevels, reports similar problems dating back decades, saying she was forced to move to Slidell in 2000 because Centanni was using heavy equipment in the wee hours of the morning and parish officials could not get him to stop. \n\u201cThis was a nice little neighborhood until he came\u201d in the late 1990s, Nevels said. \u201cThe parish has to do something to make him not do it in the middle of the neighborhood.\u201d \n\u201cI have been stressed by this neighbor for years,\u201d Mulkey said. \u201cHe tries to intimidate. But it\u2019s not the fear of my neighbor that\u2019s the last straw that makes me want to leave; that makes me have to sell my family home. It\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid, because of everything I\u2019ve seen, of Jefferson Parish.\u201d \nMulkey\u2019s observations about the parish\u2019s Code Enforcement Office started in earnest back in July 2010, when Centanni had unknown men staying in his backyard shed. \n\u201cThere was a hearse in my front yard. And they were moving a dead body from my neighbor\u2019s yard through my yard because they couldn\u2019t get through my neighbor\u2019s yard,\u201d Mulkey said. \u201cI said, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 And they told me it was a guy named Bill, and he\u2019d been back in that shed, for a while, in the summertime. It wasn\u2019t pretty.\u201d \nMulkey said Centanni had knocked down the fence between their two lots, but that didn\u2019t cause Mulkey to file any formal complaints. The dead body was the last straw, though. That was the first time Mulkey reported Centanni to Jefferson Parish Code Enforcement. \n\u201cMy neighbor found out that I reported him, through Jefferson Parish,\u201d Mulkey said. \u201cAnd I wound up with several citations on my door.\u201d Mulkey disputes some of the findings against him, but he admitted having a contractor do some repairs after Hurricane Katrina without the proper permits. That work included porch steps without the required handrails. He fixed that and a few other issues, including the grade of his backyard. \nWhile looking at his own backyard with a code inspector in 2010, Mulkey asked if the parish would ever do anything about the scrap and equipment in Centanni\u2019s backyard. Mulkey secretly recorded the inspector, who can be heard saying, \u201cBefore you open a can of worms, this is leaning to the back, you know that, don't you? \u2026 I want this to stop, I really do. This is as much a pain in the ass for me as it is for you and for him.\u201d \nFor the next several years, Mulkey said he gave up and tried to ignore Centanni\u2019s activities, even when his house shook from pile-driving or a car being dropped in a heap. \nThat all changed when Mulkey\u2019s girlfriend, Pam McLellan, moved in last year. By the spring of 2017, McLellan said she couldn\u2019t ignore what was happening next door. Fed up by the noise, she took photographs of the equipment and junk in Centanni\u2019s yard in April, and sent them to the Jefferson Parish Attorney\u2019s Office. \nSurveillance video from the outside of Mulkey\u2019s house also captured the action. One video shows a bucket truck working in Centanni\u2019s yard at about 2:00 a.m. on May 14. \nThe nighttime work only intensified two weeks later during the Memorial Day weekend. \n\u201cWe never slept a wink for three days,\u201d McLellan said. \nThings were looking up when McLellan received a certified letter from the parish about her complaint. But she said she was crestfallen when she opened it; it was a summons marked as \u201cJefferson Parish v. Thomas Centanni, Tracey Centanni and Pam McLellan\u201d\u2013 naming McLellan as a defendant, rather than keeping her as the anonymous complainant. \nCode Enforcement and the Parish Attorney\u2019s Office blamed each other for what they later acknowledged was a mistake, and McLellan\u2019s name was removed from the case records. But at that point, Centanni knew McLellan\u2019s name. \n\u201cFour days from court, I was fixing breakfast, washing dishes and I look out and he\u2019s pressure washing. \u2026 And then, all of a sudden, he begins to write my name,\u201d McLellan recalled. \nPolice reports include photographs of Centanni apparently using a pressure washer to spell out P-A-M next to a crude drawing of a woman\u2019s face on the fence. \nPhotographs and surveillance video also show a mannequin of the Grim Reaper positioned by the face as if it were grabbing it. At another point in a surveillance video, Centanni stands in front of the image of the face and thrusts his hips toward it several times. \nThose incidents were cited in court records as a judge issued a temporary restraining order forbidding Centanni from interacting with McLellan. \nIn response to the Code Enforcement complaint against Centanni, the Bureau of Administrative Adjudication ordered Centanni to remove all the heavy equipment from his property. \nBut surveillance video taken from Mulkey\u2019s property appears to show Centanni and others moving some of the equipment into his shed before a parish contractor came and cleared the lot on July 14. The parish attorney says the contractor cleared Centanni\u2019s lot for free because its contract provides \u201cno charge\u201d for clearing debris from residential lots, even repeat offenders. \nIn October, the parish sued Thomas and Tracey Centanni for the third time since 2013 for failing to comply with the Bureau of Administrative Adjudication\u2019s orders to clean the property and stop using heavy equipment. Follow-up inspections in August and October found the Centannis were still in violation, according to 1st Parish Court records. \n\u201cAnd so, he knows he has free rein and he\u2019s actually stepped it up a notch, with the sanding and the priming and the painting that\u2019s now affecting our health, and our well-being,\u201d McLellan said. \nWWL-TV tried to interview Centanni outside his home. His wife told him not to talk. Thomas Centanni approached the reporter anyway to comment. \n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you this, though, they\u2019re both going to go to jail for this crap,\u201d Centanni said, apparently referring to Mulkey and McLellan. Tracey Centanni shooed him away again by yelling, \u201cTommy, no comment!\u201d \nMulkey and McLellan said after they complained several times at public council meetings, they began having trouble dealing with Jefferson Parish officials. The couple used their cell phones to record employees at the parish Environmental Office calling security to remove them from the building, even though Mulkey and McLellan contend they were sitting quietly waiting to see someone about dust and dirt Centanni was blowing onto their property. \nCode inspectors posted a notice on Mulkey\u2019s door in August for \u201cexcessive light or glare\u201d from the flood lights pointing toward Centanni\u2019s property. On another day, two inspectors showed up asking to enter Mulkey\u2019s house to check if he was doing work inside. Mulkey recorded the encounter, denied he was doing any work and refused to let the inspectors in. \nMulkey\u2019s use of his cellphone video camera and surveillance system has proven useful in gathering evidence against Centanni, but it\u2019s also rubbed parish officials the wrong way. In October, Mulkey went out on the street to record a parish official in front of Nevels\u2019 house, theorizing he was somehow helping Centanni. \nThe code enforcement officer, Edgar Lane, told Mulkey to stop videoing him and filed a criminal complaint against Mulkey. In the police report, Lane alleged Mulkey approached him, \u201crefused to back away and kept advancing toward him in an aggressive manner.\u201d Lane also alleged Mulkey blocked his truck from leaving, forcing the parish employee to back up to get away. \nBut surveillance and cellphone videos provided by Mulkey appear to show Mulkey never got close to Lane while videoing him from his own property and the street and didn\u2019t block his truck, but rather stood aside and recorded the truck as it drove away without stopping. \nMulkey was charged with a misdemeanor count of interference with a code enforcement officer and has a January court date. \nMcLellan says Jefferson Parish President Mike Yenni met with her and Mulkey personally and told the code enforcement director, Amy Vallot, to address the problem. But Yenni said Vallot can only do so much under the law. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve had many conversations about it,\u201d Yenni said. \u201cAgain, my code director, Amy Vallot \u2026 is doing everything she can in the confines of the law.\u201d \nAsked about Mulkey\u2019s claims that the code inspectors are now targeting him, Yenni said: \u201cNo retribution whatsoever.

This condition is known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in medical terms. In such cases, the prostate gland of the male reproductive organ begins to multiple, which causes swelling and discomfort in urination. Normally, the benign prostatic hyperplasia causes due to aging but in several cases it can be caused by any hormonal abnormalities in the testicles of the patients. \nCommon symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia are incomplete bladder emptying, weak urinary stream, painful urination, incontinence and pus in the urine. Mostly 90% of men in their eighties have benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is advisable to consult doctors if any of the above symptoms appears. With proper medical history and precise physical examination, most the cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia can be diagnosed.  The size and shape of the enlarged prostate can be estimated through rectal examination. \n\n\nAlpha-1-blockers are usually prescribed as an effective treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in India . In addition to this, sometimes doctors recommend dutasteride and finasteride for hormonal reduction purposes that could provide effective relieve from benign prostatic hyperplasia. In cases of kidney failure, bladder stones or inability to empty the bladder, the best Urologist for Laser Prostate Surgery in India recommends prostate surgical procedures. \nKidney stones or failure can trigger the prostate surgery effectively. Different types of kidney stones that can cause the failure of kidney functioning are Calcium stones, Struvite stones, Uric acid stones, and Cystine stones. One of the main causes of kidney stones is the lack of water in the body of the patients. It is advisable to drink at least two to three liters of water daily. Renal tubular acidosis and hyperparathyroidism can also cause small to medium size kidney stone in the body. \nSome of the common symptoms of kidney stones are blood in urine , severe pain at the sides, burning sensation during urination, and vomiting & nausea. Doctors often conduct a physical examination to identify severe pain on the side of the stomach. Once the pain is confirmed, doctors may recommend CT or Ultrasound tests. CT scan or ultrasound can be used to confirm kidney stones with its precise size and shapes. \n\n\nUnder the supervision of qualified or experienced Kidney Stone Specialist Doctor in Delhi, the kidney stones of different shapes and sizes can be successfully operated. \nIf the sizes of the kidney stones are very small, it cannot be operated. In such cases, the doctors recommend drinking lots of water and regular checkups. If pain increases, the kidney stone specialists recommend one strong pain killer to mask the pain, as the kidney stones are too small to be operated and can be removed out of the systems through natural urination process.  \n\nSource: http://www.urocareindia.com/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:49.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a07c11d4d9f7f36747963fdfb2cb38cf7aa3ae57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_._SXB97_kw98NA0Hu.A.VCEPPHxOdp1Jo15oHWadWfln_O5b7DG.DEvb0wzo63P78EKLSgco62ciiOBFyQ5lTAUexaGOQqZmxK_ZWdHy1X3q94MJN.ZKb0yzYS938I8hBNlavu42KMxNG3eQcNTwe", "site_full": "www.theboltonnews.co.uk", "site": "theboltonnews.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/farnworth/rss/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Bolton News | Farnworth", "title": "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs pantomime premieres next week", "title_full": "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs pantomime premieres next week", "published": "2017-12-07T08:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/resources/images/7151234/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 65585, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a07c11d4d9f7f36747963fdfb2cb38cf7aa3ae57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_._SXB97_kw98NA0Hu.A.VCEPPHxOdp1Jo15oHWadWfln_O5b7DG.DEvb0wzo63P78EKLSgco62ciiOBFyQ5lTAUexaGOQqZmxK_ZWdHy1X3q94MJN.ZKb0yzYS938I8hBNlavu42KMxNG3eQcNTwe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T08:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs pantomime premieres next week", "text": "Business Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs comes to Farnworth with a song and dance by Stagedoor Theatre Productions 1 comment \nHEIGH ho i's off to work Bolton's pantomime players' go with a song and dance. \nTalented youngsters and adults are bringing to life the traditional tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. \nStagedoor Theatre Productions has penned the family pantomime which will feature a cast of actors, singers and dancers. \nHoping to bring some menacing flair to the Farnworth stage when the show premieres on Tuesday is Teresa Anderton. \nTeresa is juggling the role of story's villain, the Wicked Queen, while choreographing some big numbers. \nShe said: \"It's a traditional family panto with lots of laughs, special effects and a fabulous cast. \n\"We are aiming it at audiences from age three to 100 \u2013 there is something for everybody! \n\"There's a man playing the mirror, which is done in a way which will a surprise for everyone, a classic pantomime ghost and 35 dancers aged five to 18. \n\"We have two sets of children playing the dwarfs and we have recorded the lines with older actors because they are wearing masks.

(aren\u2019t I good to you!?) Both are ideas for a bit of role-play fun this December.

Why not let your children help with making and wrapping some \u2018gifts\u2019? This kid of play is great for fine-motor, co-ordination, and concentration skills, not to mention of course, wonderful imaginative play! \nItems you can add: Old gift tags, ribbons, bows\u2026 Sticky tape Scissors (safety scissors will work!) Cardboard boxes (or anything the children can wrap and unwrap) Tools (pretend OR real \u2013 depending on the age and stage of your children and how brave you are) Pieces of wood Junk modelling items \nDon\u2019t forget to make the whole area really Christmassy with plenty of tinsel! I\u2019m sure your children will help you to decorate. You could even add those wonderful paper chains that you made on December 1st!   Turn your role play area or writing table into a Christmas Post-Office!   \nThis is a time of year where we write and send lots of letters and cards! That means it\u2019s a great opportunity to allow your children to practice their writing and mark making skills. \nDon\u2019t forget to make your own little post box! All you need is a large box painted red and decorated however you like. Add a slot for posting and voila! Added bonus if you make a door for taking the letters out again \u2013 I always forget!

I used group policy to map drives on the clients which pointed to the namespace. Earlier this week DFS crapped out on me and no one could access their mapped drives via the namespace (for reasons I still don't understand), so I decided to get rid of it and point my clients directly to the share. That worked fine and everyone was able to access their files. I deleted the DFS replication configuration as well as the namespace in DFS. I then updated group policy to map drives by the UNC share name instead of the namespace.\nHowever every day since I get a few people who's drives have somehow been mapped back to the namespace, which cannot be accessed (because I deleted it). It's a different group of people each day. I have double checked group policy (see attached picture) and there is nothing in the policy that is configured to use the namespace for mapped drives. All RSOP testing indicates the proper policies are being processed by the users, with the correct mappings. There are only two mapped drives that point to a Windows server (F and G) and they both use the UNC path directly back to the server. The Q and Y drives never have a problem pointing to the local NAS.
