It is the first time that Lego has succeeded in a copyright competition case in China, where copies of its colourful bricks and figures have been a recurrent problem as it seeks to gain share in the $31 billion toys and games market. Earlier this year, the Beijing Higher Court passed a ruling that recognised the Lego logo and name in Chinese as 'well-known' trademarks in China, putting the toymaker in a better position to act against infringement of its trademarks. The China Shantou Intermediate People's Court had ruled that \"certain Bela products infringed upon the copyrights of the Lego Group and that manufacturing and selling of those products constituted acts of unfair competition\", Lego said in a statement on Thursday. The court also decided that Lego is protected under Chinese \"anti-unfair competition law\" for \"the distinctive and unique appearance of certain decorative aspects of its packaging across particular product lines (in this case, LEGO Friends)\" Capturing the imaginations of Chinese children with its bricks is key to reviving growth for the unlisted company after disappointing revenues in its core U.S. and European markets has brought an end to a decade-long sales boom. Lego, whose name is derived from the Danish \"leg godt\" meaning \"play well\", is competing with Barbie maker Mattel Inc and Hasbro, the firm behind My Little Pony, for a slice of the Chinese market. The case was filed against two Chinese companies, which had been manufacturing and selling Bela products that were almost identical to Lego's. They will now have to stop copying Lego's packaging and logos, it said. \"We think this is very important for the continued development of a favorable business environment for all companies operating in the Chinese market,\" Lego's vice president of legal affairs, Peter Thorslund Kjaer said.

The mourning days will be December 14, 15 and 16.\nIn Romania, the days of national mourning are set by Government Decision. On national mourning days, the flags will be flown at half-staff and the national TV and radio stations, as well as the cultural institutions, will have to adapt their programs accordingly. Moreover, all cultural, artistic and sporting events scheduled for these days are postponed.\nKing Michael\u2019s body will be brought to Romania on December 13 and taken to the Peles Castle in Sinaia and then to the Royal Palace in Bucharest. The funeral will take place on December 16 at Curtea de Arges.

Turns out, you might be able to do that. Or\u2026maybe not. \nThe disappointing truth is that while some items we expect to increase in value can pay off handsomely, many others don\u2019t. (Sorry, beanie baby collectors.) \u201cThe main drivers of value appreciation are scarcity, item condition and cultural relevance,\u201d says Sam Bright, eBay\u2019s EBAY, +0.05% general manager of art and collectibles. \u201cFor example, the recent, well-received \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 movie led to a spike in demand and prices for associated collectibles such as comics, Funko Pop and entertainment memorabilia.\u201d\nWondering whether your stuff is worth hanging onto for the long term? We looked at 11 popular collectibles and which are likely to actually increase in value (or not).\nDesigner handbags Starting with the bad news: Designer handbags aren\u2019t likely to increase in value. However, certain brands, like Gucci and Louis Vuitton, LVMUY, +0.46% could reasonably sell for about 50% of their original price tag on resale marketplaces like Vestiaire Collective or Rebagg. Just keep in mind that most consignment sites take a large cut of your profits, and the bag should be in excellent condition.\nBaseball cards Rare, in-demand baseball cards in good condition have significantly increased in value over the years, Bright says. For example, In October, a 1952 Mickey Mantle card sold for more than $40,000, and a 2013 Aaron Judge autographed card sold for $14,655. Not quite as dramatic, but more contemporary cards could also net double-digit earnings from the right buyer: A 2017 Ian Happ rookie card sold for $19.99 recently, and a 2014 Mookie Betts rookie card sold for $36.\nEngagement ring If you\u2019re selling an engagement ring, chances are there\u2019s some emotional baggage attached and any money you get might feel like a bonus\u2014which is good because you probably won\u2019t get much. While preowned rings are selling from about $1,000 to $20,000 on sites like I Do Now I Don\u2019t and Have You Seen the Ring, you\u2019ll likely only recoup a fraction\u2014perhaps as low as 20% \u2014 of the original purchase price. \nWhen you buy a ring from a jeweler, you\u2019re not just paying for the jewelry itself\u2014you\u2019re also covering the cost of other materials, labor, marketing and even the store\u2019s operating costs.\nFancy sneakers Sneakers like Nike NKE, -1.16% Air Jordans have been hot since they were first released in the 80s. If you\u2019ve held on to originals, you can likely earn a couple hundred or more per pair on eBay or at a consignment store\u2014but even new releases could offer a quick return: Last year, the Air Jordan 1 Top 3 was released on Cyber Monday with a price tag of $160, but the shoes now sell for more than $450 , even at Wal-Mart. WMT, -0.56% \nDesigner clothes Spending a fortune on your wardrobe isn\u2019t likely to help your budget today or tomorrow. Designer clothing resales are more about buyers getting great deals than sellers earning income. Currently, designer duds like Chanel and Herm\u00e8s RMS, +0.29% are selling for up to 90% off on resale site The Real Real. If you\u2019re still looking to unload some pieces, consider swapping on sites like Snob Swap and Haute Trader.\nDolls It\u2019s not impossible to get rich off your doll collection\u2014a porcelain doll from 1916 sold in 2014 for $300,000 , for example\u2014but it\u2019s unlikely, especially if your closet is full of Cabbage Patch Kids and American Girl dolls. You can easily nab a Cabbage Patch Kid on eBay for about $10, and many American Girl dolls are selling for well under their original price of $100-plus.\nStamps \u201cHighly graded, rare stamps have increased and are likely to [continue to] increase in value,\u201d Bright says. An eBay seller recently sold a sheet of the world\u2019s most famous stamp, the Uninverted Jenny Error Stamp Sheet , for $71,200. The stamps were completely unused and never folded, so the perfect condition drove up the price.\nIf you like to hunt for unique stamps and hold on to them for several years, this collection could also pay off on a smaller scale: One couple paid 10 cents for an interesting old stamp and then sold it for $200.\nAction figures Some rare figures can be big moneymakers: As new \u201cStar Wars\u201d films are released, original Star Wars action figures are selling for five and six figures on eBay. As for everything else? Most wrestling and sports figures are generally worth just a few bucks each.\nComic books Everybody knows one of those guys with a stash of old comic books in the attic\u2014and the good news is that some of those comics could be worth more than the whole house. The original comic books that go along with new movie releases have been among the most successful in recent years.\nFor instance, a 50-year old Spider-Man book sold on eBay for $24,500 after the movie released in 2012. And last summer, after the release of \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d a collection of three Wonder Woman comics sold on eBay for hundreds of thousands.\nVideogames Got a box of videogames leftover from your childhood (or last year)? Some are likely to net a nice payday\u2014or at least help you get your money back. For instance, a copy of Turok Rage Wars for Nintendo 64 recently sold on eBay for $119.99, Shadow of Earth for XBOX One sold for $45 and Call of Duty: WWII for PlayStation 4 sold for $44.19.\nHot wheels Getty Images Enjoy playing with your Hot Wheels, they aren\u2019t worth much. If you\u2019re holding on to these mini cars and trucks for a big payday, it\u2019s time for a new get-rich plan. While 80s and 90s kids may feel nostalgic about their Hot Wheels, toy maker Mattel MAT, -4.95% made so many that the marketplace has been flooded. Plus, the company continues to release about 250 new models every year. With so many Hot Wheels available, none of them are worth very much money.\nRead the original article on Grow .\nMore from Grow: Retire at 30? Save $1 Million on a $55,000 Salary?

Also, it would have ended up as Angel's sacrifice rather than Buffy's, which sort of defeats the point of the story. Click to expand... True, and I should note that I think Becoming is amazing and I wouldn't actually change a hair on its head. But, just to go off on a tangent, I do struggle a little bit with what happens to Angel. I get that in some sense it's karmic justice, and from an out-of-show perspective, I actually prefer seeing Angel get \"punished\" to just getting his soul back and continuing on. But I still think that what happens to Angel in Becoming is not that much better than throwing Dawn off the tower would have been in The Gift. I know lots of people would have been fine with that outcome, but not me. I would have been OK with Dawn sacrificing herself, though, and I know that Angel likely would have sacrificed himself, and he thought he deserved to be in hell, as he told Giles in Amends. I can't really explain it well, but I guess I struggle with the idea that sacrificing Angel in Becoming was right but killing Dawn in The Gift would not have been. Angel wasn't a child but had saved everyone's life on the show at least once; he wasn't an innocent but with his soul was still a good person who didn't deserve 100 years in hell. To me, it seemed to come down more to having less time to think about it and no obvious alternative, not that it was actually \"right\" (as Buffy says in The Gift).\n(ETA: I should say that Buffy didn't seem to think it was right at the time. She had all those Angel guilt dreams in early Season 3. So maybe she didn't really mean \"right\" in The Gift? Interested in thoughts on this if you have them!)\nI guess it just comes down to different metaphors for different times. Angel represented Buffy's desires and the danger of getting lost in love, so she had to overcome them. Dawn represented Buffy's inner child/humanity so if Buffy agreed to give that up, she would essentially become the inhuman killer that she feared.\nSorry for the ramble!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:14.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0d21ed17c7d57fb1e831390794023caa947d74c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBXRfqQVX.gYNFZl5F4G.RJCKQZFQF0FnAV3B19pI5LsPyTb.wOGY5wcpqknqCBjQDPFtu86hLNyvkzNxwCUkXwE-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money", "title": "Steam stop accepting Bitcoin (core), mempool clogging up, tx fee skyrocket, while the price of Bitcoin (core) still keep going up.

Stephen Charlton, from the Cockapoo Club, said Ms Hamer is an \u2018approved breeder ... though due to one specific complaint we have followed protocol and suspended her following an investigation\u2019. \nHe said: \u201cWe have had a complaint, which we take seriously, and we will investigate. \n\u201cWe have been shown photos, videos and audio of alleged mistreatment and these have been put to Ms Hamer. I cannot comment further due to potential legal issues.\u201d \nDog owners only need to apply for a breeding licence if a bitch has five or more litters in a 12-month period, or if they are breeding dogs for sale. \nMs Hamer is currently applying to get the \u2018appropriate consents\u2019, Wyre Council said. \n\u201cIf she is successful then we will assess her for a breeding licence, could will include a joint inspection with a vet of our choosing,\u201d a spokeswoman added. \nAnd Mr Charlton said: \u201cCurrent legislation is generally interpreted that dog breeders, and I must stress here that anyone choosing to breed a litter is a breeder, no matter what spin they try and put on things, can have up to four litters within a 12 month period, legally, without the need to be council-licensed.\u201d \n\u201cSadly, this does mean that someone with only two bitches can legally breed four litters each and every year \u2013 meaning that both bitches can be bred from every seasons \u2013 every six months.\u201d The RSPCA said it could not comment on specific cases.

We aim to form a broad consensus to ensure participation of all segments of the society in the development march in the next two decades.\u201d \nHe added, \u201cIn implementation of these directives, the preparatory stage for the development of the future vision was launched. The task forces and the technical committees were formed. They analysed the long-term sectoral strategies, aligned their objectives with the goals of the vision and set the national priorities. In addition, the relevant committees have prepared a strategy for communication and community participation in preparing a vision for all citizens and residents.\u201d \nToomas Hendrik Ilves, former president of Estonia, spoke about the importance of strategies and scenarios for future transformations from an international perspective.

The day after the bombing, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed Congress on December 8, 1941, to request a formal declaration of war. His speech was simulcast to the country at large via the radio. In it, he said: \nYesterday, December 7th, 1941 \u2013 a date which will live in infamy \u2013 the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.\n\nThe United States was at peace with that nation, and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its government and its emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American island of Oahu, the Japanese ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to our secretary of state a formal reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or armed attack\u2026\n\nYesterday the Japanese government also launched an attack against Malaya.\n\nLast night Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong.\n\nLast night Japanese forces attacked Guam.\n\nLast night Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands.\n\nLast night Japanese forces attacked Wake Island.\n\nAnd this morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island\u2026\n\nJapan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves\u2026\n\nAlways will be remembered the character of this onslaught against us.\n\nNo matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory\u2026\n\nWith confidence in our armed forces \u2013 with the unbounding determination of our people \u2013 we will gain the inevitable triumph \u2013 so help us God. \n\nPearl Harbor was attacked because it was where the U.S. Navy\u2019s Pacific fleet was headquartered. The bombing, which killed more than 2,400 people, began shortly before 8:00 on a Sunday morning.\n\nFive of our eight battleships were sunk, the other three were badly damaged, and multiple other naval vessels were destroyed.\n\nThe majority of the American war planes based in Hawaii were destroyed as they sat on the ground.\n\nIn addition, most of the American air forces based in the Philippines were destroyed during the nighttime attack on that nation, which FDR also mentioned in his speech.\n\nBy crippling our Pacific defenses, the December 7th attack left us extremely vulnerable in the face of an aggressive enemy to our West \u2013 an enemy that had signaled its intent to rule the entire Pacific basin by subjugating other nations to its will.\n\nThis came at a time when we had not responded to the fact that Nazi Germany to our East had already declared war against us, had already brought most of Europe under its thumb, and had signaled its own intention to rule the world by way of an Aryan resurrection of the old Roman Empire.\n\nSuch circumstances would have spelled doom for the vast majority of countries throughout the course of history. With their foundations based on the accidents of ethnicity and geography, most countries would have simply surrendered; or, in a distinction without a difference, entered into \u201cpeace\u201d negotiations under which they would have to accept the aggressor\u2019s terms and after which the lives of their citizens would most certainly change for the worst.\n\nBut the United States is a nation based on ideals. Our foundation springs from the knowledge that there are things greater than us, things which are greater than the transient circumstances which exist on any given day. We have always found strength in the conviction that our nation exists to support and advance those greater things, to the benefit of people all over the world, and this sets the United States apart from all other nations in all other times.\n\nTaking heed from FDR\u2019s appeal to \u201crighteous might,\u201d reflecting what Abraham Lincoln earlier referred to as the \u201cfaith that right makes might,\u201d the American people of 1941 summoned the invincible courage to rebuild and fight at the same time they were under fearsome siege. They did this despite the fact they were still suffering through an unprecedented economic depression that had started more than a decade before.\n\nLet us pray that those qualities \u2013 that will to power and that unwavering belief in the sanctity of human freedom \u2013 have not been lost as new generations of Americans take the baton from the great ones which came before. For as has been said, those who forget the past will be forced to repeat it.\n\nIt would be shameful if history were to record that we squandered what was handed down to us by people like Larry Perry, and as a result we failed to transfer freedom\u2019s blessings to our  descendants ... And since you probably don't know who Larry Perry is, I recommend you look  here  and find out.\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

For traditional chess algorithms running on regular CPU\u2019s, better evaluation was rarely worth the cost; it would slow down the search so much that it didn\u2019t pay for itself. Interesting ideas get tried and thrown out because they\u2019re too slow in that environment.\nBut this performance tradeoff (like all optimizations) critically depends on hardware. Change the hardware, and you change which ideas are worth implementing.\nAlphaZero is clearly good at using TPU\u2019s to great effect. But what would its performance be in a CPU-only environment? Like with other machine learning programs, we can guess that it would be much slower. Would it be so slow that a dumb, deeper search would win?

to the particular delight of a teenager and her family. \nThe G-Wizz Garden Railway Festive Display event didn\u2019t go ahead last year after the youngest member of its organising team, 13-year-old Gabby Neild, was diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia. \nGabby, from South Shore, spent much of the following nine months in hospital in Manchester with her mum Jo at her side, \nThe pupil of St George\u2019s School, Blackpool is now recovering and doing well - and the Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital, where she was treated is to be the charity beneficiary of Saturday\u2019s event at the White Church, Fairhaven. \nAllan Judd, Gabby\u2019s grandad who leads the organising team, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the least we can do to say thank you for all the hospital\u2019s hard work.\u201d \nThe show, supported by members of the model trade from across the North West and now in its 20th year, will feature garden and narrow gauge railway layouts among displays from all over the North of England and North Wales along with the Fylde-based G-Wizz Group\u2019s own Christmas Layout as its centrepiece. \nAllan added: \u201cWe are delighted that over the years, it has become an a key annual event in the Christmas festivities of the Fylde Coast and is designed solely to raise funds for local charities, with all of the exhibitors giving freely their time and travel expenses. \n\u201cAfter taking a break last year while Gabby was under treatment, all proceeds from this year\u2019s event will be donated to The Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital cancer ward 84. \n\u201cWe usually support Fylde coast-based charities but many youngsters from this area are among those treated at the Manchester hospital and we are delighted to do all we can to back the good work there.\u201d \nGabby said: \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to the show and raising money for the Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital\u201d while her mum Jo added: \u201cWe are so grateful for all the hard work and dedication of the doctors and nursing staff at Manchester, backed up by the Blackpool Victoria Hospital staff.
