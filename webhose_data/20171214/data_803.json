Truro in Cornwall (2.6) and Coventry (2.53) follow in second and third place, with all three areas entering the top 10 for the first time. Crewe, which had the highest number of offences in the UK last year, dropped to sixth place, despite its number of convictions rising overall from 1.69 to 2.29 per 1,0002. \nAt the other end of the scale, London dominates the list of postcodes with the lowest conviction rates for the second year in a row. The postal area of North London boasts the lowest rate of drink or drug driving convictions, with just 0.59 convictions per 1,000 drivers, while five other London postal areas also feature in the bottom 10 - North West, West, East, South East and South West. Outside London, Luton also features in the bottom 10, as do Bolton, Exeter and St Albans. \nThe analysis found men are most likely to get behind the wheel while under the influence but the total rate of convictions has increased since 2016 for both male and female drivers, rising from 1.39 to 1.68 per 1,000 for men and from 0.92 to 1.20 per 1,000 for women. \nThe conviction rate for drink or drug driving is the lowest for over 65s with 0.21 offences per 1,000 drivers, closely followed by 17 to 19 year olds, with just 0.25 convictions. Drivers aged 25 to 29 saw the highest rate of convictions, with three per every 1,000 drivers. \nTREND \nDrivers who have a drink or drug driving conviction will typically see their motor premiums increase at renewal. For those who have been convicted and experienced a hike in their premiums, it\u2019s worth shopping around as another provider might offer a smaller increase. \nKevin Pratt, consumer affairs expert at MoneySuperMarket, commented: \u201cMost people rightly view drink and drug driving as totally unacceptable. Although our analysis shows that it\u2019s a minority that are offending, it\u2019s worrying to see that convictions have increased since last year. This could be because people forget alcohol can stay in the system for a long time after the party is over, leading to being caught the following morning when they think they\u2019re sober. \n\u201cThere are serious consequences if you\u2019re caught drink or drug driving, including a driving ban of at least a year and an unlimited fine, as well as a possible jail sentence of up to six months. \n\u201cFurthermore, an endorsement for drink or drug driving will sit on your licence for 11 years and you\u2019ll have to declare the offence when you apply for car insurance for five years. So the message is clear: if you\u2019re in any doubt about your sobriety, don\u2019t drive. The temporary inconvenience you might suffer by not driving is a far better option than the life-changing upheaval that follows a conviction.\u201d \nRead every story in our hardcopy newspaper for free by downloading the app .

We strongly express our dissatisfaction and opposition,\u201d deputy director of the army\u2019s western theatre combat bureau, Zhang Shuili, said in a statement. \nZhang did not give details about when or where the incident happened. \nChinese border troops \u201ctook a professional and responsible attitude\u201d and carried out identification verification of the device, Zhang said. \n\u201cWe will earnestly fulfil our mission of duty and firmly defend the sovereignty and security of our country,\u201d he added. \nThe Indian embassy in Beijing declined to comment. \nIn August, the two nations pulled back their troops to resolve a tense deadlock over part of a Himalayan plateau claimed by both China and Bhutan, an ally of India. \nThe standoff began in mid-June after Chinese troops started building a road on the remote Doklam plateau. \nIndia has an army base nearby and moved soldiers into the flashpoint zone to halt the work, prompting Beijing to accuse it of trespassing on Chinese soil. \nAfter both sides withdrew, India\u2019s army chief said in September that his country could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war. \n\u201cAs far as our northern adversary is concerned, flexing of muscles has started,\u201d General Bipin Rawat said at a think tank event in New Delhi, in reference to China. \n\u201cThe salami slicing, taking over territory in a very gradual manner\u2026 testing our limits of threshold is something we have to be wary about and remain prepared for situations which could gradually emerge into conflict,\u201d the army chief said. \nRawat said India also has concerns that its arch rival Pakistan \u2013 an ally of China \u2013 could take advantage of the tensions. \nIndia and China went to war in 1962 over the state of Arunachal Pradesh. \nThe latest episode has fed into a broader competition for regional influence between the two Asian powers. \nThe two emerging economies both have large populations and a growing middle class. \nChina has invited India to join President Xi Jinping\u2019s new \u201cSilk Road\u201d project to revive ancient trade routes from Asia to Europe and Africa. \nBut the proposed economic corridor has alarmed India, partly because one of the links cut through Pakistan-administered Kashmir, disputed territory that New Delhi claims is illegally occupied. -AFP", "highlightText": "",

Fading down the stretch (1 of ) SUMNER FOWLER/FOR THE ARGUS COURIER Casa Grande's Sophia Gardea passes over Marin Catholic defense in non-league game played in the Casa gym. GEORGE HAIRE FOR THE ARGUS-COURIER | December 6, 2017, 9:59AM Marin Catholic broke open a tight game with the host Casa Grande girls in the final stanza and escaped with a 48-40 nonleague win on Tuesday night. \nThe two teams battled on equal terms for most of the contest, but it was the ability of the Lady Wildcats to patiently solve the Casa trapping defense that made the difference as they rolled out eight unanswered points down the stretch. \nThe shooting of junior Sydney Politzer turned the tide for Marin Catholic as quick passes from the top of the circle found open wings for good looks at the basket. \nPolitzer had 10 points in the stanza, including 8-for-8 from the foul line. The ball moved faster than the Lady Gauchos could trap, and that made the difference. She had 21 points for Marin. Miranda Jacobson added 13 points. \nMia Cain, last year\u2019s leading point maker for the Gauchos, picked up where she left off with 19 points, and she kept her team in the hunt offensively. In addition to some aggressive interior moves, three of her baskets were short and accurate teardrop runners. Cain had 10 points in the second half, but it wasn\u2019t enough to hold off Marin Catholic. Until the final period, the biggest gap between the two teams was six points. \nThe loss evened the season record for the shorthanded Gauchos at 1-1. \nThree girls were missing from the lineup, including regular starter Hannah Sullivan who is a strong wing shooter. Sullivan suffered a concussion and has not yet been cleared to return to school. \n\u201cWhen she comes back, the protocol begins so it is going to be a while,\u201d said Casa coach Dan Sack. \nEmily Boulad and Shayla Dunker also sat out the game from the Gaucho rotation. \n\u201cIt was a good effort tonight against a pretty good team,\u201d added Sack. \u201cAt times, we had only freshmen and sophomores on the floor. Marin Catholic beat Windsor by 20 points.\u201d \nFreshmen guards Trinity Merwin and Sophia Gardea controlled the tempo for the Lady Gauchos with accurate passing and fast-enough ball movement to give their teammates open shots. \nMerwin was a key player for her Kenilworth Junior High School team that went undefeated for two seasons. \n\u201cShe sees things up the floor and has as very bright future,\u201d noted Sack. \nMerwin finished with nine points and two assists, while the speedy Gardea added a key basket in the third stanza. Both players are quick enough to make the Casa pressing game very effective. Marin Catholic was forced out of a comfort zone for most of the first half. \nJunior Guard Emma Reese hit a late 3-point shot in the final stanza that closed the gap to five points, but the Lady Gauchos could get no closer. Reese had six points for the game. \nMarin Catholic improved to 4-1 for the year. The Wildcats are set to face Woodside Priory in the Laney Shootout on Saturday.

Both had their fair share of 'characters'. One particularly hot summer afternoon while I was there directing traffic on horseback one of the patrons from the Royal Exhibition emerged carrying a schooner of beer and a five-gallon bucket of water. He promptly placed the bucket in front of the horse and handed me the schooner, turned around and left. The horse refused his free drink whilst the jockey disposed of his responsibly.\"\nNot quite the Norm. \"'Free Jock' is spray-painted on a pylon leading into Bathurst Street in Sydney. Does anyone know the story behind Jock?\" asks Gail Grogan of Constitution Hill. \nThe man himself, Harry Bell from Bowral (C8), writes: \"Yes, Jude, I still wake each morning and gather my wits; I open the Herald , and read the Obits. If my name's not there, then I know I'm not dead. So I eat a good breakfast and go back to bed (or to my laptop).\" On a more serious note he adds: \"Judges' Associates were more than Court officials. They were friends, indispensable confidantes and (in country towns) hard working Clerks. It is alway a pleasure to hear from/of them.\"\nColleen Burke of Drummoyne is perplexed: \"What happened to spreading peace and joy at this time of the year? My husband opened his Christmas bonbon at a city restaurant yesterday to find the toy inside was a miniature soldier with rifle poised ready to shoot. His dining companion also got a soldier, this one with a bayonet.\" \nMore fruit (C8).\"One of my neighbours has a giant prickly pear cactus that is currently bearing fruit,\" writes Meri Will of Dee Why. \"Is this fruit edible? How does one go about picking, preparing and eating prickly pears?\" Carefully would be our only suggestion, very carefully.\nAnother citizenship test perhaps?

I'm a spanish speaker, and translating is one of those things that I'm very commited to. However, I made the mistake of not making a portfolio of sorts, but I have worked on other games already (send me a PM if you need to know more about this), but I do have the experience.\nThis might come as a surprise, but I'm actually offering my services for free, for both free and commercial projects. Just a \"Thank you\" is enough.\nHowever, in my current group, deadlines aren't given to me, so I'm not exactly used to work with them, and the reason why I'm doing this for free is because I want to take things easy and figure out how much time it takes me to complete a task. I'm not saying I'm going to slack off, don't get me wrong, but this is something I want you to keep in mind. But don't worry, I'll do my best to meet the requirements.\nI'm willing to work on any kind of VN, so don't hesitate to hit me up.\nOne last thing: Because I'm experimenting with what I've mentioned above, I'd like to work on just one project at the time. Hopefully I'll be able to work on two in the future.\nThat's everything I have to say, if you have any questions, leave a comment and I'll get back to you ASAP. Thanks for reading, and have a nice day.\nSLOTS:\n*empty*", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:45.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a29823ddbdfd622c84db8990f200d998d36c4bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbU1RQqGLQ7tgqRFImdosWxl3Uh5Yh9yyRuk0CBhtqlsS8TVtQMmF5bGaG6rLPnsEIYSBFQaU7b2JQ0KR9kwN7X4TVjxrbwyzog--", "site_full": "www.expedia.fr", "site": "expedia.fr", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.fr/Castenaso-Hotel.d5746.Voyage-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotel Castenaso - R\u00e9servez au meilleur prix avec Expedia.fr", "title": "Hotel Bologna Airport", "title_full": "Hotel Bologna Airport (Bologne, Italie) | Expedia.fr", "published": "2017-09-14T16:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21453, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b47eafd41262b5da056078724eecf3c872d580ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbU1RQqGLQ7tgqRFImdosWxl3Uh5Yh9yyRuk0CBhtqlsS8TVtQMmF5bGaG6rLPnsEIYSBFQaU7b2JQ0KR9kwN7X60gbFaPrmq5viVU711xuOLdDSrNulSqgTEEeTXC2al0Q--", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-02T08:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Ottimo soggiorno hotel confortevole personale gentile.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 4.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:45.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a29823ddbdfd622c84db8990f200d998d36c4bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbU1RQqGLQ7tgqRFImdosWxl3Uh5Yh9yyRuk0CBhtqlsS8TVtQMmF5bGaG6rLPnsEIYSBFQaU7b2JQ0KR9kwN7X4TVjxrbwyzog--", "site_full": "www.expedia.fr", "site": "expedia.fr", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.fr/Castenaso-Hotel.d5746.Voyage-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotel Castenaso - R\u00e9servez au meilleur prix avec Expedia.fr", "title": "Hotel Bologna Airport", "title_full": "Hotel Bologna Airport (Bologne, Italie) | Expedia.fr", "published": "2017-09-14T16:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21453, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0cb660a055a93ac558075935cfedb797381ed3ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbU1RQqGLQ7tgqRFImdosWxl3Uh5Yh9yyRuk0CBhtqlsS8TVtQMmF5bGaG6rLPnsEIYSBFQaU7b2JQ0KR9kwN7X60gbFaPrmq5gJkh0ieHSL5aEUcUQQ_7fMy7LPuBVpjSQ--", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-02T11:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Wunderbar,, mehr habe ich nicht zu sagen.

Centrist - Parties - Parties The centrist parties will need to change if they want to hold off more extreme parties.Germany has the fourth-largest economy in the world and the largest in Europe. Country - Center - European - System - Decades This country has been the stable center of the European system for decades. Amid social and political tensions that have torn the European Union since 2008, Germany has been the solid rock on which Europe has rested.It is not an overstatement to say that if Germany destabilizes, the EU won\u2019t survive. Germany has not yet destabilized, but it is wobbling. Sign - Inability - Parties - Government - Elections One sign is the inability of German parties to form a new government since elections in September.A reason for this is that Germany\u2019s political reality has shifted. Both the CDU and the SPD lost roughly 20% of their seats in parliament in the election. The Christian Social Union in Bavaria, the CDU\u2019s long-time partner, lost about the same. And the two left-wing parties, the Greens and the Left Party, gained hardly any. Alternative - Germany - AfD - Seats - Party Meanwhile, the right-wing Alternative for Germany, or AfD, gained 93 seats to become the third-largest party in parliament, taking most of its votes from the CDU and the SPD.In addition, the Free Democratic Party, a traditionally liberal party dedicated to free markets with a minority euroskeptic faction, became the fourth-largest party after failing to win any seats in the previous election. Earthquake - Ground This is not an earthquake, but the ground has shifted.The CDU and the SPD can still form a grand coalition, but to date, they have been unable to do so.

These clots restrict blood flow through the circulatory system. It is classified into two type\u2019s deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Formation of blood clot in a deep vein (generally in the leg) is called deep vein thrombosis. The formed deep vein thrombosis clot break off and travels to the lungs, called as pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism is a serious complication from deep vein thrombosis. It occurs in almost one-third of patients suffering from deep vein thrombosis. Venous thromboembolism can occur at any age; however, it is common in adults aged 60 and above. People who are overweight, older, whose blood is thicker than normal or suffer from some other diseases such as autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, etc.) or cancer are at a higher risk of venous thromboembolism. Hospitalization due to major trauma (fractures or immobilization) or surgery increases the risk for venous thromboembolism. Up to 60% of venous thromboembolism cases occur during or after hospitalization. Venous thromboembolism equally affects men and women. Globally, venous thromboembolism is the third most common cardiovascular disease and leading cause of death and disability. \nReport Overview and TOC @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/venous-thromboembolism\u2026 \nVenous thromboembolism is a life-threatening medical condition that requires immediate medical treatment. Treatment primarily focuses on breaking the clots and preventing further formation of clots. Treatment includes blood thinning agents such as anticoagulants (such as unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin as well as warfarin), mechanical devices (compression stockings), and thrombolytic therapy (tissue plasminogen activator). The venous thromboembolism market is expected to expand in the near future, led by the development of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to overcome the limitation of current treatment options and provide improved patient of care. NOACs are classified into direct thrombin inhibitors (argatroban, dabigatran), which inhibit factor IIa (thrombin), and factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban). NOACs offer major pharmacological benefits over current vitamin K antagonists (heparin or warfarin). \nThese include rapid onset and offset of action, predictable pharmacokinetics, and less drug interactions, which eliminate the need for regular coagulation monitoring associated with conventional anticoagulant therapy. Increase in government expenditure, rise in incidence rate of venous thromboembolism, growth in patient awareness about treatment, and high unmet needs of current treatment options are fueling the venous thromboembolism market. However, complex pathophysiology of the disease, high cost of treatment, and side effects associated with it act as key restraints for the venous thromboembolism market. \nRequest brochure @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag\u2026 \nThe venous thromboembolism market can be segmented based on disease type, product type, and geography. In terms of disease type, the venous thromboembolism market can be segregated into deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The pulmonary embolism segment is estimated to expand more than the deep vein thrombosis segment, as pulmonary embolism is the third most common cause for hospital related deaths. Based on product type, the venous thromboembolism market can be divided into anticoagulants, medical devices, and others. In anticoagulant segment, NOAC\u2019s market is expected to grow because it eliminates the need for regular coagulation monitoring, overcoming the major limitation of current standard of care. \nIn terms of geography, the venous thromboembolism market can be classified into North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. North America dominates the venous thromboembolism market, followed by Europe, due to the higher incidence and prevalence rate than that in Asia Pacific and Middle East & Africa, increase in demand for advance treatment, and rise in geriatric population in the region. Asia Pacific is an emerging market for venous thromboembolism due to the developing healthcare infrastructure and rising government expenditure in the healthcare industry. However, affordability issues, lack of proper treatment, and poor patient education are factors restraining the venous thromboembolism market in such as Middle East & Africa and Latin America. \nfor Specific and Customized requirements@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag\u2026 \nMajor players operating in the venous thromboembolism market include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Sanofi S.A., Pfizer, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo Co.

Adam Schiff of California. Schiff said he didn\u2019t think it was a legitimate invocation of attorney-client privilege. \nStory Continued Below \n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you can shield communications between individuals merely by having an attorney present,\u201d he said, after the committee\u2019s lengthy interview with Trump Jr. \u201cThat\u2019s not the purpose of attorney-client privilege.\u201d \nTrump Jr.\u2019s meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower \u2013 and the president\u2019s response after it became public earlier this year through a New York Times story \u2013 has become a central focus of investigators probing whether any Trump associates cooperated with Russian efforts to interfere in the presidential election. \nThough Trump Jr. initially portrayed the meeting as \u201cshort,\u201d\u201cintroductory\u201d and focused on the issue of adoption, it was later revealed that there were eight participants \u2013 including the senior Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort \u2013 and that Trump Jr. agreed to the meeting with a promise that he would receive negative information about Hillary Clinton provided by the Kremlin. \nBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. \nAs the story unfolded, Trump Jr. revised his statements and ultimately released a series of emails that revealed he was told before the meeting that the Russian government wanted to help his father\u2019s presidential campaign and urging him to meet with a Kremlin-connected lawyer to receive dirt on Clinton. Subsequent reporting suggested that President Trump had a hand in crafting the initial, incomplete response to the Times story. \nRepublicans on the committee indicated they were satisfied with Trump Jr.\u2019s answers but declined to discuss the substance of the hearing.

The choices included Vladimir Lenin, Alexander Kerensky, Tsar Nicholas II and Mata Hari. \nAfter the tumultuous events of the February Revolution, the hungry and weary Russian people cried out for a program that would amount to more than rhetoric full of promise of an economic and social liberalization. Lenin was to become the face of that program, as he understood the underlying causes of people\u2019s problems, and how to tackle them. \nThis was in stark contrast to the provisional government \u2013 which replaced the autocratic rule of Nicholas II, but addressed burning issues in a very cosmetic way, so as to keep up the legalistic fa\u00e7ade of a Western democracy. Needless to say, Russia had nowhere near the societal structure to resemble that. \nBourgeoisie used to swindle people with its millions, called this power-play \u2018freedom\u2019. We\u2019re breaking away from bourgeoisie and its \u2018freedom\u2019 #1917LIVE \n\u2013 Vladimir Lenin (@VLenin_1917) December 4, 2017 \nSomething that few people actually remember is that the Bolsheviks did not actually have a concrete program; rather, they borrowed elements of Menshevik and SR ideas. But what the others had in college smarts, the Bolsheviks more than made up for in political perseverance. Lenin understood that two things needed to be done immediately to upset the power balance in favor of Russia\u2019s working and fighting population: exit the Great War and feed the starving population \u2013 solving inherent, persistent inequalities through agrarian reform and a redistribution of land. \nREAD MORE: Lenin, Romanov, Kerensky, Mata Hari: Vote for #1917LIVE Person of the Year \nThe war and the economy were inextricably tied, so the Bolsheviks had their work cut out for them. \nVictorious Russian revolution raises the issue of peace point-blank: it\u2019s YES or NO. All warring states should answer that simple question #1917LIVE \n\u2013 Vladimir Lenin (@VLenin_1917) November 28, 2017 \nAt the end of the 19th century, the Russian Empire \u2013 despite its projected growth in the preceding years \u2013 was an underdeveloped social system of absolute monarchy, where only the elites had the sense that they belonged to a European civilization, like France or the UK. It was only a matter of time until the working classes rose up \u2013 and Lenin\u2019s Bolsheviks were instrumental in seizing upon that popular discontent. \nBourgeoisie sabotage people\u2019s rule! Working people can only rely on themselves. Nation faces extremely heavy times, but we think BIG. We trust people\u2019s creativity & the strength of united masses #1917LIVE \n\u2013 Vladimir Lenin (@VLenin_1917) December 6, 2017 \nIn the eight months since the February Revolution, Russia was in Dual Rule limbo, whereby the provisional government had had to share power with the Petrograd Soviet. This gave the Bolsheviks an opportunity to push forward a leftist agenda through the Soviets \u2013 regional bodies representing workers and soldiers. \nTrue democracy means right of voters to recall elected representatives, including Constituent Assembly; Soviets can organize local re-elections #1917LIVE \n\u2013 Vladimir Lenin (@VLenin_1917) December 2, 2017 \nIssuing near-daily writings through Pravda and other news vehicles, the Bolsheviks were able to eventually sway public opinion to such an extent that the government of Alexander Kerensky had run out of forces loyal to them. This finally resulted in the comparatively bloodless October Revolution, bringing Lenin and his group to power, and changing the course of Russian (and global) political development forever. \nRT\u2019s #1917LIVE and #1917CROWD projects is the first historical re-enactment of its kind, allowing users to don the guise of a wartime figure of their choice.

What would you like to do [with this step], Mr Trump? What kind of stance is it?\u201d Erdogan said on Thursday, at Esenboga Airport in the capital Ankara, before leaving for a visit to Greece. \nBreaking with decades of US policy, Trump on Wednesday announced the transfer of American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, formally recognising the contested city as the capital of Israel despite widespread international opposition. \n\u201cI have determined that it is time to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\u201d he said in a speech in Washington. Ignite a \u2018powder keg\u2019 \nUS analysts say Trump\u2019s announcement might risk igniting a \u201cpowder keg\u201d at the heart of the Israel-Palestine conflict. \n\u201cJerusalem has a tendency to explode when you fool around with the status quo,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, vice president at the Woodrow Wilson Center and a former Middle East adviser to the Clinton and Bush administrations. \nThe Turkish president, who had earlier warned that the status of Jerusalem was a red line for Muslims, said that the US decision disregarded a 1980 United Nations resolution regarding the status of the city. \nHe added that political leaders should work to bring peace, not stir things up. \nCalling Jerusalem \u201calso a sanctuary for Christians\u201d, Erdogan added that he would speak to Pope Francis about Trump\u2019s decision this evening or on Friday. \nTurkey will host an extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) on December 13 to discuss the US move. Jerusalem at the core of the conflict \nJerusalem remains at the core of the Israel-Palestine conflict, with Palestinians hoping that East Jerusalem might eventually serve as the capital of a future Palestinian state. \nIsrael illegally occupied Palestinian territories in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem in defiance of the international community, and wasted no time in declaring the city as its \u201ceternal, undivided\u201d capital. \nTrump had promised to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem during his election campaign. \nSaeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said Trump \u201cdestroyed any possibility of peace\u201d and was \u201cpushing this region towards chaos [and] violence\u201d. \n\u201cHe is destroying all moderates in the region and giving power to extremists,\u201d Erekat told Al Jazeera.\u201cThis is the most dangerous decision that any US president has ever taken.\u201d \nErekat said it is \u201cmeaningless\u201d to have a Palestinian state without Jerusalem as its capital.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "recep tayyip", "sentiment": "none"},

Writing in the Atlantic, Derek Thompson calls bitcoin an \u201cingenious and potentially transformative technology\u201d that could the entire economy could be built on \u2013 the currency equivalent of the internet. Some are even speculating that bitcoin could someday make the U.S. dollar obsolete. \nBut the rise of bitcoin is also happening at a specific moment in history: Humanity is decades behind schedule on counteracting climate change, and every action in this era should be evaluated on its net impact on the climate. Increasingly, bitcoin is failing the test. \nDigital financial transactions come with a real-world price: The tremendous growth of cryptocurrencies has created an exponential demand for computing power. As bitcoin grows, the math problems computers must solve to make more bitcoin (a process called \u201cmining\u201d) get more and more difficult \u2013 a wrinkle designed to control the currency\u2019s supply. \nToday, each bitcoin transaction requires the same amount of energy used to power nine homes in the U.S. for one day. And miners are constantly installing more and faster computers. Already, the aggregate computing power of the bitcoin network is nearly 100,000 times larger than the world\u2019s 500 fastest supercomputers combined. \nThe total energy use of this web of hardware is huge \u2013 an estimated 31 terawatt-hours per year. More than 150 individual countries in the world consume less energy annually. And that power-hungry network is currently increasing its energy use every day by about 450 gigawatt-hours, roughly the same amount of electricity the entire country of Haiti uses in a year. \nThat sort of electricity use is pulling energy from grids all over the world, where it could be charging electric vehicles and powering homes, to bitcoin-mining farms. In Venezuela, where rampant hyperinflation and subsidized electricity has led to a boom in bitcoin mining, rogue operations are now occasionally causing blackoutsacross the country. The world\u2019s largest bitcoin mines are in China, where they siphon energy from huge hydroelectric dams, some of the cheapest sources of carbon-free energy in the world. One enterprising Tesla owner even attempted to rig up a mining operation in his car, to make use of free electricity at a public charging station. \nIn just a few months from now, at bitcoin\u2019s current growth rate, the electricity demanded by the cryptocurrency network will start to outstrip what\u2019s available, requiring new energy-generating plants. And with the climate conscious racing to replace fossil fuel-base plants with renewable energy sources, new stress on the grid means more facilities using dirty technologies. By July 2019, the bitcoin network will require more electricity than the entire United States currently uses. By February 2020, it will use as much electricity as the entire world does today. \nThis is an unsustainable trajectory. It simply can\u2019t continue. \nThere are already several efforts underway to reform how the bitcoin network processes transactions, with the hope that it\u2019ll one day require less electricity to make new coins. But as with other technological advances like irrigation in agriculture and outdoor LED lighting, more efficient systems for mining bitcoin could have the effect of attracting thousands of new miners. \nIt\u2019s certain that the increasing energy burden of bitcoin transactions will divert progress from electrifying the world and reducing global carbon emissions. In fact, I\u2019d guess it probably already has. The only question at this point is: by how much?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "derek thompson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tesla", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "haiti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:46.048+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8225cdf8b8334f036551cd939945990fae60683f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMopbZsP2F.BPzPPlhmSPo0PH8rMzYWU4GLeSspZuV7C78RbdjdHyXLxKsS5TJBGn0pfI6lsVmtwgAlcUF6tBbxfJLAry7a7qPyIGIW0z4i1rQ--", "site_full": "trueviralnews.com", "site": "trueviralnews.com", "site_section": "http://trueviralnews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "True Viral News", "title": "Trump\u2019s Jerusalem decree outrages leaders from London to Amman", "title_full": "Trump\u2019s Jerusalem decree outrages leaders from London to Amman", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8225cdf8b8334f036551cd939945990fae60683f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMopbZsP2F.BPzPPlhmSPo0PH8rMzYWU4GLeSspZuV7C78RbdjdHyXLxKsS5TJBGn0pfI6lsVmtwgAlcUF6tBbxfJLAry7a7qPyIGIW0z4i1rQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TVN stuff", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "Trump\u2019s Jerusalem decree outrages leaders from London to Amman", "text": "Trump\u2019s Jerusalem decree outrages leaders from London to Amman 07.12.2017 tweet \nFrom Europe to the Middle East to Australia, U.S. allies and adversaries alike lined up Wednesday to condemn President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to later move the U.S. embassy there. \nWorld leaders painted the decision as unilateral and outside the vision of a negotiated peace between Israelis and Palestinians and warned of heightened tensions or even violence across the Middle East. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May swiftly \u201cdisagreed\u201d with Trump\u2019s decision, saying in a statement that Jerusalem\u2019s fate should be decided as \u201ca negotiated settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and Jerusalem should ultimately be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian states.\u201d \n\u201cWe regard East Jerusalem as part of the Occupied Palestinian Territories,\u201d May said in the statement.\u201d \nSaudi Arabia\u2019s government went further, calling the move an \u201cirresponsible and unwarranted step.\u201d A statement from the kingdom\u2019s Royal Court said the move \u201crepresents a great bias against the historic and permanent rights of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem, which have been affirmed by the relevant international resolutions and have been recognized and supported by the international community.\u201d \nIranian President Hassan Rouhani denounced it as \u201cnew adventurism by global oppressors,\u201d Reuters reported, and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said \u201cone announcement by a country\u201d does not make Jerusalem the capital of Israel and called the decision a \u201cdangerous step.\u201d \nIsrael, meanwhile, thanked Trump for his \u201ccourageous and just\u201d decision. \u201cThere is no peace that doesn\u2019t include Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Isreal,\u201d Isreali Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement on Twitter. \nThis is a historic day. Jerusalem has been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years. Jerusalem has been the focus of our hopes, our dreams, our prayers for three millennia. Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years. Thank you, @realDonaldTrump! pic.twitter.com/mWCUpUMpiC \n\u2013 Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) December 6, 2017 \nTrump made the declaration on Wednesday from the Diplomatic Reception Room in the White House. \u201cToday we finally acknowledge the obvious: That Jerusalem is Israel\u2019s capital,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It\u2019s something that has to be done.\u201d \nThe announcement broke from a decade\u2019s long \u201chands off\u201d foreign policy approach by previous administrations and went against the advice of international policy experts. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called Trump\u2019s decision \u201cregrettable\u201d and said it \u201ccontravenes international law and U.N. Security Council resolutions.\u201d \nThe 28-member European Union also expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d regarding the U.S decision without any input from the Palestinian side. \n\u201cThe aspirations of both parties must be fulfilled and a way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of both states,\u201d said EU representative Federica Mogherini in a statement on Wednesday. \nAustralia\u2019s Foreign Minister Julie Bishop expressed concern regarding \u201cany unilateral action by either side which could add to tensions.\u201d \nProtests erupted in several countries following Trump\u2019s announcement. Demonstrators burned American flags and effigies of Trump on the streets of Gaza and Lebanon on Wednesday with more demonstrations expected throughout the week. \nThe State Department issued an updated \u201cworldwide caution\u201d to American citizens traveling abroad. \n\u201cAs terrorist attacks, political upheaval, and violence often take place without any warning, U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness when traveling,\u201d a statement issued shortly after the president\u2019s announcement said. \nSeveral nations concurrently offered a stance of support to Palestinian leaders along with denunciations of the U.S. decision. \nPresident Abdel Fattah El Sisi spoke with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas over the phone on Wednesday and the two discussed \u201cthe repercussions,\u201d according to a statement from the Egyptian president\u2019s office. \nJordan, which has long been a U.S. ally but also has a significant population of Palestinian refugees, also backed the Palestinian Authority along with its repudiation of Trump\u2019s declaration. In a statement released by the Jordanian Embassy in Washington, D.C., Jordan called Trump\u2019s move a \u201cviolation of international legitimacy resolutions and the UN Charter.\u201d \nJordan\u2019s King Abdullah II is scheduled to meet with Abbas later this week in Jordan to coordinate a response, the Associated Press reported. \nJordan and the Palestinian National Authority have called for an emergency meeting of the Arab League\u2019s Ministerial Council in Cairo on Saturday to \u201ccoordinate positions on the U.S. decision and to agree on a mechanism of collective action to reduce its adverse impact effects and contain its consequences,\u201d the statement said. \nThe Arab League consist of 22 countries throughout the Middle East. \nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres delivered a strong rebuke of Trump\u2019s decision. \u201cIn this moment of great anxiety, I want to make it clear: there is no alternative to the two-state solution. There is no Plan B,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cJerusalem is a final status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties.\u201d \nThe United Nations Security Council is also expected to convene an emergency meeting on Friday at the request of eight member countries \u2013 Bolivia, Egypt, France, Italy, Senegal, Sweden, United Kingdom and Uruguay \u2013 that oppose Trump\u2019s decision, according to Reuters. \n\u201cThe U.N. has given Jerusalem a special legal and political status, which the Security Council has called upon the international community to respect,\u201d said Deputy Swedish U.N. Ambassador Carl Skau, according to Reuters. \u201cThat is why we believe the Council needs to address this issue with urgency.\u201d TAGS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

Is Like SXSW For Cannabis Celebrate cannabis culture with a solid music lineup, art, speakers, and pot galore in its latest innovations at the world's largest cannabis competition and expo.\nCannabis has shifted from a psychoactive drug enjoyed from time to time in recreational fashions to a medical necessity for many. Capable of diminishing pain, helping to ease symptoms of PTSD, and even thwarting-off episodic seizures, marijuana, truly, is a Holy Grail to chronic illness. And the Emerald Cup embodies everything medicinal and life-changing about the plant, while working to propel sustainable, outdoor farming.\nStarted in Mendocino, the Emerald Cup has grown to become Northern California's premier convergence for medicinal marijuana suppliers and consumers alike, introducing the concept of sustainable, outdoor cannabis farming to the humble masses, as well as limelighting new scientific research around the provocative planet. Now, the Emerald Cup, too has been solidified by the sheer fact that it represents the largest, most respected, organic, outdoor, medicinal cannabis competition in the world.\nBut, The Emerald Cup isn't as much a competition of sorts as it is a communal convention, where cannabis aficionados can commingle and exchange ideas, contributing to the greater conversation at large. It's where small craft farmers and industry leaders admire each others to high-quality cannabis products; artisanal vendors come out in droves to showcase their hand-blow glass bowlings and other smoking accoutrements. Trophies are bestowed to visionary glow-blowing artists in a multitude of categories including the CBD, lifetime achievement, topicals, edibles and breeders cup, regenerative cannabis farm, and tinctures awards. What was once a taboo art has become an integral part of cannabis culture.\nThe event also presents a festival experience with music and speakers, much like Austin's SXSW. The music lineup includes the likes of The Roots, Portugal the Man, Hieroglyphics, Gramatik, and an array of DJ sets; while the speakers range from doctors to growers and everyone in between. Above all, the Emerald Cup is a marijuana mecca and pilgrimage for those among us who celebrate the plant for all it has to offer.\nPlanning on going?

Another meal lined up for the Rat Eaters \u2013 some of India\u2019s poorest people. \nMr Phekan said it would take 15 minutes to prepare the rat stew, as he dissected the animal with his fingernails. \n\u201cAlmost everyone here loves this and knows how it\u2019s prepared,\u201d he added. \nMr Phekan is one of about 2.5 million Musahars \u2013\u2018Rat Eaters\u2019\u2013 one of India\u2019s most marginalised communities. Even the browbeaten low-caste Dalits look down on them. \n\u201cThey are the poorest amongst the poorest and rarely hear about or get access to government schemes,\u201d said Ms Sudha Varghese, who spent three-decades working among Musahars in the northern state of Bihar, where most live and survive as dollar-a-day labourers. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a daily struggle for the next meal and diseases like leprosy are an everyday reality,\u201d added Ms Varghese, who was awarded India\u2019s top civilian honour for her work. \nA member of the Musahar community roasting a rat at Alampur Gonpura village in the eastern Indian state of Bihar.

Some days we get work at the farm, on other days we go hungry or catch rats and eat it with whatever little grain we can get,\u201d Mr Manjhi said. \n\u201cGovernments may have changed but nothing has changed for us. We still eat, live and sleep as our ancestors,\u201d said Mr Phekan as he took the roasted rat off the fire and poked the tender meat. \nHe cut the flesh with his hands into a bowl and added mustard oil and salt. \nThe feast disappeared in seconds as a dozen men and half-naked children grabbed what they could. \n\u201cNothing but education can change our lives and future,\u201d said Mr Jitan Ram Manjhi, who in 2014 became the first Musahar chief minister of any Indian state. \nMembers of the Musahar community roasting a rat at Alampur Gonpura village in the eastern Indian state of Bihar. PHOTO: AFP \nHis nine-month tenure heading Bihar, one of India\u2019s most populous states, is considered a huge achievement for the Musahars. \n\u201cMy community is so downtrodden that I think even government records don\u2019t yet show its real numbers, which could easily be around eight million,\u201d Chief Minister Manjhi added. \nAs a child, the former minister herded cattle for a rich landowner who employed his parents as labourers. \n\u201cThey were almost like bonded labourers, getting one kilogram of grain for each day\u2019s work. Even today, things haven\u2019t changed much for many,\u201d he added. \nBihar\u2019s Welfare Department Minister Ramesh Rishidev insisted that life has improved for the Musahars. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard with the different communities, which includes the Musahars,\u201d the minister said. \nMembers of the Musahar community eating roasted rat at Alampur Gonpura village in the eastern Indian state of Bihar.

They are linked to government skills and training projects to get them employment opportunities,\u201d he added. \nMr Rishidev said that while in the past the Musahars ate rats to stave off hunger, most now do so out of a \u201ccultivated taste and not compulsion\u201d. \n\u201cSome from the older generation still eat rats because it is like any other food they have. Most of the younger generation don\u2019t eat it.

GARY NYLANDER/The Daily Courier \nA funny thing happens when Premier John Horgan goes out in public. \nHe doesn\u2019t get yelled at. At least, not as much as he used to. \nHorgan told a roomful of adoring NDP members on Sunday in Westbank that he now encounters confrontational people \u201cfar less\u201d than when he was leader of the Opposition. \nHorgan suggested that might be because people recognize he is \u201coverwhelmingly optimistic,\u201d and because they\u2019re generally satisfied with the way the NDP is governing the province since taking power five months ago. \nThe NDP\u2019s accomplishments so far, he said, including eliminating a $50-million tax break for banks, closing a loophole that was often used by \u201cunscrupulous\u201d landlords to jack up rents, providing housing for the homeless, returning a bus pass for people with disabilities, reconstituting a human rights commission, developing a poverty reduction plan, and hiring more than 2,000 additional teachers. \n\u201cThese things are not rocket science,\u201d Horgan said. \u201cThe notion that only Liberals can govern B.C. has been fairly thoroughly debunked in just 137 days.\u201d \nThe NDP government has been able to implement big parts of its election platform and the \u201cbond raters will still give you a thumbs up,\u201d he said, referring to the province\u2019s retention last month of its AAA credit rating by Standard and Poors. \nOf course, BC Liberals will say that continued good rating has everything to do with the rosy financial situation they left for the NDP. Just wait six months or so, they\u2019d say, when the true cost of the NDP\u2019s mini-spending spree comes due. \nTo the extent they noticed Horgan\u2019s appearance in West Kelowna, however, Liberals might have some reason to be a teeny bit anxious heading into the February by-election to replace Christy Clark, who abruptly quit politics rather than suffer the indignity of leading the Opposition. \nIt was a standing room only crowd to greet Horgan, with everyone seeming eager to volunteer and donate and generally wage war in the upcoming bye-election. One wag, Bruce Marriott, called it \u201cthe bye-bye bye-election, as in bye-bye Christy, and hello NDP.\u201d \nTrue, it was a smallish room with space for only 70 or so folks. But measure that against the shockingly low number of Liberals \u2014 around 200 or so \u2014 who turned out to watch the party\u2019s leadership debate in Kelowna, the heart of the party (if it has one). \nThose numbers alone clearly suggest which party has the wind in its sails right now, and it ain\u2019t the Liberals. Call them \u201ccockeyed optimists,\u201d a tag which they\u2019d probably embrace, but the NDP clearly believes it has a shot at winning the Kelowna West by-election. \nRichard Cannings, the NDP MP for South Okanagan-West Kootenay was in the room to show, as Horgan quipped, that there is \"tangible proof\" the party can thrive in the Valley. \nHorgan also mentioned the party\u2019s breakthrough, in a 2016 by-election, in the riding of Coquitlam-Burke Mountain, as evidence the NDP can make deep inroads in previously hostile terrain. (The Liberals regained that seat, but only just, by less than a percentage point in last May\u2019s general election) \nStill, Kelowna West is not Coquitlam, a riding like others in the Lower Mainland where the popularity of the NDP\u2019s promise of eliminating bridge tolls was badly under- estimated by the Liberals. Nor is it the South Okanagan-West Kootenay, an area which has always had a good chunk of left-leaning voters and not for nothing has a big hill called \u201cAnarchist Mountain.\u201d \nKelowna West was won by Clark by 35 points in May. That\u2019s not a landslide, that\u2019s continental drift. \nMuch is made by the NDP of the credibility, familiarity, and experience of NDP by-election candidate Shelley Cook, but the fact is she did only marginally better for the party than did the two no-hopers that represented the NDP in the two Kelowna ridings. \nThe local NDP will hit the Kelowna West by-election hard, hoping to energize their base and convince more than a few others that it\u2019s better for the area to be represented in government than outside it. They might have had a shot if the margin of defeat in May had been a single digit. \nBut there\u2019s more than enough Liberals in the riding who\u2019ll be motivated to resist the typical apathy a by-election arouses and get out and vote. They\u2019ll be motivated by party loyalty, bitterness over the May result, and their fondness for Liberal contender Ben Stewart. \nI thought Horgan took an odd approach at the Westbank meeting when he suggested the Liberals had long taken the Okanagan for granted. That\u2019s close to saying people here are so stupid they always vote Liberal. \nWhen she arrived in 2013, Christy Clark said she wanted to represent the Okanagan because it was the \u201ccradle of free enterprise.\u201d The NDP are many things, but they aren\u2019t cradle robbers. \nRon Seymour is a Daily Courier reporter.
