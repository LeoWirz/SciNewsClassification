Got plenty of silage as we'll.\nSorry for long post but any help would be useful as I may be a little out of my depth at the mo.

Don't get me wrong; I love this head. Amazing tone, great durability, and the ability to switch from 100/50 watt power modes (to get more headroom for cleans, or faster breakup for distortion)... but I just don't need it anymore. The head was bought brand new in May, and has been on the road but always kept in a case and a smoke-free home. The case is just a few months old and works like a dream. Fits the head snug, and has some room for cables at the bottom, too. These go for $900 new, and the case is around $250, so both for 9 is a great deal, especially considering they're basically brand new. Willing to drive within a certain radius of Cincinnati.

The tech bubble of the 1990s had Nasdaq and E-Trade. And the virtual currency market of the last year has had Coinbase. Coinbase employees lining up for free food in the gaming room of the company\u2019s office in San Francisco. Credit Jason Henry for The New York Times Coinbase has been at the center of the speculative frenzy driving up the value of Bitcoin \u2014 which topped $13,000 on Wednesday \u2014 and similar currencies. While there are many Bitcoin exchanges around the world, Coinbase has been the dominant place that ordinary Americans go to buy and sell virtual currency. No company had made it simpler to sign up, link a bank account or debit card, and begin buying Bitcoin. The number of people with Coinbase accounts has gone from 5.5 million in January to 13.3 million at the end of November, according to data from the Altana Digital Currency Fund. In late November, Coinbase was sometimes getting 100,000 new customers a day \u2014 leaving the company with more customers than Charles Schwab and E-Trade. The company faces challenges that are a reminder of the early days of now-mainstream online brokerages, which suffered through untimely outages and harsh criticism from traditional finance companies and government regulators. And Coinbase\u2019s missteps make it clear that the virtual currency industry is still young, with little of the battle testing that other financial markets have faced.

Credit Jason Henry for The New York Times Coinbase\u2019s offices in downtown San Francisco show a start-up straining to keep up withgrowth. The company offers all the usual perks: free lunch and dinner, a sizable cafeteria and a room with yoga mats and board games. Recently, every last inch of space has been pressed into action. The day after Bitcoin hit $10,000 last week, a training session for Coinbase managers was moved to the game room because the engineering team needed to set up an emergency war room in the regular conference room. The engineering team was trying to get Coinbase back up after the company\u2019s site was knocked offline, overwhelmed by a wave of incoming traffic. The number of visitors was double what it had been during the previous peak \u2014 two days earlier \u2014 and eight times what it had been in June, the peak until recently.

State Democrats gathered on Saturday to hear pitches from the party\u2019s six candidates for the 1st District U.S. House seat in 2018, but before the forum began, there was a long discussion on the way presidential candidates are chosen. \nSeveral dozen activists, mostly backers of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary campaign, pressed the party\u2019s two members of the Democratic National Committee, Kathy Sullivan and Bill Shaheen, to urge the DNC to reform the superdelegate system. Advertisement \nThe Sanders backers are still smarting over the fact that all but one of the state superdelegates backed Hillary Clinton last year despite Sanders having won the Democratic primary by 22 percentage points. \nUnder the current system, superdelegates, who are officeholders and top party officials from across the country, are free to support the candidate of their choice at the national convention, regardless of the outcome of the voting in their states\u2019 primaries and caucuses. \nThe superdelegate system is one of the topics expected to be addressed when the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Unity Commission, which was formed during the 2016 Democratic National Convention, holds its fifth and final meeting Friday and Saturday in Washington. \nCommission chair Jen O\u2019Malley and vice chair Larry Cohen are expected to lead discussion on the panel\u2019s final recommendations on a wide range of possible reforms, including the superdelegate issue. \nThe commission must issue its report and recommendations to the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee by Jan. 1. \nSullivan, who is a member of the rules committee, said Wednesday that she has heard from her contacts in the national party that the commission \u201cmay propose allocating superdelegates in accordance with states\u2019 primary and caucus results.\u201d \nShe said she has also heard that the binding of superdelegates to voting results \u201cmay not apply to elected officials. But it\u2019s not definite, yet.\u201d \nThe state party, meanwhile, plans to hold a special meeting in January to further discuss the issue following the release of the Unity Commission report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bernie sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sullivan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill shaheen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathy sullivan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jen o\u2019malley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dnc rules and bylaws committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "1st district u.s. house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dnc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic national committee\u2019s unity commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic national committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unity commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:30.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3224eae943e12b7fb359eb8d4c536d4c64e0ff05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRFLAU5tMTbwUbmHOUk0Ch_Kq12mrHsl5s8SxtcSCngMQD7JCLSMHitAQsyLA.uKCOpsuA8xrfLcEfqnw8SKGyRYTjZ58iEOmo-", "site_full": "cincinnati.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://cincinnati.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist cincinnati | for sale search", "title": "MEN'S WATCHES ALL SIZES (SARDINIA, Oh)", "title_full": "MEN'S WATCHES ALL SIZES (SARDINIA, Oh)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00404_8Q4BgWfG71G_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3224eae943e12b7fb359eb8d4c536d4c64e0ff05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRFLAU5tMTbwUbmHOUk0Ch_Kq12mrHsl5s8SxtcSCngMQD7JCLSMHitAQsyLA.uKCOpsuA8xrfLcEfqnw8SKGyRYTjZ58iEOmo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "MEN'S WATCHES ALL SIZES (SARDINIA, Oh)", "text": "( google map ) QR Code Link to This Post I have 28 men's watches for $5.00 each all need batteries but are in pretty good condition apparnce wise.

I have the original Box, paperwork and cables. The model is Red/Black and it lights up and glows when connected via USB. Kids love these. Heck, I love them. The headset will work on PlayStation PS3, PS4, PS4 Pro, or X Box One, X Box One S, X Box One X, or and Android or Apple iPhone. It has three connection types, so it can hook up to anything. It has the normal 3.5\" Auxiliary Cable (This is the normal headset connection on phones, game controllers or your car), you can also connect via USB or RCA/3.5\" stereo cables. So you have plenty of options. The headset sounds amazing and has a 40mm Drivers and a 120 Degree adjustable Microphone. It has its own easy separate game volume and chat adjust volume bars, so you can just turn each up or down separately without have to go into the system. It can be used as a headset for your phone as well. Very Comfy to wear, especially if you wear glasses. I ramble. Just like to give all the info.

According to The Atlantic , the drugs used in this method can put you lightly to sleep, yet leave you capable of possibly feeling pain and even answering questions during the procedure. The advantages are that patients don\u2019t need heavy anesthetics (which come with their own set of hazards); the disadvantage is that you possibly may be feel pain you don\u2019t want to feel. If you\u2019re having trouble relating to this, you may not have had a colonoscopy, as this procedure is one that uses this type of \u201clight\u201d sedation , with most people neither feeling uncomfortable during the procedure nor even recalling it later. You\u2019re not really totally \u201cout,\u201d but on the other hand you\u2019re mostly oblivious to it. And while this underscores the need for you, as a patient, to always discuss with your doctor the pros and cons of the anesthesia you\u2019re going to get if you\u2019re having a surgical procedure, it also is a good time to bring up the side effects and drawbacks of a colonoscopy. Colonoscopies are done to screen for colon cancer, which is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. And despite the fact that there are three acceptable screening methods, it seems that colonoscopy always comes in first \u2014 with patients being the ones to choose the test even when they\u2019re given the options. But before you become one of these patients, make sure your doctor explains all the possible side effects of a colonoscopy, which can include perforation of the colon, complications from the anesthesia and even false positives from the test itself \u2014 a problem that can lead to unnecessary drugs and treatments , as well as other side effects. If you do decide to get a colonoscopy, be sure to ask the question many don\u2019t know to ask, and that is: What do you use to clean your scopes ? If your physician doesn\u2019t answer peracetic acid, then choose a different facility, as the alternative, Cidex, does not properly sterilize the devices.

Nigerian Victims of Sex Trafficking Share Their Tales of Horror to Caution Others. by 10:35:00 in NEWS   Arab-American journalist who is a senior international correspondent for CNN, Arwa Damon sat with two victims of sex trafficking in Nigeria, to hear their accounts of how they were lured abroad, and the horrors they suffered. Sharing her experience, one of the victims narrated being tricked by a man she met in a church in Edo State, who said he was an assistant pastor. According to her, the man had a vision from God that she traveled abroad and he said his sister could help her get a job at a hair salon. The victim said he took, \u201cmy pants, my bra, the hair from my head, the armpit and my private parts,\u201d to a medicine man for juju. Owing her trafficker $45,000 for covering her flight to Europe, the victim said the juju was to ensure she\u2019d pay back. Talking about a particularly awful experience, she said: \u201dThere were five of them. They were brutal, they beat me up, they brought out a knife and tried to stab me. They might even kill you if you try to defend yourself. That\u2019s the reason why it is very horrible. And in that process most Nigerian girls lose their life, because not every girl can withstand the pressure of 10 men. The men eventually pushed her out of a second-story window for not submitting. Another victim, Ede \u2018s story is quite different. She was sold into sexual slavery in Libya. Ede said of the man who bought her; \u201cHe used to hurt me, apart from work. That is how they do there. When you finish paying your money [to your captor], if you are staying with a wicked somebody, they will sell you to another people so you start all over again.\u201d \u201cEspecially they hate us, we Nigerians\u2026 they don\u2019t even want to hear anything concerning Nigerians,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey treated us like a slave, as if we are nothing. So we went through a lot there.\u201d On December 5, 2017, some Nigerians return home with a warning to others: \u2018Don\u2019t go to Libya\u2019. A young couple were spotted proudly showing off their baby. Love has blossomed in the most unusual but uplifting circumstances for this Nigerian migrants, Mabel Emmanuel , 27, and Henry Stevens , 28, who met after she was kidnapped in Libya during an attempt to enter Europe. Emmanuel was unable to pay a ransom to her kidnappers, so Stevens stepped in to pay the money and bought her freedom. The pair became inseparable and now have a three-month-old son called David . \u201cThey kidnapped me in a place called Sabha, that\u2019s when I met my husband. He bailed me out, it was last year and we fell in love,\u201d Emmanuel said. \u201cI got pregnant in March this year and I gave birth to my baby in August. I gave birth to my baby in prison, with tears. Even though I was pregnant, they were still beating and maltreating me. But I give God the praise that I\u2019m still alive today and I have my baby and my husband now.\u201d Their story is a rare silver lining amid the tales of horror recounted by newly-returned Nigerian migrants from Libya. On Tuesday night, the latest batch of 143 arrivals, mostly from Nigeria\u2019s Edo State, stepped onto the tarmac at the cargo terminal of Lagos airport, tired and weary, uncertain what the future holds for them in the country they were so desperate to flee from. Even so, regardless of the uncertainty they face, their relief at being back on home land was palpable. There were shouts of joy, prayers of gratitude and jubilation as they got off the plane. Several of the new arrivals were women with very young babies. One of them, Abeuwa Igwe , had her 10-month old daughter Favor strapped tightly to her back. She told CNN she left Nigeria in June last year to travel to Italy after one of her neighbors in Edo State promised her work as a domestic worker. Abeuwa said she was willing to make the dangerous boat journey even though she was aware that many had died during the crossing. \u201cI was scared but I made up my mind. I prayed to God that he would help me cross over the river. Many people die, but many survive,\u201d she said. However, her plans to reach Europe didn\u2019t happen as she got stuck in Libya instead. Her situation became further complicated when she discovered she was pregnant. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was pregnant before I went to Libya. I found out at five months. I was forced to give birth in the back of a condemned vehicle. No hospital. Nothing. It was God that helped me. I was all alone. I had nothing, nothing,\u201d she said, recalling the birth of her child. \u201dI spent a year and four months in Libya. All my time there was horror and terrible. I had a lot of beatings,\u201d she recounted, pausing at times to sigh deeply before regaining her composure. \u201cPeople are dying every day, no food, no water. I was in prison for 10 months with my baby. It was horror. We just ate two slice of bread in the morning with some chai (local tea). It\u2019s hard for the babies to get clothes or food. They were not kind to the babies at all. The worst thing that I saw was a pregnant woman who was beaten and raped.\u201d she said. Like the other new arrivals Abeuwa sounds a cautionary note to other Nigerians planning a similar journey. \u201cIn my life, I would never go to Libya. I advise Nigerians not to travel to Libya,\u201d she added. However, Abike Dabiri-Erewa , a senior special assistant to the Nigerian president, said: \u201cWith the outcry, they are going at a faster pace. As the week goes by, the number of planes will increase. There are stranded African migrants in detention centers outside Tripoli because those prisons are manned by rebels, we can\u2019t get there. It\u2019s important that the African Union and European Union instructs them to open up all detention centers so every African there can come back home,\u201d she added. The United Nations-backed Libyan Government of National Accord, or GNA, said it\u2019s keen to address violations against illegal immigrants but called upon regional and global partners to provide assistance.

She is depicted as attractive, beautiful, tall, and blonde women in this famous series of Game of Thrones. She is the only queen who wears a crown in the series. Cersei was the daughter of late Tywin Lannister, who was killed by his dwarf son, and sister of Ser Jaime Lannister and the dwarf, Tyrion Lannister. In this series, it is shown that Cersei and her brother Jaime Lannister keeps some intimate relationship even though they are blood-related to each other. We could see at the last episode of the first season, when Ser Jaime Lannister pushes Brandon Stark from the tower of Winterfell. Bran then falls into coma and wakes up only when he has a vision of his father being slaughtered. Cersei can be taken as the real game player in this series. We can commonly notice her having a wine glass in her hand. Obviously, she had three children, viz. Joeffrey, Marcella, and Tommen Baratheon, with her brother Ser Jaime, not King Robert Baratheon. Every child she ever had dies on her presence some because of her action or some because of her faith on others, whom she thinks her own.You can really say Karma has done its job in case of Cersei. Cersei Lannister later on crowns herself as the rightful queen of the seven kingdoms and the protector of the realm after the death of her all kids. She even fights with Ser Jaime Lannister to obey her orders to disrespect the vow taken among the King in the North, the dragon queen, and the crown itself. Lastly, she loses Jaime Lannister from her side. In conclusion, Cersie Lannister is the villain of this great series of Game of Thrones.

Asked to explain just how little Benevento, from the Campania region, finds itself in Serie A this season, for the first time ever, critics like your correspondent last summer pointed to the town\u2019s so-called \u201cmagical\u201d qualities. \nThe thing is that, since ancient Roman times, Benevento has been known as the \u201ccity of Sorcerers\u201d, the home town of wizards. Some might even argue, with all due respect to then coach Marco Baroni, that it was only thanks to the efforts of wizards and witches that the club unexpectedly made it to Serie A last spring. \nWhatever about that promotion, you could be forgiven for arguing that the wizards were hard at work down in Benevento last Sunday. Until then, Benevento\u2019s season had been an unmitigated disaster. Their record read: Played 14, Lost 14, 0 points. And then along came the mighty AC Milan, themselves just a little shaky following last week\u2019s sacking of coach Vincenzo Montella, replaced by 2006 World Cup winner, Rino Gattuso. \nWhen we looked at the fixture list, most of us thought that Gattuso had been gifted an ideal starting place as Milan coach, with an away fixture against Benevento, the club which now holds the Italian all-time record for the worst seasonal start. Surely this feature will get Gattuso off to a good start, no? \nIndeed, as we headed into injury time, that was the way it looked. After an admittedly unconvincing performance, Milan looked ready to wrap up a vital 2-1 away victory. Buoyed by a goal just after half-time and not resigned despite a second Milan goal five minutes later, Benevento poured forward in the final minutes against a defensive Milan, down to ten men in the wake of the 75 th minute sending-off of defender, Alessio Romagnoli. \nAs the stop watch hit 95 minutes, Benevento were awarded a free-kick out on the left, close to the penalty area. From the Benevento bench, someone shouted at goalkeeper Alberto Brignoli to \u201cget up there\u201d for what would probably be Benevento\u2019s last chance. \nThis is a scene that we witness week after week. In a final, all or nothing dramatic gesture, the goalkeeper rushes up to the other end for the injury-time corner kick that might just save the day. Gigi Buffon, in the last seconds of Italy\u2019s World Cup play-off elimination by Sweden last month, is just the latest in a long line of keepers to hurl themselves into the attacking fray. \nIn Buffon\u2019s case, as in most other cases, the gesture was totally in vain; often the keeper gets nowhere near the cross. The difference, though, is that Buffon and friends do not have the witches and wizards on their side. Brignoli took a deep breath, shut his eyes and pulled off what he subsequently called \u201ca goalkeeper\u2019s jump\u201d to score an historic goal that gave Benevento a 2-2 draw and their first point of the season. \nFor 26-year-old Brignoli, making only his ninth appearance in Serie A after a career until now with lower division sides such as Montechiari, Lumezzane and Ternana, this was an unexpected joy, \u201cone that I will one day proudly tell to my grandchildren\u201d. Even at Benevento, Brignoli did not start this season as first-choice goalkeeper, having replaced Slovenian Vid Belec on the eighth day of the season. \nThe man who made that decision, then coach Marci Baroni, was not on the bench on Sunday, having been replaced by Roberto De Zerbi just five weeks back. A journeyman player whose playing career touched many clubs and included two Romanian titles with CFR 1907 Cluj, De Zerbi started off as a youth team player at guess where \u2013 why, Milan, of course. \nDe Zerbi and Benevento, may well have put yet another spanner in the Milan works as the side which reportedly spent more than \u20ac250 million on new players this summer continues to misfire in Serie A. Milan now lie joint 7 th in Serie A after a draw about which Gattuso said that \u201ca knife in the stomach would have been better than that goal\u201d. \nWorse still for the Milan fans is that the consideration that at the end of a significant weekend, it is their city cousins, Internazionale, who now sit atop Serie A following on their 5-0 destruction job of Chievo and following, above all, that 1-0 Juventus win over Napoli on Friday night, knocking the Naples club off the top. (We did suggest that it was a little premature to be writing off the \u201cOld Lady\u201d). \nInter, too, look like a more serious side, week after week. With 18 points more by comparison with the same date last season, having conceded 11 fewer goals and scored 11 more, and all with a largely unchanged squad, you would have to conclude that this season\u2019s new coach, Luciano Spalletti, must be doing something right. \nThe top of Serie A, too, is suddenly looking very competitive, led by Inter on 39 points followed by Napoli on 38, Juventus on 37 and Roma on 34 (but with a game in hand). After the trauma of Italy\u2019s World Cup elimination, are the fans about to be compensated with the most closely contested Serie A title contest in years? \nThat remains to be seen. These are still early days. What is certain, however, is that last weekend\u2019s results have set us up for a mouth-watering \u201cderby d\u2019Italia\u201d in Turin next Saturday night between champions Juventus and leaders Inter. Having last weekend struck a major dent in Napoli\u2019s ambitions, who is to say that the Old Lady will not repeat the trick against Inter? \nInternazionale, however, go into this game with at least one advantage, namely no midweek European fixture. Juventus, in contrast, travel to Athens for an away Champions League tie against Olympiakos on Tuesday night, knowing that to be certain of their place in the second round, they need to win. \nPerhaps, the most fascinating, if obvious sub-plot to this great Juve-Inter drama concerns the two men leading the respective attacks, Argentine rivals Mauro Icardi and Gonzalo Higuain.

Then a second count radically inverted this tendency, putting incumbent Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez as the victor. With protests of fraud, the court decided to suspend the final publication of the results. Both candidates called on their supporters to defend victory on the streets .\nBut in the following days, Nasralla denounced that opposition protests were being infiltrated by outside elements, thus creating an image of a country in chaos. It was the perfect excuse for minister Jorge Ram\u00f3n Hern\u00e1ndez, who took no time in announcing the suspension of constitutional rights on Friday night, for a period of 10 days. However, as constitutional law experts have stressed, this decree could only be approved by the President in a cabinet meeting.\nThe curfew specifically forbids people from going out on the streets between 6PM and 6AM. Soon after the images of the first dead people started circulating on social media. But that is not enough for some people to lose sleep\u2026\nThe long road towards democracy\nAs soon as the Electoral Court announced the vote swing favouring Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, Nasralla announced that the elections were \u201cbeing stolen\u201d and that this time he would not allow it, referring to the 2013 elections in which he also ran, garnering 13% of the vote. Nasralla was then the candidate for the Anti-Corruption party that he had co-founded.\nIn September 2014, the director of the Honduran Institute for Social Security was seized by the police for a theft estimated at 335 million dollars. The government of Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez declared that fighting corruption was to become a priority and signed agreements with several international organisations dedicated to transparency.\nMeanwhile, the period after the 2009 coup has been extremely hard on Hondurans, who have valiantly resisted against the repression and the impunity of state agents. In 2015, the Honduran people marched every week with torches to protest against the dictatorship they faced, but the state carried on assassinating social leaders. The Honduran people have been subjected by the system to extreme violence, but there seem to be no alternative sight, as an opposition movement had yet to be unified.\nIn early July 2017, after months of waiting and only a day before the deadline, the Electoral Court registered the candidacy from the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship. This coalition, coordinated by the ousted former president Manuel Zelaya, rallies multiple political forces around a social and democratic program: transparency and rooting out corruption; an alternative economic system with restructured productive sectors; investment in public services such as education, healthcare and housing; environmental protection, etc.\nIn the elections inside the Anticorruption Party earlier this year, the party did not choose its co-founder Salvador Nasralla as general secretary. Then Nasralla became the candidate for the Opposition Alliance due to his popularity as a former sports journalist.\nAre democracy and impunity compatible?\nIt is important to take into account the difficulty in mobilising voters in a country immersed in extreme, structural violence. Honduras is one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Its murder rate is only comparable to the situation of countries during wars, such as Iraq! In the run-up to the elections there has been an escalation of violence. In the weeks leading to the November 26 poll, activists from both Opposition Alliance and the governing party were attacked.\nThe murder of activist Berta C\u00e1ceres in March 2015 became engraved in the minds of an entire generation. Since then, banners, murals and posters have multiplied to commemorate the courage she showed in her struggle against all odds. The slogan \u201cBerta lives, she has multiplied\u201d has spread beyond the borders of this small country. Berta had become renowned around the world for her role in the struggles of her organisation, COPINH. Her case is far from unique: for years, environmental activists have been harassed and attacked with impunity.\nIn this context, the daughters of C\u00e1ceres, Laura and Bertha Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, quickly moved to the spotlight and denounced the responsibility of Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s government:\nthe oligarchic groups have great influence, they mobilize the army to repress people. We should point out that since the 2009 coup many military people have become shareholders in extractive industry projects (hydroelectric, mining, and others). But the corrupt mafias also allow for the organization of criminal groups that work in coordination with major corporations.\nIn early November, an independent report rattled a lot of cages. Finally the complicity of the state in Berta C\u00e1ceres\u2019 assassination was confirmed, in line with the strong suspicions held by relatives and friends from the very beginning. The report\u2019s authors are adamant:\nAmong the chat exchanges between DESA staff members, the experts could detect that there was permanent contact between the company and state security forces, such as the Seguridad y Polic\u00eda Preventiva. For example, only 14 hours after Berta\u2019s murder, there were messages between DESA managers and staff members revealing that they had asked public officials for help in being shielded from any investigation.\nConsequently Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez had every interest in hiding the incestuous links between the state and multinational corporations. It is no coincidence that during his term the security budget was increased and special military forces were created. The $17.3 million provided in security aid by the United States seem to pose no problem to our democracies.\nBut the plot thickens: the president of the Constitutional Court, David Matamoros, is a relative of Dennis Matamoros Batson, a legal counsel of a company that provides services for DESA, the company accused of playing a role in the assassination of Berta C\u00e1ceres.\nOne of the things at stake in the current Honduran elections is to get rid, once and for all, of this culture of political impunity.\nVenezuela, an ever present scarecrow in elections all over the world\nThe media campaign for the Honduran elections was another opportunity to attack Venezuela. The Spanish CNN channel posed the crucial question of our time to Nasralla: \u201cWhat is your position concerning Venezuela?\u201d. And he responded \u201cthe Venezuelan problems should be solved by Venezuelans, just like Honduran problems should be solved by Hondurans\u201d \u2026 and adding that should Venezuela sell oil at low prices Honduras would not complain\u2026\nTo prove Venezuelan interference in the electoral process, secretary of the right-wing National Party Juan Diego Zelaya showed in the same program a photo of Manuel Zelaya, now coordinator of the Opposition Alliance, in a car next to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. But he did not mention the context of said photo, which is almost 10 years old! After the coup against Zelaya in 2009, Maduro was one of the few Latin American foreign ministers who committed personally to taking Zelaya to the Honduran border and risking his life to defend democracy in Honduras. But this is about taking advantage of the media propaganda of him being a dictator to demonise the Opposition Alliance\u2026\nFor the dominant ideology, raising the Venezuelan scarecrow is a tactic to draw attention away from the shortcomings of governments that embrace economic policies that hinge on the almighty \u201cfree market\u201d. Cultivating amnesia and distorting the historical examples of social achievements that challenge powerful elites is a tried and tested propaganda technique, which in this case has the virtue of ignoring the needs of the Honduran population! The most surreal moment happened when the government of Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez expelled the Venezuelan band Los Guaragaos, who were going to play at an opposition rally. Has Latin American folk music become a weapon of mass destruction against elites in power? (1)\nThe lesson of the Honduran people\nThe Opposition Alliance had demanded total transparency in the special tallying process announced by the Electoral Court, and sent a letter detailing 11 necessary conditions for them to accept the result. But the Court did not respect these conditions, and the Alliance has called on people to defy the curfew and defend the victory stolen via electoral fraud. Nasralla has pointed the finger at president Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez and Electoral Court president David Matamoros as the ones responsible for the situation.\nIt is true that elections are just a single moment in people\u2019s lives. But in Central America, where institutions have done nothing to defend quality public services, representatives have destroyed whatever was left by raiding social security funds, there are crucial matters at stake. People would have plenty of reasons to adhere to fatalist ideas of \u201call politicians are the same\u201d. If we add to this the trivialisation of violence and judicial impunity, we would believe that nothing could be done. But this is a vision that underestimates people.\nHistory has shown, in contrast, that resistance is necessary and inevitable. The day after the 2009 coup, in spite of their suffering, the Honduran people did not sit idly by. First it created a Resistance Front against the coup government. Then it focused efforts in the struggle against corruption and continuity, especially since Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez bypassed the law to run for re-election, something that is illegal under the current Constitution. Finally, it is equally important to emphasise that these movements have understood that struggles, in order to be effective, also should bring about a change of government, even if that is not the final goal. As such, they have formed an Opposition Alliance to take on the current political opponent, and not shying away from openly describing the government of Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez as a dictatorship.\nFrom Saturday, December 3rd, to Sunday, Hondurans again protested against electoral fraud, the curfew and repression by banging pots and pans . In this context, the announcement of new results by an Electoral Court which is suspected of colluding with the government offers no prospects of exiting this deep political and institutional crisis. Only adhering to the conditions demanded by the main opposition party and putting a stop to repression will do.\nIn light of the challenges posed by Honduran events, the reactions from international bodies such as the OAS (whose president Almagro is obsessed exclusively with Venezuela) and the media have been timid or non-existent. This shows that the big powers are more than comfortable with failed states so long as they help advance their geopolitical interests.\nThe Honduran people are providing a brave lesson of hope for the oppressed peoples of the world.

jumping for joy now their village has a play area that caters for children of all ages. \nNew fitness equipment has been installed at Wootton Wawen CofE Primary School, thanks to funding provided as part of the new affordable housing development which is currently underway in the village. \nAs the planning agreement states that the development must make a positive contribution to the local area and community, nearly \u00a310,000 was given to Stratford-on-Avon District Council to be used for village play equipment. \nWootton Wawen Parish Council approached the school to see if the new equipment could be sited there and the school were delighted to accept the grant. \nNow four pieces of fitness equipment, including a cross-trainer and stepper, have been installed in the playground. \nMarion Jones, headteacher at the primary school, said: \u201cEncouraging pupils to stay fit and healthy is something close to my heart. It\u2019s really nice to see that when parents come and meet and chat after school, they can now have a go on the fitness equipment, as well as their children. \n\u201cPupils are really enjoying playing on the equipment at lunchtimes and the playground has been become a real focal point for the whole community after school and during weekends and school holidays.\u201d \nWarwickshire Rural Housing Association in partnership with Waterloo Housing Group and developer, Bouygues UK, is building Warwickshire\u2019s first Passivhaus affordable housing development in Wootton Wawen.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wootton wawen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marion jones", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "warwickshire rural housing association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waterloo housing group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wootton wawen parish council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bouygues uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stratford-on-avon district council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wootton wawen cofe primary school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warwickshire", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wootton wawen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:33.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0802818dc46968c5862787950a6aeafb27c79fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxvxVKWlWFS4Zq3dxuh4X9h_lkCcsMEnSoD8E0vTbNsoRGE08rpi3PABnydsHukhsKKSs7fP2d_5mWKtW4Rwd0wnZ1P2oHixaBhNXZgcpz6lYFUPL1ec62lwnB.nxzVeS0-", "site_full": "forum.kvinneguiden.no", "site": "kvinneguiden.no", "site_section": "http://forum.kvinneguiden.no/forum/294-telletr%C3%A5der-og-ordleker/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Telletr\u00e5der og ordleker - Kvinneguiden Forum", "title": "Skriv et nytt ord fra siste bokstaven i ordet over. 323", "title_full": "Skriv et nytt ord fra siste bokstaven i ordet over. - Page 323 - Telletr\u00e5der og ordleker - Kvinneguiden Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T15:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NO", "spam_score": 0.157, "main_image": "http://forum.kvinneguiden.no/uploads/monthly_2017_11/kg_logo.jpg.2cc246c4f2263fe4acd07583e6a83fca.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 42764, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ddf9bf5ff5fa735475e8d326da1784a1f459ba72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxvxVKWlWFS4Zq3dxuh4X9h_lkCcsMEnSoD8E0vTbNsoRGE08rpi3PABnydsHukhsKKSs7fP2d_5mWKtW4Rwd0wnZ1P2oHixaBhNXZgcpz6lYFUPL1ec62lsCb3euKADdcySg2wDytsLDxfZGxAWY18", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "LiseTV", "published": "2017-12-07T09:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "LiseTV 5237 737 LiseTV B-Kjendis Medlem 5237 737 Kj\u00f8nn: Ikke viktig \u00b7 #6447 Posted 9 hours ago Sjokolade", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:33.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b10c032e77052c21aaeea3ec71613e1ca3c60dbb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQAlAVUgO.PqRiTOoRnfyJef61KiDAreXEdVT2A3O0G.dCT5IaRYXd2AgtnTCryeBqIMNOm2MTHAgJbQY1OS15TvrrEJiGU2gjDDMgye.bRg7xgiyMODrA2tW2qc2K67ek-", "site_full": "iampepperlim.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://iampepperlim.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Dear Paprika: I Once Thought Music Came From Satan \u2013 Pepper's World.

It opens with these wonderful words, \u201cThere are five Malay rhythms in the country: joget , inang , zapin , masti , asli . Joget is Portuguese, inang is Indian, zapin is Persian, masri is Arabic, asli is Chinese ( dondang sayang ). Yet they form the traditional music of Malaysia. We are rich, you know.\u201d\nI recall, I was taught that music was from Satan himself. In church, I only listened to church songs. Yet, I was attracted to music from the 50s and 60s. I loved the rhythm of rock and roll but I was discouraged from listening to it. It was the devil\u2019s music, I was told. It was not Godly music. At that time, the church cited evidence from \u201cbackward masking\u201d songs which has since been declared bunkum.\nThe only 50s and 60s music I listened to was Cliff Richard\u2019s. He was well known as a Christian. I own all his albums. Later, I found out that members of U2 were also Christians so I allowed myself to listen to their music. Well, actually, only three members profess to be of the Christian faith \u2013 three out of four ain\u2019t bad.\nI remember a young boy named Solomon Tan who enjoyed rap music. His favourite singers were MC Hammer and Kris Kross. He could even rap and dance like his idols. However, the pastor had proclaimed rap music to be a tool of the devil one Sunday morning so his mother disallowed him from listening to it. He saved up to buy their music albums only to come home one day to find them recorded over with Christian songs! He complained to me and I tried my best to console him. I understood how he felt.\nAs much as I tried to barricade myself from \u201cworldly music\u201d, it drew me in. It was something else. It was something church music was not. It was different. It was better! Elvis, Chuck Berry, The Beatles, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, The Animals, Little Richards, Ricky Nelson and many more called out to me with their songs.\nWhen I started to wane in my Christian faith, I began to explore their music in earnest. Thank goodness for the Internet and Napster, I listened to all the songs I had denied myself. And it was like opening a flood gate! I could not believe all the good music I had missed by heeding the idiot pastor who declared music to be evil!\nMusic is wonderful. It is magical. I personally know several people who were saved by it. One is uncle Khairuddin. He was in his 60s and somewhat depressed because many of his friends had passed away. I invited him to tuk-tuk\u2019s house to join our band, The Penchala Terrace band. He came after I asked him several times. He played the drums in his younger days. We jammed once a week and after a few weeks, he thanked me and told me how our jamming session helped him out of his depressed state.\n\nWhen students go overseas to continue their studies, I always advise them to take along their musical instruments.
