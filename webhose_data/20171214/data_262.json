Most events might over book cause in the past they had some who book and don't turn up but if all turn up well they have to turn people away. As to how many they over book by I don't know.\nAlso Sky don't always have full exclusive to events. One cinema film they shared with the times so it was a mix and don't know how many they both over book by.\nIn my experience with the cinema trips at least to stand a chance of entry you need to turn up early.

The Company\u2019s product, the Argus II System, treats outer retinal degenerations, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The Argus II System provides an artificial form of vision that differs from the vision of people with normal sight. It does not restore normal vision and it does not slow or reverse the progression of the disease. The Company\u2019s Argus II System employs electrical stimulation to bypass degenerated photoreceptor cells and to stimulate remaining viable retinal cells thereby inducing visual perception in blind individuals. The Argus II System works by converting video images captured by a miniature camera housed in a patient\u2019s glasses into a series of small electrical pulses that are transmitted wirelessly to an array of electrodes that are implanted on the surface of the retina.

But she wasn't totally surprised when her son told her his secret.\nAmid tears, she said, \"I knew there was something going on with you.\"\nOmar Mohammed, 31, disclosed in an Associated Press story Thursday that he is the man behind the legendary and widely read Mosul Eye, the pseudonym under which he wrote the catalog of horrors that was life under Islamic State fanatics.\nAfter Mohammed told tens of thousands of Twitter and Facebook followers that he was Mosul Eye, post after post thanked him, blessed him and welcomed him with a single word: Hero.\nAnonymous for more than three years, Mohammed wandered the streets of occupied Mosul by day, chatting with shopkeepers and Islamic State fighters, visiting friends who worked at the hospital, swapping scraps of information. He grew out his hair and his beard and wore the shortened trousers required by the extremists. He forced himself to witness the beheadings and deaths by stoning, so he could hear killers call out the names of the condemned and their supposed crimes.\nBy night, he was Mosul Eye, and from his darkened room he told the world what was happening. If caught, he knew he would be killed.\nBut over three years, his double life grew too heavy to bear. His secrets consumed him, sapping the energy he needed to work on his doctoral dissertation and to help Mosul rebuild. In face-to-face conversations with AP reporters over the course of two months, he agonized over how to end the anonymity.\nThe day he revealed his identity to the world, Mohammed told AP: \"I feel free.\"\nHe received scores of media requests, and on Facebook and Twitter, his fans poured out their feelings.\nTahani Saleh posted on Facebook: \"When death was sweeping over us, you said: We are the life. I am very proud of you, Omar.\"\nBella Oskar, a member of the \"Women of Mosul\" Facebook group, wrote, \"I used to read what you posted on Mosul and your love for it and for its people. The voice of Mosul reached the world by the son of Mosul.\"\nMohammed decided to reveal his identity for his thousands of readers and followers, for all his volunteers in Mosul who have been inspired by a man they have never seen. But above all, he did it in memory of his older brother, who died in the final battle for the Iraqi city, and for his grieving mother.\n\"I can't be anonymous anymore. This is to say that I defeated ISIS . You can see me now, and you can know me now,\" he told AP.\nMohammed first posted about the Islamic State group under his own Facebook account, in the first few days after its fighters swept into the city, but a friend warned him he risked being killed. A newly minted teacher with a reputation for secular ideas, he lost his university job when IS took over.\nOn June 18, 2014, he became Mosul Eye. His motto: Trust no one, document everything.\n\"My job as a historian requires an unbiased approach which I am going to adhere to and keep my personal opinion to myself,\" he wrote on that first day.\nMosul Eye became one of the outside world's main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself.\nMuch of what he collected went on the blog. Other details he kept in his computer, for fear of blowing his cover. Someday, he promised, he would write history with them.\nMohammed's information sometimes included photos of the fighters and commanders, complete with biographies surreptitiously pieced together during the course of his normal life \u2014 that of an out-of-work scholar living at home.\nWhen intelligence agencies made contact with Mosul Eye, he rebuffed them.\n\"I am not a spy or a journalist,\" he would say. \"I tell them this: If you want the information, it's published and it's public for free. Take it.\"\nHis computer hard drive filled with death, filed according to date, cause of death, perpetrator, neighborhood and ethnicity. Accompanying each spreadsheet entry was a separate file with observations from each day.\n\"IS is forcing abortions and tubal ligation surgeries on Yazidi women,\" he wrote in unpublished notes from January 2015. A doctor told him there had been between 50 and 60 forced abortions and a dozen Yazidi girls younger than 15 died of injuries from repeated rapes.\nApril 19, 2015: \"The forensics department received the bodies of 23 IS militants killed in Baiji. They had no shrapnel, no bullets, no explosives and the cause of death does not seem to be explosion. It is like nothing happened to the bodies. A medical source believes they were exposed to poison gas.\"\nJuly 7, 2015: \"43 citizens were executed in different places, this time by gunfire, which is unusual because they were previously beheadings. A source inside IS said that 13 of those who were executed are fighters and they tried to flee.\"\nFinally, he decided it was time to get out. On Dec. 15, 2015, he left with a smuggler whom he paid $1,000. Overnight, Mohammed had transferred the contents of his computer to a hard-drive that he packed with him.\nOnce in Europe, Mosul Eye kept at his mission: via WhatsApp and Viber, from Facebook messages and long conversations with friends and relatives who had contacts within IS.\nBy mid-2016, deaths were piling up faster than he could record. The Islamic State group was on a hunt for traitors and the airstrikes were taking an increasing toll on everyone. His records grew haphazard, and he turned to Twitter to document the atrocities. In February 2017, he received asylum in Europe.\nAfter he posted his name on Facebook, among the dozens of responses one from Safwan al-Madani stood out:\n\"You defied all expectation and speculation about who you are. We waited for so long for this moment.\"\n  Secret scholar who battled Islamic State goes public  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "viber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul eye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omar mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ap photo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tigris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:26.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfcf4e6f3ebdde161694fa00d2de116b4072cbde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl.Zq0O9QZ4xcWyFFbJXXPhc3hJGWkmJT9234a869X2CjF_EZXHRrXDOIWAIl_DwMhVWFbHqzIGjlUtzy.vG1tSwvNmINoDIIELU8639APymrys4F4BAFEJPvrFcZYc7V4w--", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[FFBE] Our first \"real\" bard arrives Friday, with Roy!

DLR is the smallest property that Disney controls, and is completely surrounded by urban development. Also DLR is the most mature resort. so compared to Asia there isn't nearly as much potential for expanding their audience. Click to expand... I've always felt that DL was the resort that had the \"blessing of size.\" What I mean is that because space is limited and resort is landlocked, Disney has had to make the best possible use of every inch of space, creating 2 theme parks absolutely packed with attractions and rides. The parks are right next to each other giving it the perfect \"bubble\" that is walkable.\nIn contrast, WDW is almost the size of San Francisco, yet they have only 1 full theme park and 3 half day parks. The worst part about it is that the resort is poorly designed. You would think that all the parks would be walking distance from each other since they own the land, but we all know that is not the case. They are all spread out so transportation is needed. Most of the land is undeveloped or hotels. Classic attractions have been gutted, such as Snow White Scary Adventures and Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, even though the resort is MASSIVE.\nAt the end of the day, when I find myself getting angry at a decision Disney has made towards the DL resort, I put things in perspective.

Roy being released opens up the bards so that could mean Lunera also gets enhancements since Roy, Lunera, and Ramza are the bards we have/will have I think.\nWeek after that I would assume would be a Christmas themed event with the new Christmas units for the banner.

I guess it depends on what they do for the holidays.\nThe following week I'm assuming we get a re-run of the old Christmas units (like Halloween), and then either King Mog or one-off story (whichever we didn't get before).\nAfter that we're into January so who knows what we may or may not get. I think we'll be due for the Season 2 version (the CG whatever) of the main characters.\nWe do have Fan Fest in LA this weekend, so I'd expect a decent amount of information then as far as sneak peaks.

We're getting story and Roy this week.\nNeeehhh. Is there anything else in the Cloud banner? Cause I couldn't give less of a shit about Cloud and Sephiroth if I tried.\nI'd pull on the Roy thing instead, cause I got no bards, but the other units in the banner seem meh and pulling for a 5* only is suicide.\nOnce again, I arrive to hype William. He's the 4* on the banner (the only one, woohoo) and is an Earth Mage.\nHis TMR is an excellent 40% MAG / 20% DEF with Rod materia.\nHe's got a huge MAG stat for a 4*, and an innate 70% MAG boost (with rod). And he comes with Quake (2.75x 8-hit AoE earth damage, -50% earth imperil, aka Earth Tornado) and Stonja. So like the 5* Barbariccia, two of them can build up chains with Quake and then cap each other with Stonja for big damage. Dual Black Magic innate, and also has Osmose in case you have no MP battery and he runs out of MP.\nYeah, I remember William from the Loren story event. He's in Cloud's banner? The heck?\nGL banner order is all messed up compared to JP right now. But originally, it went Cloud Banner -> Roy with Chloe/Amy with the Roy story event. So William was just a new FFBE unit, who then starred in the following week's story event.\nAs for Conrad's Greatsword; it's (I believe?) BiS weapon for Cloud. Since not only is it a high ATK rating, but it's twohanded (which as mentioned, doesn't matter for doublehand anymore with Cloud/Elfried's TMRs) so it has a larger damage variance and accuracy.\nPersonally, I want it because I want a nice two-handed greatsword to put on Dark Veritas so his Dual Slash can start hitting 100% evasion units in the arena.\nLorek on December 6", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001313969", "http://alabasterslim.com/76561198001313969/steam_sig.png"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:27.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b01032bec924af558532517c3fa56180745957d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ57tlIr26bYFKemoIBXKjJnaQ519ImTgQtwXFVSdnXdRMoJAvH6J1Wpv83HKiKheXPzzLSA.eMQkYib6XYAFf957ftoqvwux1OeL43r3L8eVrvQbNHOKEIT5IDDNVL7QRd.SPD2guOyFXIl6mF691jIGfN80S.nHQWGJXwrXnBHJgC83hr6R9vZMCuhwfkNT3sTIBM5lGIuNcA7CfCXOh_ZPgQNptMQ9n5j9zwHVAoiQ--", "site_full": "dipdiplove5wordpresscom.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://dipdiplove5wordpresscom.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "CASHBETASIA THE TRUSTED ONLINE PROVIDER IN MALAYSIA SATISFY ALL YOU NEED.WE PROVIDE DIFFERENT OF ONLINE HOT GAMES SCR888 \u2013 dipdiplove5wordpresscom", "title": "CASHBETASIA THE TRUSTED ONLINE PROVIDER IN MALAYSIA SATISFY ALL YOU NEED.WE PROVIDE DIFFERENT OF ONLINE HOT GAMES SCR888", "title_full": "CASHBETASIA THE TRUSTED ONLINE PROVIDER IN MALAYSIA SATISFY ALL YOU NEED.WE PROVIDE DIFFERENT OF ONLINE HOT GAMES SCR888", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b01032bec924af558532517c3fa56180745957d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ57tlIr26bYFKemoIBXKjJnaQ519ImTgQtwXFVSdnXdRMoJAvH6J1Wpv83HKiKheXPzzLSA.eMQkYib6XYAFf957ftoqvwux1OeL43r3L8eVrvQbNHOKEIT5IDDNVL7QRd.SPD2guOyFXIl6mF691jIGfN80S.nHQWGJXwrXnBHJgC83hr6R9vZMCuhwfkNT3sTIBM5lGIuNcA7CfCXOh_ZPgQNptMQ9n5j9zwHVAoiQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dipdiplove5", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "CASHBETASIA THE TRUSTED ONLINE PROVIDER IN MALAYSIA SATISFY ALL YOU NEED.WE PROVIDE DIFFERENT OF ONLINE HOT GAMES SCR888", "text": "\nCASHBETASIA365 IS THE MOST TRUSTED ONLINE SITE IN MALAYSIA SCR888 In the event that you like online space diversions with old Egypt topic, at that point you should attempt Pyramid: Quest for Immortality from NetEnt.

And he comes with Quake (2.75x 8-hit AoE earth damage, -50% earth imperil, aka Earth Tornado) and Stonja. So like the 5* Barbariccia, two of them can build up chains with Quake and then cap each other with Stonja for big damage.
