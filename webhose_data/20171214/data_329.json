And no traction with the target. Marketing: Fail. Sales: Fail.\nI want to automate everything possible WITHOUT REPLACING PEOPLE.\nI hear this every day -- I want, my company wants, we want. What is lacking is what the customer wants. You may want something or another, you might decide for the customer a hundred things, There Is No Customer Confirmation. In this scenario you're being 'the mommy' and telling reluctant clients you know what's best. Since that sounds silly in a corporate setting I've termed it a more optimal than thou attitude.\nFrom a marketing and sales standpoint that puts the end to the meeting. Sales is there to force feed your undifferentiated product down the market's throat. You select a demographic not because you developed anything for it, but you have to choose a spot to start shoving it into the market somewhere.\nIt would be a merciful sales guy who told you just this.\nAlso, by understanding the problems of the clients we can offer solutions that maybe the client hadn't thought a computer could handle.\nThe time for this was research, pre development. Which would have identified three to five key demographics to choose from and narrow down. You are now in the \"solution scouring the landscape in search of problems\" business. Very common commodity tech. ... And no customer service department. ... And no tech support department. ...And no training department.\nSo adopting your eventually-we'll-figure-out-the-problem-this-solution-goes-to would be tantamount to ending your chosen demographic's career. As for not firing people, tech is great for expanding the IT staff exponentially. That's a deal killer. Given exposure to humans is nil, it's just as likely a scenario as your hope.\nIn 1993 two authors came out with a book titled Reengineering the Corporation. A smash hit, it became popular for sanctifying mass firings and not doing one thing the authors recommend. (Read an interview where they state just this.) The word they hoped to coin as a synonym for reinvigorating and reinventing industries became a synonym for stupidity in workforce reduction. (Many had to go on a bout of rehiring afterward, mostly because there was not one lick of thought or reengineering involved. Major surge in tech spending. Smart tech using ... not so much. AKA Magical Thinking.)

The trial results were presented today at   Congress 2017 (IDF 2017).[1]\"Millions of people with type 2 diabetes participate in Ramadan every year and we know that periods of prolonged fasting can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia,\" said lead investigator Dr Mohamed Hassanein of the Dubai Hospital, Dubai Health Authority, UAE and chair of the Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance (DAR). \"This highlights the importance of people with type 2 diabetes preparing for Ramadan with their doctor and discussing treatment options for preventing episodes of hypoglycaemia.\"It is estimated that worldwide over 116 million Muslims with diabetes may choose to fast during Ramadan.[2] Muslims with type 2 diabetes who fast during Ramadan have up to a 7.5-fold increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia.[3]\"This trial has shown that Ryzodeg(R) is not only a simple treatment option which can make daily life easier for people with diabetes. Ryzodeg(R) also reduces the risk of potentially dangerous episodes of hypoglycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes who choose to fast during Ramadan,\" said Mads   of Novo Nordisk.The trial was designed to investigate the effects of Ryzodeg(R) on blood sugar control and hypoglycaemia reduction versus BIAsp 30, both at the end of Ramadan and 4 weeks post-Ramadan. There was no difference in overall blood sugar control between Ryzodeg(R) and BIAsp 30.[1]About the trialThe Ramadan trial compared the efficacy and safety of Ryzodeg(R) twice daily and BIAsp 30 (NovoMix(R)) twice daily in subjects with type 2 diabetes before, during and after Ramadan. The trial was a 28-week, international, open-label, randomised, treat-to-target trial involving 263 adults from five countries with large Muslim populations (Algeria, India, Lebanon, Malaysia and South Africa). The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of the month of Ramadan (four-week period). Secondary confirmatory endpoints included rates of blood sugar confirmed, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia.[1]About Ryzodeg(R)Ryzodeg(R) is a combination of two distinct insulin analogues (insulin degludec and insulin aspart in the ratio of 70% and 30%), making it the first combination of a basal insulin with an ultra-long duration of action and a mealtime insulin in one pen for people with type 1 and 2 diabetes.[4]-[6] Ryzodeg(R) incorporates the benefits of the degludec molecule.[7],[8] Ryzodeg(R) is given as an injection once or twice daily with the main meal(s).[4] Ryzodeg(R) offers a simpler regimen with fewer injections than basal and bolus therapy, in one pen.[9]Ryzodeg(R)   December 2012 and European Medicines Agency approval in January 2013. Since then, Ryzodeg(R) has been approved in more than 70 countries, including the US in September 2015.   13 countries.[4]About Novo NordiskNovo   novonordisk.com, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTubeFurther information Katrine Sperling +45 4442 6718 krsp@novonordisk.com \u00c5sa Josefsson +45 3079 7708 aajf@novonordisk.com Investors: Peter Hugreffe Ankersen +45 3075 9085 phak@novonordisk.com Hanna Ogren +45 3079 8519 haoe@novonordisk.com Anders Mikkelsen +45 3079 4461 armk@novonordisk.com Christina Kjaer +45 3079 3009 cnje@novonordisk.com Kasper Veje (US) +1 609 235 8567 kpvj@novonordisk.comReferences1.
