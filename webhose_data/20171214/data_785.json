Romania has a notification from the European Commission to reduce the termination rates, he explained.\nLast week, Grindeanu said that termination rates will decrease in the near future.\nIn October, ANCOM decided to freeze the mobile and fixed termination rates at the 2014 level. The decision was supported by the largest telecom operators on the local market, Orange, Vodafone and Telekom but opposed by local group Digi. Romania\u2019s Competition Council said that ANCOM needed to revise the tariffs, which haven\u2019t been updated in years, and the European Commission started an investigation on this matter.\nTermination rates are essential in determining the final prices with which operators sell communications services.\n[email protected]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "grindeanu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sorin grindeanu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vodafone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "telekom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ancom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "competition council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "romania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:37.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0408f5b6de4702c074d24796e3a6949764047baf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN4M33LvCtDyTZVctZ6xuWzzZ2T.J9XOP2r7xYsN49AFbsDtEdBs3TmdsOJBPgV1Bn0-", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/europe", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com - Europe News", "title": "Heiko Karschti named new CFO at CWS-boco", "title_full": "Heiko Karschti named new CFO at CWS-boco - Worldnews.com", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5594, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0408f5b6de4702c074d24796e3a6949764047baf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN4M33LvCtDyTZVctZ6xuWzzZ2T.J9XOP2r7xYsN49AFbsDtEdBs3TmdsOJBPgV1Bn0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wn.com", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Heiko Karschti named new CFO at CWS-boco", "text": "In Heiko Karschti (50) we see an old acquaintance re-joining the ranks of the Haniel Group : He began his career here in 1994 after completing his degree in economics.

Close Meet the biggest dinosaur ever to walk the Earth Newsweek \nArchaeologists are surprised and excited about the recent discovery of a new dinosaur fossil which reveals that around 70 million years ago a bizarre-looking predator that could swim underwater and walk on land, roamed the Earth. \nThe stunningly well-preserved fossil reveals that the new species of dinosaur , which has been named Halszkaraptor escuilliei, had killer claws similar to the ones velociraptors possessed, had hidden rows of sharp crocodile-like teeth , an elongated swan-like neck and flippers that likely allowed it to have penguin-like underwater swimming skills. \nAn international team of researchers used 3D synchrotron analysis to study the fossil, which revealed that the dinosaur lived in present-day Mongolia during the Cretaceous Period. The swan-necked and flipper-forelimbed dinosaur's versatile features \u2013 it has both bird-like and aquatic features \u2013 have stumped palaeontologists. \n\"The first time I examined the specimen, I even questioned whether it was a genuine fossil,\" Andrea Cau of the Geological Museum Capellini in Bologna said, the ScienceDaily reported. \nNational Geographic cited Cau as saying: \"The fossil was so complete, beautifully preserved, and at the same time so enigmatic and bizarre, with a completely unexpected mix of strange features. It was the most exciting challenge for a paleontologist!\" \nFossil smuggled to Europe \nThe fossil, which was found at Ukhaa Tolgod, had previously been dug up by poachers and smuggled to fossil black markets in Europe, National Geographic reported. \n\"Illicit fossil trade presents a great challenge to modern palaeontology and accounts for a dramatic loss of Mongolian scientific heritage,\" Pascal Godefroit of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels reportedly said. \"Illegally exported from Mongolia, Halszka resided in private collections around the world before it was acquired in 2015 and offered to palaeontologists for study and to prepare its return to Mongolia.\" \nResearchers determined the integrity of the fossil using 3D synchrotron multi-resolution X-ray microtomography, which helped them reconstruct the specimen. \"This technique is currently the most powerful and sensitive method to image internal details without damaging invaluable fossils. \nThe ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) has become the worldwide leader for high quality X-ray imaging of such precious specimens,\" said Paul Tafforeau of the ESRF, according to the ScienceDaily. \"So far, it's the specimen for which the greatest number of experiments were made on a single fossil.\" \n245-million-year-old 'Darth Vader' fossil of creature that lived before dinosaurs has been found \nAccording to Vincent Beyrand of the ESRF, the dinosaur had \"a neurovascular mesh inside its snout that resembles those of modern crocodiles\" which indicated that the prehistoric creature was essentially an aquatic predator. \nThe dinosaur, which is believed to be related to velociraptors, appears to have possessed multiple predatory features, allowing the ancient creature to hunt prey on land and underwater. National Geographic reported that the dinosaur's long swan-like neck likely allowed it to strike unsuspecting prey, while its strong flipper-like limbs likely helped it kick powerfully through water. \n\"When we add up all the [characteristics] it shows that it was an amphibious animal \u2013 it was able to run on land, as we imagine dinosaurs running around, and on top of that it was able to go into water,\" Vincent Fernandez, a palaeontologist at ESRF, told the Guardian. \nThe research describing the features of the newly discovered fossil has been published in the journal Nature . \nApart from revealing previously unknown information about dinosaurs, the new findings also provide hope for palaeontologists conducting research in well-known archaeological sites of discovering similar incredible finds. \n\"Even in very well-known sites, we can still find new animals and show that they have an incredible diversity of forms that we never even expected before. I doubt that we know one percent of one percent that lived in the world,\" the study's co-author Philip Currie, a paleontologist at the University of Alberta, told National Geographic.

I vowed to never again speak of the horrors I found there - an act abided by the rest of my brothers there. \" \u2015Sev explains why there were no records of this battle. \nDespite his links to the rebellion, Sev quickly squashed any issues regarding his loyalty, quickly showing he was the most devoted of the honour guard and gaining the trust of Regret himself. So when rumours from Chi Ceti IV late in the war spoke of a suspected forerunner facility, Sev was deployed to the planet in early 2552 to locate and activate the said installation without any doubts. He took the Pious Inquisitor , along with elements from the Devnum'Plat Combined Legion, which was now led by his good friend and former squadmate Khan 'Devnumee, who granted his request. \nAfter two and a half weeks of searching, the search teams discovered the source of the luminary disturbances - a massive subterranean forerunner facility. The Pious Inquisitor excavated the facility, and Sev's army entered the facility. Though a forerunner site, the surroundings were different compared to those of other facilities - smashed sentinels laid around, fallen bridges, holes which looked like a massive blast created them - created a scene of horror for the Covenant forces. In fact, this was perhaps a warning to stay away. \nPer normal operations, Sev ordered the forerunner facility to be stripped of everything which is valuable - if it can be picked up and carried, it goes straight to the Inquisitor . After more searches with the company, he came across a large armoured door. He ordered the Huragok to unlock the door without defiling the terminal. However, rather than a simple cache of weapons, inside laid a series of terminals and a hologram in the centre - a bridge. Now knowing why it was so small for an installation, he ordered the Inquisitor to move into orbit, and brought in the Huragok to activate the facility. It was only an hour later did everyone realise the mistake he made. \" Holy Light, an unknown darkness is among us, taking our men on the Journey. \" \u2015A Sangheili Minor warns of the mutants. \nUnknown to Sev, teams started to go missing soon after the activation of the warship. It was only after a scream was heard down the hall, along with weapon shots, did the crew team notice the anomaly and prompted him to investigate. What he saw was a number of Unggoy ripped apart... and a large spawn of alien worms . Opening fire immediately, he ordered everyone to evacuate the warship, with the Inquisitor to destroy the dreadnought. Within seconds, his squad was decimated. As he accepted his fate and as the alien collective lunged at him, a pair of Covenant Mgalekgolo appeared, and the collective hesitated long enough for Sev and the Mgalekgolo to burn and kill several of the collective's worms, but it retreated before it could be killed. Retreating to the hangar, they ignored the other attacking mutants. Backed at the hangar and waiting for Phantoms, they fought the mutants off... for a while. His team was flanked just as the phantom arrived, and he watched his loyal Mgalekgolo get absorbed into their foe's collective. The ship (and its 'cargo') met its fate moments later, when the Pious Inquisitor destroyed the holy vessel. \nAfterwards, the combat experience, as well as the toll of so many lives lost, led to Sev passing out. When he awoke, he ordered the memory banks of the incident to be wiped, the relics abandoned and the ship searched - the creatures couldn't have the opportunity to attack the Hierarchs. When Sev returned he reluctantly lied about the event - simply told them there was no such forerunner artifact. Edit \nAfter a few other similar missions raising him to the rank of Honour Guard Ultra, Sev was to face his most famous moment of the war - the destruction of the Human world known as Circumstance. With a combined Covenant Fleet engaged at Reach , the Human Fortress World, Regret sort to demoralise the remaining humans by leading another invasion in the same system. As such, Sev and the other Guardsmen had to escort Regret in combat. The Regret from Mercy and the Solemn Penance engage the defenders of Circumstance. \nTo better protect the Hierarchs, Sev commanded the ORS-class Cruiser Regret from Mercy , and was flying in escort formation for Regret's carrier, the Solemn Penance . They quickly realised the ODP stations, however. While Regret ordered indiscriminate attack orders, Sev attempted a more subtle approach; he activated the ship's cloaking abilities and moved to position himself behind the line. As the cruiser brushed past the stations, a Longsword squadron launched from a ODP - and crashed into the invisible obstacle in front of them. The Regret's shields fluctuated and revealed its location to the enemy. In desperation once again, Sev ordered all power to be redirected from engines and shields to weapon systems, and in an instant the three closest stations and their defending squadrons were obliterated by masses of Plasma Torpedoes, Pulse Lasers and even energy projectors, with further ODPs damaged but not destroyed. One such station was able to fire a slug at the Regret , almost cutting it in half. The station was quickly destroyed by the remaining covenant ships. Ground Action \" While I am ashamed of the role the role I had performed in the Great War, I believe that, had the Great Schism never happened, I would have been remembered for what I accomplished on Circumstance. \" \u2015Sev proudly explains his contributions to the Battle of Circumstance. \nThe Regret from Mercy was rendered almost irreparable by the attack, but Sev's work was not done, however, as Regret sort to lead the ground invasion himself; a risky, but hugely honourable action for a San'Shyuum. With a path cleared, the Penance positioned itself right over the planet's capital city, New London. Using the strategy Sev and the Aile developed, Regret landed directly on one of the largest and important structures in the system; the Inner Colonies High Court of Civil Justice. The guardsmen quickly cleared out the security forces, and while Aile locked down the building, Sev himself captured the high-ranking politicians in the lower tower, assassinating the military commander. He brought them to Regret himself, and Regret interrogated them for any information they had. When Sev confirmed the structure had been secured, the Penance began deploying reinforcements \nThe plan was for three attack groups to be formed, with Attack Group A (Xui'Plaitur Combined Legion), led by Aile, directly engaging the main UNSC Forces and keeping them occupied, while two other groups (using elements from the Ssi-Rvi Legion) attempt to pincer around it, taking seemingly random directions so it becomes almost impossible for the UNSC to pinpoint its destination. The heavy anti-aircraft fire means that only Shadows and other rare troop carriers had to be used - in fact, Attack Group C's only troop transport was an unarmed variant of the scarab. \" When you joined this expedition, you offered your life, your total loyalty, to fight alongside our holy messenger. Now I see the truth; you came here for glory, not for honour. You fight for yourself, not your race. For this, oath-breaker, you mean nothing to me. \" \u2015Sev cuts off the commander's arm. \nSev led Attack Group C, the smaller of the two teams, if only to ensure the group followed. At targets of high value, for example the nearby hospital, he led a small team to cause concern for the UNSC. In the case of the hospital, he bombed the entire thing, killing hundreds of defenceless human refugees. The UNSC followed soon after, arriving too late to save anyone from the massacre. A similar thing happened to the local school they brushed past, except that the convoy commander disobeyed his orders and participated in the attack as well. The UNSC retaliated immediately, dispatching a number of warthogs and Marines. Though they were able to execute the defenders, Sev knew he had to make an example to instil order. He cut the commander's left arm off to show him the punishment of disobeying orders, but spared him. Years later, he would wish that he killed the commander when he had the chance. \nWhen Attack Group C arrived, the other Attack Group never arrived, leaving the Combined Legion starving of reinforcements. Worryingly, the UNSC assault force was winning as well, and the Combined Legion was almost decimated. Despite his best ideas, he believed that the only way to prevent the unit's destruction was to charge straight towards the group. He ordered the Scarab to deploy the lances, and he led his army right into the enemy formation. The sudden assault from behind put the UNSC forces on the back foot, though the distance was enough to kill multiple Covenant lances before the battle was fully joined. The appearance of another scarab in Attack Group B was enough to break the concentration of the marines. Sev engaged the ODSTs, his swift combat skills and close-combat specialties quickly killing member after member, even taking out a scorpion with some assistance. The UNSC troops were thinning out and being displaced, and victory was almost assured. However, running through the balconies and over the defence wall were a small group of human soldiers. Worrying about his Hierarch, he moved to deal with the intruders, stealing a ghost and following the intruders. \" Your kind are pathetic, weak, defiling yourselves with the corruption offered by your Associated Spirits . All these are vast crimes in the name of our gods; I should kill you where you lay. However, long have I wished to duel your kind. So I'll let the god's decide your fate - by a duel. \" \u2015Sev offers a duel with Domanic-G175. \nThe soldiers set camp on the detention tower, before all except one leaving and running into the destroyed entrance to the building, where inside Regret was about to lead his forces. Just as the soldiers engaged Regret's Honour Guardsmen, Sev climbed to the top of the tower, where he realised it wasn't any old soldier - it was a Demon sniper, Domanic-G147. Domanic only realised the guardsmen was there when Sev cut his rifle in half. He was unexpectedly thrown a spare energy sword, and was challenged to a duel. \nThe combat styles could not have been more different. Because both of Domanic's helmet and specialty as a sniper, he had a very forceful, heavy-handed stance and attack. Sev, meanwhile, was both swift and strong, choosing quick and deliberate strikes, and used quick footwork as well. Thus, Domanic was slowly losing, until a forced strike gave Sev an opening and stabbed his sides, and cut his hand off to stop him from grabbing his pistol. As he used prepared to kill Domanic, saying a silent prayer, he was almost tackled by yet another demon; Gary-B341. He tackled again, and quickly pushed him to the ground and gained mount. Now knowing this new opponent was a master at close combat, Sev grabbed the God's Word and blasted him with numerous plasma bolts, blinding him for a second and getting off. Gary changed tactics, and began using knife fighting to get close, before stabbing the Sangheili's hand and dropping his rifle in pain. Resisting the pain, Sev grabbed the opponent's arm and broke it. The demon wasn't done yet, and tackled Sev back to the ground and keeping him there for Domanic to kill him. At the last second, 'Bright-Eyes' used his superior strength and rolled Gary into Domanic. Gary recovered quickly, and did a number of successful stabbings until, on the verge of victory, he spun Sev around and showed him that Regret has been captured. Predicting his opponent would thrash around randomly, he was surprised when Sev yet again blinded him with the Plasma Rifle. Sev wasted no time, and used the Word's dual energy daggers to aggressively kill the experienced foe. He then threw the badly-injured Domanic off the balcony in an attempt to kill him. Using Regret's flagship, the Solemn Penance , Sev personally glassed Circumstance. \nDespite his grave wounds, Sev's devotion to Regret allowed him to proceed to gather all the remaining troops, and charged to save Regret. Sev was fully aware that the Demons would attempt to kill Regret at any time, so he was surprised when the Spartan leader didn't even attempt the action despite his claims. While all the other Sangheili forces hesitated, Sev did not, and desperately tackled him. The other Demons threw him off, but before Sev could die the rest of the Covenant opened fire on them, driving them off. For his efforts for saving Regret, he offered Sev a unique reward; he could use the Penance to glass both the major population centres and the glyph for 'Faith' onto the planet. Before the Great Schism, Sev considered this his proudest moment in his entire life. Cleansing of Tau Ceti Edit \nThe destruction of Humanity's fortress worlds at Epsilon Eridiani was immediately followed by a stepped up military operation to locate and destroy their remaining nearby colony worlds. This operation was endorsed and promoted by none other than Regret, having believed that their homeworld was at Reach. Though escorted by a skeletal fleet designed to breach the orbital defences that characterised UNSC fortress worlds, Sev's military fleet would find none of that at Tau Ceti III; only a small population of independent rebels under the impression that the Covenant was a myth. \nThe Regret from Mercy led the charge on the single unidentified freighter-type vessel which stood between the fleet and planetary control. Before any shots were fired, a young recruit at the communications station warned him that intercepted communications came back confirmed of a human name - Furmirole. The knowledge that the ship was jumping to a fallen colony meant it was one of two things: that the captain already knew it was glassed and was jumping at a rally point for a major counter-attack, or that he was violating the Cole Protocol and was unaware of its fate. Either way, the answers could only be retrieved from its databanks, so Sev ordered carefully-aimed Energy Projector strikes on its engines. Though the initial strike only destroyed the starboard aft propulsion array, it nevertheless slowed it down sufficiently for the spirits to keep pace and eventually disembark its contents at key points on the hull. Sev led a strike force from the primary hangar to shut down its remaining engines and disconnect its FTL drive. Against undisciplined crewmen and underpowered rifles, it was a massacre, so much that all it took was a minute from leaving the Spirit that he already severed the AI core and disable the fuel lines to the engines. Within five minutes, they left, having already acquired its navigation and backup data banks. \nBefore he could return, the standing-in Fleetmaster had informed Sev that a concentration of humans in the upper hemisphere, so Sev ordered the strike teams still heading towards the fleet to change course to the human population. An overhead sweep quickly revealed that though the walls were thin, they were extremely tall and composed of starship plating, making them invulnerable to small arms fire. While waiting for a small vehicle squad to arrive, the deployed ranger teams including his collected and tested the defences of the wall. Using the intel gathered, Sev reluctantly volunteered his group to use the Revenants and a single wraith to fire on the heavily fortified gate to distract the humans from the other infantry teams from the North and North East. Strangely, the honour guardsmen did not choose to drive the wraith into combat, instead using a Revenant to strafe and counter the defender's motives. When the assault proved to have no effect, he boosted up a small cliff which the base was built into to jump the walls; something only he succeeded in doing, with his wingman picked off by Gauss fire. In support of the highly mobile rangers, he quickly eliminated the heavy weaponry installed to help clear the skies and secure victory. \nIf the easy victories were supposed to boost his resolve, then he was disappointed to hear that the freighter's navigation data proved to be a fluke; there was nothing on it the Covenant did not already know. The only way it would prove to be of any value was its communication encryption codes, rendered useless due to the fact the war was officially over. What Sev or his command staff did not know was that the data was indeed useful, as it held the other set of coordinates to Humanity's real homeworld, except it was stolen away by a commander who sort favour with the High Prophet of Truth}} and would pave the way for an invasion fleet that was created for that purpose. Feeling as though the entire mission was a failure, he instantly executed the commander who told him this and glassed the base off the face of the planet. Edit \" Do not believe the lies that spill out from the jaws of your dictator. He was once an arbiter, but was craving and kicked off the Great Schism just so he could become on top of us. He collaborated with enemies of the Covenant to turn us from the loyal defenders of the Prophets themselves, into animals killing each other for looking the other way - why else would he adopt a disgraced Guardsmen marked for death as his bodyguard, anyway? \" \u2015A post-war rebel preaches that the Great Schism was the result of Sev's failure to protect Regret. \nNot long after the battle, Sev was recalled in secret to retrain the Solemn Penance's weapon crews - a cover in which he was to secure an artifact unlike any other which have been discovered before, though no-one else expanded on that. During those preparations, Regret gave Sev his blessing for challenging Aile 'Voxyanhulee for the mantle of leadership in a traditional Sword Duel. In the early minutes, Sev's largely offensive movement was countered by the heavy hitting defensive tactics of Aile, forcing him to change to a more ranged attack pattern. However, Aile's age and desperation proved to be his undoing, and Sev decapitated his late superior and took the even more elaborate helmet of his foe. Before he could fully carry out his duties as \"Pinnacle of the Dreadnaught\", or Honour Guardsmen Commander, he took part in the Invasion of Mombasa before discovering the jewel of the entire Covenant religion - Halo Installation 05 , only tainted by humans when one of their ships tailed the Penance to the Halo. \nSev planned the occupation of the Ring. To better defend Regret, during the Battle of Delta Halo he lead a majority of Covenant forces to utterly crush the main human advance. Intercepted communications told him that the UNSC planned to create two strike teams, one of which consisted of heavy ordnance and artillery. He determined to lead his forces against the larger, better-armoured UNSC strike force at a beach which, if captured, gave them significant control of the overall battle. Against shipmaster's advice, he did not include huge numbers of Wraiths and Spectres in his complement, instead either putting them in the line of the other strike force or other locations which are optimal for even smaller teams. Instead, he included mostly-infantry advance to stop them, using the heavy overgrowth, cliffs and narrow entrance to the most. \nThe initial UNSC assault was a scouting platoon of Marines, who were decimated by a solitary wraith. They were then followed by three Scorpion tanks to take it out and clear the way. Instead of springing his trap, Sev order his Spec-Ops specialists to sabotage the scorpions while he, a small lance and the wraith distracted them. The infantry hid in the singular trench, who were (mostly) safe from Scorpion rounds. The scorpions were quickly destroyed and formed a barricade which prevented anything larger than Warthogs from entering. The UNSC chose to attack en masse, sending several warthogs and supporting Marines. All but two Warthogs jumped the scorpions and the trench, and Sev was left to deal with the large Marine attack. Before he could call in the ambush, they themselves were flanked by Marines who sort to use the same advantage. Here, Sev and his lance had to fight in and around the lance against overwhelming odds and began to take significant casualties. Though a priority target for the Marines, Sev proved to be a difficult target and wiped out entire squads in his bid to survive. \nIt was around when Marine forces were on the edge of being exhausted that a single tank that Sev never encountered before - an aging Cobra. It blew through the Scorpion barricade and moved on, ignoring the lone badly-injured Sangheili which remained. He boarded it and, after realising none of his weapons could breach its armour, destroyed the turret's targeting periscope to blind the gunners, leaving it vulnerable to the Wraiths on the edge of the beach. Well aware the remaining survivors were on the verge of being overrun or killed off, Sev made the seemingly ill-considered order for the remaining troops to charge on UNSC positions and strike at their source - the UNSC staging area at the landing craft . \nHad Sev enacted on this desperate gamble, it would have surely killed all Covenant forces. By a stroke of luck, Sev was informed that the other strike team had reached the temple Regret used as his base of operations. As soon as he learnt the Heretic Demon , even worse than the ones he fought on Circumstance, was in the other force, he ordered all forces to fall back to Regret's location. While all other forces ignored his command due to the Solemn Penance's Shipmaster overriding them with a retreat order, Sev tried to return as quickly as he could. The closest he got was just over a hundred metres from the temple, where the pilots pulled off to evade the incoming orbital fire for the temple. Punishment and Escape Edit Sev : \" My oath has been reduced to mere dust. My sword; tainted by false salvation. My life, sentenced to my teacher, a waste of complete potential. The false saviours took my place among the Gods. No longer am I worthy of service; my fate has abandoned me. \" Zule : \" I did not come all this way, kill uncountable numbers of loyalists, to watch my old friend die before me. \" \u2015Zule attempts to subdue Sev. \nFor his failure to protect both the holy temple and Regret, Sev was branded a traitor without trial, stripped of his rank and status name, and sentenced to die. He awaited execution, which was to-be one of the largest executions in Covenant history, with Thel 'Vadam failure of Installation 04 traded to become the new Arbiter . He was allowed to keep his God's Word plasma rifle in the cell, reduced to only two shots to allow him to kill himself from the grief - a final act of cowardice. After a few days, and becoming convinced that there was no way to redeem his honour, his Jiralhanae captors were overwhelmed by a small band of Sangheili led by his wife Falia and Zule. Sev was taken by the so-called 'honour sickness', where he believed the only way to redeem himself was to commit suicide and be deleted from all records. He rebelled against his friends to commit the act, saved when Zule knocked him out. \nHe woke up days later on a Phantom Gunship to mocking, yet non-serious, Sangheili guards. He was quickly told that Zule desperately loaded him on the phantom to save him even despite the protests, and an offer to join the Swords of Sangheili in the Fleet of Retribution . He was also quickly told of the situation, including that Truth deliberately stalled the fleet to allow not only Regret to die, but also the High Prophet of Mercy. Zule himself told Sev the hardest truths - Fal was publicly executed while Sev was in detention, while Falia was lost to the Flood on the way to the ships. With only revenge left, he agreed to enlist more help to the newly-formed Fleet of Retribution. After hearing reports of a Sangheili fleet massing near Malhiem , Sev eventually made contact with the legendary Xytan 'Jar Wattinree of the Combined Fleet of Righteous Purpose - one of his few heroes. Despite the very different political stances of the groups, the Imperial Admiral agreed for a truce to be formed 'until the crisis is over'. Soon after this milestone was made, contact was lost with the entire fleet soon after due to a massive explosion, ending any hope of gaining a formidable force to oppose the Loyalists. Edit Rtas 'Vadam : \" I have heard of you. I hope you have realised what you have actually done. My people, our species are threatened with extinction because you let one of our Prophets perish. You punish my brethren merely because they disobeyed you, and here in my face, you demand a ship of your own? Why should I grant your request, when I should execute you here and now for all those you have wronged? \" Sev : \" Fleetmaster, you and I know we are on a time limit here. The Usurper seeks to fire the holy rings, and you have only a small fleet of ships and even less experienced shipmasters to oppose him. I will hate it, and so will you, but in this race for time, we need everyone we have to take up arms against the Usurper. \" \u2015Sev argues why he needs a ship. Sangheili Civil War Edit \nWhen Sev returned to Sanghelios, he never realised he would be so hated. On the path to redemption, many rebellious cult leaders who sort to contest Thel 'Vadam's government used the fact that he recruited a disgraced 'failure' to serve as his bodyguard. This wasn't helped well by the whispers that he joined the Regret's guard just to assassinate the Prophet, forcibly triggering the Great Schism. In many attempts to stop this view, he underwent many diplomatic duties to attempt to gain trust with the Kaidons and their keeps. Unfortunately, one of these was the Ontom Keep diplomatic meeting - in that mission, the tension generated by the envoy was manipulated by ONI to spark off the Sangheili Civil War. \nStill wondering about the promise of faith which was offered by the local cult, the Servants of the Abiding Truth , as well as an eerily and suspicious vibe generated by their converts, Sev ordered his envoy to return to Vadam State to report of the failure of the missionaries. Unofficially, he disguised himself as a senior Shipmaster to gain access to the cult. Over the course of a month, Sev witnessed the increased aggression of zealot Avu Med 'Telcam , but couldn't verify if he posed a threat or not, due to shaky level of trust between the two. Eventually, Telcam openly announced his plans and armament, prompting Sev to warn Thel 'Vadam. Telcam fully anticipated this, and led an execution squad to capture Sev in the middle of his transmission, and was being interrogated for information on Vadam Keep's defenses and potential recruits to the cult - though Sev's long life and experience meant he was a very tough to crack. He was later saved after a Jiralhanae rebellion freed Sev from his cage, allowing him to flee back to Vadam. Siege of Vadam Edit \" I hated ship-to-ship combat because it meant that, unless you were a gunner, pilot or shipmaster, you could do nothing to help yourself survive the engagement, or be forever branded a traitor and coward for your sins. That is how I felt when I overlooked the Keep's tall walls, knowing that no matter what I do, I was as helpless as the civilians to turn the tide to our favour. \" \u2015Sev remembers the Siege of Vadam. \nSev only narrowly made it back to Vadam before Telcam's forces attacked the Keep. He made a hasty and unfortunately attempt to prepare a defensive strategy before the rebels arrived. However, his tactics were aimed at conventional war, not rebellion. As a result, he was fearfully surprised when even before Telcam's forces arrived, he witnessed guards abandoning their post to begin the rebellion earlier. Thus, the lines were already breached before he even arrived. Thel's speech to unite the defenders, however, did improve the morale of the troops. However, he argued and encouraged Thel to lead his soldiers so they can turn the tide of the battle. Thel remained reluctant, however, and to Sev's frustration, he had to remain silent outside the chambers. \nTelcam's Sangheili did eventually reach the chambers, but this was a mere handful of the hundreds sent to claim Vadam. Of these few, only one or two had the experience to give Sev any trouble, as the majority were dissatisfied youths who had yet to experience real combat. After this direct attack and the knowledge that the Keep was overrun, something snapped in Thel's head and now sort to lead his people against the insurrection, and finally Sev saw action. Thel moved quickly, leaving Sev behind. The duo, along with the remains of the Swords of Sanghelios' military forces, slowly managed to free the Keep from Telcam's forces, only for the destroyer Defender of Faith to appear. After listening to the Zealot's taunts and demands, Thel unexpectedly fired upon the Defender with a Fuel Rod Gun - a fruitless effort to confirm Vadam's response to them. Soon after, to Sev's surprise, the destroyer took heavy fire and exploded mid-air, and a large projectile destroyed a majority of Telcams forces and the coastline. Thel revealed he struck a deal with the UNSC for reinforcements, saving their lives but losing much of their military hardware. Founding of the Sangheili Council Edit \nSev's failed tactics and strategy meant he was punished severely and stripped of his bodyguard status, but he was patient. He participated in numerous small-scaled anti-terrorist movements on Sanghelios, and by 2558, he rose rather quickly back to not only the rank of Field Master, but also becoming a skilled politician in the Swords of Sanghelios as representative of the Swords of Sanghelios general military. He may not have been much-liked by the more manipulative and political-minded, or trusted thanks to the seemingly randomness of his outbursts, but his arguments were hard to shut down or oppose, and was a skilled researcher to counter possible rebuttals. The founding of the Honour Guardsmen and their subordinates, the creation of the Council of Concerns for less-important matters and of course the foundations for what would later become the Sangheili Council were all his handiwork. In the latter case, he proposed a number of possible selection criteria for future High House representatives, divided house structure and the rules behind the Lower House overruling the Upper House. He was, however, a vocal opponent of the study and development of cybernetic enhancements for soldiers, originating due to his own stance on the subject. \nAfter the Storm Covenant was disbanded, a former Storm missionary came to Sanghelios to set up a cult near Vadam in the midst of the civil war. He would have been removed or killed, had a Councillor not visited him and joined the cult. Though originally joining as a spy, Sev discovered he began to draw deeper and deeper into the cult. The missionary taught him the basis of their religion, with a warrior-god promoting action and honour while his wife preached intelligent responses and calm decisions in the worst stages of her believer's lives. The more he became involved, the more he found himself following and believing in what the missionary preached, especially due to the appearance of their god a year earlier. He became quite a zealot for he, though not to the extreme as during his time in the Honour Guardsmen, and this religion served as a conditioner which helped him come to terms with his past, thus giving his mind the space to be if slightly more stable.

Well, you gotta read what Shahid Kapoor has to say about it as the actor says being a star wife isn't an easy job. \nWhile talking to Film Companion, Shahid Kapoor revealed why he told Mira Rajput that she needs a security personnel with her when she goes out, especially with daughter Misha Kapoor. When Shahid Suggested Mira To Take A Security Personnel \nHe said, \"It was very normal with Mira and I am sure there were things that came along stardom which were difficult for her. Like for the first few times, I used to tell her that you should take a security personnel with you.\" Here's What Mira Faced As A Star Wife \n\"And she was like why and after good five or six times, she was like Shahid, people are randomly walking up to me and touching me and all. I was like now you know why?\" It's A Professional Hazard, Says Shahid \n\"When she took the security person with her, the next day the headline was 'Why Mira needs a security personnel? She is No Star? But that comes with profession I am in and it's a professional hazard. \nOur biggest concern is Misha as we want to give her a normal life and she will always be. I will always ask this question to myself that I have burdened her because of who I am.\" Shahid Recalls His Courtship Period With Mira \n\"I remember when I was getting married, I was shooting for Udta Punjab in Amritsar and she was in Delhi living with her parents. It was just a forty-minute flight and we were at that stage we were getting to know each other.\" When Shahid Refused To Meet Mira \n\"She said should I come see you and I said no for the first 10 days I don't want you to come and she at that time was so thrown off because she was like what kind of a guy are you.\" \n\"She said we are getting to know each other and we're supposed to get married and you're telling the girl you're thinking about getting married to not to come what does that mean.\" \n\"I was like you know I can't explain this to you but I hope some day you will understand why I need this space because it's one of the most difficult characters in my life and I don't want any distraction.\" When Mira Watched Udta Punjab & Was Left Shell-shocked \n\"When I showed her the film, by that time we were married and it was a small edit room where we saw the film. I was very nervous about my performance and when the interval happened, I looked and there was a distance of 10 feet between me and Mira.\" Udta Punjab Left Quite An Impression On Mira Rajput \n\"She got up and she said I don't think I know you because who's that guy and if you're that guy I don't want to marry you. \n\"She was actually so thrown off when she saw that for the first time that I could feel that whenever we were at home even if I would come close to her, she would give me that energy of just keep your distance,\" said Shahid.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mira rajput told shahid kapoor", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shahid kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mira rajput", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shahid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "misha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "misha kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mira", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mira watched udta punjab & was left", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "udta punjab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amritsar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:39.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0bd6868709c90a7fb29796629593eaa047a58228", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGSBRBOAX1PnfVRae24EI5COO1994S5.Mcj", "site_full": "www.pistonheads.com", "site": "pistonheads.com", "site_section": "http://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/forum.asp?h=0&f=23", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_cars", "vehicles", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "General Gassing - Page 1 - PistonHeads ", "title": "Are these Vloggers just a scam?

It's common for many parents -- T.Rowe Price found 69 percent of those surveyed have at least some level of reluctance to talk with their kids about finances. And parents who have a lot of credit card debt or who've gone through bankruptcy were more likely to say it made them feel extremely uncomfortable.\nTaking stock Even if you've made money mistakes in the past or aren't sure if your own financial habits are top notch, having regular conversations with a child about money can help set her up for a stronger financial future.\n\"A few things we found in the surveys over the years is that money conversations should be frequent, and they don't have to be earth shattering. It can be comparing prices in a store or calculating a tip at a restaurant. Those are all good ways to involve your kids in the conversations about money,\" Roger Young, CFP at T.Rowe Price said in an interview with CBS MoneyWatch. \"We've definitely found that even when parents have some negatives in their past, if they talk about it, the kids have better outcomes\"\nStart early Many experts suggest talking with kids about money as early as kindergarten, making sure to keep the conversations age-specific. For a younger child, introduce the concept of money, maybe with a piggy bank or explaining the value of bills and coins. Make a plan for subjects you would like to tackle. Unsure of what's age-appropriate? Checking jumpstart.org's list of national standards for children's financial literacy can help you make a plan.\nJennifer Harper, director at Common Sense Financial Literacy, suggests starting with tools like spend/save/give jars -- a Pinterest sensation -- to help very young children learn about the different roles of money. \"Money can have different jobs, money can do different things depending on what you tell it to do. These allow the child to have control of what they want. Instead of having a last-minute impulse buy, you can say, \"do you want this bad enough to take money out of the spend jar?'\"\nOne way to start the conversation is to open the floor so your children can ask you questions about money. That way it doesn't feel like a lecture.\n\"It's sharing the good and the bad. Say 'because we saved, we are able to go on this vacation.' Or 'because we planned, we can buy you this for Christmas, and we are excited about it,'\" Harper said.\nLeveling up money talks For older children, look for teachable moments. If you're at a grocery store, take a few minutes to explain your shopping list and budget, or why you're buying something on sale this week but may not next week as a way to show how to live within your means.\nShopping for the holidays? A gift card can be a great way to help kids learn about making smart spending decisions because it has a limited amount that can be spent. Have your child make a list of things to buy with the card. If coupons are available, help them do the math to figure out how much they can save.\nThe digital age means many transactions, like depositing checks or paying credit card bills, are done online, or mobile payment systems and debit cards are used to pay at stores instead of cash. Discuss how you pay your credit card bill or explain the process of depositing a check into your bank account.\n\"Spend a little time figuring out what's age appropriate. ... If you're looking at your accounts online, show your child this is what we bought, this is where the charge came in. So they can look at something, and it's part of life,\" Ted Beck, CEO at National Endowment for Financial Education, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You can even give homework assignments: Why don't you look up how a credit card works? How a bank works?\"\nChores are another way kids can begin to learn life skills and manage their own money. As they move toward high school and after-school or summer jobs outside the house, help them open a savings account and set a weekly budget.\nPreparing to leave the nest For many families, paying for college out of pocket isn't an option. It's best to start having conversations with your child about higher education and expectations for tuition early on in high school.\nWill you pay for tuition if they stay in state but can't cover the amount if they go to a private out-of-state school? Are there scholarships or Pell grants they may be able to apply for?\nAlso important is talking about their career goals and being realistic about salary expectations when they graduate .\n\"You probably will make great money through your career, but maybe not out of the gate,\" Harper said, \"Look at what the student loan payment means on your entry-level salary.\"\nIf they decide to take on loans and don't understand how much their monthly payments will be when they graduate, adult children may end up right back where they started -- at home.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www3.troweprice.com/usis/corporate/en/press/t--rowe-price--parents-are-likely-to-pass-down-good-and-bad-fina0.html", "http://www.jumpstart.org/assets/files/2017_NationalStandardsBook.pdf", "https://www.pinterest.com/torthodoxcpress/give-save-spend/?lp=true"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ted beck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer harper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harper", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbs moneywatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "common sense financial literacy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cfp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national endowment for financial education", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pinterest", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:40.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a5513a566b3b6302323e0c93a4fa3f665393fa3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pl2NhdRZH3PbJh70FR765T4ly6JfEssbr", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/b/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/b/ -

PHOTO: REUTERS \nA California state judge has dismissed class action claims accusing Alphabet\u2019s Google of paying female employees less than men and giving them fewer opportunities for promotions. \nSuperior Court Judge Mary Wiss in San Francisco said on Monday the lawsuit was inappropriate because it was brought on behalf of all women who worked for Google in California. She gave the plaintiffs 30 days to file a new complaint on behalf of only those women who faced pay discrimination. \nThe decision comes as Google faces an investigation by the US Department of Labor into sex bias in its pay practices. \nGoogle spokesman Gina Scigliano said the company works \u201cto create a great workplace for everyone.\u201d \n\u201cIf we ever see individual discrepancies or problems, we work to fix them,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \nJames Finberg, a lawyer for the three women who sued Google in September, said he intended to file a new complaint by early January that \u201cmakes clear that Google violates the California Equal Pay Act \u2026 by paying women less than men for substantially equal work in nearly every job classification.\u201d \nThe lawsuit appeared to be the first to make sex bias claims against Google on behalf of a class of women, but was only the latest instance of a major tech company being accused of discriminating against women. \nThe Department of Labor sued Oracle America in January, claiming it paid white men more than women and minorities with similar jobs. \nMicrosoft and Twitter are facing sex bias lawsuits, and Qualcomm last year settled claims for $19.5 million. \nThe plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Google are a former software engineer, a former communications specialist and a former manager who worked in various roles at the Mountain View, California-based company. \nGoogle pulls YouTube from Amazon devices, escalating spat \nThey say in the lawsuit that Google pays women in California less than men who perform similar work, and assigns female workers jobs that are less likely to lead to promotions, in violation of state laws. \nGoogle has denied the claims and says its employment decisions are made by hiring and promotion committees and are vetted to ensure there is no bias. \nOn Monday, Wiss said the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were vague, and that they must show how specific groups of women were affected by Google\u2019s pay policies. \nThe judge also said that two of the three named plaintiffs had not shown that they performed comparable work to men who were allegedly paid more.",
