And in 2016, nuclear power still accounted for 73% of France\u2019s electricity generation. Based on these first observations it is hard to imagine that we may currently be witnessing the early decline and inevitable fall of the almighty nuclear power industry in France, and yet\u2026In recent years, the combination of economic & technological challenges, safety concerns, and the new direction of national energy policies have all contributed to seriously weaken the \u2013 once believed to be unshakeable \u2013 foundations of nuclear power in France. Renewable Energy Institute 16th Nov 2017 read more \u00bb \nFrance has reportedly outlined plans to reduce its reliance on nuclear power \u201cas soon as possible\u201d in a topsy turvy week for the uranium sector. France\u2019s plans come the day after uranium stocks had jumped as major producer Kazatomprom announced production cuts. Junior ecology minister Brune Poirson told an industry conference in France that the country would reduce its share of nuclear energy in the electricity mix as soon as possible, but did not give a target date as the government was drawing up a new PPE (multi-year energy plan), Reuters reported. \u201cThe PPE \u2026 will lay out how we increase the share of renewable energy in our electricity mix and, little by little, reduce the share of nuclear,\u201d Poirson told reporters. Mining Journal 7th Dec 2017 read more \u00bb \nEDF has received permission from France\u2019s Autorit\u00e9 de S\u00fbret\u00e9 Nucl\u00e9aire (ASN) to restart three reactors at the Tricastin power plant after carrying out repairs to a canal embankment. The regulator ordered the temporary shutdown of Tricastin\u2019s reactors on 27 September because of the risks of failure of a 400 metre long portion of the embankment of the Donz\u00e9re-Mondragon canal in the event of an earthquake.

I\u2019m angry. That\u2019s a given. How I take it out? At my job in the boxing room of our gym. I\u2019ve spent over a year trying to harness it, but I wasn\u2019t by myself. Almost every night, like clockwork, he\u2019s there on one side and I\u2019m at the other. He is big, rugged, but handsome. He\u2019s also scary. Silent. Deadly. When I hear the name Bullet, you would think I would have gone running in the other direction. I didn\u2019t. I should. He has a past. He has secrets. Danger. Pain. Sorrow.  Little did I know that it would just bring us closer together. \n\n**FREE on Amazon!** \nGoodreads * Amazon \n\nCursed Frames Scarred Bullet Series #2 \nHe's been there to help through it all. \nEvery touch, every sound, and every breath. \nI was starting to get better. I was starting to live again the way a normal girl should. That is until we graduated college and life got in the way. I didn't think I would see Dem Dabbs again, at least I hoped I would soon, because now I'm falling back. I'm back into my habits. I don't think I'm strong enough, but somehow, I have. I'm living on autopilot... until I get that hope back. I can see him. Will it be the same? Will we pick up where we left off? Will his touch bring me back to normal? Or does he need me more than I need him? \n\nGoodreads * Amazon \n\nDefine Us Scarred Bullet Series #3 \nI\u2019m supposed to be strong. \nUntil I found I was in a relationship I swore I would never be in. \nI didn\u2019t know how trapped I was until Dean Sailer walked into the diner, making me question who I turned into. Dean reeked of overconfidence. He\u2019s sarcastic and thinks he\u2019s funny. The worst part is I find myself smiling when I don\u2019t feel like it. He brought out something inside me that I locked away a long time ago. I wanted nothing to do with him. I wanted to stay contained in my world. When tragedy threatens the life of me and my best friend, he\u2019s the one I find myself relying on. He\u2019s there for me when no one else is. No matter how much I try to resist Dean Sailer, he seems to delve deeper into a place I thought was gone. Can I change?  Or will I be the definition of what I\u2019ve made myself out to be? \n\nGoodreads * Amazon \n\nTenderly Toxic Scarred Bullet Series #4 \nHe showed me what love is really like. \nThey showed me how happiness affects the heart. \nThey showed me that I still have one. And then my violent past comes to rip it out of my chest. Fine, let it. Happiness. Love. I have to leave it behind. Violence. Hate. I have to accept it all over again. Because I will do anything to keep the ones I love safe. Including going back to the cold, toxic soul I once had. \n\n**Releases Dec 1 st !** \nGoodreads * Amazon \n\n\n\nI am a Leo. Born August 10, living on the east coast. I self-published my first novel, PNEUMA, November 2014, and it's hasn't stopped since. \nOne of my biggest problems was having too much to read. Now my newfound problem; having too much to write and not enough hands to type it out. Not enough brains to put the stories together fast enough. Not enough tea or coffee to keep me awake 24/7. \n\nSo, like every normal person, I have to take it one day at a time. \nMy cravings for sweets keep me going, any sort of cakes (especially red velvet), pies, cookies, and ice cream. I have a cat named Bongo-Bongo, who loves to get in my way when I'm trying to work, but is too cute for me to fight him off. And then I have my family, specifically my husband, who puts up with my endless nights, my tapping of the keyboard, my ridiculous imagination, and yet, he always encourages me to believe in myself and follow my dreams. \n\nFacebook * Facebook Fan Page * Twitter * Instagram * Amazon * Goodreads \n\n\nFollow the tour HERE for exclusive excerpts, guest posts and a giveaway! \na Rafflecopter giveaway \n\nThis blog not responsible for giveaway  \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "serena kearney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dean sailer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook * facebook fan page", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:50.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b707e843624f579e8470af9f6cc526d32c866d7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSrqzb1FvfkPFveiQtqdChxEBesIy1ttM_tp1ONQ8IHmw.rlQzXDokdIdGot2D1KmJaabUHGK3jdsLkqLJaoM1BXy9yuKhfd2RriBc44VTBdqxmYuaHIy3xkqq_vRQ0GUTVdTkurJgVAqols5evx6buPezs.qeuNnoQTM0kf3Rwg2W0Il4ENYuPUPAIlVaOuJjWwmmve7MQcQY1V1Cs0cb45ThtZp4r2b2kZ.qXdu.YI3aMInLyS3Z34l2HdQQmFTafZNPHEMXLmjPqIEBIswxm0DDz2TvSP3w-", "site_full": "www.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/user/10801506340960377915/state/com.google/alerts/11721040684694061649", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "tech"], "section_title": "KKC Human Rights Venezuela", "title": "Chinese firm sues Venezuela as crisis tests ally's patience", "title_full": "Chinese firm sues Venezuela as crisis tests ally's patience", "published": "2017-12-07T06:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b707e843624f579e8470af9f6cc526d32c866d7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSrqzb1FvfkPFveiQtqdChxEBesIy1ttM_tp1ONQ8IHmw.rlQzXDokdIdGot2D1KmJaabUHGK3jdsLkqLJaoM1BXy9yuKhfd2RriBc44VTBdqxmYuaHIy3xkqq_vRQ0GUTVdTkurJgVAqols5evx6buPezs.qeuNnoQTM0kf3Rwg2W0Il4ENYuPUPAIlVaOuJjWwmmve7MQcQY1V1Cs0cb45ThtZp4r2b2kZ.qXdu.YI3aMInLyS3Z34l2HdQQmFTafZNPHEMXLmjPqIEBIswxm0DDz2TvSP3w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T06:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Chinese firm sues Venezuela as crisis tests ally's patience", "text": "The National Human Rights Commission on Thursday recommended lawmakers pass a special law to initiate an investigation and also called for the government to sign and ratify a United Nations convention against forced disappearance.

Ty The Government of Japan announced on November 3, 2017 the conferment of The Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star, on Dr. George S.K. Ty, Group Chairman and Founder of Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company (Metrobank), in recognition of his contribution to strengthening the economic relations between Japan and the Philippines. As a major player in the Philippine banking sector, Dr. Ty has been instrumental in forging several cooperation initiatives with not only major financial institutions but also rural banks in Japan, thereby facilitating the entry of more Japanese investments including MSMEs into the Philippine market. Having successfully steered the Metrobank Group and the GT Capital Holdings to greater heights for decades, Dr. Ty also took the lead in launching landmark joint ventures with many Japanese companies in several sectors. In the Philippines, Dr. Ty has also served as Chairman of Metrobank Foundation, Inc., actively engaging in different advocacy programs in the fields of education, visual arts and healthcare. The Government of Japan extends its sincere congratulations to Dr. Ty and his family on this conferment, and hopes that he will continue to take an active role in further strengthening close relations between our two nations.

"text": "SHARE \nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling Wednesday legally requiring television owners to pay for a subscription to NHK is raising new questions about the role and relevance of the public broadcaster, at a time when young people are increasingly watching shows on the internet rather than on television sets. \nIn the first decision of its kind, the top court ruled in favor of NHK in a lawsuit against a Tokyo man who refused to respond to a request to sign a contract in September 2011. \nThe ruling said that contracts should be considered binding following the lawsuit by NHK and the verdict in this case ordering the TV owner to enter a contract. \nWhile the ruling is a boon for NHK\u2019s efforts to make every household and business with a TV pay, Hiroyoshi Sunakawa, a professor at Rikkyo University, said it \u201crisks accelerating (the trend) of young people moving away from receiving broadcasts via TV sets and from NHK.\u201d Sunakawa said more young people around him are using smartphones to watch videos. \nA 2015 opinion poll by the NHK Broadcasting Culture Research Institute found that more than half of younger people \u2014 66 percent of respondents aged between 16 and 19 and 54 percent of those in their 20s \u2014 said they found online video sites more interesting than TV offerings. \nSunakawa said that because \u201cpublic broadcasting is a system built upon public trust,\u201d NHK should consider viewers\u2019 preferences. \n\u201cThe time has come to seriously debate what constitutes public broadcasting that is befitting of the internet age,\u201d he said. \nThe Broadcast Law, which was at issue in the suit, states that any person who has installed equipment capable of receiving NHK broadcasts must conclude a contract. The law, however, does not stipulate that the payment of the so-called broadcast reception fee is an \u201cobligation,\u201d and there is no penalty for not paying the roughly \u00a514,000 ($124) annual fee. \nNHK is primarily funded through the fees, which it says should be paid by all TV owners regardless of nationality and whether or not its programs are watched. But around 10 million households and businesses are believed to be sidestepping payment. \nWhile Wednesday\u2019s ruling officially backed NHK \u2014 which has been struggling with unpaid fees due mainly to people protesting scandals at the broadcaster in 2004 \u2014 it remains uncertain whether the payment obligation can be enforced. \nThe court ruled that the obligation to pay begins when a TV is installed. For the Tokyo man involved in the suit, that would mean 11 years of back payments. \nSome working in sales and marketing at the broadcaster, however, had mixed feelings about the ruling. An NHK employee said that while the decision \u201cmakes it easier to explain\u201d the obligation to viewers, the situation \u201cwould not change at all \u201d \u2014 with people who refuse to pay unlikely to change their stance. \nWhat would have been a \u201cbig change\u201d is if NHK had won its argument that contracts are concluded at the time of the broadcaster\u2019s request, the employee said. NHK argues that contracts should be viewed as concluded when a written request is delivered to a residence or business, and that payment should start from that point. But the court said there must be consent from TV owners for a contract to be considered concluded. \nThe ruling did boost the possibility that contracts from now on will be concluded with TV owners\u2019 consent, said Yoshihiro Oto, a Sophia University professor. \nBut proving the timing of TV ownership, and collecting payments in full, are likely to remain major challenges.

Located in Barangay Cabalawan, the single-detached permanent shelters are part of a total of 100 houses that will be built by the partners for disaster-stricken residents. Funded by BDO Foundation, the project is managed by UN Habitat with the DSWD providing site development support. SHFC, through its community mortgage program, assists the homeowners association by providing affordable financing to secure the lots occupied. The United Architects of the Philippines helped in designing the housing units, making sure that they are resilient, appropriate for the terrain in Cabalawan, Tacloban, and can be expanded incrementally by the recipient families. The typhoon-resilient structures were turned over to the members of the Villa de Tacloban Homeowners Association in ceremonies witnessed by BDO Foundation president Mario Deriquito, BDO Foundation program director Rose Espinosa, UN Habitat country programme manager Christopher Rollo, SHFC president Atty. Arnolfo Ricardo Cabling and HUDCC deputy secretary general Leira Buan. The construction of resettlement homes forms part of BDO Foundation's contribution to UN Habitat's Post-Yolanda Support for Safer Homes and Settlements program. The foundation supports UN Habitat's mission to promote socially and environmentally sustainable human settlements development and the achievement of adequate shelter for all. The initiative is also part of the disaster response advocacy and long-term rehabilitation program of BDO Foundation, the corporate social responsibility arm of BDO Unibank, in provinces severely affected by Typhoon Yolanda. The foundation has supported UN Habitat's projects in Capiz, Iloilo and Leyte through its financial inclusion initiatives. It has also rehabilitated rural health units and constructed school buildings, multi-purpose halls and resettlement homes in Yolanda-hit provinces including Tacloban.

It is also, tragically, undergoing a decline in numbers. To the extent climate change and a degraded environment are responsible, we can be blamed for not heeding the repeated warnings of scientists and others. \nWarnings to humanity are much in the news again as the latest , signed by over 15,000 scientists from 184 countries, appeared in the journal Bioscience not long ago on November 13. But before, much before, there was an earlier one, now a quarter century past. \nThe late Henry Kendall was the winner of a Nobel Prize in physics, a founding member of the Union of Concerned Scientists, and the chairman of its governing board. He spearheaded the effort leading to the 1992 warning signed by 1700 eminent scientists, including then a majority of science Nobel Laureates. It appealed for the help of the world\u2019s peoples, its scientists, religious, industrial and business leaders. \nEarlier still, there was Rachel Carson\u2019s 1962 canary in the coal mine, The Silent Spring, famous for its attack on pesticides like DDT. \nWhile these warnings caution us on the degradation of our planet, there is one area that might be implied but is not specifically mentioned: the negative impact on the quality of our food. Noted first by Irakli Loladze, the relatively new discovery was hypothesized in 2002. \nIn the parts of the world relying on a plant-based diet, people cannot easily compensate for the loss of nutrients. The proven decline of protein, iron and zinc in grains, potatoes and vegetables will inevitably lead to stunted growth, anemia and more disease. \nThis distressing and unhappy prospect is not confined to humans. Bees rely on the goldenrod plant. It flowers late, and the protein in its pollen is vitally important for them to build themselves up to weather the winter. Unfortunately, as scientists have learned, the protein content in goldenrod has suffered a drastic loss of about a third as atmospheric CO2 levels have increased. There may be other causes like pesticides and parasitic mites but lack of nutrition has to be a major candidate. \nOn the other side of the world lives the harmless Koala bear. A marsupial, it is truly unique for feeding only on eucalyptus leaves. Most unusually the female has three vaginas, the outer two leading each to a separate uterus while the center passage is for delivery of its young. To complement this anatomy, the male is endowed with a double-pronged penis. \nMany causes are attributed to the serious drop in koala bear numbers, including habitat destruction, road kills, bush fires and loss of genetic fitness due to inbreeding, but also chlamydia. This STD has found a fertile field in its complicated genetic apparatus, aided possibly by weakened immunity. In some places infection rates are as high as 90 percent . Sadly, the little joeys pick it up suckling in their pouch. Moreover, the infection can also leave mothers infertile. \nNow a new threat has been identified leaving them on the brink . The koalas source of all nourishment, the eucalyptus tree, has been affected by increasing CO2 levels. The koalas rely on the mildly toxic leaves for food and water and up to now have been able to tolerate the toxicity \u2014 they sleep up to 20 hours to work it out . But the rise in CO2 has decreased nutrition content leaving them more poisonous. Feeding on these, the koalas are ingesting ever more poison. Worse, the Australian drought, blamed on global warming for its intensity, has left the leaves with reduced moisture content. The stresses have left the koalas dying from kidney failure. \nHow long before they are added to the ever-increasing endangered list? Unless the world really sits up and takes notice, we will be soon adding our pollinator bee friends and, eventually, ourselves to that list. It is what we have in common. \nArshad M.

The justices urged those courts to rule swiftly, but offered no rationale for letting the full ban take effect in the meantime.\nMany legal experts saw it as sign of the high court\u2019s thinking, one that\u2019s likely to color the arguments this week.\n\u201cWe agree a speedy resolution is needed for the sake of our universities, our businesses and most of all, for people marginalized by this unlawful order,\u201d Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said afterward. \u201cWe look forward to the arguments this Wednesday on the merits before the Ninth Circuit.\u201d\nCiting national security concerns, President Donald Trump announced his initial travel ban on citizens of certain Muslim-majority nations in late January, bringing havoc and protests to airports around the country. A federal judge in Seattle soon blocked it, and since then, courts have wrestled with the restrictions anew as the administration has rewritten them.\nThe latest version, announced in September, targets about 150 million potential travelers from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, though it allows for some admissions on a case-by-case basis. It also blocks travel by North Koreans along with some Venezuelan government officials and their families, although those parts of the restrictions are not at issue.\nThe administration said the latest ban is based on assessments of each country\u2019s security situation and their willingness to share information about travelers. But judges in Hawaii and Maryland blocked it to varying degrees just before it was due to take effect in October. The judges found that the ban appears impermissibly discriminatory, has no legitimate national security purpose and violates U.S. immigration law.\nThe lower court rulings \u201cthreaten the ability of this and future Presidents to address national-security threats and advance foreign policy interests,\u201d the Justice Department wrote in its 9th Circuit appeal. Further, the government says, courts don\u2019t have the authority to review the president\u2019s decision to exclude foreigners abroad unless Congress authorizes them to, and Congress has provided no such authorization.\nCritics of Trump\u2019s travel restrictions insist that they make up the Muslim ban he promised during his campaign, and judges have seized on the president\u2019s public statements on Twitter and elsewhere in finding them unconstitutionally discriminatory.\nThis week\u2019s arguments arrive as Trump continues to stoke those anti-Islam sentiments: Just last week, he drew a sharp condemnation from British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s office when he retweeted a string of inflammatory videos from a fringe British political group purporting to show violence being committed by Muslims.\nDespite the Supreme Court\u2019s action Monday, Matt Adams, the legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights project, which has also fought Trump\u2019s travel restrictions in court, said he\u2019s hopeful it will be struck down.\n\u201cI\u2019m still optimistic the courts are going to say yes, this is version 3.0, and they might have painted it a little fancier, but it\u2019s still the Muslim ban,\u201d Adams said.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael hawkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard paez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt adams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas chin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald gould", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "4th circuit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ninth u.s. circuit court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northwest immigrant rights project", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ninth circuit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "somalia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richmond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:53.059+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ed5874d426981bf95b8aac4a9ef1fa9c139f2aaa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jf0l0D4zXovHgwSOF7BeuuKCfvL4IP1e3Wcy5RgMDYIPslqLBCwjrNl3_9iEcwKf3bPoAwk1WGh1DPOdB5HEKlrS26Gq6uWBMyPYgMUkRl69Pd7wfDLbf8CFfY3iLQg_JvbTf3NT2JwGA--", "site_full": "customer-care-tollfree-phone-numbers.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://customer-care-tollfree-phone-numbers.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Customer Care Toll Free Phone Numbers", "title": "CVS Headquarters Contact Number USA - CVS Corporate Office - CVS Customer Helpline Phone Number, Email id and Website", "title_full": "CVS Headquarters Contact Number USA - CVS Corporate Office - CVS Customer Helpline Phone Number, Email id and Website", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ed5874d426981bf95b8aac4a9ef1fa9c139f2aaa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jf0l0D4zXovHgwSOF7BeuuKCfvL4IP1e3Wcy5RgMDYIPslqLBCwjrNl3_9iEcwKf3bPoAwk1WGh1DPOdB5HEKlrS26Gq6uWBMyPYgMUkRl69Pd7wfDLbf8CFfY3iLQg_JvbTf3NT2JwGA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gyan War (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "CVS Headquarters Contact Number USA - CVS Corporate Office - CVS Customer Helpline Phone Number, Email id and Website", "text": "CVS Headquarters Address & Office Phone Numbers - CVS is the largest pharmacy and convenience store chain in the United States.

That sentiment varies with race, sex, and current party affiliation, but holds strong majorities in every demographic. \nThere\u2019s nothing particularly new here. In every presidential election, pluralities or majorities say they\u2019re \u201cwilling to vote for\u201d or \u201cinterested in seeing\u201d a third party candidate. In between, pluralities or majorities proclaim the \u201cneed\u201d for a third party. \nThat excites third party activists like me (I\u2019m a long-time Libertarian). But in election after election, the actual voting returns Republicans and Democrats to Congress and the White House. \nWhy? For part of the answer, consider pizza toppings. \nAccording to a 2011 Point of Sale survey by Brian Roemmele, pepperoni accounts for 36% of topping orders. That leaves 64% as a \u201cdifferent topping\u201d market which could presumably out-sell pepperoni. \nBut there\u2019s a problem: Customers don\u2019t agree on what that different topping should be. 14% order sausage, 11% prefer mushrooms, 8% just want cheese. Tomatoes, peppers, and anchovies account for 2% each. 64% of customers want something other than pepperoni on their pizzas. But they don\u2019t want the SAME something. \nThink of the Republicans and Democrats as the pepperoni of politics \u2014 and consider the fact that in politics, when a bunch of people put in their various orders (that is, vote in an election), only the pizza with the most popular topping actually gets made. Everyone else goes hungry. \nMany, maybe most, Americans want a third political party. But some of them want it to be a party of the left and some of the right, while still others want a centrist party or are obsessed with different sides of single issues (like abortion or guns or drugs). \nPlurality or majority support for a generic third party in principle is not the same thing as plurality or majority support for a specific third party in the voting booth. \nIn practice, most voters who say they want a third party end up voting Republican or Democrat, or just not voting. Why? \nPerhaps they can\u2019t find a third party they agree with any more than they agree with the Democrats or Republicans. \nOr maybe they find a third party they like, but fear-mongering supporters of the \u201clesser evil\u201d variety of pepperoni convince them that their preferred party can\u2019t win and that the \u201cgreater evil\u201d pepperoni type absolutely must be defeated. \nOr, as too often happens, the pepperoni lobby makes it difficult or impossible for the restaurant to even put anchovies on the menu. Er, that is, major party legislators pass \u201cballot access\u201d laws to exclude the option of voting for third party candidates. \nIs it impossible for third party candidates to win elections? No. They often do at the local level and occasionally for state legislature or Congress. But it\u2019s a tough row to hoe. \nFor a new party to consistently get into the winner\u2019s circle, voters are going to have to coalesce around something more specific than \u201csomething else.\u201d Hopefully, that something else will be freedom.
