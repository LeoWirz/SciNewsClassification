But our terms with the Marlins are clear.\" \nMarlins CEO Derek Jeter said Tuesday that Miami has not decided whether to trade Stanton, still owed $295 million from his record $325 million, 13-year contract. \nSan Francisco was last in the NL West at 64-98. \nAP Sports Writer Steven Wine in Miami contributed to this report. \nMore MLB baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

By her count, she has been on five plans in five years.</p> <p>Every fall, after she has spent months figuring out her insurance plan\u2019s deductibles, doctor networks, list of covered drugs and other fine print, she receives notice that the policy will be canceled as of Dec. 31. Because her job doesn\u2019t come with insurance, \u201cit\u2019s agonizing going through all the plans and trying to compare,\u201d said Weston, 55, who has diabetes and a history of melanoma. \u201cEvery year it\u2019s the same scenario: \u2018We\u2019re not going to renew your policy.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Under the market-based system set up by the ACA, individuals are encouraged to \u201cshop around\u201d each year to find insurance that better suits medical needs and income. In fact \u2014 like Weston, a trade association executive in Sulphur, Okla. \u2014 they are often forced to do so when plans drop out of the local market or eliminate preferred hospitals and doctors from the network.</p> <p>The ACA increased the number of Americans with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/health/obamacare-health-insurance-numbers-nchs.html?_r=0\">health insurance by 20 million</a> and cut the uninsured rate to about <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/uninsured-rate-falls-to-a-record-low-of-8-8-percent/\">9 percent</a>.</p> <p>But the task of finding new insurance annually often undermines the continuity of care for people with ongoing medical needs or chronic conditions. That challenge is immeasurably harder this year as policies change under the Trump administration, spurring unstable networks and turmoil in many state and local markets.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s quite a number of people who are either temporarily uninsured or they move into different plans\u201d each year, said Marianne Udow-Phillips, head of the Center for Healthcare Research & Transformation at the University of Michigan. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing this year that will be much greater, given all the changes that are happening in the marketplace plans.\u201d</p> <p>Fewer than half of those buying individual coverage in 2014 kept the same plan the following year, according to a <a href=\"http://www.chrt.org/publication/insurance-churning/\">Michigan survey</a> done by Udow-Phillips and colleagues. Nearly a third of marketplace enrollees for 2017 <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2017-Fact-Sheet-items/2017-03-15.html\">were new customers</a>, meaning they had other kinds of coverage before or were uninsured. For the 2018 enrollment season that began on Nov. 1 and ends Dec. 15 in most states, millions of consumers will find themselves switching coverage.</p> <p>The imperative to shop for insurance affects mostly those who buy insurance for themselves, such as small-business owners and those who are self-employed.</p> Email   <p>Enrollment for 2018 through online ACA marketplaces has been particularly complicated, due to big premium increases for some plans, the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/25/nearly-1-in-4-americans-believe--wrongly--that-obamacare-is-partially-repealed.html\">mistaken belief</a> that the health law was fully or partially repealed and the administration\u2019s decision to terminate $7 billion in subsidies.</p> <p>Many of plans that people relied on for 2017 <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/number-of-issuers-participating-in-the-individual-health-insurance-marketplace/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">are being canceled</a>, the result of insurers exiting the marketplaces or redesigning coverage to try to keep premiums down.</p> <p>Aetna and Humana stopped selling individual marketplace plans for 2018 after losing money on the products. UnitedHealthcare has sharply pulled back. Hundreds of counties have only one marketplace insurer next year, although competition is higher in metro areas.</p> <p>The average number of carriers selling individual marketplace plans in each state <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/number-of-issuers-participating-in-the-individual-health-insurance-marketplace/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">has fallen</a> from five in 2014 to 3.5 next year.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it ideal. It\u2019s what we have,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, who studies insurance for Georgetown University\u2019s Health Policy Institute. \u201cUltimately, the consumers have to read the fine print and probably expect that things are going to change from year to year.\u201d</p> <p>Such instability impedes what was supposed to be the ACA\u2019s other big goal besides coverage expansion. Former President Barack Obama talked of fixing a \u201cbroken system\u201d that neglects preventive care, orders billions of dollars in unneeded procedures and shuffles patients among doctors who don\u2019t talk to each other.</p> <p>The idea was to push insurers to help diabetics improve diets, keep patients on their blood-pressure medication, prevent asthma flare-ups and otherwise improve care and control costs.</p> <p>Investing in prevention upfront, the thinking went, would pay off for carriers over time as members needed less emergency and inpatient care.</p> <p>That equation fails when people find themselves with a new policy or a new insurance company each year \u2014 or more often.</p> <p>Insurance churn \u201cis a long-standing problem in the U.S. health care system,\u201d said Benjamin Sommers, a physician and health economist at Harvard\u2019s Chan School of Public Health.</p> <p>\u201cBut there\u2019s a concern that with the ACA you\u2019ve added a whole new layer.\u201d Insurance turnover is especially frequent among lower-income families and those with irregular work.</p> <p>Unemployed people might be eligible for a plan under Medicaid, which the ACA expanded to most low-income adults in most states. But getting a job and a salary might make them ineligible for Medicaid, bumping them up to a subsidized marketplace plan and a coverage change.</p> <p>Medicaid, which often comes with its own confusing menu of managed-care plans, generally covers those with the lowest incomes. Subsidized marketplace plans are for medium-income households.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/in-the-literature/2016/oct/insurance-churning-low-income-adults\">2015 survey</a> by Sommers and colleagues, about a fourth of low-income adults reported they changed coverage during the previous 12 months. That was lower than expected but still problematic, Sommers said.</p> <p>More than half the switchers had coverage gaps between policies, causing many to report skipped medications and poorer health. Even plan changers with no coverage gap were more likely to swap doctors, to have trouble booking appointments and to seek treatment in the emergency room.</p> <p>Even though <a href=\"http://familiesusa.org/sites/default/files/product_documents/ACT_Network%20Adequacy%20Brief_final_web.pdf#page=10\">laws in some states</a> allow patients in active treatment to keep doctors from one plan to the next, that\u2019s not a recipe for stable medical relationships or long-term treatment strategies.</p> <p>\u201cComing up with the right balance and right approach to a patient\u2019s condition takes time,\u201d said Sommers. \u201cIf you wind up with a new set of doctors and new coverage every year, it\u2019s going to make that much harder.\u201d</p> <p>Cyndee Weston has navigated the shifting ground better than many. For years she has had the same insurer \u2014 BlueCross BlueShield of Oklahoma \u2014 which has dominated that state\u2019s market for individual plans and is the only marketplace player for 2018.</p> <p>But even though the carrier is the same and the health law requires insurers to take all comers, canceled plans each year force her to learn a new coverage design, file new paperwork with doctors and worry her primary physician will be dropped from the network.</p> <p>One year BlueCross \u201cautomatically enrolled us into a bronze plan which we didn\u2019t want, so we chose another gold plan,\u201d Weston said.</p> <p>Even when insurers stay in a particular market, they often redesign plans from year to year, changing drug coverage or raising out-of-pocket costs to keep premiums as low as possible, Corlette said. As in Weston\u2019s case, that often requires canceling the old plan and having subscribers switch.</p> <p>\u201cEach year, we assess our plan offerings and make any necessary adjustments to best meet our members\u2019 anticipated health care needs,\u201d BlueCross Oklahoma spokeswoman Melissa Clark said via email.</p> <p>After Weston\u2019s primary physician left the plan\u2019s network this year, she\u2019s had trouble finding a new one, although the insurer said its physician list has not changed significantly.</p> <p>\u201cI take some medications, and I worry that if I go to a new doctor they\u2019ll change my medication or it won\u2019t be covered,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, she got a new notice from BlueCross saying her current plan is canceled as of Dec. 31.

He was disturbed by the numerous crimes yet to be prosecuted before domestic courts in the Former Yugoslavia. The rise of revisionism and nationalism throughout the region could not be ignored. \n\u201cDo not delude yourselves; the absence of war does not mean peace,\u201d he said. Ending impunity for mass crimes is not the preserve of any one institution \u2013 it is a common goal that ties all together in the shared quest for justice, peace and stability. \nIn closing, President Agius stated: \u201cAs the international community now looks on while mass crimes continue to take place, even as I speak, and geopolitical roadblocks impede any kind of comprehensive justice solutions, we must not forget the political courage that sparked the ICTY\u2019s existence, the Tribunal\u2019s long trajectory, and the need to stay the course.\u201d \nBeyond the Tribunal\u2019s success, reconciliation remains a significant challenge \nTheodor Meron, President of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, affirmed that the Tribunal had made plain that even complex trials could and must be conducted in accordance with the panoply of due process guarantees. As a result, the principles of international law were stronger and, \u201caccountability for grave crimes is increasingly the expectation rather than the exception.\u201d \nDescribing the current activities of the Residual Mechanism, which will maintain the Tribunal\u2019s legacy and carry out its remaining functions, he said it is \u201cserving as a new, effective and efficient model of international court\u201d in carrying out duties such as preparations for administration disposition of records, in further developing its legal and regulatory framework and working on provision of assistance to national jurisdictions. \nThe fulfilment of the Mechanism\u2019s mandate depends on the ongoing support of the Council and the broader international community and on the commitment to all concerned to the invaluable legacies of the tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. \nIn his remarks, the Prosecutor of the International Residual Mechanisms for Criminal Tribunals, Serge Brammertz, said his Office remains focused on expeditiously completing the limited number of trials and appeals transferred from the ICTY and on locating and arresting the remaining eight fugitives indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). \nHe acknowledged that the Tribunal failed to achieve reconciliation in the Former Yugoslavia, where many still viewed convicted war criminals as heroes while victims and survivors were ignored and dismissed. \u201cThe reality is that there is still no true will within the region to accept the immense wrongdoings of the past and move forward \u2013 sadly, most of all among the political leadership,\u201d he said. \nToo many people listen to war criminals, who hide behind claims of collective responsibility, when in fact no community bore responsibility for what those men had done. He emphasized that justice is an essential precondition for achieving reconciliation. \nPhoto: ICTY ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "serge brammertz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmel agius", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agius", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theodor meron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jadranko prlic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ratko mladic", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "security council  india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital news management \u2018mission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international residual mechanisms for criminal tribunals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blooms news service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international criminal tribunal for rwanda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international residual mechanism for criminal tribunals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tribunal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ictr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "yugoslavia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rwanda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "former yugoslavia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the hague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balkans", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:07.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "182dce0e6060ac81b798b07468e4368da6ab5eea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQkK7aUqeqwE.fx2Pb7UwUjF9I.X5.bcv555VcL9bktYWHgTZRp9Vej8nhZQ4MBFDAOe3tlkG6wiAlx8zp1zn9IZorqnHukim8aJbQrE_nSlFlXCAyg8f4iWlYDtTETOugmcaP95hGua99BONuHeKRpOH8nCl1MxBQ-", "site_full": "www.indiablooms.com", "site": "indiablooms.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "8-year old girl student allegedly raped by a private school sweeper | Indiablooms - First Portal on Digital News Management", "title_full": "8-year old girl student allegedly raped by a private school sweeper | Indiablooms - First Portal on Digital News Management", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.201, "main_image": "https://www.indiablooms.com/ventuno_video_image/116125_2017120661__EG07DBIO.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "182dce0e6060ac81b798b07468e4368da6ab5eea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQkK7aUqeqwE.fx2Pb7UwUjF9I.X5.bcv555VcL9bktYWHgTZRp9Vej8nhZQ4MBFDAOe3tlkG6wiAlx8zp1zn9IZorqnHukim8aJbQrE_nSlFlXCAyg8f4iWlYDtTETOugmcaP95hGua99BONuHeKRpOH8nCl1MxBQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "8-year old girl student allegedly raped by a private school sweeper | Indiablooms - First Portal on Digital News Management", "text": "8-year old girl student allegedly raped by a private school sweeper \nANI | @indiablooms | 07 Dec 2017 Twitter Pinterest \nPatna (Bihar), Dec 06 (ANI): While the nation is still heating up with the rape cases from some of the most popular schools, yet another gruesome case of minor came into light from Patna.

Why does he have to link Ram Mandir with elections? Is such thinking proper?

He handed it to Jem. Jem opened the box. Inside, surrounded by wads of damp cotton, was a white, waxy, perfect camellia. It was a Snow-on-the-Mountain. Jem\u2019s eyes nearly popped out of his head. \u201cOld hell-devil, old hell-devil!\u201d he screamed, flinging it down. \u201cWhy can\u2019t she leave me alone?\u201d In a flash Atticus was up and standing over him. Jem buried his face in Atticus\u2019s shirt front, \u201cSh-h,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that was her way of telling you \u2014 everything\u2019s all right now, Jem, everything\u2019s all right. You know, she was a great lady.\u201d \u201cA lady?\u201d Jem raised his head. His face was scarlet. \u201cAfter all those things she said about you, a lady?\u201d \u201cShe was. She had her own views about things, a lot different from mine, maybe \u2026 son, I told you that if you hadn\u2019t lost your head I\u2019d have made you go read to her. I wanted you to see something about her \u2014 I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It\u2019s when you know you\u2019re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do. Mrs. Dubose won, all ninety-eight pounds of her. According to her views, she died beholden to nothing and nobody.

GPD XD+ Android Console To Get Mediatek MT8176 SoC, 4GB RAM Upgrade Tweet \nRockchip RK3288 32-bit Arm processor was first spotted in a company presentation in the summer of 2013, before being announced \u2013 with some confusion (Cortex A12 vs A17) \u2013 at CES 2014 in January. The quad core Cortex A17 processor had then its moments of glory with inclusion in products such as Chromebooks (2015), and ASUS Tinker board SBC earlier this year. \nAnother product based on the processor is GPD XD Android game console , but according to a report on reddit , GPD will soon launch an upgraded version call XD+ powered by Mediatek MT8176 Hexa-core Cortex A72/A53 processor with 4GB RAM, mainly because \u201cRockchip are phasing out sales of the RK3288\u201d. If true, it means most products based on the chip will soon be phased out or upgraded to another solution. How long each product will keep selling will depend on the stocks held by the manufacturer. \nGPD XD+ console preliminary specifications: SoC \u2013 Mediatek MT8176 hexa-core processor with 2x Cortex A72 cores @ 2.1 GHz, 4x Cortex A53 cores @ 1.7 GHz, and Imagination PowerVR GX6250 GPU (as used in Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 tablet ) System Memory \u2013 4GB RAM Storage \u2013 32GB and up internal storage,

The Decade will ensure greater coordination of research,\u201d said Audrey Azoulay, the Director-General of UNESCO, urging all stakeholders to join the endevour. \n\u201c[We are] proud to be at the forefront of this effort,\u201d she added. \nAcross the world, close to three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity to meet their needs. \nOceans \u2013 critical for survival of all people across the planet \u2013 absorbs around a third of the carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by humans and reduces the impact of climate change. \nGiven this important, the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for specific action for the conservation and sustainable use the oceans, seas and marine resources (SDG 14). \nThe importance of oceans was also underscored at a major conference this past June at the UN Headquarters, in New York. \nHowever, the cumulative effects of human activities on this vital important, including the impact of pollution, warming and acidification are yet to be fully evaluated scientifically and surveying the ocean requires costly ships and equipment, satellite imaging, underwater robots and remotely controlled vehicles. \nIt also requires thousands of scientists collecting and analysing the data, either in laboratories or in marine environments. \n\u201cOne of the priorities of the Decade will be to strengthen and diversify financial sources, particularly for small island developing States and least developed countries,\u201d said UNESCO. \n\u201cThis Decade, will provide a framework for international coordination and partnership to reinforce research capacities in marine sciences and the transfer of technology,\u201d it added. \nUN Photo/Rick Bajornas ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "audrey azoulay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "photo/rick bajornas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "digital news management un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ocean science\u2019  india blooms news service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un headquarters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ocean science for sustainable development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cultural organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un education", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:09.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "972c570864a35bda674320c3fbc4ce43c2b9ed61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Nw_bKXrBsz4uTYkfYfj0VNKU_OO9.mvaRH.ktQAMRyQBd88_8p.1TgYKWw_ZGDAio3tEzemTpG_iUIXFCmPHR", "site_full": "www.wpbf.com", "site": "wpbf.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bel-Air wildfire joins siege across Southern California", "title_full": "Bel-Air wildfire joins siege across Southern California", "published": "2017-12-07T07:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.212, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "972c570864a35bda674320c3fbc4ce43c2b9ed61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Nw_bKXrBsz4uTYkfYfj0VNKU_OO9.mvaRH.ktQAMRyQBd88_8p.1TgYKWw_ZGDAio3tEzemTpG_iUIXFCmPHR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T07:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Bel-Air wildfire joins siege across Southern California", "text": "{copyShortcut} to copy Link copied!

Advertisement Trapped in their stalls, 30 horses burned to death in California wildfire \nAs many as five fires have closed highways, schools and museums, shut down production of TV series and cast a hazardous haze over the region. About 200,000 people were under evacuation orders. No deaths and only a few injuries were reported. \nFrom the beachside city of Ventura, where rows of homes were leveled, to the rugged foothills north of Los Angeles, where stable owners had to evacuate horses in trailers, to Bel-Air, where the rich and famous have sweeping views of L.A. below, fierce Santa Ana winds sweeping in from the desert fanned the flames and fears. \n\"God willing, this will slow down so the firefighters can do their job,\" said Maurice Kaboud, who ignored an evacuation order and stood in his backyard with a garden hose at the ready. \nAir tankers that were grounded most of Tuesday because of high winds went up on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before the winds picked up again. They were expected to gust as high as 80 mph (about 130 kph) overnight into Thursday, possibly creating unprecedented fire danger. \nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection uses a color-coded wind index in its forecasts. Tomorrow's forecast is purple, the most extreme conditions, which has never been used before, director Ken Pimlott said. \n\"Conditions are going to change again tonight,\" Pimlott said. \"They're going to be extreme tomorrow. We need to have everybody's heads up \u2014 heads on a swivel \u2014 and pay very close attention.\" \nBefore dawn Wednesday, flames exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes in Bel-Air, where houses range from $2 million to more than $30 million. \nFirefighters hosed down a burning Tudor-style house as helicopters dropped water on hillsides to protect homes from the 150-acre (60-hectare) blaze. \nA Christmas tree saved from the flames was in the front yard of a burned-out house and a large painting was propped against a Range Rover. \nBel-Air was the site of a catastrophic fire in 1961 that burned nearly 500 homes. Burt Lancaster and Zsa Zsa Gabor were among the celebrities who lost their houses. \nAcross the wide freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles canceled classes because of poor air quality. UCLA, at the edge of the Bel-Air evacuation zone, canceled afternoon classes and its evening basketball game. \nBy late afternoon, firefighters said they had controlled the fire's advance. \nProduction of HBO's \"Westworld\" and the CBS show \"S.W.A.T.\" was suspended because of the danger to cast and crew from two nearby fires. \nIn Ventura County northwest of L.A., the biggest and most destructive of the wildfires grew to 101 square miles (262 square kilometers) and had nearly reached the Pacific on Tuesday night after starting 30 miles (about 45 kilometers) inland a day earlier. \nThe fire destroyed at least 150 structures, but incident commander Todd Derum said he suspects hundreds of homes have been lost. \nWhile winds were calmer Wednesday, the fire remained active around Ventura, spreading along the coast to the west and up into the mountains around the community of Ojai and into the agricultural area of Santa Paula. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\"",

You vow to get started early, making considered choices for all your friends and family, then realise you can\u2019t be bothered with all that brain-sapping thought and ask Google Claus to do the work for you. So, for our loyal readers and those of you who have hit the search button on \u2018Christmas + Gift + Booze + Garden\u2019, here are some suggestions. \nYou\u2019ll find a mix of things we\u2019ve discovered throughout the year along with some superb treats from some of our digging and swigging chums. \nAnd if this lot doesn\u2019t fully satisfy you, then we\u2019ll be adding some more in the run up to Christmas, so come back later and have another goosey-goosey- ganders. Craft Metropolis Box of 12 Beers \nPrice \u00a336 A trip to London is always a treat as it gives us the opportunity to sneak off to the pub and guzzle a load of the latest London beers. Which might be why we like Craft Metropolis beer boxes so much \u2013 they only contain beers sourced from the capital, meaning each selection contains otherwise hard-to-find beers, rather than the more common nationwide brews filling other boxes. Their Christmas dozen includes bottles and cans from personal favourites Kew Brewery, Signature Brew and Anspach & Hobday with an impressive range of styles to savour. Turn your living room into a great London boozer\u2026 \nSAVE MONEY! Christmas bonus! Because Craft Metropolis like us so much they\u2019ve agreed to knock \u00a34 off the price of their Christmas box. It\u2019s \u00a340 for most people. Click the link below and you\u2019ll be able to get it for \u00a336. Bargain! Hepple Gin \nPrice \u00a336.55 A few years ago we interviewed top chef Valentine Warner for this site, in which he revealed his plans for a new gin distillery in Northumberland. Hepple distillery is now up and running, producing one of the best new gins on the market. The local juniper shines like few other gins, showing off their complex bitter and fruity flavours, and the drink is lifted with a few refreshing flourishes of citrus. Hepple is also doing good things through a sustainable juniper propagation programme, so if you know a gin fan this is a product well worth investigating. The Scotch Malt Whisky Society Membership \nPrice from \u00a365 The Scotch Malt Whisky Society like whisky. They\u2019ve assembled the world\u2019s biggest collection of single barrel whiskies, containing some of the highest quality boozes you could wish for, and nurtured them in their vaults before popping them into bottles and sharing the goods with their members. Not many people get to taste these special treats, so the gift of membership opens up a whole world of taste exclusivity for you gleeful recipient (and if you don\u2019t know what their whisky taste might be, they\u2019ve even worked out a way to discover everyone\u2019s taste profile ). \nAvailable from SMWS. Membership starts at \u00a365, with other options available that include special gift-worthy extras (such as the membership and taster box for \u00a395). It\u2019s our digging and swigging home made booze book! \nFor the ultimate digging and swigging gift there\u2019s always our book, Brew it Yourself . It\u2019s rammed full with ace booze recipes \u2013 from beers, ciders and wines to more curious cocktails and infusions \u2013 many of them using home grown ingredients.

My first computer was an Apple ][+ with 3rd party add ons like extra 16k ram and lowercase letters.\nNot counting retail laptops, my first portable computer had 15\" lcd, full size keyboard and mouse, micro itx motherboard, 120gb ssd, 12x 18650 cells, notebook, textbooks, pens, pencils, paper and power brick all inside a briefcase. It dual booted Windows 10 and Linux Mint 18.1. I was a student of Electrical Engineering and felt my school computer should reflect that.\nMy second portable will be called the \"XU4 toughbook\". I bought a military spec laptop (Panasonic CF-29) on ebay for less than $40 including shipping. I intend to upgrade it with an XU4, and try to keep it waterproof. The hardest part may be connecting keyboard and trackpad. Laptops often use a ps/2 interface for keyboard and trackpad, but controller is built into motherboard and nigh impossible for a hobbyist to extract. The toughbook appears to have a separate board for input, will look at it this weekend. If I have to I can map the keyboard but will need some hand-holding configuring the o/s. For Wi-fi I will use a travel router, so the only driver I need to worry about is ethernet and I can still have an external ethernet port. The router can also do TOR, VPN, firewall, and simple NAS. The router also has connectors to plug in laptop antennas. It will be a shame to hide those GPIOs in the laptop, but a DB44 connector can fit where the parallel printer port is behind a waterproof flap. For batteries I can reuse the packs from the briefcase, they can provide 5v at 4a. The toughbook has passive cooling for the Pentium M, I will of course reuse that for XU4.

Once that happens, the work isn\u2019t over. Future policies, procedures and strategies need to reflect how trends will impact the organization over time . For example, if the organization is planning to expand into the Latin American market in the next 5 years, what is the company doing today in terms of understanding the Latin American culture to ensure their success?\n\nOne of the biggest challenges to creating an inclusive culture is the nebulous nature of diversity training and activities. The chief complaints are that the business definition for diversity isn\u2019t well-defined (which we talked about in the first post of the series) and focuses too much on legal and compliance issues, which is one of the reasons we\u2019re not talking about them in this series.\nI had the opportunity to hear Corey Anthony, senior vice president of business services at AT&T, talked about bias at a conference earlier this year. He said that it\u2019s very hard for companies to know everyone\u2019s biases. But that organizations can create an environment where people are able to discuss bias, focus on behaviors and changing behaviors, and create opportunities to listen and not label.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that diversity training efforts should be eliminated. In fact, it\u2019s a call to action that diversity programs gain clearer focus to become more effective. A few elements to concentrate on when developing diversity training include:\nClear objectives and expectations Participant engagement before, during and after the session Opportunities for open discussion and dialogue Creative activities and sharing within a safe environment Facilitation of hot-topics and challenging conversation that emerges during the session Support and positive energy by everyone involved While there are clear recruiting and retention benefits to creating an inclusive culture, it\u2019s important to recognize that this isn\u2019t exclusively about recruiting or retention. It\u2019s about transforming the culture of the company into one that\u2019s customer-centric, business-focused, and leadership-focused. If you haven\u2019t seen it, Randall Stephenson, CEO of AT&T, made headlines with his speech about race relations and defense of Black Lives Matter .\nIt\u2019s clear that having a diverse workforce and creating an inclusionary culture yield huge rewards for companies. The challenge is clearly defining what that means for your unique corporate culture, designing efforts that align with the business goals and constantly measuring and evaluating results.\nOrganizations need to consciously revisit their efforts to ensure they are creating a sustainable culture. Maintaining an inclusive culture is not a one-time conversation. Companies will want to evaluate their energies at several levels on a regular basis. A few questions you should consider:\nHow can the company attract and retain the talent necessary to meet our current and future business goals? How can the corporate culture support the products and services our customers want? How can the organization drive innovation and growth by leveraging our diversity efforts? How can we expand our business reach into new markets? William Morgan, former senior vice president of human resources at NASDAQ, shared how their cultural transformation translated into business success. \u201cWe saw how we could better leverage our diversity efforts to impact our business bottom-line. Not only did we identify our opportunities to improve, but we provided specific measurable actions we can take along with easy-to-measure outcomes. We found ideas were practical and well aligned with our other business priorities.\u201d\nSuccessful organizations understand that inclusion is not optional \u2013 it\u2019s a business imperative that gives them a competitive advantage with stakeholders at every level : customers, suppliers, partners, and employees. Diversity and inclusion are no longer programs within an organization. They are infused within the culture of the company and drive business outcomes.\nImage captured by Sharlyn Lauby at the 34th Street Graffiti Wall in Gainesville, FL\nThe post The Culture Series [Part 4] \u2013 Implementing an Inclusive Culture appeared first on hr bartender .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "randall stephenson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharlyn lauby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corey anthony", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "at&t", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gainesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fl", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:10.082+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0dbb224dda955286a86c3267774e644d8047d806", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ71sGc2UOFRAmIjJGHLyM4U8OD_Da.u.egy_BAIHIKOSGMTjENjXpALkJQSWG9t80ZkKszNuVVnAkX.rdZuwVLQSQTFgsPm.p_PWyPAn5xYymrOR46VeYd", "site_full": "press-start.com.au", "site": "press-start.com.au", "site_section": "http://press-start.com.au/feed", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Press Start Australia \u2013 Bringing The Best Of Video Games & Gaming To Australia", "title": "Essendon Football Club Has Acquired A Top Esports Team", "title_full": "Essendon Football Club Has Acquired A Top Esports Team", "published": "2017-12-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://drdw8nfjvtevv.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Essendon-FC.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0dbb224dda955286a86c3267774e644d8047d806", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ71sGc2UOFRAmIjJGHLyM4U8OD_Da.u.egy_BAIHIKOSGMTjENjXpALkJQSWG9t80ZkKszNuVVnAkX.rdZuwVLQSQTFgsPm.p_PWyPAn5xYymrOR46VeYd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shannon Grixti", "published": "2017-12-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Essendon Football Club Has Acquired A Top Esports Team", "text": "Shannon Grixti December 7, 2017 \nEssendon Football Club has announced that it has acquired the license for Abyss Esports and will relocate the team to Melbourne to compete in the League of Legends, Oceanic Pro League and Oceanic Challenger League next year. \nThe operations and management of the club will be fully integrated as a division of the Essendon Football Club and the team will be renamed with a new name, brand and logo \nEssendon Football Club has said that they are committed to creating a professional culture and high performance environment for the team providing the best facilities, programs and resources to compete locally and globally. \nYou can read about Essendon\u2019s move into Esports on their website .

Each character description includes an illustration, the name of their creator, information about their first appearance, and where to find their comics now. \nEach decade from the 1930s on is represented, and the women featured include many heroines of color as well as LGBTQ heroines. It\u2019s fascinating to see how characters evolve through time and how art styles changed decade by decade. Each decade gets one \u201cIcon of the Decade.\u201d While many characters are well-known, other are a delightful surprise, like Torchy Brown, a Black woman in a comic strip of the same name written and illustrated by a Black woman (Jackie Ormes). The surprise factor here is that this strip, which tells the story of a young woman who moves from the South to Harlem, dates from 1937. \nHere\u2019s a random sampling of some of the heroines you\u2019ll find in these pages, both well-known and obscure. \nMeet Maureen Marine, a tween girl who lives with mermaids and rides sea turtles as she rules the seas from her underwater city of gold! May I introduce the barely dressed Vampirella, who has a blonde twin sister named Draculina? Admire the independent and resourceful Gail Porter: Girl Photographer, who fights werewolves, Nazis, and the Mob using her investigative skills! Give an \u201ca \u201d to Street Angel, a homeless thirteen-year-old who fights ninjas using nothing but a skateboard! Fight conformity with Penny Rolle, of Bitch Planet ! \nEvery character is given thoughtful but also funny analysis. The author talks about the character\u2019s history in context with what was happening in comics as an industry, and any ways in which the character left a lasting mark. She also talks about both problematic and progressive aspects of characters. It\u2019s a fascinating examination of how cultural ideas about race, class, gender, and sexuality are explored in both independent subculture and mainstream culture. \nThis collection does include some nudity and quite a number of heavily sexualized characters that were primarily marketed to men, so it\u2019s not for kids. It also contains a few characters from comics that were marketed as porn/erotica. Ultimately, it\u2019s the mix of characters as well-known as Wonder Woman and as obscure (and body positive) as Pudge (from Pudge: Girl Blimp) that make this collection so informative, so fun, and so special. This book would make a great gift for your comics loving friends, but you\u2019ll want to keep a copy for yourself too!

The original outline scene that I drew out was very rough and I didn\u2019t really like it too much as I felt that the scene didn\u2019t work and that the reference images I used to get the right shape were too close to that of my scene, I much prefer the scene with color as it really helps with the depth of the scene.\nScene Outline After re listening to the song while looking at the scene and I think that my initial idea and inspiration for my scene was correct and the fact that the song still fits with what I had intended also leads me to think that I have created the right scene for what I actually wanted to create.

President Trump announced that the U.S. will view Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and he ordered the State Department to \"begin preparation to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv.\" The controversial move threatens to unsettle the region's volatile politics. Ahmad Gharabli / AFP/Getty Images \nPresident Trump's declaration that Jerusalem is Israel's capital and his order to move the U.S. Embassy brought quick and sharply differing reactions from Jewish, Christian and Muslim leaders. \nThe government of Israel considers Jerusalem its capital, and most Jewish-American organizations have long argued that the United States should acknowledge it as such. The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which called for the U.S. Embassy to be moved to Jerusalem, passed by a large bipartisan margin and was strongly supported by Jewish-American groups. \n\"It's been the consensus mainline view for decades,\" said Nathan Diament, executive director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, \"because Jerusalem is the capital city for Israel and the Jewish people. ... The United States puts its embassies in capital cities, and it's unjust and discriminatory to say we're going to single out Israel as the one country where we don't put our embassy [in the capital].\" \nWhen President Trump on Wednesday ordered the State Department to begin preparations to move the embassy to Jerusalem, several Jewish-American groups welcomed the move. \n\"By stating the truth of Jerusalem's status as the capital of the State of Israel, President Trump has asserted U.S. global leadership towards ending a longstanding, senseless anomaly,\" said David Harris, chief executive officer of the American Jewish Committee. \nThe Anti-Defamation League called the move a \"significant step,\" coming at a time \"when international organizations and other detractors delegitimize the Jewish state and deny any Jewish connection to the holy city.\" \nBut there were also misgivings from some Jewish-American groups. The Reform Jewish Movement, representing nearly 900 congregations, noted that it has long supported the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital but also believed that moving the U.S. Embassy there should happen only \"at the right time.\" Without a comprehensive peace plan, the movement said it cannot support the president's decision to move the embassy now. \nConservative evangelical Christian leaders had fewer qualms. \n\"This decision will be met by political praise and theological conviction,\" said Johnnie Moore, an informal spokesman for Trump's evangelical advisory group. \"Evangelicals in every corner of the United States will be ecstatic,\" he said. \nEvangelicals feel a special kinship with Jerusalem as the city where they believe Jesus Christ was crucified and rose again. Some sects even take an eschatological view, arguing that Jesus will return to earth in Jerusalem, once all Jews are reunited there. \nFor Trump's evangelical advisory group, said Moore, the only issue more important than the status of Jerusalem is the question of who will be appointed as federal judges. \n\"In our various meetings with the White House, this issue has always come up,\" Moore said, \"and it has always been an extended discussion around the table. I mean, at the heart of the relationship between the United States and Israel has been the friendship between evangelical Christians and the Jewish people.\" \nSome evangelical leaders who generally support the president's Jerusalem decision, however, fear the repercussions for their own Palestinian Christian followers. Muslim leaders in the Palestinian territories have warned there will be a reaction there to the president's announcement. The governments of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey all expressed alarm at Trump's decision, as did Muslim leaders in the U.S. \n\"The reality is that Palestinians have existed for generations on the land of Palestine [and] in Jerusalem,\" said Osama Abuirshaid, a board member of the American Muslims for Palestine, at a press conference near the White House. \"[Trump] cannot deny this reality,\" Abuirshaid said. \"He spoke about the Jewish connection to Jerusalem while negating the Christian and Muslim connection to the land and to the holy city.\" \nPope Francis advised against \"adding new elements of tension in a world already shaken and scarred by many cruel conflicts.\" The heads of several Christian churches in Jerusalem, in a joint letter to Trump, said a unilateral change in the status of Jerusalem by the U.S. government \"will yield increased hatred, conflict, violence, and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land ... [and] cause irreparable harm.\" \nA similar warning came from Elizabeth Eaton, the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran group in the U.S. \n\"This announcement,\" Eaton said, \"has a high probability of leading to violence and bloodshed and not ... getting any closer to having the two parties come to the table again.\" \nEaton spoke following a meeting in Geneva with fellow Lutheran chuch leaders from around the world, including those in Jordan and other Arab countries.

The tax was eliminated in 2010 but was reinstated a year later. Alex Wong / Getty Images \nRepublicans in Congress are on the verge of fulfilling their long-time dream of eliminating the federal estate tax, and they could do it in a way that is even more generous to heirs than previous repeal efforts. \nBills passed by the Senate and the House recently would reduce or scrap the taxes heirs now pay on estates larger than $5.5 million. And the bills would do so without repealing the so-called \"stepped-up basis\" provision. \nOrdinarily, people have to pay taxes when they sell off assets that have appreciated in value, like shares of stock or real estate. But heirs are exempted from that tax. That's because they already pay the estate tax. \nThe bills approved by Congress recently would eliminate or reduce the estate tax, while leaving the exemption in place. \nIn other words, you would be able to pass on assets that have gained a lot in value \u2014 like those Apple shares you bought years ago \u2014 and, unlike everyone else, your heirs never have to pay tax on the appreciation. \nTo put it another way: Someone could inherit her grandfather's large beachfront mansion without paying estate tax, and sell it off right away without paying any capital gains tax. \nIt's a much more generous policy than previous tax overhauls, says Lily Batchelder, a professor of law and public policy at New York University Law School. \n\"We've never seen a proposal like this,\" she says. \"I don't recall ever seeing a proposal that would both fully repeal the estate tax and fully exempt from tax all the accrued gains on these giant estates.\" \nThe bill passed by the Senate early Saturday would double the exemption on large estates, allowing people to pass on estates worth $11 million to their heirs tax-free. \nThe exemption for married couples would be $22 million. The House bill would gradually reduce the estate tax and then scrap it altogether in 2023. \nHouse and Senate leaders are now trying to reconcile the two versions of the tax overhaul, with a vote expected by the end of the month. \nThe estate tax has long been the bane of conservatives. Congress briefly eliminated the tax in 2010, but it came back the following year and remains in place today. \n\"We just think it's unfair. Death should not be a taxable event. And we should not be stopping people from being able to pass their life's work on to their kids,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox News recently. \nThe estate tax brings in a relatively small amount of money to the federal Treasury, about $19 billion a year, even as it hurts the large economy, says Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation. \nBecause of the tax, people end up pouring money into tax shelters and paying hefty bills to tax lawyers, he says. \nThe tax is especially onerous for assets that may be worth a lot on paper but are cash poor, such as certain kinds of businesses, Hodge says. In some cases, heirs have to break up or sell businesses to pay taxes, he says. \nPeople who want to keep the tax say such cases are extremely rare. They also say that at a time of growing income inequality, the estate tax plays an important role in making the economy fair. \n\"The estate tax is basically a way of partially leveling the playing field, so that these heirs of massive estates don't have quite as gigantic a leg up in life,\" Batchelder says.
