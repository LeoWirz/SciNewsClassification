It was a gay guy they wanted to grab a beer with and that entertained them, which I don\u2019t think many beforehand had ever considered.\nSure the board shits on Toddy, but Toddy brings it on himself.\nQuote: :\nGood. Everyone should accept them.\nWe should have pity on them, but the transsexual movement has gone out of control. Sure transitioning for some may be the appropriate solution, but for the majority, no. It\u2019s a delusion they usually grow out of, and the school bathroom argument should be irrelevant since they shouldn\u2019t be taking hormones in the first place in their teens and youth. There\u2019s a reason why suicide rates for trans people is the same before and after surgery at like 43%, and that can\u2019t be solely blamed on society.\nQuote: :\nThe sooner the better.\nMove to Venezuela and you can get right on it.\nQuote: :\nCan you show me one American city where Sharia law is the law of the city?

Kennedy told the United States \" we choose to go to the Moon .\" What JFK and the American public didn't know yet was that by investing in its space program, it was also choosing memory foam, precision GPS and the cardiac pump, food safety standards, invisible braces and the Dustbuster.\nWatch Dubai Police test its latest gadget -- a flying motorbike NASA has a rich history of spin-off technology ; byproducts of its mission to explore the solar system. It's among the space program's most tangible legacies, demonstrating that ambitious ventures can reap diverse rewards to the benefit of all. In the present day and half a world away, Dubai is no stranger to moonshot projects. Many are stipulated by ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid himself, and space has become just one frontier. Scientists at the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center inspect the Hope spacecraft, destined for Mars in 2020. The UAE Space Agency was formed as recently as 2014, and Dubai's Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center was established in 2015. The center has already successfully launched two home-grown satellites, and the Emirates is targeting Mars with plans for a probe in 2020 -- the Arab world's first mission to another planet. More ambitious still, there are plans to develop a human settlement on Mars by 2117. (In comparison, NASA's Journey to Mars outline extends to sending humans into low Mars orbit in the \" early 2030s .\" Dutch private venture Mars One plans to put boots on the ground in 2032, while Elon Musk's SpaceX is aiming to do the same in 2024.) Read More At the World Government Summit in February 2017, the UAE previewed its vision of what that colony might look like. In November, their VR presentation was made available on YouTube. In September, Sheikh Mohammed and Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, unveiled renders of Mars Science City , a $136 million simulation center planned for the desert outside Dubai. A render of the Bjarke Ingels Group-deisgned Mars Science City, planned for Dubai. Designed by \"starchitect\" Bjarke Ingels and covering 1.9 million square feet -- the largest project of its kind -- it will include biome laboratories simulating the surface of Mars, agriculture testing areas and a museum. Much of it will be built using 3D printers, including walls made of desert sand. No timeline was given for Mars Science City, but speaking at the launch Sheikh Mohammed told the audience \"the UAE seeks to establish international efforts to develop technologies that benefit humankind, and that establish the foundation of a better future for more generations to come.\" The 1.9m square feet Mars Science City is designed to test future built environments on the surface of Mars. The UAE plans to create a human colony on the planet by 2117. The Emirates' space program is aware it's entering towards the back of the race, and its modus operandi appears to emphasize the benefits of the journey over the final destination. It's all part of a plan to stimulate the nation's science industries and boost its STEM credentials. Dubai's big plans to revolutionize how we travel \"Our primary target is having education and outreach,\" says Sarah Amiri, UAE minister of state for advanced sciences and science lead at the Emirates Mars Mission. \"It's about building people, it's not about building buildings... It's creating people that are creative enough to stimulate your economy and to stimulate the growth of your entire nation.\" In other words, space is a means to an end. Afshin Molavi is a senior fellow in foreign policy at John Hopkins University, and monitors trends shaping the Middle East. \"We sometimes think that the only way a space program is successful is when you have men on the moon planting a flag, or in the case of Dubai maybe rockets that land on Mars,\" he says. \"But (a) space program is successful because of what it does on Earth.\" Whether the UAE's investment manifests itself in an off-world colony, a new generation of homegrown scientists, or the next Dustbuster, Emirati lives could be the better for it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john f. kennedy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sarah amiri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheikh mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afshin molavi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheikh mohammed bin rashid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elon musk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjarke ingels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jfk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emirati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheikh mohamed bin zayed al nahyan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john hopkins university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rashid space center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spacex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed bin rashid space center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mars science city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu dhabi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:26.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef591cc45c27e1b1765fb6cedc742bc81ff577e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4Q.oqil8fwL9zabPoFiB99bRfCift_3BMSCKxu7S1DIgmahNKVE8XKPcj01GeYw4spnHfMl3Zxp0IVczxOihvJ9ue1RmRkI97DA--", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/San-Diego-Hoteis.d178304.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Condado de San Diego: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Wyndham Garden San Diego Near SeaWorld:", "title_full": "Wyndham Garden San Diego Near SeaWorld: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-11-07T02:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ec3acffce53a49858ef4d3232c0d88959430a53", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4Q.oqil8fwL9zabPoFiB99bRfCift_3BMSCKxu7S1DIgmahNKVE8XKPcj01GeYw4spnHfMl3Zxp0IVczxOihvJ9uQFEAWak0wRHZpbVRR7u92gSIF75yd3RoB3U30XvMciQ--", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-30T22:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "We went to a concert at Valley View Casino Center and were able to walk there and back.

Curiouser and Curiouser \nAbout five years ago, when the Disneyland social club phenomenon began, Disneyland regulars took note. Most were curious; some were concerned. Still others\u2014hundreds of others\u2014starting joining the clubs or starting their own. \nAt last count, there were more than 100 active social clubs organized around Disneyland. Many dress like Disneyfied biker gangs\u2014sporting tattoos and denim vests bearing patches with their club logo, like the Wonderlanders, the Main Street Elite, or Sons of Thunder. \nWhile they looked intimidating to some and incongruous to others, on the whole they appeared to mean well, organizing fun meets and riding rides together, usually without incident. They\u2019ve even been known to \u201chelp\u201d Security police the park, by pointing out and occasionally confronting line-cutters and other mischief makers. For the most part, the social clubs seem to have gotten along well with each other\u2026 until the White Rabbits crossed swords with the \u201cbattalion chief\u201d of the Main Street Fire Station. \nThe brouhaha started in late summer 2016, after John Sarno, president of the Main Street Fire Station 55 Social Club, announced plans for a charity walk around the park to raise funds for the families of firefighters who lost their lives on Sept. 11, 2001. \nSarno\u2019s idea was to get as many as 343 participants to walk roughly two miles around the park, each wearing the name of a different fallen fireman. He\u2019d also sell merchandise ($10 patches and $30 T-shirts), and donate the profits to the Michael Lynch Foundation. Sarno said he got permission from Disneyland to conduct the event on Sept. 11, 2016, and the park allegedly agreed to furnish security. By about a week before the event, Sarno reached his registration goal. On Sept. 11, 2016, close to 340 guests\u2014including members of other social clubs\u2014participated in the walk, garnering positive media attention in outlets such as the Orange County Register . \nThe event appeared to be a hit, and Sarno quickly began making plans for a repeat performance Sept. 11, 2017. But that walk would never take place. Instead, his social club is now disbanded, he\u2019s too terrified to visit the park, and he\u2019s filed suit against Disneyland and the rival social club that took him down. \nAccording to Sarno, about a week before the 2016 walk, he was approached on Disney property by five members of the White Rabbits, one of the park\u2019s older and larger social clubs. As Sarno tells it, the group demanded $500 from him for them to \u201cprotect\u201d participants during the walk. White Rabbits club president Jakob Fite allegedly asked why Sarno didn\u2019t get his permission first, since his group \u201cran the park\u201d and had authority from Disney to demand protection money. \nSarno says he turned them down, because he wanted to donate all the money he collected to charity and he had already made security arrangements with Disney. Fite, according to Sarno, grew incensed and said if he didn\u2019t get paid, he would make sure Sarno and his wife would never be able to visit the park again. \nSarno says that Fite then began making derogatory statements about him on his White Rabbits Facebook page and Club Hub group page, intimating that Sarno was a pedophile, that he was only masquerading as a firefighter, and that folks should watch out for him. Sarno suspects the posts convinced several registrants to back out of the walk. \nOn the day of the walk, Fite confronted Sarno at the park. While the exact words exchanged will vary depending on who\u2019s retelling them (both men declined requests to be interviewed), they seem to agree on the upshot: either Sarno would shut down his fictional firehouse, or Fite was going to make life very miserable for him. Instead, within days, Sarno announced plans for his 2017 walk\u2014and the White Rabbits turned up the heat. About a week after the event, Fite aired a two-hour episode of his \u201cRadio Underland\u201d podcast, leveling a litany of accusations against Sarno, basically contending that the 9/11 walk was a ruse to scam walkers out of money and the Fire Station social club was a pretext to meet fellow swingers or young girls. \nAfter the podcast, Sarno says the harassment escalated. Sarno claims: \u2022 Fite accused the Sarnos of being \u201ccon artists,\u201d \u201cscammers,\u201d of stealing charity proceeds, gambling charity proceeds, conducting false raffles, and misappropriating funds donated for their medical treatment. \u2022 Fite allegedly produced T-shirts people would wear in the park featuring Sarno\u2019s name and likeness, to warn other patrons that he\u2019s a pedophile and to report him to the police on sight. \u2022 Fite allegedly encouraged other White Rabbits that if they spotted Sarno, they were to beat him up. \u2022 Fite allegedly defaced the Fire Station 55 logo and threatened to assault anyone wearing the logo on T-shirts or patches at Disneyland. \u2022 Fite allegedly printed and posted photos labeling him as a pedophile in his Sacramento County community, and he aired a live podcast at a local park near his home. \u2022 Fite allegedly made false reports to PayPal, law enforcement, and news media (including the Register ) falsely claiming Sarno had committed theft, fraud and other financial crimes, and asking that he be investigated and prosecuted. \u2022 Fite allegedly published the medications that the Sarnos have been prescribed by their physicians, making them out to be drug addicts. Sarno contends he must have hacked into his confidential medical files. \nTo mark Sept. 11, 2017, Sarno filed suit in Orange County Superior Court against Fite and the White Rabbits Social Club for cyberbullying, destroying his reputation through false statements, and causing his wife to lose her job. As co-defendants, he named Kaiser Permanente, for failing to protect his confidential medical files, and Disneyland, for taking \u201cno steps to stop the White Rabbits\u2019 malicious conduct.\u201d \nHe has shut down his social club and its website, says he is unable to return to the park, lives in fear of being physically assaulted, and feels ostracized in his community and workplace. And Disneyland has refused to authorize another 9/11 walk. \nCourt records show that as yet none of the defendants have formally responded to Sarno\u2019s lawsuit. But according to Fite, he got involved with Sarno only after a woman came to him looking for help after learning that her 12-year-old daughter was receiving text messages from the 43-year-old Sarno. So Fite says he messaged Sarno about the issue, but Sarno didn\u2019t respond. So Fite says he posted an alert online for leaders of other social clubs to be wary of Sarno. Fite says people then started contacting him, providing more dirty laundry about Sarno, which he supplemented with his own investigation. He saw exposing Sarno as a way of protecting others from him. \nSarno\u2019s lawsuit is one of more than 100 Disneyland Resort cases currently making their way through the court system. More Legal Filings Against Disneyland \u2022 A man waiting near Mr. Toad\u2019s Wild Ride was resting his hand on the top of the exit gate, when an employee walked out, catching the man\u2019s hand between two metal bars of the gate. His fingers were crushed, with the tendons in his middle finger damaged. \u2022 A woman says she seriously injured her back when her Splash Mountain log crashed into the water at the bottom of the big drop. \u2022 Another woman said she was injured while dining at the Napa Rose in the Grand Californian, when her table collapsed. \u2022 A Grizzly River Run passenger claims she hurt her jaw and teeth when one of two mechanical arms that was supposed to catch her raft failed and sent her raft smashing into a wall. \u2022 Other unfortunate visitors slipped on a Main Street curb, the steps of the New Orleans Train Station, and in the shower of a two-bedroom suite in the Disneyland Hotel. \nOne of the most recent cases was filed by Joseph Cosgrove, the former longtime Club 33 member, who last year sued Disneyland for not allowing him to renew his membership. Disney had spent the last several years constantly revising the rules and perks of club membership, after what they viewed as abuses of the system by members like Cosgrove. \nCosgrove\u2019s jury trial against Disneyland is currently scheduled to begin March 5, 2018, although the case has already endured several delays, in part due to Cosgrove being hit by a car on Sept. 28, 2016. He was walking not far from his Lake Forest home, in a marked crosswalk, when a woman struck him with her SUV, knocking him into a steel guardrail. Cosgrove suffered multiple fractures to his nose, skull and upper spine. \nOne year later, Cosgrove had Mark Corrinet, the attorney who\u2019s also representing him against Disney, file suit against the driver of the SUV. \nFor clues as to how all these cases will play out\u2014and for the low-down on the 2,000 other lawsuits filed against Disneyland since 1955\u2014check out my latest book, The People v. Disneyland: How Lawsuits & Lawyers Transformed the Magic . \nLet\u2019s hear from you folks. What do you think about these various legal cases against Disneyland?

The Supreme Court is now scheduled to hear the Aadhaar card case next week. A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra was informed by Attorney General K K Venugopal that the Centre was willing to extend the deadline of December 31 to March 31 next year for linking of Aadhaar card with various services and schemes. Senior Supreme Court lawyer Shyam Divan had mentioned before the top court that the deadline was going to expire, so the petitioners should be heard for an interim relief. However, the deadline for Aadhaar linking to cellphone numbers that is on February 6, cannot be extended, since the date was fixed by the apex court, the Centre added. Earlier on October 25, the Supreme court had said that the deadline for compulsory linking of Aadhaar to receive benefits of government schemes has been extended till March 31, 2018 for those who do not have the 12-digit unique biometric identification number. As of now, the 12-digit Aadhaar number is compulsory to be linked to bank accounts, PAN cards, government services and cell phone services.

As part of Quark, we're excited to be able to extend the benefits of Quark's content automation solutions, deliver even more personalized content, and transform the early stages of the content lifecycle.\" \nDocurated uses automation and AI to find the content relevant to end users - technologies going beyond the traditional methods of taxonomies and metadata tagging, explained Cheri Keith, senior research analyst at SiriusDecision. This means sellers and buyers should be empowered by the delivery of more relevant content for their business. \nRay Schiavone, Quark president and CEO, said: \"We believe Docurated has the best technology and user experience for sales professionals who must deliver the right content to the right prospects at the right time.

Many people have make the assumption that carsickness is caused by rear-facing when it's in fact not true. Carsickness can occur regardless if they're sitting in a forward-facing car seat or a rear-facing car seat. \nChildren between 2-10 years are most likely to suffer from carsickness. The most common cause of carsickness is mixed signals in the brain. Sight and balance come in conflict and cause the person to feel sick. \nThe first signs of carsickness are yawning, drowsiness and a loss of colour in the face. We have listed 6 things to do to avoid carsickness for children and at the same time can be five times safer in a rear-facing car seat . \n1. Sleep \nNauseous can be reduced if your child is in a reclined position, relaxed and close their eyes. Sleeping is often a quick way to ease the symptoms as the child is less sensitive to the motion of the vehicle. \n2. Take breaks \nTake regular breaks, stretch your legs and your child can get some fresh air. That will help a lot. \n3. Avoid big meals \nBefore and during the trip try to avoid eating any large meals. It is better to try to both eat and drink more often but in smaller quantities. Drink water and avoid fatty foods! \n4. Temperature \nKeep the vehicle cool! Remove bulky, warm items of clothing! \n5. Drive safe and careful \nDrive with consideration, acceleration and heavy breaking will make the symptoms of carsickness worse. \n6. Don't look down \nIf your child does suffer from carsickness, then reading a book or looking at an iPad will only make them feel worse. Look out the window and focus on items further away from the car, when your child is in a rear-facing car seat it is a good idea to install a mirror so they too can focus on the horizon ahead of the car. \nRead more about child safety in car: \nAxon Kids AB published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:51:08 UTC . \nOriginal document https://www.axkid.com/6-things-avoid-carsickness-children-rear-facing-car-seats/ \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/2A2A2B18C95C0E6CC72FA5FA252CCA5B05B5945D", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "axon kids ab", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:27.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7eaef3f44b093def2ea5e72d0734050a733ec5b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodWALdqgQlSq13U31W45RtaVGJmC_y4AgLCoLSApOXzlxOeifFjz.R1p0u4LfIbganh14FHSzyMMhFWGecOEr_baqkjUQPhlccwFkEB_Z8vozwMxqKIIn7Y4iQS5Z4nrU8A--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/politics/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Political Talk | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Minnesota city Mayor berates councilwoman for denying she has \"white privilege\"", "title_full": "Minnesota city Mayor berates councilwoman for denying she has \"white privilege\" | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T09:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.634, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0d22faf0de94a10dae4953b948a5174e63490d19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodWALdqgQlSq13U31W45RtaVGJmC_y4AgLCoLSApOXzlxOeifFjz.R1p0u4LfIbganh14FHSzyMMhFWGecOEr_baqkjUQPhlccwFkEB_Z8vozwMxqKIIn7Y4K6kaiFxmpjWTs3J9wtckp", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Pinecone Repair", "published": "2017-12-07T09:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Those guys have no balls.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://imgz-fandroppingsllc.netdna-ssl.com/Images/Icons/IconLOL.gif"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:27.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7eaef3f44b093def2ea5e72d0734050a733ec5b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodWALdqgQlSq13U31W45RtaVGJmC_y4AgLCoLSApOXzlxOeifFjz.R1p0u4LfIbganh14FHSzyMMhFWGecOEr_baqkjUQPhlccwFkEB_Z8vozwMxqKIIn7Y4iQS5Z4nrU8A--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/politics/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Political Talk | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Minnesota city Mayor berates councilwoman for denying she has \"white privilege\"", "title_full": "Minnesota city Mayor berates councilwoman for denying she has \"white privilege\" | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T09:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.634, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c22a708d5630e356cba82b93ef0bb08d265a1010", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodWALdqgQlSq13U31W45RtaVGJmC_y4AgLCoLSApOXzlxOeifFjz.R1p0u4LfIbganh14FHSzyMMhFWGecOEr_baqkjUQPhlccwFkEB_Z8vozwMxqKIIn7Y4K6kaiFxmpjazJQkU.lgQH", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "gthog61", "published": "2017-12-07T09:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Doug Jones is exactly like these kooks but he is running as an \"independent voice\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:27.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "384d88298e5c7db8bee41ddacc116687a1d43d1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXxn_YZs2f.PraoYMnla2xO2Jb_dOjJ0nlGklQR6.AP1Yd7kIn3H26eaw.YhUSREF7_P21n.2w7QR4aDvulUP.wFIxN0Wa7qD79VLLsUFTpgg-", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com -

CNN", "text": "Story highlights Mothers around the world consistently alter their voices when talking to their babies, one study found How babies babble back to their parents might vary by culture (CNN) We all use baby talk when we babble with bundles of joy, but does how we talk to infants vary across cultures? \nThe answer seems to be yes and no. \"Some cultures talk more or less to babies, some not at all,\" said Mark VanDam, assistant professor of speech and hearing sciences in the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine at Washington State University. \"Overall, however, the impulse and act of infant-directed speech seems to be pretty human, not necessarily culturally defined,\" he said. Here is a sampling of how moms and dads from around the world use infant-directed speech or \"baby talk,\" and why. Read More How baby talk might be consistent Mothers around the world consistently alter their voices when talking to their babies, no matter what language they speak, according to a study published in October in the journal Current Biology . Parenting Without Borders considers how parenting trends and methods differ -- or don't -- around the world.\nResearchers recorded and analyzed the voices of 24 moms with a powerful machine-learning algorithm. Half of the women were English speakers, and the others spoke Spanish, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, German, French, Hebrew, Mandarin and Cantonese. Despite their native languages, the study showed, all of the women consistently shifted their timbre -- or the tone and sound of their voice -- when interacting with their infants. The researchers were surprised that this shift in sound was a consistent pattern across such a diverse range of languages, said Elise Piazza, associate research scholar at Princeton University and lead author of the study. \"After we controlled for pitch, we still found timbre differences between infant-directed speech and adult-directed speech,\" Piazza said. Though some similarities have been seen in how mothers speak to babies, studies have also spotted some cultural differences among both moms and dads. How baby talk might differ A study published in February in the journal Child Development found that dads in North America tended to slow their speech when talking to infants, whereas dads in the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu did not. Rather, they tended to shift their pitch more. JUST WATCHED Babies' developmental milestones Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nBabies' developmental milestones 03:17 Researchers examined 30 interactions between the fathers and their infants, around 7.8 months old. More research is needed in a larger sample of fathers to determine that such differences do, indeed, exist in how these dads baby talk. \"These are small samples,\" said Greg Bryant, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. He conducted the study with Tanya Broesch, assistant professor in the department of psychology at Simon Fraser University . \"The bigger picture is that there are many ways that mothers and fathers can achieve the same communicative effect,\" he said. \"What's universal is that parents often do change their voice when speaking to young children, but how they change exactly could vary across cultures.\" As for mothers, a study published last year in the journal PLOS One found a tendency for Lebanese mothers to use more infant-directed speech than American moms. The study involved 19 American and 19 Lebanese mothers. The researchers recorded audio of the American moms interacting with their infants in a lab and the Lebanese moms interacting with their infants at home. Around the world, mothers have similar response to crying baby, study finds The key difference between the groups was that Lebanese moms had a higher rate in utterances per minute of baby talk than the American moms, the researchers found. Although other research groups have identified differences in baby talk across cultural contexts, this study was the first to report quantitatively on such language differences, the researchers wrote. Still, the study had some limitations. For instance, American moms were tested in a lab, but Lebanese mothers were tested at home, which could explain the differences. On the other hand, it turns out that how babies respond to their parents could vary by culture. How babies babble around the globe \"Babies will often babble with their native sound-sequences,\" VanDam said. \"For example, we don't have words in English that begin with 'tl,' such as 'tlick,' and English-speaking babies don't tend to babble that way,\" he said, but some Spanish words begin with \"tl.\" \"We also see sign language babies babbling in sign language, which is fairly strong evidence that it's more of a human trait than some language or culture specific trait,\" VanDam said. Where your taste in music comes from In other words, as kids develop, their babbling starts to reflect the speech patterns of their native language, Bryant said. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in November suggested that infants start understanding words around 6 months old. \"So mothers and fathers exaggerate vowel categories, for example, so they'll make vowel sounds a little more noticeable, and then that helps the infants acquire the vowel sounds of their language,\" he said. \"Some people also think that exaggerated features in infant-directed speech help kids learn how to parse the syntax of spoken sentences, but that is a little more controversial,\" he said. The changes we tend to make in our voices -- such as exaggerated, repetitive and high-pitched baby talk -- could actually be useful for babies' learning, Piazza said. JUST WATCHED Baby Sign Language Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nBaby Sign Language 02:55 \"Previous experiments have shown that infants segment words and learn the meaning of novel words better from infant-directed than adult-directed speech,\" Piazza said. \"It also seems to help parents capture babies' attention and engage them emotionally,\" she said. \"Adults are generally motivated to engage infants, and they intuitively know that babies respond well to the exaggerated patterns in baby talk. Infant-directed speech is just one example of tailoring your communication style to a particular audience, which we do all the time.\" Why we use baby talk Some scientists argue that baby talk not only helps infants acquire language, it helps parents form a positive emotional bond with their babies, said Linda Polka, a professor in the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders at McGill University in Canada. Baby talk helps infants learn language Other studies suggest that infants prefer high-pitched infant-directed speech and even infant-directed singing, Polka said. The reason for this preference remains complex, but research suggests that when adults shift the sound of their voices for \"baby talk,\" that causes them to sound smaller -- as if their voice is coming from a smaller vocal tract, Polka said. \"Our research shows that babies prefer to listen to speech coming from a smaller infant talker, but we don't know exactly why babies show this preference. Do they simply have a general 'smaller talkers are better' bias, or are they particularly sensitive to how big an infant is?\" Polka said. In the future, \"we could figure this out by assessing how they respond to speech sounds that come from a vocal tract that is too small to be an infant. Would they still like it, or would that be less interesting to them?\" she said. Additionally, Polka said that whether you are talking to a baby or an adult, research suggests that there is a tendency to shift your speech to sound more like the person who you are interacting with.

We may be kind of priming them for their own voice, which is quite distinct from an adult voice.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "piazza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg bryant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elise piazza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda polka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark vandam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tanya broesch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vandam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "polka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "princeton university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national academy of sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn health on facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "child development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcgill university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school of communication sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elson s. floyd college of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon fraser university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanuatu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:27.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "65bf37e9e141b97600edc6dedc63c6a709ca53ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgx6ijsQ6vdXdMO9CR1Tg6eS.lDxuE_OcGoLNKKUFQKchFNW.ntmnfweSozhzror850Awf1dWa9pnZUWZyab5Uik", "site_full": "fiftywordstories.com", "site": "fiftywordstories.com", "site_section": "http://fiftywordstories.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "50-Word Stories", "title": "KEVIN P MICHAELS: Waiting", "title_full": "KEVIN P MICHAELS: Waiting", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "65bf37e9e141b97600edc6dedc63c6a709ca53ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgx6ijsQ6vdXdMO9CR1Tg6eS.lDxuE_OcGoLNKKUFQKchFNW.ntmnfweSozhzror850Awf1dWa9pnZUWZyab5Uik", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tim", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "KEVIN P MICHAELS: Waiting", "text": "It\u2019s always the same, every single time. \nA dark ominous shape follows me through endless hallways. \nI go left, it\u2019s there; I go right, it\u2019s there. \nI go faster, it gets closer. \nFinally I\u2019m cornered.

The film, which was slated to release on December 1, was put on hold, after Rajput Karni Sena called for a ban. \nTwitter \nAccording to the Rajput founder, the film disrupts historical facts which led to the director showing the film to selected journalists. Despite giving green signal to the film, Bhansali's Padmavati still didn't get approved. \nPadmavati/Screengrab \nSo now, BJP has decided to get involved in this. According to sources in Asian Age, the sources reveal that the Union information and broadcasting ministry has sought the help of the human resource development ministry to suggest names of eminent historians who can be part of a Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) panel to review the controversial content in the Deeepika Padukone starrer.

Pete Ibarra\u2019s Design \nThe Special Olympics youth deserve to have the chance to be exposed to great opportunities. VENTURA, Calif. (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 STARKART , the largest grocery cart advertising company in the U.S. and Canada, recently posted its original creative design entries for the CokexAdobexYou campaign to its Twitter and Instagram accounts, with the #cokexadobexyou hashtag. The CokexAdobexYou campaign is a benefit for the Special Olympics . STARKART graphic designers, Pete Ibarra and Dennis Viloria, created special designs for the campaign, along with digital artists from around the world. To celebrate the creative community, Coca-Cola will make a one-time contribution of $35,000 to Special Olympics. \u201cI relate to being an adolescent that craves to be inspired and wants to win. The Special Olympics youth deserve to have the chance to be exposed to great opportunities,\u201d said Ibarra, the graphic designer responsible for spearheading the STARKART team\u2019s submissions for CokexAdobexYou . Added Viloria, \u201cMy design features a swimmer for sports, as I love water sports. I used clean, modern lines to create a flow of sports and movement. I also incorporated a Japanese rising sun effect, with the Asian family pattern for unity.\u201d In honor of the campaign, Coca-Cola has shared the brand\u2019s iconic elements (i.e. its bottle, script, and shade of red) for artists to create a unique visual piece using Adobe Creative Cloud Tools. Participants are also encouraged to draw inspiration from the city of Tokyo, Japan, and other core elements such as a circle and the colors red and white when creating their designs on any app in the Adobe Creative Cloud. \u201cFor my submission, I used pop art, texture experimentation, and street art feels to signify dimension and emotion,\u201d concluded Ibarra. \u201cIt was a privilege to be able to use Coca-Cola classic design elements.\u201d About STARKARTSTARKART has the largest shopping cart advertising network in the United States and Canada offering grocery cart advertising that reaches a network of thousands of locations.

Since I installed the new GPU (upgraded from an GTX 780Ti) I have these strange issues and I am not really sure if the GPU is to blame or the general setup (drivers/windows etc)\n1. Sometimes Chrome seems to freeze for a moment, and then kinda \"breaks\", meaning that the Chrome window turns to blue (old windows style blue) and the tabs are fuzzy and mixed up. If I restart Chrome then the problem is gone.\n2. Same thing as above happens on Thunderbird too.\n3. I have also faced random monitor black-outs, when both monitors go black for a moment, then return to the desktop with no problem\n4. I, at some point, have seen random screen artifacts (black dots) on right click menus and on different app window menus (which I haven't faced again after some driver updates at some point)\n5. Lastly I have faced BSOD with an \"VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR\" stop code\nThe strange thing is that when I play games or when I'm editing video/images with the Adobe software, I don't have any issues whatsoever, and the general gaming performance is as expected. Just to clarify, I haven't had these issues on the GTX 780Ti.\nJust downloaded the latest NVIDIA driver (388.43) but I expect to see these problems again since I've been updating the GPU drivers as soon as they appear. On a side note, I have just upgraded to a Ryzen 7 1700 on an MSI X370 Gaming Plus motherboard and with Corsair Vengeance LED 16GB DDR4-3200MHz, but haven't received all parts to build the new PC yet. I'm just hoping that I won't face these problems on the new clean setup.\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated! Should I try to test the GPU somehow or should I RMA it?\nThanks in advance", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:28.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a465a560684fe43e339f04093dcb65652927aa0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR98uB0fySmkef48VQHdROnSFvvkeS4gDx8ovj4wHL93gFY6_XXZ_qHUXdlN3fIlwk-", "site_full": "af.reuters.com", "site": "reuters.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/AFRICAegyptNews", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Reuters: Egypt News", "title": "Egypt to sell $1 bln in dollar-denominated one-year treasury bills - Cbank", "title_full": "Egypt to sell $1 bln in dollar-denominated one-year treasury bills - Cbank", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/images/rcom-default.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6a465a560684fe43e339f04093dcb65652927aa0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR98uB0fySmkef48VQHdROnSFvvkeS4gDx8ovj4wHL93gFY6_XXZ_qHUXdlN3fIlwk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "Egypt to sell $1 bln in dollar-denominated one-year treasury bills - Cbank", "text": "December 7, 2017 / 9:32 AM / in 26 minutes Egypt to sell $1 bln in dollar-denominated one-year treasury bills - Cbank Reuters Staff 1 Min Read CAIRO, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Egypt will sell $1 billion in dollar-denominated, one-year treasury bills on December 11, the central bank said on Thursday.

Two people were burned in one new hot spot, known as the Lilac Fire, which was about 45 miles north of San Diego. Officials didn't release the nature of the injuries to the burn victims nor give their conditions. The 4,100-acre fire is moving at an \"extremely rapid rate,\" and burning west toward the Vista and Oceanside communities, officials said. A total of 20 structures were destroyed, according to Cal Fire. Many of those were mobile homes in a community next to where the fire started, said Ron Lane, the deputy chief administrative officer for San Diego County. Read More To the north in Ventura County, the numbers were much more ominous. The four-day old Thomas Fire had burned 115,000 acres and destroyed 439 buildings, damaging 85 others. Another new fire, just to the north of the Lilac Fire, had consumed 300 acres. That blaze, called the Liberty Fire, is 10% contained. The wildfires are testing the stamina of firefighters and military personnel, who have been laboring almost nonstop. On top of exhaustion from the long hours, they're also trying to stave off the effects of smoke inhalation and the airborne embers irritating their eyes. At least 190,000 residents have been evacuated as 5,700 firefighters work to contain the blazes, Cal Fire officials said. \"Honestly, the firefighters are taking a beating, but we have to acknowledge the residents because they're taking a beating, too, but they're cooperating with our orders,\" Thomas Kruschke, spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department, said earlier. See photos of the fierce wildfires in Southern California The state National Guard's 146th Airlift Wing out of Oxnard has also joined the fight, even though roughly 50 of the National Guardsmen involved had to be evacuated themselves, said spokeswoman Maj. Kimberly Holman. Three lost their homes in the blazes, she said. The fires have pushed 110,000 Californians from their homes. Compounding problems Thursday were dry weather and merciless winds, with gusts predicted to reach the strength of a Category 1 hurricane in mountainous areas. Almost half of the total number of firefighters are assigned to the massive Thomas Fire alone, officials said. Officials have shut down hundreds of schools spanning at least 16 districts. It could go down as one of the most destructive fires in state history , and at one point, spread over 31,000 acres in the span of about nine hours -- roughly an acre a second. At that rate, it would have consumed New York's Central Park in about 15 minutes. The plume from the fire stretches 1,000 miles into the Pacific Ocean.

As he filmed the \"heartbreaking\" scene in his Ventura neighborhood, where six neighbors' homes had been reduced to rubble, he explained he had to rush back to the hospital to see his wife and newborn. \"My little fire baby decided today was the day,\" he said.

Police drove through the neighborhood announcing a mandatory evacuation around 4:30 a.m., he said. The family's car was already packed with hospital bags, changes of clothes, laptops, photos, passports, dog food and important financial documents. Why the California wildfires are spreading so quickly \"Last trip back inside I grabbed my ketubah off the wall and headed out,\" he said, using the Hebrew word for a wedding contract. On Thursday, Rosenberg and his wife were staying with his in-laws in Carpinteria, about 25 minutes from Ventura, and \"We can see the billowing smoke clouds in the distance,\" he said. Purple is the new red The battle to contain the blaze is especially difficult on the Santa Barbara-Ventura County line, where the terrain is steep and rugged, said Kruschke, the Ventura County fire official. Fire officials hope to get as many as a dozen helicopters in the air Thursday, but the winds have been playing havoc on the choppers and fixed-wing aircraft, he said. Thursday afternoon, in the eerie, sepia-colored haze, firefighters could be seen setting a back fire on the northwest flank of the Thomas Fire. Well before sundown, the back fires added more smoke but seemed to help hold a fire line built in a canyon on the county line.

For most people this is not due to a lack of initial motivation. We do, but as time goes on, it is very common to feel less motivated. There are ways you can stay motivated. This article will describe how to be one of those fortunate people who takes off the weight and stays at goal weight.\n\nIt is essential that you know your purposes for working out before setting up a plan. You need to figure out if you just want to lose a few pounds, or if you are planning to see significant changes in both weight and size. Is your goal to increase your energy output by having a regular exercise program? What is your end goal?\n\nConsider starting a weight loss diary. This can be as simple as recording what foods you eat and noting their effect on your weight loss. By using a weight loss journal, you can can check on your progress. If you find that you are not sticking to your plan, you can change where you\u2019re going wrong to get back on track.\n\nIt is best to shop for and prepare food when you are full. When you are hungry, you lose sight of your goals. If you carry a healthy snack with you, you are less likely to overindulge with junk food. Try bringing your lunch from home to avoid restaurants. Eating in is a fabulous way to shed weight and save your hard earned cash.\n\nA truly great weight loss plan will focus on both diet and exercise. You have to take the time for physical activities that you actually want to do. If you just can\u2019t seem to find the time to workout, try incorporating exercise into more enjoyable activities. Do you enjoy spending time with your friends? Take them on in a game of basketball. Do you enjoy dancing the night away? Hit a Jazzercise class! Are you more comfortable with nature? Go on a hike in the great outdoors or explore your local park.\n\nEliminate unhealthy food options from all places that you spend time at. It may seem cruel, but the reality is that if it isn\u2019t there, you won\u2019t be tempted to eat it. After removing the junk food, stock those areas with healthy food choices that will be readily available to you. Store a bunch of healthy snacks around, such as trail mix, nuts, fruits and vegetables, for those times when you must eat something quickly.\n\nInvite a friend to workout with you. In many cases, if there is nobody to keep us accountable, we tend to slack off and neglect what is best for us. When you work out with a friend, it is more likely you will keep going. You can also help each other by giving helpful advice, motivation when needed and encouragement when someone reaches a hump in their weight loss journey.\n\nClick Discover The Full Story ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:28.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5cbe454c3ce64dba739ac50b4597eafa7aafcfcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsK3zEc1jpKyM6D43kbCXlSOdpYK6pFUQTPIGE2HpDz9uDSnmIRhGj2xZAo5Uk6nL31mXGpKuNegnnh2UDsEJw.FUq6MWXv79CNDFBaqn4r4A--", "site_full": "medicinebyalexandros.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://medicinebyalexandros.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Medicine by Alexandros G.Sfakianakis", "title": "Larvicidal Activity against Aedes aegypti and Chemical Characterization of the Inflorescences of Tagetes patula", "title_full": "Larvicidal Activity against Aedes aegypti and Chemical Characterization of the Inflorescences of Tagetes patula", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5cbe454c3ce64dba739ac50b4597eafa7aafcfcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsK3zEc1jpKyM6D43kbCXlSOdpYK6pFUQTPIGE2HpDz9uDSnmIRhGj2xZAo5Uk6nL31mXGpKuNegnnh2UDsEJw.FUq6MWXv79CNDFBaqn4r4A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexandros G.

BF was fractionated by reversed-phase polyamide column chromatography, obtaining 34 subfractions, which were subjected to HSCCC, where patuletin and patulitrin were isolated. CAE and the fractions BF, EAF, DF, and AQF were analyzed by LC-DAD-MS, and patuletin and patulitrin were determined as the major substances in EAF and BF, respectively. BF was also analyzed by HPLC and capillary electrophoresis (CE), and patulitrin was again determined to be the main substance in this fraction. CAE and the semipurified fractions (750, 500, 300, 100, and 50\u2009mg/L) were assayed for larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti, with mortality rate expressed as percentage. All fractions except AQF showed insecticidal activity after 24\u2009h exposure of larvae to the highest concentration. However, EAF showed the highest activity with more than 50% reduction in larval population at 50\u2009mg/L.

To tie in with the channel's commemorative programming during 2017 it has lined up a modern take on one of its most nostalgic programmes with a Thingummygig Hogmanay Ceilidh . Thingummyjig was one of STV's most-watched shows in the 1970s and 80s; its combination of traditional Scottish music and dance - with top variety acts such as Andy Stewart, Fran and Anna, Alasdair Gillies, The Tartan Lads, and The John Carmichael Band - consistently won the programme top ratings. \nHost Jack McLaughlin - better known to millions as the Laird O' Coocaddens - fast became a household name and Thingummyjig 's lively blend of varied entertainment and tongue-in-cheek tone turned it into a cult classic. Subsequent stage shows proved so popular that they sold out at venues across the country. \nSTV Head of Programmes Paul Hughes said: ' We know Hogmanay is about fun, family and traditions for our viewers and nothing says that more than a big ceilidh. Our 60 anniversary gave us the perfect opportunity to do just that in conjunction with one of STV's most loved shows. \n'I'm delighted Jack and the John Carmichael Band are joining us to provide the perfect Hogmanay soundtrack for viewers at home. They will be treated to a night of Scottish ceilidh classics and a host of well kent faces including Glen Michael, Eileen McCallum, Archie McPherson, Kris Commons, Lisa Hague and Jesse Rae as well as many of STV's current stars.' \nSTV's Thingummyjig Hogmanay Ceilidh show, which will air from 11.30 on Sunday 31 December to 00.30 on 1 January, comes from the stunning surroundings of St Andrew's in the Square in Glasgow. The splendid 18 century A-listed former church is an appropriate venue for a splendid traditional ceilidh as it is now the home of Glasgow's Centre for Scottish Culture, promoting Scottish music song and dance. \nJack McLaughlin said: 'I can't wait to meet up with a great bunch of hoochter teuchter pals at our very swanky sunny dunny for STV's Thingummyjig Hogmanay Ceilidh. I'll be waggling my wallies once again and asking everyone to join me for a fun night of Scottish music and dance - so I hope everyone at home will be tuning in from their single ends and buts and bens as we see the old year out and bring in the new.' \nEnds. \nFor further information, please contact the STV press office:\nEllen Drummond : 0141 300 3341 / 07803 970143 / [email protected] \nAnna Hendry: 0141 300 3830 / 07921 494654 / [email protected] \nSTV Group plc published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:51:08 UTC . \nOriginal document http://www.stvplc.tv/blog/2017/12/thingummyjig-returns-for-stv-60th-anniversary-hogmanay-ceilidh \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/0C501E5A20FA10A31A7750F6759C7A2E9B646B5D", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul hughes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glen michael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesse rae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john carmichael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa hague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alasdair gillies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thingummyjig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "archie mcpherson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eileen mccallum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ellen drummond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack mclaughlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna hendry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kris commons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stv", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "john carmichael band", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st andrew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stv group plc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:28.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c61a2f63f4eecc84ae270febf4d1c38aae586f55", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodeJQIf95jZCeP24GzEnF6S0hD8uFzWerRR69Mei3FDbzrqIJzkqwLAGxIDmOXy0FDA0fDI0hHwMKFV8.pILWpuEtNjA0k2A287n8OebJwUMhm9XYVgrQoWbRBFRFRUwy5Q--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/politics/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Political Talk | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "/pol/ thread and beyond (++, 4/10/20) Unraveling Threads of Everything Thread | Page 350", "title_full": "/pol/ thread and beyond (++, 4/10/20) Unraveling Threads of Everything Thread | Page 350 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T06:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c61a2f63f4eecc84ae270febf4d1c38aae586f55", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodeJQIf95jZCeP24GzEnF6S0hD8uFzWerRR69Mei3FDbzrqIJzkqwLAGxIDmOXy0FDA0fDI0hHwMKFV8.pILWpuEtNjA0k2A287n8OebJwUMhm9XYVgrQoWbRBFRFRUwy5Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "zatetic", "published": "2017-12-07T06:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "/pol/ thread and beyond (++, 4/10/20) Unraveling Threads of Everything Thread | Page 350", "text": "Quote: :\nIf even half of what Q has laid out is true it\u2019s probably best that the worst of this never comes out to the masses.\nWrong.\nThe horrors that have been covered up have gone on throughout humanity a long time.

Courtesy Josh Rosales/U.S. Air Force/Handout via REUTERS The annual U.S.-South Korean \u201cVigilant Ace\u201d exercises feature 230 aircraft, including some of the most advanced U.S. stealth warplanes, and come a week after North Korea tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to date, which it says can reach all of the United States. North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry blamed the drills and \u201cconfrontational warmongering\u201d by U.S. officials for making war inevitable. \u201cThe remaining question now is: when will the war break out?\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it.\u201d China, North Korea\u2019s neighbour and lone major ally, again urged calm and said war was not the answer, while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said North Korea wanted direct talks with the United States to seek guarantees on its security, something Moscow was ready to facilitate. \u201cWe hope all relevant parties can maintain calm and restraint and take steps to alleviate tensions and not provoke each other,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. \u201cThe outbreak of war is not in any side\u2019s interest. The ones that will suffer the most are ordinary people.\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on the sidelines of a conference in Vienna that U.S. military exercises and aggressive rhetoric were causing an unacceptable escalation in tension. Lavrov said he had passed on to Tillerson Pyongyang\u2019s desire for direct talks. \u201cWe know that North Korea wants above all to talk to the United States about guarantees for its security. We are ready to support that, we are ready to take part in facilitating such negotiations,\u201d Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said direct talks with North Korea were \u201cnot on the table until they are willing to denuclearize.\u201d \u201cIt is something that Russia says it agrees with; it is something China has said it agrees with, and many other nations around the world as well,\u201d she told a regular briefing. Nauert said North Korea was \u201cnot showing any interest in sitting down and having any kind of serious conversations when they continue to fire off ballistic missiles.\u201d Another State Department spokesperson, Justin Higgins, said it was not enough for North Korea to freeze its nuclear programme, and it \u201cmust be prepared to come to the table ready to chart a course to \u2018cease and roll back\u2019\u201d that programme. China\u2019s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zheng Zeguang was to meet Matt Pottinger, the head of Asian affairs at the White House\u2019s National Security Council, on Thursday to discuss North Korea and trade, a senior U.S. official said.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji Tensions have risen markedly in recent months over North Korea\u2019s development, in defiance of repeated rounds of U.N. sanctions, of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the United States. Last week\u2019s missile test prompted a U.S. warning that North Korea\u2019s leadership would be \u201cutterly destroyed\u201d if war were to break out. The Pentagon has mounted repeated shows of force after North Korean tests. STRATEGIC BOMBERS In September, after North Korea\u2019s sixth and largest nuclear test, B-1Bs flew further north along North Korea\u2019s coast than at any time in the past 17 years. The sortie prompted Pyongyang\u2019s foreign minister to warn that U.S. bombers could be shot down even if they did not enter North Korean airspace. Yang Uk, a senior fellow at the Korea Defence and Security Forum, said B-1Bs would be key to any strike targeting major North Korean facilities. Slideshow (2 Images) \u201cB-1B bombers have been regularly dispatched to the Korean peninsula over the past years; however, it seems that the U.S. Air Force might have enhanced its training to better prepare for actual warfare,\u201d he said. Both sides insist they don\u2019t want war, while saying they will act to defend themselves. U.S. national security adviser H.R. McMaster said at the weekend the possibility of war was \u201cincreasing every day.\u201d He said Trump was prepared to take action against North Korea but was working to convince China, Russia and others to do more to press Pyongyang to get it to give up its weapons programs. U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged the Pentagon on Sunday to start moving U.S. military dependants out of South Korea, saying conflict with North Korea was getting close. The Pentagon said it has \u201cno intent\u201d to move out any dependants. On Wednesday, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, raised doubts about U.S. participation in the Olympic Winter Games in South Korea in February, telling Fox News that Washington was concerned about its citizens. However, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Thursday the United States looked forward to participating in the games and was engaged with South Korea and other nations to secure the venues. North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and the United States and says its weapons programmes are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. The rising tensions coincide with a rare visit to North Korea by United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman, the highest-level U.N. official to visit North Korea since 2012. Some analysts and diplomats hope his visit could spark a U.N.-led effort to defuse tensions. Feltman met North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho on Thursday, North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency said.

When he moves to Hyderabad, he gets a chance to take up a high-profile case. To win this case, he has to compete with top-most criminal lawyer Rajpal (Sai Kumar) who is defending a rich youngster Rohith who is accused of drunken driving causing the death of six people. He gets setbacks initially but he soon starts finding his strength. How he gathers evidence and how he turns a real hero forms the rest of the movie. \nOxygen Review: First half runs on flimsy sequences | Thiruttu Payale 2 review: An engaging watch | Jawaan review: An average action entertainer \nSaptagiri LLB is a remake of director Subhash Kapoor\u2019s Bollywood hit Jolly LLB . Subhash Kapoor\u2019s Jolly LLB was a critique of the system that favours rich, makes the lives of the poor difficult. Subhash Kapoor packaged the movie with lot of funny scenes and never missed the undercurrent satire. This Telugu version has also followed the same plotline but it has missed the soul and fun. It has turned out to be a messy and shoddy remake. \nThe writer and directors have included some comedy scenes but they are quite clich\u00e9d and humourless. Till the interval, we don\u2019t know which direction the film is heading as boring sequences continue. The film\u2019s basic story is solid and the final episode has come out well in this Telugu version. \nMain issue of the movie is the direction. All scenes are treated like stitching patches to a cloth than stitching a proper dress. There is no smooth flow of the narration or no heightened drama. \nLuckily, Sai Kumar as criminal lawyer and Siva Prasad as judge with their performances have tried their best to make this watchable. Saptagiri is out of form as far as comedy is concerned but he has done a fairly decent job in the final court drama. \nThe original movie is filled with genuine LOL sequences as well as riveting court episodes with terrific performances from Boman Irani and Saurabh Shukla (he won National Award too). Though Both Sai Kumar and Siva Prasad have given their best shot, it fails to draw the audience in like the original movie did. Don\u2019t know why Saptagiri has indulged in fights and dances in a film that doesn\u2019t require him to act like a mass hero. Moreover, his dance steps and dresses he wore are gaudy. \nAs far as technical values are concerned, the making values and camera work is substandard. Music is pretty bad too. \nNew director has failed to translate the original content\u2019s inherent better moments on to the Telugu version. \nSaptagiri LLB is a shoddy remake of the original Bollywood flick Jolly LLB . Barring the final twenty minutes (court room episode), it is marred by bad direction. \nSaptagiri LLB Review: 2.5/5 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Pantone just announced its selection for the 2018 Color of the Year: Ultra Violet, a purple shade that is sure to prompt passionate discussion among design pros and enthusiasts. Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, says the color \u201ccommunicates originality, ingenuity and visionary thinking.\u201d \nWe spoke with Eiseman about how her team selects the color of the year, and some of the color trends that will influence home decor in 2018. \nPantone\u2019s annual Color of the Year selection makes an impact on the home and interiors industry \u2013 often in ways the average consumer isn\u2019t even aware of.\nFor example, Pantone\u2019s 2016 selection Rose Quartz paved the way for Millennial Pink, a blush hue that made headlines in 2017 thanks to its ubiquity in packaging, logos, and products \u2013 particularly those targeted to young female consumers.\n\u201cThat [selection] really created a spike,\u201d says Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute and author of the recently released book \u201cThe Complete Color Harmony: Pantone Edition.\u201d\n\u201cPink just went everywhere,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt went viral.\u201d Pantone chose the shade because it was reminiscent of rosy cheeks and good health.\nRose Quartz shared the 2016 Color of the Year designation with sister shade Serenity, a soft blue. The delicate colors were chosen for a balance between warm and cool, and to show that pink and blue are no longer gender specific.\n\nPantone proclaimed its 2017 choice, Greenery, a symbol of new beginnings, and \u201cillustrative of flourishing foliage and the lushness of the great outdoors.\u201d This year, perhaps influenced by Greenery, Gen Z Yellow and other vibrant sunny hues have been seen in the home and on the fashion runways.\n\n\u201cVibrant yellow has captured attention because in every society, yellow is sunlight. It means warmth, an enveloping presence, and it makes you happy. It\u2019s a feel-good color,\u201d says Eiseman.\nTrends for 2018 Next year, in addition to Ultra Violet, expect to see a new, exciting spectrum of colors in the interior design world. Pantone\u2019s 2018 home and interiors color palettes include Playful, an array of \u201clollipop colors\u201d that are perfect for a cheery kids\u2019 room.\nPantone\u2019s Playful color palette offers a selection of whimsical hues. On the other end of the spectrum there is Discretion, which feature natural hues and nuanced neutrals, and the Verdure palette\u2019s quieter shades in the green and blue family.\nEiseman also notes a newfound interest in neutrals. Beyond shades like gray, beige, off-white, camel and taupe, a new, exciting category of colors is making its way into the design world. New neutrals like \u201cgreige\u201d (gray-beige) and blush are fun new options for the person who wants a neutral that has a little personality to it.\n\u201cNeutrals started out in a very basic place,\u201d says Eiseman. \u201cWhen you add undertones to neutrals it can be affective and sophisticated. You can add a mauve tone to gray so it\u2019s rosy, not dull and flat.\u201d\nEiseman also recommends embracing the natural world and using neutrals that incorporate green tones.\nSince 1999, when Pantone started selecting a Color of the Year, the interest in color forecasting has grown dramatically. \u201cIt\u2019s just so interesting the way people respond to it,\u201d says Eiseman. \u201cIt really proves how exciting the subject of color it is \u2013 whether you\u2019re a designer or someone who simply loves getting a conversation going about color. It helps to unleash creativity.\u201d\nSignals from many sources From 2016\u2019s delicate pink and blue to 2017\u2019s invigorating Greenery, color trends have dramatically shifted just in a year. So how does Pantone make its predictions about what the next big thing will be?\nFrom art exhibits to animated movies, each year design elements from around the world guide Pantone as they forecast color trends for the year ahead.\n\u201cOur team at Pantone is well-traveled,\u201d Eiseman. \u201cWe go to trade shows in Paris and Milan, and while we\u2019re there we stay in the Design District, so we get a real sense of what is in stores, worn on the street, what exhibits are being shown \u2013 and then we start to connect dots.\u201d\nIn the art world, Pantone stays abreast of current exhibits for artists like David Hockney and Yayoi Kusama , along with the colors that appear in their work.\n\u201cThese shows travel the world and get the buzz out and people start talking about [the art] and the way color is used,\u201d Eiseman says. \u201cThis also enters into our thinking when we are creating a forecast. Yayoi uses bright colors and polka dots, and Hockney uses saturated colors for the most part.\u201d\nEiseman also mentions big worldwide events like the Olympic Games and international auto shows in Los Angeles and Geneva as places where Pantone observes the interplay of hues. \u201cThese are indicators of the future,\u201d she says.\nUsing color in your home When selecting color for your home, many factors come into play. Here Eiseman gives her pro tips on infusing your abode with the right hues.\nInside the home, don\u2019t be afraid of defying tradition . \u201cYou create your fantasy on the inside of your home,\u201d says Eiseman. For instance, Eiseman lives in the gray Pacific Northwest, so she painted her walls in a sunny yellow to evoke a happy mood and the illusion of sun. For your home\u2019s exterior, choose subtle colors . Eiseman warns that painting your home an attention-grabbing color like purple could rub people the wrong way. If you love vibrant colors, paint your front door a bold hue or incorporate bright colors in your pots and plantings. Decide on your comfort level . \u201cWhat do you want your house to feel like?\u201d asks Eiseman. \u201cFigure out what you want your house to represent.\u201d If you want solitude, go with a calming color palette. Or if you love bold color, go all out. Each color sends a different message and evokes a different mood. Set the mood. For a soothing environment, choose quiet colors like Pantone\u2019s Angora White or Dove Gray. For a tinge of warmth, go with Rose Water Pink or Almond Oil. Cooler neutrals include sea spray greens, dew-touched blues or a frosty lavender. Eiseman warns to not exclusively decorate with cool hues, as it can create a cold atmosphere. Create balance . For someone who wants a more \u201cprovocative palette,\u201d Eiseman recommends seductive hues like spicy reds, hot pinks and succulent oranges \u2013 but not exclusively.

Indiatimes.com", "text": "Indiatimes December 07, 2017 \nAfter his highest score of 243 in the third Test against Sri Lanka, Virat Kohli jumped three places to grab the second position among batsmen in the ICC rankings. \nKohli's double ton was followed by a 50 in the second innings as he finished with 610 runs in the series, which India won 1-0 after the first and third Test ended in draws in Kolkata and New Delhi. \nKohli, who slammed back-to-back double-centuries and recorded three-figure scores in three consecutive matches, started the series in sixth position but has leapfrogged David Warner, Cheteshwar Pujara, Kane Williamson and Joe Root after the stupendous run which saw him average 152.50. \nreuters \nThough 45 points separate him from Australia captain Steve Smith, Kohli would be eyeing the chance of reaching the zenith in all three formats since he is the current No. 1 in ODIs and T20Is, the ICC said in a statement. \nSmith though has been in a different league and last week reached 941 points, the joint fifth-highest in terms of the highest points tally in batting history in Tests. Smith is now on 938 points while Kohli is on 893 points. \nFormer Australia captain Ricky Ponting is the only batsman to have been at the top in all three formats at the same time - in December-January 2005-06, while his compatriot Matthew Hayden is the other batsman to have topped all three formats. \nreuters \nThough Smith enjoys a substantial lead over Kohli, the competition for second to fifth positions remains intense. Before this Test, only 11 points separated second-ranked Pujara from fifth-ranked Kohli. \nFollowing the latest performances, the gap has increased slightly with 28 points now separating second-ranked Kohli from fifth-ranked Williamson. \nAmong other Indians, opener Murali Vijay (up three places to 25th) and middle-order batsman Rohit Sharma (up six places to 40th) are the other batsmen to move up. \nreuters ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "virat kohli", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ricky ponting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kane williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe root", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "though smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murali vijay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kohli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohit sharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew hayden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david warner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cheteshwar pujara", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "icc", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "sri lanka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolkata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:30.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "add7535e4f7eecc51dc097c71c782e4fd530fd63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUYnYX.EWCvSktGXgTgjHhmKpughZLW7B2r8Fxt0wRiCXG8J0x5lOC_oYMtaWmq_WuWz3eO0RLt7SnTSKHszeV_VP9WFL6L.G8-", "site_full": "nalert.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://nalert.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Newsalert", "title": "To view yesterday's posts or earlier posts, click on Older Posts below this entry", "title_full": "To view yesterday's posts or earlier posts, click on Older Posts below this entry", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "add7535e4f7eecc51dc097c71c782e4fd530fd63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUYnYX.EWCvSktGXgTgjHhmKpughZLW7B2r8Fxt0wRiCXG8J0x5lOC_oYMtaWmq_WuWz3eO0RLt7SnTSKHszeV_VP9WFL6L.G8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Steve Bartin (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "To view yesterday's posts or earlier posts, click on Older Posts below this entry", "text": "To view yesterday's posts or earlier posts , click on Older Posts below this entry, right below the line on the right hand side.\nTo view yesterday's posts or earlier posts, click on Older Posts below this entry, right below the line on the right hand side.\nTo view yesterday's posts or earlier posts, click on Older Posts below this entry, right below the line on the right hand side.

As the campaign in the state reaches feverish pitch, Gehlot accused Modi of speaking \"only untruths\" and making \"false promises\". Modi has now been \"exposed\" and people are not going to believe him or come under his \"illusion\", says the former Rajasthan Chief Minister. He maintains the Prime Minister is becoming \"furious\" as he senses defeat in the Assembly polls, which is the reason for his \"disgraceful\" attacks on Congress and its legends like Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. \"We want him to attack us more. We want him to abuse our legendary leaders. We will be benefiting as much as he attacks us,\" Gehlot told IANS in an interview. Claiming that the party will win the Gujarat polls with a clear majority, he also attacked the Prime Minister for describing Rahul Gandhi's impending elevation as party chief as \"Aurangzeb raj\". \"We will win this election with a comfortable majority. There is an undercurrent in favour of Congress. See how Modiji is attacking Congress and even its internal elections. A figure like the Prime Minister is attacking Rahul's elevation, and that too by taking the name of a person who is not a Congress member,\" Gehlot said, referring to Shehzad Poonawala. He said it goes to show how the Prime Minister and the entire BJP is \"scared\". \"In fear of defeat he is saying anything in order to get the election agenda diverted from his model of development. He is mocking Congress' internal democracy, but everyone knows that in the BJP the RSS decides who will be Prime Minister, President and Chief Minister. And you are talking about Congress,\" he said. Gehlot was referring to Modi's charge that Nehru was not in favour of reconstructing the Somnath temple and his accusation that Indira Gandhi covered her nose with a handkerchief to avoid the stench when she visited Morbi in 1979 after the Machhu dam flood tragedy. \"It was under Indira Gandhi's leadership that Pakistan was divided. It was one of the world's historic events. There are many more such events with which the new generation is not familiar. They (BJP) are in the habit of misguiding people,\" he said. \"They (PM and BJP) are raising these issues as they have become furious (baukhla gaye hai). Who cares about all this? They may hatch conspiracies to win elections but we don't care. This is all because defeat is at their doorsteps. People of Gujarat are with us. Rahulji (Gandhi) is getting people's love, affection and blessings.\" Continuing his attack on Modi, he said the Prime Minister has \"lost his charisma\" and this is seen during his election rallies too. \"Modiji has fooled people in the name of Vibrant Gujarat. Go to the villages of Gujarat and you will find the reality of development called 'Modi model'. He has been exposed. Which class of society is happy with him? From farmers to labourers and from youths to business class, all are unhappy. Now people of Gujarat are not going to believe him. They are not going to come under his fake claims. \"You can see this on the ground. Earlier crowds used to chant 'Modi, Modi' in his rallies. Now what is happening? Chairs remain vacant. Where have they gone - those who used to chant his name?\" he asked. \"His graph is shrinking. Now people have acknowledged their (BJP) lie. They speak only untruth and make false promises. People still remember the promises of bringing back black money, two crore employment every year and getting Rs 15 lakh into their bank accounts.\" The Congress General Secretary in charge of Gujarat said that Rahul Gandhi's elevation to the party President's post will impact the country's politics a lot and youth would come forward under his leadership. \"I believe the young generation will come forward under his leadership. We were also youth. I became MP at an age of 28 and then became PCC President, General Secretary, Union Minister and Chief Minister. Today there are four General Secretaries in AICC, who were youths during Indira Gandhi's regime. This is the speciality of the Congress that it gives opportunities to the new generation. \"Rahulji will do the same. He will take benefit from the experience of senior leaders and will move ahead with the youth,\" he said. Describing BJP as a party of \"hypocrites\" he said that they are \"embracing Gandhiji, whom they killed\". \"Sardar Patel banned RSS and now they are claiming their birth right on him. After being humiliated by public throughout their journey from Jan Sangh to Janata Party and now BJP, they are doing divisive politics in the name of Congress. \"In the early years they did politics in the name of cow and its protection. They then raked up the issue of Ram temple. And now when they are in power they are again doing politics in the name of cow and trying to divide the country,\" he said. On Rahul Gandhi's temple visits, he said that there was nothing new in this as Sonia Gandhi also began her election campaign in 2007 from Ambaji temple. \"She used to campaign by helicopter and temples don't exist in air. Rahulji is travelling through roads and he goes to temples on the way,\" he said.
