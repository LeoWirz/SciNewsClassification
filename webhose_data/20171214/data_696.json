If in any jurisdiction, any part of this disclaimer is held to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such part of this disclaimer shall be restricted or eliminated to the minimum extent and the remaining disclaimer shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. \nPlease note the information presented is deemed representative at the time of its original release. Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

There were certain suggestions that kept coming up over and over again, so I decided to put together a list that I shared with the team. Here are my 3 (+1 bonus) most common code review suggestions. Suggestion 1: Throw an exception when things go wrong A common pattern I have seen is this: This pattern actually caused an outage in one of the mobile apps I worked on. The search backend we were using started throwing exceptions. However, the app\u2019s API server had some code similar to the above. Therefore, from the perspective of the app it was getting a 200 successful response and happily showed an empty list for every single search query. If instead the API had thrown an exception, then our monitoring systems would have picked this up immediately and it would have been fixed. There are lots of times when it may be tempting to just return an empty object after you\u2019ve caught an exception. Examples of empty objects in Java are Optional.empty(), null, and empty list. A place where this comes up all the time is in URL parsing. Instead of returning null if the URL can\u2019t be parsed from a String, ask yourself: \u201cWhy is the URL malformed? Is this a data issue we should be fixing upstream?\u201d. Empty objects are not the right tool for this job. If something is exceptional you should throw an exception . Suggestion 2: Use the most specific type possible This suggestion is basically the opposite of stringly typed programming . Too often I see code like these examples: Using the most specific type possible allows you to avoid a whole class of bugs and is basically the entire reason for choosing strongly typed language like Java in the first place. So now the question is: how do well-intentioned programmers end up writing bad stringly typed code? The answer: because the external world is not strongly typed. There are a number of different places where strings come from, such as: query and path parameters in urls JSON databases that don\u2019t support enums poorly written libraries In all these cases, you should use the following strategy to avoid this problem: keep string parsing and serialization to the fringes of your program . Here\u2019s an example: This confers a number of advantages. Malformed data is found immediately; the application fails early if there are any problems. You also don\u2019t have to keep catching parsing exceptions throughout the entire application once the data has been validated once. In addition, strong types make for more descriptive method signatures; you don\u2019t need to write as many javadocs on every method. Suggestion 3: Use Optionals instead of nulls One of the best features to come out of Java 8 is the Optional class that represents an entity which could reasonably exist or not exist. Trivia question: what is the only exception to have its own acronym? Answer: a NPE or Null Pointer Exception. It is by far the most common exception in Java and has been referred to as a billion dollar mistake . Optional allows you to completely remove NPEs from your program. However, it must be used correctly. Here\u2019s some advice surrounding theuse of Optional : You should not simply call .get() anytime you have an Optional in order to use it, instead think carefully about the case where the Optional is not present and come up with a sensible default value. If you do not yet have a sensible default value then methods like .map() and .flatMap() allow you to defer this decision until later. If an external library returns null to indicate the empty case, then immediately wrap the value using Optional.ofNullable() . Trust me, you will thank yourself later. nulls have a tendency to \u201cbubble up\u201d inside programs so it\u2019s best to stop them at the source. Use Optional in the return type of methods. This is great because then you don\u2019t need to read the javadoc to figure out whether it\u2019s possible for the value to not be present. Bonus Suggestion: \u201cUnlift\u201d methods whenever possible You should try to avoid methods that look like this: What do all the avoid methods have in common? They are using container objects like Optional, List, or Task as method parameters. It\u2019s even worse when the return type is the same kind of container (ie. a one param methods takes an Optional and returns an Optional). Why?1) Promise<A> method(Promise<B> param) is less flexible than simply having 2) A method(B param) . If you have a Promise<B> then you can use 1) or you can use 2) by \u201clifting\u201d the function with .map . (ie. promise.map(method) ). However, if you have just B then you can easily use 2) but you can\u2019t use 1), which makes 2) the much more flexible option.

In the battle of Dilwale vs Bajirao Mastani, it was Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period drama which won. Buzz had it that clash is set to repeat itself on Christmas 2018 with Simmba clashing with SRK's swarf film. But Rohit Shetty has averted the clash by pushing the release date of Simmba by a week. Ranveer Singh-starrer Simmba will now release on December 28. A source told BollywoodLife, \"Rohit Shetty wanted to release Simmba on December 21, 2018. But when he realised that Shah Rukh Khan\u00e2??s Aanand L Rai film had already booked the slot, he decided to push his movie by a week. With the long holiday period, there is an assurance that Simmba will do well at the box office even though it releases after Christmas. In fact, with the ongoing festivities and the quirky, entertaining theme of the film, Rohit is confident that it will be a huge hit with the masses. Both Karan and Rohit are also close to Shah Rukh, so they did not want to get into any box office battle for screens with the superstar. They were assured of a considerable screen space post December 28 and they grabbed it.\"However, this is not the first time that a box-office clash has been averted.", "highlightText": "",

Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

I think of it like going to a party full of people in a huge room. There is no way I can get to everyone I want to talk.

CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

\u2013 Hannah Peel \u201d Ian says: December 6, 2017 at 2:11 pm \nImagine my surprise earlier this year when I heard a song on an indie/alternative radio station which sounded suspiciously like 1970s -era Steely Dan. Of course Todd Rundgren\u2019s collaboration with Donald Fagen on \u201cTin Foil Hat\u201d draws heavily on Fagen\u2019s vocals, but is only one of 12 collaborations included on Todd\u2019s new album \u201cWhite Knight\u201d. With guest appearances from the aforementioned Fagen, Trent Reznor, Robyn, Joe Satriani, Joe Walsh & Daryl Hall & many others, the album is a compendium of musical styles. Sadly, while some of the tracks work well, not many of them work very well. While I I liked the track \u201cLook At Me\u201d, produced with hip-hop artist/movie producer Michael Holman, none of the videos I found for this song match the quality of the album tracks.

CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data.

Scientists Turn Beer Into Fuel The team's key finding is that their catalysts will convert beer (or specifically, the ethanol in beer) into butanol. World | Press Trust of India | Updated: December 07, 2017 15:25 IST Share PRINT COMMENTS The research group does not want beer on an industrial scale and compete with food crops London, United Kingdom: Scientists have made the first step towards creating sustainable petrol using beer as a key ingredient.One of the most widely used sustainable alternatives to petrol world-wide is bio-ethanol, according to researchers at University of Bristol in the UK.However, ethanol is not an ideal replacement for petrol as it has issues such as lower energy density, it mixes too easily with water and can be fairly corrosive to engines.A much better fuel alternative is butanol but this is difficult to make from sustainable sources.Scientists at Bristol's School of Chemistry have been working for several years to develop technology to convert widely-available ethanol into butanol.\"The alcohol in alcoholic drinks is actually ethanol - exactly the same molecule that we want to convert into butanol as a petrol replacement,\" said Professor Duncan Wass, whose team led the study published in the journal Catalysis Science & Technology.\"So alcoholic drinks are an ideal model for industrial ethanol fermentation broths - ethanol for fuel is essentially made using a brewing process,\" said Wass.\"If our technology works with alcoholic drinks (especially beer which is the best model) then it shows it has the potential to be scaled up to make butanol as a petrol replacement on an industrial scale,\" he said.The technology used to convert ethanol into butanol is called a catalyst - these are chemicals which can speed up and control a chemical reaction and are already widely used in the petrochemical industry.The team's key finding is that their catalysts will convert beer (or specifically, the ethanol in beer) into butanol.In demonstrating that catalysts work with a 'real' ethanol mixture, the team has demonstrated a key step in scaling this technology up to industrial application.\"We would not actually want to use beer on an industrial scale and compete with potential food crops,\" said Wass.\"But there are ways to obtain ethanol for fuel from fermentation that produce something that chemically is very much like beer - so beer is an excellent readily available model to test our technology,\" he said.Another advantage of this approach is that it is quite similar to many existing petrochemical processes, researchers said.The next step in terms of application is to build this larger scale process and, based on previous processes, this could take as long as five years even if everything went well, they said.\"Beer is actually an excellent model for the mixture of chemicals we would need to use in a real industrial process, so it shows this technology is one step closer to reality,\" he said.

REUTERS\nIndia on Thursday refrained from reiterating its long-held view that eastern part of the holy city of Jerusalem should be the capital of Palestine even as it declined to toe the US line to recognise the holy city s the capital of Israel.\n\"India's position on Palestine is independent and consistent.

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, too, had visited Palestine after touring Israel in January 2016, just as one of her predecessors, S M Krishna, had done in October 2012.\nIndia was the first non-Arab country to recognise Palestine way back in 1988.\nBut New Delhi's growing ties with Israel after the BJP's ascent to power in May 2014 fuelled speculation about India reviewing its position on Palestine.\nThe Narendra Modi government made it clear that while India would continue to support the cause of Palestine, it would also seek to build stronger ties with Israel.\nNew Delhi is now set to host Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is likely to visit India next month.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "palestine anirban bhaumik", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krishna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sushma swaraj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pranab mukherjee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raveesh kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mukherjee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dh news service", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "united nations security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united state of palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "solidarity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramallah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kfar aqab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:22.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5757e86e63665f5fc00456f119e850fc6ab3f0ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Qb6m4ieU938XRp29sGltiwzMMrNxtArS.DQQavX9i5p20E.Ybe20dskxr7HvU48P0gYEcNG5uxQkuIbz8hpMNv1x7QmwPrdTKpi7bvpjynw--", "site_full": "www.deccanherald.com", "site": "deccanherald.com", "site_section": "http://www.deccanherald.com/rss/news.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Deccan Herald -

But there's a lot more that's on offer when it comes to the Urus and we tell you all there is to know about Lamborghini's SUV The Lamborghini Urus is based on the MLB platform that underpins the Bentley Bentayga, Porshce Cayenne, and the Audi Q7. Lamborghini says the Urus is every bit performance-oriented with a highe centre of gravity, while the the central turbocharger is placed near the combustion chambers for an enhanced engine response. The Urus comes with rear wheel steering for better dexterity The Lamborghini Urus gets a 4.0-litre Twin Turbo V8 engine, a first turbo in the automaker's history The engine is tuned to produce 641 bhp and 850 Nm of peak torque, while the performance SUV can hit the 0-100 kmph in 3.6 seconds and 200 kmph in 12.8 seconds. The V8 engine is paired with an 8-speed torque converter, and comes with a central torsion differential 4 Wheel Drive with torque vectoring rear differential. The Urus has a top speed of 305 kmph, which is not bad at all for something that weighs 2.2 tonnes and this makes it the fastest SUV in the world. The suspension setup on the Lamborghini Urus is adaptive and can be adjusted to meet the race track requirements on that on irregular road surfaces. The Italian SUV comes with 21-inch wheels as standard, which can be specced up to 23-inches. The design has pretty much similar to the what the concept promised but with improvements. Lamborghini retains its extravagance with the Urus as well, but this one certainly looks a lot more practical. The Urus will launch in India on January 11 2018 in Mumbai. That is just 38 days after its global debut - and a launch this quick in India almost unheard of in any market segment.

Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

Played .5 of the game with the wrong rules- interestingly, MIL said it wasn't a game because she didn't groan over a bad decision. When we did, there were groans a-plenty. Very interesting little card driven game with a neat stock system. Am wary of trying the included expansions, to the point where I probably never will, as the simple tight package of the original is more than enough for me.

It's become a family staple, and I feel like, as a result, we've all hit a higher level of play. Megan and I tried to hit the bauers, where as MIL picked up the quacksalber and adeliger and with the zigeuner pushing the patriarch to the back, churned the special deck. She also, powered by the quacksalber and pflanzerin, and the newly acquired cinnamon prince (she had two by the end) and schmied, tore up the contracts, especially making sure to steal any fields from me and Megan. I was donkey shy, Megan was gold shy, and in the end MIL took it by at least a turn. I'm really loving all the subtlety in this game. It also feels interesting, as it's an anti-engine game in that it's only 25 points- which comes up fairly quickly, and it also constantly throws inefficiencies in your way with the patriarch.
