The centre will be an important place for research on social and economic issues,\u201d the prime minister said. \nModi added that the government had developed five places related to Babasaheb Ambedkar into pligrimage spots. He added that the five pilgrimage spots, in Delhi, Mumbai, Nagpur, Mhow and London, were like homage from the present generation. \n\u201cI think that this centre is for the youth\u2026 where they can see and understand the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar,\u201d the prime minister said.

Previously the government said more than 733,000 people had been vaccinated. \nSanofi\u2019s announcement last week caused great concern in the Philippines \u2013 where the mosquito-borne disease is extremely prevalent. \nThe French company on Monday sought to allay concerns, saying Dengvaxia would not cause anyone who was immunised to die and would not cause a dengue infection. \nHowever, Duque said Sanofi\u2019s recent statements on Dengvaxia were \u201cconfusing\u201d. \nDuque said he may ask Sanofi to refund 1.4 billion pesos (US$27.6 million) worth of unused Dengvaxia supplies. \nHe added the government might also demand Sanofi set up an \u201cindemnity fund\u201d to cover the hospitalisation cost for children vaccinated under the public programme who would fall ill. \nSanofi was not immediately available to comment on Duque\u2019s remarks. \nAsked if the government would sue Sanofi if allegations of a lack of transparency were proved, Duque said: \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to get there.\u201d \nHe added: \u201cIf it\u2019s found out that (Sanofi) withheld material information that would have changed the outcome of all of these problems and the decision makers of the Department of Health in the previous administration, then they are liable.\u201d \nDuque said congressional hearings into the issue would start next week.

(click to show/hide) My current job doesn't use much of my mathematical or programming abilities, and I thought that a forum game with those in mind might be fun. Currently, I was interesting in thinking about Markov Chains, and how most forum games on here consist of discrete time intervals with probabilistic movements from one state to the next. These are not true Markov Chains, otherwise the player would have no input into the outcome, but I've decided to visualize the game as a series of Markov Moments, which behave as though piece of a Markov Chain, and non-Markov Moments, in which the player acts in a non-probabilistic manner.\nBy it's nature, I hope to be able to add more to the game as we go, but for now, there's going to be three aspects which are controlled in this manner.\nSpoiler: Markov Traits (click to show/hide) The Economy, Military, and Culture of your kingdom can exist in one of six levels, detailed below. Without your intervention, there is a relatively high chance that these attributes remain the same from turn to turn, and a relatively small chance that the either increase or decrease. The value at the level determines their effect on the dice you roll. Every action that uses one of these traits will be evaluated by rolling (3+n)d6, with the n being the level of the trait. Every die above a 3 is counted as a success. Different actions will be given different difficulties, and if the number of successes exceeds the difficulty, then the action is successful. If you fail by two or more the tested trait may be lowered. Successes by two or more can carry additional benefits subject to my whims. This means it\u0092s risky to overextend your resources.\nLevel", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6cecb2bddea18a91ade8edd808d00c52fb32e99d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuid9zOJBUpavo-", "site_full": "www.bay12forums.com", "site": "bay12forums.com", "site_section": "http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?board=15.0", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "Forum Games and Roleplaying", "title": "Markov's Kingdoms [OOC]", "title_full": "Markov's Kingdoms [OOC]", "published": "2017-12-05T09:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 76718, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8617eb6d569c77d8a28e18fff6e0e2b94e24fb25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuioLbjkmTQSZqD1QMs53jP5DZkckIqWH0D", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "UristMcChladni", "published": "2017-12-05T17:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: from: RulerOfNothing on December 05, 2017, 09:01:49 pm Well, I am interested in this.\nSigged.\nBut on a more serious note, if it seems that interest is truly low, and we can't get five people together, we can do it with 3 or 4, and I can either spend less time writing up posts and more time fleshing stuff out till more people pop in, or I can add a very rudimentary AI and have some other un-controlled kingdoms vie for control.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95bec75cc8e77dc5b6f5a169da098012340d6506", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_x2AG.SSUlR8u2xLNHW4RaclcmqxtxoLOmad4nmXcqnGSI3gKimilW", "site_full": "www.uaest.com", "site": "uaest.com", "site_section": "http://www.uaest.com/vb/forumdisplay.php?f=9", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0646\u0648\u0639 -

Their coloration varies widely depending on where they live and who they were born to, but those who live in Cantiera trend towards being either sandy colors or greens and blues. Their natural spines running along their spine and neck are usually are the same color as their scales, but it's not uncommon for them to be more brightly colored, especially in males. They're largely herbivorous, much like their lesser cousins, and enjoy similar things like sunbathing and exotic fruits.\nThose who reside in Cantiera prefer to dress in long, multicolored robes with fancy embellishments along the sleeves and buttons. It's also customary to paint one's spines various colors in regards to their trade, or for various holidays.\nKingdom Background: The kingdom of Cantiera was established originally as a small group of lizardfolk who had taken up residence in the pass as many traders tended to move through their on their journies through the region. As more trade went through the area, it grew from a rest stop into a settlement, and into a full blown town in very little time. It's architecture reflects the rapid boom, as well. The walls and spires are made of adobe, and they twist and turn around old and new buildings alike as it sprawls out from the center of the pass and into the surrounding desert.\nIt's become something of a hub of trade for the nearby area, with many cultures and strange goods passing through almost constantly. As a result of the constant exchange of goods and ideas, the kingdom has become steeped in culture, and the streets are usually filled with banners and flags celebrating several different happenings and holidays from distant lands. Incidentally, the constant movement means that some illicit activities can go more easily unnoticed inside the city walls, and a healthy black market stirs underneath the guards' noses.\nEconomically speaking they're also doing quite well, gold is always moving through the gates of the capitol, along with a healthy stream of dates and agave fruit from the nearby farms. Normally agriculture is difficult, but thanks to an underground aquifer it can be sustained, and is the method by which a majority of the kingdom is fed. That said, a good chunk of food for the kingdom is brought in by traders, requiring it to remain in their good graces.\nKingdom Tags:\nLagging Military\nRobust Economy\nAccelerated Culture\nLeader Name: Chief Cielo Racion\nLeader Appearance: Chief Racion is a tall, regal looking lizardman. He has opalescent blue scales and his spines are embellished with gold paint as a symbol of his status. He's usually seen wearing a yellow silk robe with intricate silver patterns running along its borders. Atop his head are jewels that hang on golden chains adorning his brow and cheeks. He's middle aged for his kind, but his eyes give off the impression that he's wiser than most.\nLeader Background: Cielo Racion is of the Racion line, a family who had only recently come into power after the previous line of leaders had come to an abrupt and strange end as the last child of the Dorado family had suddenly contracted an acute case of raving madness. He had been quickly deposed and replaced with his closest adviser and Cielo's father, Golpe Racion, with very little fanfare or resistance. Golpe's rule was prosperous, but very focused on keeping the status quo with what the Dorado family was largely concerned with- Money. By the time Golpe had passed the economy was booming, but left much of the social life of the kingdom neglected.\nNow, second in the royal line, Cielo had learned from an early age to ensure that he keeps his mind sharp and his wits about him, as well as maintain a healthy circle of advisers to keep tabs on the goings-on of the kingdom.\nSince his life as a child was spent trying to escape the boredom of the financial machine that was his father's rule, Cielo is a very big proponent of schools and the arts, riding off of the economic health of his kingdom, and welcomes outsiders who offer new and interesting ideas to be shared. However, his lack of fear of the outside has left his military rather lacking in some areas, and the cultural growth has been substantial but has still only recently gotten underway.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:50.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6cecb2bddea18a91ade8edd808d00c52fb32e99d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuid9zOJBUpavo-", "site_full": "www.bay12forums.com", "site": "bay12forums.com", "site_section": "http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?board=15.0", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "Forum Games and Roleplaying", "title": "Markov's Kingdoms [OOC]", "title_full": "Markov's Kingdoms [OOC]", "published": "2017-12-05T09:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 76718, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9ae56ed416517d34119180144520c3e0204b4f9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuioLbjkmTQSZrXHmd_6FqZBhE79Iaab8ZF", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "RulerOfNothing", "published": "2017-12-06T09:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: from: RulerOfNothing on December 05, 2017, 09:27:59 pm Actually, can you clarify if you want me to fill out a kingdom sheet right now or not?\nAbsolutely!\nQuote: from: Shadowclaw777 on December 05, 2017, 09:37:27 pm Like this?\nYup!

(click to show/hide) Kingdom Name:Viri S\u00e1nguinum Imperii\nKingdom Location: In a set of High Mountains near a Taiga far to the north where its cold, under the ground.\nKingdom Race: Telrac, Vampiric (Ie drinks blood, doesn't like the sun, doesn't age, pale skin) human like creatures with varying wings (the kind of wings depending on their skills during adolescence, bat like for warriors/hunters, branch like for bureaucrats, metal like for smiths) and hair colors that feast on blood and have regenerative abilities, able to regenerate lost limbs with time. They also grow stronger with age and with more blood drunk and though they don't need it to survive, for pleasure they drink and eat other foods at times. Unlike what one might expect, they are actually alive and not a kind of undead. Should also be mentioned the nation has Dwarven Thralls\nKingdom Background: Long ago, a Kingdom of hardy dwarves existed in the lands now controlled by the Viri S\u00e1nguinum Imperii. However, a race of creatures nearby, known as telrac, slowly grew in numbers, stealing from caravans and raiding small towns for equipment as they moved through the caves and returning to their well hidden lairs controlled by different clans. Over time, as they grew stronger, and fought among themselves and over time, the clans fell one by one until there was only one clan left. Eager to expand their lands, the new king of these creatures revealed themselves, and demanded the dwarves immediate surrender or suffer the consequences. Naturally the dwarves where not content to just surrender all their hard worked lands to some upstart creatures and they prepared themselves for a fight. Over the hundred years of bloody warfare, the telrac changed and became more focused on family lines then the clans they use to be a part of, eventually resulting in clans being a thing of the past, replaced by dynasty's which where much more focused on bloodlines. At the end of the war, during the last siege, the dwarven king fought against the king of the Telrac, and, fittingly, they killed each other. This would have lead to the collapse of the entire nation if Adelina, the current monarch, didn't step in. Of course, with all the damages caused to both the dwarven halls and the Telrac's the self proclaimed empire had a somewhat rocky start, and mostly kept to itself for the longest time, rebuilding and growing in numbers. During that time, another shift in culture happened, resulting in only the highest of positions being tied to nothing but blood and the others based on skill and wisdom resulting in noble positions, especially at lower levels, being chaotic and short lived.\nModern Kingdom Culture: The society of Viri S\u00e1nguinum is one that focuses on age, status, and ability. Very few Young Telrac are in important positions, and the ones that are usually don't last long. Ambition drives most and most in any kind of power jockey for position to gain more power and a higher position along with trying to make alliances to their benefit and their enemy's detriment. They are also vengeful and tend to take betrayal as a personal matter which usually results in some survivors of families of high position that are brought low by an old ally seeking revenge. It also should be noted that the majority of Telrac see other creatures as lesser then them and as such don't mind slavery of non Telrac's and generally are quite prideful of themselves. One particularly odd thing however, is that the military has a sense of honor that the other parts of government and nobility does not, seeking to prove themselves through pure skill without any backstabbing. Despite all this, The upper nobility is mostly content and not too many power struggles happen that high up, and major ones are rare. This is all due to the fact that the risk of doing such things and destabilizing the empire generally leads to the Wrath of the Eternal Monarch, who, generally speaking, is someone no one wants to mess with due to their age and unquestionable skill. Although, that's not to say the constant political infighting results in issues. Usually the upper class wears elegant and fancy clothing, some even wearing cloths of other far away kingdoms to try and impress others. Lower class usually wear more simple cloths, but they are still more interesting to look at and better then one of another nation and race would have. Most Telrac are also to an extent hedonistic, mostly due to the fact that their religion makes them believe the world was made for their enjoyment, and although their religion is for the most part quite free from morals, they still see killing another Telrac outside of a formal duel as bad, however if they get away with it and did it themselves its perfectly okay. Although priests have a immunity from this as killing a priest for any reason is seen as a very very bad thing, unless the priest was trying to kill them first.\nLeader Name: Adelina the Eternal Empress.\nLeader Appearance: Adelina stands at a height of 5,6 ft and has a athletic build and a cello body shape with bat like wings coming from her back. She has Crimson red hair that goes down a bit past her shoulders and green eyes. She usually wears an ornate black dress with a hidden sheath for her rapier along with a few rings of silver and gold and platinum crown encrusted with gems of alexandrite, emerald, Topaz and a single prominent large red diamond.\nLeader Background: Adelina was born a very very long time ago and is one of the oldest Telrac currently alive. She was alive before, and fought through, the entirety of the war against the old dwarven kingdom. Her family at first, wasn't really in much power what so ever, being a minor soldier family with her father and mother both being soldiers who raided dwarven caravans. Naturally, she followed in their footsteps and learned the way of the sword, both figuratively and literally. They weren't anything special at first, but, when the war started, she survived long enough to learn many many things, eventually becoming a general and being responsible for plenty of successful sieges. During the last siege of the war, against the capitol mountainhome, the old King died in battle, and naturally, seeing how he had no heir, she was able to take his place by defeating anyone who challenged her claim in combat. Naturally, over the years she has managed the country, she has been a bit...biased to the military...\nKingdom tags:\nAdvanced Military\nRobust Military\nLagging Economy\nFragile Culture", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:51.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6cecb2bddea18a91ade8edd808d00c52fb32e99d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuid9zOJBUpavo-", "site_full": "www.bay12forums.com", "site": "bay12forums.com", "site_section": "http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?board=15.0", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "Forum Games and Roleplaying", "title": "Markov's Kingdoms [OOC]", "title_full": "Markov's Kingdoms [OOC]", "published": "2017-12-05T09:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 76718, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1855293133f607464ccbabd1264719b5a80baada", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuioLbjkmTQSZqKdvw3XTayKOOv7rlSV6u6", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "Kashyyk", "published": "2017-12-06T20:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: from: UristMcChladni on December 06, 2017, 12:13:22 pm Looks good!
