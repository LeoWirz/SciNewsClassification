Computech PDF Compress is the kind of application that can do just that either by processing one file at a time or by handling them collectively, which, needless to say, saves you a lot of time. Capable of compressing PDF files in batch mode It should be stated from the very beginning that the program is quite easy to handle, especially considering that its set of features is not that varied, and figuring out its inner workings should not take more than a minute or two. As such, the software utility lets you select the PDFs whose size you plan on reducing either one by one or by indicating a folder that contains them all. The next step you need to take is go to the \u201cOptions\u201d section in order to choose one of the four available compression types: screen, ebook, printer, and prepress, each of them corresponding to a quality level. Assesses the success rates of the compression Aside from that, specifying an output location should raise no issues whatsoever, with the possibility of opting for the same path as the source file and even overwriting them in case you don\u2019t want to choose a new destination. This should be it, and once the compression is carried out, the main window becomes populated with all sorts of details about your PDF files: number of pages, original and new size, compression percentage, status, source path, and output directory. As you can see, compressing PDF files is a breeze, and a basic understanding of computer science should be more than enough to enjoy the program\u2019s capabilities. It can reduce the size of your PDFs in batch mode pretty quickly and offers handy info on the success rates, which makes it a pretty useful tool.

Dec. 9", "text": "Founding member of Della Mae to play first solo concert in N.H. Dec. 9 Thursday Dec 7, 2017 at 3:15 AM By Christopher Hislop \nFrom Nashville\u2019s Ryman Auditorium to major festivals including Bonnaroo, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, mandolinist Jenni Lyn Gardner \u2013 who you might recognize from bluegrass band Della Mae \u2013 has had some solid success thus far in her music career (which includes being nominated for a Grammy!). Stepping out of the Della Mae spotlight for a moment, Gardner has released her debut full-length record, \u201cBurn Another Candle,\u201d and will make a stop at the historic Stone Church in Newmarket on Saturday, Dec. 9 in support of the album. \nEDGE caught up with the pickin\u2019 songstress to talk about a life surrounded by music, mandolin, and, of course, Bill Monroe. \nEDGE: Let\u2019s talk about your latest record, \u201cBurn Another Candle.\u201d What sort of goals did you set for yourself when you started in on making this album? \nGardner: I wanted \"Burn Another Candle\" to reflect who I am and the only real goal was to be honest. \nEDGE: Do you enjoy stepping out of the format of a fully collaborative unit/band (Della Mae) to tackle some of your own songs as a solo entity? How does both inspire the other? Are you OK alone? \nGardner: I do - it\u2019s been an outlet for me to do something different from what I do with Della Mae, both are fulfilling, because they're not trying to be the same thing \nEDGE: In general, why music? Why do you seek it? Why do you create it? \nGardner: I was naturally drawn to music early on, and now I do it to challenge myself and to contribute to the genre. \nEDGE: Why the mandolin? What led you to that particular instrument? How does the mandolin challenge and/or inspire you? \nGardner: Mandolin was an instrument that I connected with instantly when I first picked it up at 8 years old. I'm constantly inspired by so many great players and how many different styles of music can be played on it. \nEDGE: Speaking of mandolins, you met the late, great Bill Monroe when you were a kid. How did that moment change the course of your own musical existence (if at all)? How does Bill\u2019s approach to the mandolin inspire or inform your own playing? \nGardner: Bill Monroe was larger than life and a pioneer in every sense of the word. He had his own style and blazed his own trail, and that's what inspires me most about him.

Citing pending investigations, he repeatedly declined to answer questions about either, while also refusing to give an opinion on whether Trump could be accused of obstructing justice. \nBut he did not hesitate to defend the nation's premier law enforcement agency following a weekend of Twitter attacks by Trump, who called the FBI a biased institution whose reputation is \"in Tatters \u2014 worst in History!\" and urged Wray to \"clean house.\" \nThe outburst from the president followed a guilty plea from his former national security adviser for lying to the FBI and the revelation that an agent had been removed from a special team investigating the Trump campaign because of text messages seen as potentially anti-Trump. \nWray, who was nominated as FBI director by Trump, faced Republican criticism over perceived political bias in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of possible Trump campaign ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential election and in the handling a year earlier of an FBI investigation Clinton's use of a private email server that ended without criminal charges. \nWhen asked about Trump's harsh tweets, Wray rebutted him directly, saying, \"My experience has been that our reputation is quite good.\" \nWray expressed pride in the agents, analysts and other personnel who he said were working to protect Americans. But he also conceded that agents do make mistakes and said there are processes in place to hold them accountable. \n\"There is no shortage of opinions out there, but what I can tell you is that the FBI that I see is tens of thousands of agents and analysts and staff working their tails off to keep Americans safe,\" Wray said of the agency he has led for just four months. \"The FBI that I see is tens of thousands of brave men and women working as hard as they can to keep people they will never know safe from harm.\" \nThe White House on Thursday tried to soften Trump's message, denying any discrepancy between his comments and those of the FBI director. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump agrees field agents are \"appreciated and respected,\" but said the president's \"issues are with the political leaders in the FBI under former director Comey, particularly those that played politics with the Hillary Clinton email probe.\" \nThe emphasis on the Clinton and Trump probes reflected how the FBI in the last two years has found itself entangled in American politics, with investigations focused on the Democratic presidential nominee and the Republican president and his successful campaign. Those investigations have transformed routine oversight hearings, like the one Thursday, into platforms for tense questions about the political leanings of an agency that prides itself on being removed from partisan consideration. \nWray's defense of the FBI came after the committee's chairman, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said he was concerned by reports that Peter Strzok, a veteran counterintelligence agent involved in the Clinton investigation, was removed from Mueller's team last summer following the discovery of text messages seen as potentially anti-Trump. \n\"Even the appearance of impropriety will devastate the FBI's reputation,\" Goodlatte said. \nRep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, top Democrat on the House Judiciary panel, predicted Trump's attacks on the FBI will only grow louder as Mueller continues investigating. \"Your responsibility is not only to defend the bureau but to push back against the president when he is so clearly wrong, both on the facts and as a matter of principle,\" Nadler told Wray. \nWray's tenure as the new FBI chief would be difficult even without the intense scrutiny of the Russia investigation.

Remember back in re:Ports days, we were always putting a piece of art on the cover? I thought of it as a regular gallery in print back then,\" Augusta, the book's editor, says. \"Since we sold it. I've watched for something like that to happen, for somebody to pick up what re:Port did - sort of promoting local regional artists.\" \n\"We would put photographers, or different painters in it, and regularly published poetry, short fiction, essays - local artist stuff,\" he says. \nPost re:Ports, he initiated a number of publications highlighting the arts, notably \"Black and White\" in the late '80s, but none took off. Other subsequent Portsmouth publications touched on different areas, he says. There were reviews, occasional poetry, \"but nobody regularly published someone's art.\" \nHe looks at \"Ten Piscataqua\" as an answer. Each release will focus on a different category of art or writing. \"I'm not necessarily claiming each is the best, but they're outstanding in some way.\" \n\"Anyway, this idea has been percolating along for 35 years really,\" Augusta says. \"The idea is basically for the arts community, for there to be some kind of forum. I think of (Ten PIscataqua) - the coffee table book - as a more grown up form than a weekly paper.\" \nThis is not a tourist book, Augusta emphasizes. While a steeple or tugboat may make an appearance, they'll be few and far between. \"It's really more about the arts community; it's FOR the art community, ... for them to have something.\" \nThe book's funding is a hybrid of shared risk-taking and crowdfunding. \n\"Since I can't pay photographers in advance like a typical publisher would, I'm asking them to stick their necks out with me, and share the risk, and they each get a share of anything the book makes,\" he says. \"I've extended that to those that will help produce, market and distribute.\" \nFor example, artist Gordon Carlisle designed the series logo, and Jenny Jenson Greenleaf designed the book, he says. Laura Pope has written the photographers' introductions; they are all stakeholders. \n\"When I first started the idea, and approached photographers, I was really anxious that they'd say no. One was too busy, but everyone else, ... said yes!\" Augusta says. \n\"As editor ... I tried to collect a diversity of different categories or genres of fine art photography, for example, landscape, portraiture, photojournalism, abstracts, still life, architecture, nature, etc., rather than just the one note of scenic landscapes people seem to expect when I mention the title.\" \nWhat he has now is \"a fine art portfolio about the community,\" he says. \"It's tremendous - outstanding talent, and this is how you can see it.\" \nCrowd-funding for printing happens in January and February 2018. \nMore books are to come: \"Ten Piscataqua Painters\" in 2019 and \"Ten Piscataqua Writers\" in 2020. \nTo stay abreast of what's happening (including discounted pre-sales) and future crowdfunding information, see tenpiscatiqua.com. or sign up for monthly updates at http://eepurl.com/c_1Fev \nBrewing pioneers subject of new book \nPhotographer Michael Penney will drop his inaugural book \"Pioneers of Craft Brewing in New England\" in time for holiday gifting. The self-published book is designed by by Matt Ralph at Plainspoke. \nPenney has been a photographer since the late 1970s (largely portraits and architecture). \nThe idea for a book on brewing came about three years ago, he says. Initially he wanted to focus on those \"actually making the beer.\" \n\"I stared this project in 2014 when the craft scene was starting to get really crazy. I got interested and wondered who was actually making they beer. I started going around to the breweries and photographing the brewers,\" Penney says. \"And then I decide it would be really cool to make a book of portraits of craft beer brewers throughout the New England ... a good area to explore.\" See some of Penney's portraits and a story about his project at www.seacoastonline.com/news/20160414/toast-to-brewers. \nA Kickstarter fundraiser failed to meet its goal \"so I decided on a smaller book of the pioneers of craft brewing in New England,\" he says. \"These are the people that really started it.\" \n\"Portraits\" features 16 pioneers with photos and accompanying brief biography by Penney. The Seacoast's Peter Egelston, owner of The Portsmouth Brewery (Granite State's first brewpub) and Smuttynose Brewing Company in Hampton, is included. \n\"It's a pretty cool cast of characters; it's pretty interesting, to me, when you see them all.\" \nThe run is limited to 150 books with 25 copies, signed by all the pioneers and author available for a bit more. \nIf in fact this does do well, Penney will revisit the \"Behind the Beer\" concept with \"portraits of people actually brewing the beer,\" he says. \nPublishing his first book \"feels great,\" he says. He concedes it was disappointing to not go for a larger coffee table book first. \"But, I took the money out of my retirement fund to do this book,\" he says. \" ... Now, I just hope people are interested in it.\" \nPenney will have a book signing at Smuttynose Brewing on Saturday, Dec. 9, 1 to 3 p.m. For more information, visit www.behindthebeer.net or www.michaelpenneyphotography.com \nGrazier to debut Amram's new composition \nPortsmouth Music and Arts Center's CEO Russ Grazier is one of 30 saxophonists worldwide who will premier a saxophone and strings arrangement by David Amram on Feb. 25, as part of the \"Worldwide Concurrent Premieres\" project. Grazier's performance of Amram's \"Greenwich Village Portraits\" will be held at the center. \n\"I'll be performing the piece with an ensemble of eight string players and a guest conductor from Boston Conservatory,\" he says. \"It's very cool.\" \nWorldwide Concurrent Premieres was organized by Ken Radnofsky, one of Grazier's former teachers, to allow groups of saxophonists to combine resources to commission major works by established composers. \nAmram (a former featured guest at Portsmouth's defunct \"Jazzmouth Festival\") wrote the piece for sax and piano in 2014. \n\"What I'm premiering is the version of the piece for sax and strings, a new version,\" he explains. \"It's a beautiful piece very difficult and virtuosic. ... It's really a haunting, beautiful, nostalgic piece. I'm really excited to play this.\" \nThe premier will feature PMAC faculty members, and Hannah Reitz, concert master of Portsmouth Symphony Orchestra. A graduate conducting student from the Boston Conservatory (\"my alma mater\") will conduct. \n\"The other human interest part of this is, ... I will turn 50 the day before,\" Grazier says. \"So, when I got a request to take part I thought I have to do this. This is a great way to celebrate turning 50.\" \nIn other PMAC news, \"the West End Master Series is growing.\" The next one, Jan. 21, will feature Cathy McLaurin as speaker. \n\"Cathy is the most recent recipient of the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation's Artist Advancement Grant,\" he says. \"She'll be talking about her art - the event is free and open to the public,\" Grazier says. \" I think that will be really interesting; she' s a really fascinating artist.\" \nJeann\u00e9 McCartin has her eyes and ears out for Seacoast gossip.

This is over the course of about five months. Meanwhile I am here with 175k strength at fleet cap, maybe pushing 200k if I go over as much as I can.\nA Fallen Empire was losing a battle one time, it was against me. I was fighting their 120k strength fleet with my 150k strength one and barely winning, but we were doing it. They woke up in the middle of the fleet battle, got boosted to 300k strength and pasted me. Then I shut the game off.\nFallen empires can't awaken while at war.\nThat's part of the key to beating/avoiding them in the first place - declare war on them before the conditions are met for them to awaken. They won't be able to awaken during the war, and as long as you've got a correctly-built fleet with ~40-60k fleet power by year 100 (the earliest point at which they can awaken) you'll be able to conquer them while they're still unable to build ships.\nEnding the war by conquering them will quickly trigger an awakening by any other FEs, so if you have more than one you basically declare war, kill their fleets and start occupying their worlds, but without actually allowing a peace or getting to 100 warscore to trigger an automatic peace. Then, once their fleet is gone they won't be able to build a new one and are effectively irrelevant, so you can declare war on each FE in turn and once you've beaten them all, annex them all at once.\nWell. They can, because it happened. So. Yeah. Awakening also doesn't alter the strength of their ships; it just gives them extra fleets (and enables further production). An individual fleet might become stronger via assignment of an admiral, but that can't happen in combat, either.\nIt's likely that your memory of this event is faulty, or you were playing with a mod, or you ran across an undocumented bug.\nEvery time I've seen an FE awaken, their fleets double in power, minimum.\nIf they were fighting them in their home system where this would trigger, it could easily show up like that.\nProject G.I.F.T.B.O.M.B. is completed", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970761807", "http://alabasterslim.com/76561197970761807/steam_sig.png"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:22.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4c92b92b20a522c770b8b84154bd32fb9a8b935", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCp4g5fkJrouQ2vkbl3l9dack7Ev9xHhAUmvWMyMVLd.IXPLuzAvXEGrndlWKpdsKDpTiSGujYIzSOX8txFcW31XVG3eufWv5uE-", "site_full": "bbmlive.com", "site": "bbmlive.com", "site_section": "http://www.bbmlive.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["travel", "australia_and_new_zealand"], "section_title": "BBM Live Travel Music Jobs", "title": "Sydney Jobs: Human Resources Administration | Temporary Roles", "title_full": "Sydney Jobs: Human Resources Administration | Temporary Roles", "published": "2017-12-07T07:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://bbmlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jobs-in-australia-people2people.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f4c92b92b20a522c770b8b84154bd32fb9a8b935", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCp4g5fkJrouQ2vkbl3l9dack7Ev9xHhAUmvWMyMVLd.IXPLuzAvXEGrndlWKpdsKDpTiSGujYIzSOX8txFcW31XVG3eufWv5uE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BBMLIVE", "published": "2017-12-07T07:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sydney Jobs: Human Resources Administration | Temporary Roles", "text": "Home / Jobs in Australia / Sydney Jobs / Sydney Jobs: Human Resources Administration | Temporary Roles Sydney Jobs: Human Resources Administration | Temporary Roles \nPeople2people are an award winning agency based in the heart of Sydney CBD \nWe am currently sourcing experienced HR Administrators / Internal Recruiters for a variety of temporary roles based in Sydney CBD or Sydney North Shore. \nRequired experience: Posting of job advertisements & reviewing responses for a variety of internal positions Preparation of employment letters and contracts, and new starter documents Reference checks Phone screening & scheduling interviews for successful candidates Candidate Management including updating candidates on job applications & interview status \nThe positions which we recruit for require immediate availability and ongoing commitment .

By the time the FEs woke up, I went \"How cute. You have a 100k fleet. I have three with a fourth in the oven\"\nI was the end-game crisis.

More to the point, this integrated tool allows you to effortlessly create full-stack Clojure and ClojureScript web apps from under the same roof, without having to have third-party tools installed, for example, JDK or various other build tools. Learn the basics of Clojure development with the help of Lightmod's super-useful templates Once installed, you're bound to discover that Lightmod is not your typical IDE, as soon as you lay your eyes upon its main window. Each time you launch Lightmod, you're greeted by a welcome screen that displays a set of handy templates you can start out with. You're able to choose from a basic app, as well as create complex chat, database, or isomorphic apps. There are also two gaming-related templates, a basic game and a simple platformer that requires you to move a character a 2D map. Intuitive and well-thought-out Clojure development app The app's interface is not exactly stellar in terms of overall looks, but realistically, it doesn't need to be, either. It does, however, respond well to user inputs, it supports multiple simultaneous open projects, and it also comes with two themes, Dark and Light. You'll also notice that the first time you open a template/project, it does take a bit of time until the app compiles the code (for both server and client side). However, rest assured that once loaded, every change within the code is almost instantly translated into the app thanks to a very nifty \"hotcode reloading\" engine. All-in-one Clojure development tool for novices This brings us to yet another advantage a well-integrated tool such as this brings forth, namely the fact that it allows you to provide the exact same user interface for both the server and the client. All things considered, Lightmod is a simple yet incredibly clever (if not innovative even) utility that provides one of the most accessible ways of getting into ClojureScript and full-stack Clojure web development. New in Lightmod 1.1.3: This release updates the Docs tab so that the examples in play-cljs.core are interactive, just like in the online docs. Small change, but a fun one.

Yet the Bavarians were keen not to stifle the youngster\u2019s encouraging development and, as they had done with Philipp Lahm at Stuttgart six years previously, they sent Kroos on loan to Bayer Leverkusen in January 2009. Kroos (l.) and Jupp Heynckes in training at Leverkusen in April 2010. \nIt was a transfer that as good as confirmed Kroos was destined for the top. Under the tutelage of Jupp Heynckes, who would later also coach him at Bayern and recently made a successful return to Bavaria as Carlo Ancelotti's successor , the Greifswald native developed into one of the Bundesliga\u2019s standout midfielders. One particularly fruitful five-game spell in 2009/10 brought five goals, four assists and consecutive Player of the Month awards from German football magazine kicker . \nKroos ended that campaign with a hugely impressive nine goals and 12 assists in total, and a place in Die Mannschaft \u2019s final squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, where he appeared in four of his team\u2019s seven matches. \nHe will likely never forget how important that spell at Leverkusen was, nor the impression Heynckes made on him as a coach. \u201cI look at my career in stages,\u201d Kroos said in an interview with the German Football Federation (DFB). \u201cJupp Heynckes was the most important coach I had in the early stage of my career, both at Leverkusen and then in Munich too. It\u2019s fair to say that it was after he arrived in Munich in 2011 that I started to be able to play at a high level consistently.\u201d Kroos (r.) goes close to an equaliser in Germany's semi-final defeat to Spain at the 2010 World Cup. \nAfter a bucket load of trophies under Heynckes, Kroos then worked under Pep Guardiola, and though their co-operation lasted only a year before the former\u2019s transfer to present club Real Madrid, Kroos values the lessons he learned under the Spaniard to this day. \n\u201cYou could say that Heynckes\u2019 arrival was one of the catalysts for my development, but I wouldn\u2019t underestimate that year under Guardiola,\u201d he says. \u201cI think my career took another step forward in that time. Guardiola saw me as a central player in his system, which fitted my style of play perfectly.\u201d Pep Guardiola (l.) and Kroos (r.) celebrate winning the Bundesliga title in 2014. \nPlaying regularly for season after season under some of the best coaches in the world had helped Kroos mature into the complete midfielder in his final season at Bayern, and by the time Germany travelled to the 2014 World Cup, both he and the rest of Germany\u2019s golden generation \u2013 Schweinsteiger, M\u00fcller, Mesut \u00d6zil et al. \u2013 were ready to become world champions. \nSince swapping Munich for Madrid, Kroos has continued to mature, lifting the Champions League twice \u2013 an achievement that continues to elude his former club \u2013 and winning the La Liga title in 2016/17. As the trophies and the appreciation continue to rack up, Kroos looks more and more the German equivalent of Xavi, and perhaps may even surpass him. \nIt is not inaccurate to assert that very soon \u2013 perhaps already \u2013 we will be saying the Bundesliga made one of the greatest midfielders of all time. \nBernie Reeves", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ma", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "toni kroos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mesut \u00f6zil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim borowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philipp lahm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heynckes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m\u00fcller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carlo ancelotti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bastian schweinsteiger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jupp heynckes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xavi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernie reeves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kroos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bommel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pep guardiola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guardiola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schweinsteiger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "real madrid", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dfb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "die mannschaft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "german football federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la liga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bayer leverkusen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bayern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leverkusen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "werder bremen", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuttgart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bayern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greifswald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bavaria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:22.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf992af980f7b5b19142e6e9517d670283f6fe17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT2yHVgC5Mysm7rQyUMMcsYJQCP64OWapOJ0ag_Yb2PmNJDqgu6HQnhGHecbGtIp1fVRFmGuk8ldXkmSztMZwSUFT6pJRdyBf4neHc.fKb.xvOdy4zJLJGUMAXLvLm2U0bxY1RclaLYb8iTSpdiWJFA6pU5q29yGIgkNSQd.9Wc5JZruM1AcY_A0WJD9KVsNK2cbA3EYhLMJlxt5nIB6zPizqW0Ywes2WNJZ2DKtORLktI4JxRvOVTIQarGGX81VNIZt8kA.WWQe559YF8aADQN", "site_full": "login.ntm.eu", "site": "ntm.eu", "site_section": "http://www.nsd.se/allt/rss", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Alla nyheter", "title": "Larm p\u00e5 bank", "title_full": "Larm p\u00e5 bank", "published": "2017-12-07T10:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf992af980f7b5b19142e6e9517d670283f6fe17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT2yHVgC5Mysm7rQyUMMcsYJQCP64OWapOJ0ag_Yb2PmNJDqgu6HQnhGHecbGtIp1fVRFmGuk8ldXkmSztMZwSUFT6pJRdyBf4neHc.fKb.xvOdy4zJLJGUMAXLvLm2U0bxY1RclaLYb8iTSpdiWJFA6pU5q29yGIgkNSQd.9Wc5JZruM1AcY_A0WJD9KVsNK2cbA3EYhLMJlxt5nIB6zPizqW0Ywes2WNJZ2DKtORLktI4JxRvOVTIQarGGX81VNIZt8kA.WWQe559YF8aADQN", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "webmaster@nsd.se", "published": "2017-12-07T10:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "Larm p\u00e5 bank", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:22.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa59bbf99c3dc7751affa82afd9fc0e44ad2fa21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl.cK_pwJaaP0XBkvn24rHFy5lE8SjCgIHcaI0YLEhOboe5LptPI90dkaElmrgejaHVflHNTRZgrniP5Ka3IQbGlgzLaB09rIcZzSyKb6h8RJA3_Iy9qcloQ-", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[Stellaris] Utopia and the new social order of my fanatical purifiers!

One where one can find the right tools, good service and friendly salespeople ready to help out at a moment\u2019s notice. \nThose descriptions can best be applied to Florham Park Hardware at 186 Columbia Turnpike, a borough business staple since 1955. One of the borough\u2019s oldest businesses, the name is instantly recognizable to any long-time Florham Park resident, along such business staples as the Florham Park Roller Rink, Florham Park Liquors and the Florham Park Diner. \nSince the store was sold to current owner Allan Epstein in 1976, he has been a familiar face behind the counter, always ready to help a customer when needed. \nSo it will be a sad day in Florham Park on New Year\u2019s Eve, Sunday, Dec. 31 when Florham Park Hardware closes after six decades in business. \nThe store has a long history in Florham Park. It was opened in 1955 by Bill DeAngelis and Jim Dante at the intersection of Columbia Turnpike and Ridgedale Avenue, where TD Bank now sits. \nThe business was sold in 1972 to Peter and Tucker Brennan, who sold the store to a then-26 year old Epstein in 1976. \nOver the years, customers could find the usual items typically found at a hardware store: paint, garden supplies and electrical and plumbing equipment. \nBut Epstein did a good job of expanding the store\u2019s inventory to include items that included barbecue grills, storage sheds, gazebos and even Lee Middleton dolls and doll furniture. \nThe store has been a place for people of all walks of life could come for all their hardware needs. It had Florham Park\u2019s support and in turn, Florham Park Hardware supported the borough it called home for more than six decades. \nFortunately, residents won\u2019t be disappointed to learn that Epstein will still be in Florham Park after the store\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve closing. He will be busy running Al\u2019s Shed World in a smaller storefront between Florham Park Hardware and Florham Park Shoes and Repair. \nWhile storage sheds at 186 Columbia Turnpike aren\u2019t new, the absence of Florham Park Hardware at that storefront address will be sad for many. \nBut times are changing and so is the hardware store business model. \nFlorham Park Hardware has had a great run in the borough and we wish Epstein the best of luck in his new endeavor.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lee middleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill deangelis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim dante", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allan epstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tucker brennan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "florham park hardware", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florham park roller rink", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "td bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florham park liquors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia turnpike", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florham park hardware", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florham park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ridgedale avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florham park diner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia turnpike", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florham park shoes", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:22.061+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "956d0c3d11d883ae03a7021c6910e282187e4954", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlN8MQld0wHZNHHOWT5ftrp54o5.n3xbn6Q0HWrpflqUVlmNipxN7Di", "site_full": "rssfeeds.wltx.com", "site": "wltx.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.wltx.com/_/20/63716632/wltx-local", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "WLTX - Local", "title": "Santa Visits Patients", "title_full": "Santa Visits Patients", "published": "2017-12-07T05:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://content.wltx.com/photo/2017/12/06/SANTA_1512617266358_11892551_ver1.0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 78664, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "956d0c3d11d883ae03a7021c6910e282187e4954", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlN8MQld0wHZNHHOWT5ftrp54o5.n3xbn6Q0HWrpflqUVlmNipxN7Di", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "Santa Visits Patients", "text": "Close East TN Boy Surprised by Reaction to Viral Bullying Video Dec. 11, 2017: An East Tennessee boy who shared his story of bullying in a viral video said he's surprised by the national reaction he's received. WBIR 11:02 AM. EST December 12, 2017 Keaton Jones. CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nUNION COUNTY, TENN. - An East Tennessee boy who shared his story of being bullied at school said he's been surprised by the outpouring of support in response to his viral video. \nSixth-grader Keaton Jones and his mother Kimberly Jones posted the video on Facebook Friday, prompting reaction from thousands of people across the state, nation and the world. Several celebrities, athletes and lawmakers have reached out to Keaton since the post. \n\"I was just expecting friends and family to see it. Not half of the world,\" Keaton said Monday. \nKeaton Jones. (Photo: WBIR) \nKeaton said he knows he's different, and he's the new kid at Horace Maynard Middle School. He said people pick on him for his looks and because he's new. \n\"I just don't fit in with the crowd, I guess,\" he said. \nHis video generated an emotional reaction and sent people like former UT football player and radio host Jason Swain into action. \nSwain and UT quarterback Jarrett Guarantano spent time hanging out with Keaton over the weekend. \nSo I got the chance to spend the day with my new best bud Keaton. It was unbelievable to get to know him and realize that we have a lot in common. This dude is very special and has changed my life forever. Now I have the little brother I always wanted! God bless you my man pic.twitter.com/vMHVtnf2rC \u2014 Jarrett Guarantano\u271e (@BroadwayJay2) December 11, 2017 \n\n\"I just reached out and wanted to pair him up with some Tennessee football players,\" Swain said. \"I figured the kid would love meeting the starting quarterback, so I wanted to get him with Jarrett. We met Keaton at the mall. Him and Jarrett just hung out, talked.\" \n\"We're all different, but we all have things in common,\" Swain said. \nKeaton has even heard from Captain America actor Chris Evans. \n\"That one shocked me,\" Keaton said. \nStay strong, Keaton. Don\u2019t let them make you turn cold. I promise it gets better. While those punks at your school are deciding what kind of people they want to be in this world, how would you and your mom like to come to the Avengers premiere in LA next year? https://t.co/s1QwCQ3toi \u2014 Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) December 10, 2017 \n\nKeaton said he knows there's no quick solution to bullying, and that the video he made and all the attention it's getting might make things even more difficult at school. Keaton didn't go to school Monday, and said he might be out of school for a few more days. \nBut he's glad for the positive response his video received, and said it feels good to encourage other people who are bullied. \n\"It makes me feel good that I'm making a difference all around the world,\" Keaton said. \"To inspire people that are bullied, it's just, give them a voice they might not have to speak out about it and explain how it's not right to bully.\" \nThe Union County Board of Education Director of Schools issued a statement Monday in response to requests for comment about the bullying Keaton said he experiences at school. \nDirector of Union County Public Schools James E. Carter released the following statement: \n\"To fulfill our mission of educating all children in Union County Public Schools, we must provide an academic environment that is safe, civil and supportive. We do not and will not tolerate bullying and have a policy in place that addresses conduct taking place on school grounds, at any school-sponsored activity, on school-provided transportation or at any official school bus stop. With any incident of bullying that is reported to our administrators, we follow the process of our policy and immediately investigate the alleged incidents. The privacy of all parties and witnesses to complaints will be respected in accordance with federal and state law.\" \nLINK: Tennessee's Bullying and Harassment guide | Union County Schools Handbook \nThe video was posted on Keaton's mother's Facebook page Friday, but on Monday, the privacy settings on the post had been changed so the video could no longer be viewed. In the original post, Keaton's mother Kimberly Jones wrote: \n\"For the record, Keaton asked to do this AFTER he had he me pick him up AGAIN because he was afraid to go to lunch. My kids are by no stretch perfect, & at home, he's as all boy as they come, but by all accounts he's good at school. Talk to your kids. I've even had friends of mine tell me they're kids were only nice to him to get him to mess with people. We all know how it feels to want to belong, but only a select few know how it really feels not to belong anywhere.\" \nWBIR is aware of questions about the motives by Keaton's mother on social media, and we have requested an interview with her. People online are voicing concerns about some of her previous social media posts but, in general, the focus of this story remains on doing something positive for a boy who says he was bullied at school and pushing to make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else. \n\u00a9 2017 WBIR.COM", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "santa visits patients santa visits patients in children's hospital santa", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "santa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:23.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b1651144efcdce24948283ba7f2a7ab3c0699b3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ze7iYzhB4pRQYGxBfV1QC0OU50lnjWrWrygAJhrLeKDjPow491K2Mv.d1XyYzse_0zMuF6B_Wdg--", "site_full": "www.fosters.com", "site": "fosters.com", "site_section": "http://www.fosters.com/edge?template=rss&mime=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Edge - fosters.com", "title": "Five Spot: Hollie Foster", "title_full": "Five Spot: Hollie Foster", "published": "2017-12-07T10:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.fosters.com/storyimage/FD/20171207/NEWS/171209738/AR/0/AR-171209738.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1651144efcdce24948283ba7f2a7ab3c0699b3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ze7iYzhB4pRQYGxBfV1QC0OU50lnjWrWrygAJhrLeKDjPow491K2Mv.d1XyYzse_0zMuF6B_Wdg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Christopher Hislop", "published": "2017-12-07T10:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Five Spot: Hollie Foster", "text": "Dec 7, 2017 at 3:15 AM By Christopher Hislop \nResidence: Newmarket Guilty associations: Women\u2019s Studies major at the University of New Hampshire; General Director of MUSO UNH; Vocals in Gash; Vocals in Tossed AsideFavorite Seacoast spot: The Women\u2019s Studies office or the Haunted Mansion in DoverAverage amount of sleep: Anywhere from 5 to 9 hoursFavorite color: Pink, duh.Here we go:EDGE: Music. What is it good for? Why do you seek it? Why do you create it? Foster: Honestly ... I\u2019m just like really pissed off constantly so for me, music is a good outlet for that. I\u2019m not great at writing lyrics, but having this to let out my disappointment and anger has been really therapeutic. EDGE: Let's talk about Gash. How'd the band come to be? Why'd the band come to be? Is fronting a band nerve-wracking? I couldn't do it.Foster: Gash started as a solo project until I asked Nate, Shema and Alexa to join. They\u2019re my backing band during live shows. I thought fronting a band would be nerve-wracking, but it\u2019s honestly one of the easiest things I\u2019ve ever done. EDGE: MUSO. You're the current director of this esteemed University of New Hampshire organization. What are the challenges of leading an arts organization? What sort of lessons have you learned during the tenure of your post? Is this the line of work you're hoping to get into upon graduating in mere days? Foster: Yes! There are a lot of challenges. One of which is getting people to commit enough time so that the organization can run smoothly. Students have so much going on, so sometimes volunteering for the sake of art can be a last priority. This org has helped teach me that sometimes I need to chill out and let other people do their own thing. I can definitely be a micro-manager. Once I graduate, I know that I want to work in shelters for people who've suffered from abuse, but I always thought I wanted to focus on the counseling portion. Through MUSO, I\u2019ve realized that I might be more interested in the volunteer management side of this career. EDGE: Community. What's that word mean to you? What's the importance of \"community\u201d?Foster: To me, community is feeling welcome and accepted somewhere, but also where you\u2019re able to make mistakes and receive constructive criticism to better yourself. This is important because no one is perfect or all-knowing, and we need spaces where questions are allowed and education is normal. I\u2019ve learned so much from my group of friends and I\u2019m really grateful for that.EDGE: What's your greatest fear? How do you combat said fear?Foster: I\u2019m terrified of the dark and depression so I sleep with a salt rock lamp.

I must be honest the other day I went to the hairdresser and I sat there for 4 hours at that time all I heard was negative talk about their personal lives.  When I got home I had no other choice as to take some painkillers.  \nBeing around negative people is draining and they just don\u2019t get out of it.  My sufficiency is in the LORD.  I receive my strength through God\u2019s Word, which strengthens me each and every day.  Helping me stay positive and changing my thought patterns from feeling miserable to staying focused and being positive. \nI have learned to look for the good things in life, see what opportunities arise and grab it with both my hands; I claim success each morning from God for my own life.  I believe God is qualifying me and it is because I come to HIM each day. \nPrayer \nLord God as I think about my attitude and my the personal changes in my own life, I can only draw near to You.  Staying positive is one of the key components of being successful and with You Lord in my life I am positive.  I look forward to a prosperous future and I know You have a blueprint for my life.

Stop putting yourself on the pedestal, God will lift you up at the right time at the right place. \nPrayer \nLord today I commit my works into Your hands, I am asking that whatever I am planning that You will be with me.

It was a simple question: \u0db8\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dc0\u0dca\u0daf? \u0db8\u0ddc\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0daf \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda (Who is this [and] what is he doing? It did not come in colors associated with any of the major parties.   It was in orange.   It was duly followed by a \u2018response\u2019 that began with \u2018\u0db8\u0dd9\u0dba\u0dcf \u0dad\u0db8\u0dba\u0dd2\u2026([he] is the one [who]\u2026) and went on to detail achievements and pledges.   \nThat was effectively the launch of Ranasinghe Premadasa\u2019s presidential campaign.   And the color made sense, because orange was the signature that marked his doings, especially the overhead walkways all over Colombo.   It was an idea that is attributed to G.W. Surendra and Victor Hettigoda.   It was executed by Arambawelage Don Upali Ranjith alias Soththi Upali, according to some the only person who could put up posters all over the country at the time.   This was late 1988 and the punchi aanduwa (small government) of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) could prevail over the government in the game of hit and run.   \nThat was a time when politicians and political campaigns used posters to almost the exclusion of other propaganda devices.   We live in a different age and yet a poster can still create a buzz.   \n\nHere\u2019s a poster that gave credence to the speculation that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa would contest the 2020 presidential election: \u0d9c\u0ddd\u0da8\u0dcf \u0d85\u0db4\u0dda (Gota is ours).   It was signed, \u2018\u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2 (us for ourselves),\u2019 the tagline of the campaign to support the security forces during the last years of the war on terrorism, executed when Gotabhaya was the Secretary, Ministry of Defence.   An exercise in branding, obviously.   \nA few days later, there\u2019s a response.   A single line against a white background with blood spots at the bottom: \u0d9c\u0ddd\u0dad\u0dcf \u0db6\u0dba \u0d85\u0db8\u0dad\u0d9a\u0daf (\u2018Gothaa Baya Amathakada\u2019 or \u2018Have you forgotten the \u201cGota Terror\u201d?   It\u2019s a play on Gotabhaya\u2019s name. Gota has been corrupted to \u2018Gothaa\u2019 which draws from \u2018Gothaya.\u2019   \u2018Gotha\u2019 in colloquial Sinhala would mean \u2018good for nothing\u2019.     Obviously someone clever with words would have come up with the corruption, but it reminds me of certain people in Colombo\u2019s high society absolutely unfamiliar with the name (and its history) innocently mispronounced and even now mispronounces his name.   For them it is \u0d9c\u0ddd\u0dad\u0db6\u0dba\u0dcf (Gothabayaa).   \nAnyway, if you want to keep playing with names, then here are two that are pretty significant: a) Biyagama (Village of Fear, or Fearful Village) and Gam Udawa (Village Reawakening) which my father used to call \u2018Gun Udawa\u2019 or \u2018The Reawakening of Guns\u2019.   \nWhat is politically significant is the purpose of this poster war.   The name-play poster was followed by one which directly referred to the pro-Gota poster.   The line was \u2018Api venuven mineemaruwek\u2019 or \u2018A murderer for us\u2019.   Goes with the blood-stains.   Clever, some may think. \nHowever, we need to ask some questions.   If someone fears a good-for-nothing then doesn\u2019t it say more about the fearful than the feared, especially since there was a poster just over a week ago claiming that the Prime Minister was \u2018fearless\u2019?   And if the past is relevant, then we could go back as far as we want.   If the supporters of this government did just that then this government would not be in power simply because the track records of the key figures including candidates, party leaders and an ex-president are not exactly untainted.   \nBut what is this \u2018 baya \u2019 or \u2018fear\u2019?   I believe that the fear is legitimate on two counts.   First we have the absolute power that Gotabhaya arrogated upon himself.   Nepotism might have resulted in the victory over terrorism, one might argue, and may have given Colombo the facelift and more that it sorely needed, but it also produced arrogance and abuse of authority, not to mention corruption if charges on such grounds are proven correct.   \nWe can do without such fear.   In fact this government was brought to power because a significant number of key players wanted to be relieved of such fears.   The fact that this government retired the man feared but did not retire fear, so to speak, is of course something to think about.   \nHowever, if an identity-change is what we got then a switch-back won\u2019t make things better, at best.   No reason to support the present set of thugs of course, but the poster makes sense.   The bloody part of it notwithstanding.   \u2018Not withstanding,\u2019 one should add, because there\u2019s exaggeration if not a lie right there if one subscribes to the dictum \u2018innocent until proven guilty\u2019 and because the finger-pointers have been part of bloody-regimes, the President and Prime Minister included.   \nThere\u2019s another \u2018fear-element\u2019 here.   Fear of the man, not for the kind of thuggery he may unleash on the country, but the existentialist threat to those currently in power.   In attacking Gota, the attackers (obviously those currently in power) betray a strong sense of unease.   If Gota was not a threat, then why bother?   \nOne remembers how J.R. Jayewardene in the first time candidates were given official airtime on TV, in 1982 dismissed the JVP candidate.   He said (in Sinhala): Other candidates include Hector Kobbekaduwa (he dragged the \u2018be\u2019 to make it sound like the bleating of a goat) and Rohan (not Rohana)\u2026.(paused as though trying to recollect the name) Wijeweera of the Janatha Vimukthi Pakshaya (not Peramuna).\u2019   Dismissive. Dismissed.   Smart.In this instance, Gota\u2019s detractors are raising his profile, elevating him to the candidate that he is not.   \nIn other words, what all this indicates is that the government does not feel confident to face the people on its track record alone.   It has to conjure ghosts of the past (selectively of course) and indulge in fear-mongering.   No wonder that the entire pantomime was captured thus (in Sinhala) in social media: \n\u0dbd\u0dc3\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dbb\u0db8\u0dad\u0dd4\u0d82\u0d9c \u0dc0\u0dbb\u0ddd \u0d91\u0d9a\u0dca\u0db1\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0d9c\u0ddc\u0da9 \u0dc0\u0dbb\u0ddd \u0dad\u0dcf\u0da2\u0dd4\u0da9\u0dca\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dbb\u0ddd \u0d9a\u0dd3\u0dad\u0dca \u0db1\u0ddc\u0dba\u0dbb\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dbb\u0ddd \u0db8\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dab \u0db4\u0dd0\u0db8\u0dd2\u0dab \u0d87\u0dad\u0ddd \n[Come, Lasantha Wickramatunga; come Ekneligoda, come Thajudeen, come Keith Noyhr\u2026.come, for elections have come] \nThe larger lesson is also about fear.   The options expressed or implied by these various posters indicate that there\u2019s someone we should fear and there\u2019s someone who is fearful, both qualities that we should worry about.   The truth is that any candidate who cannot or will not effectively represent is not a candidate worthy of a vote.   \nWe do not need someone whose effectiveness is wrought (even in part) from the fact that his brother is the President.   We do not need someone who is so insecure that he has to say \u2018I am fearless\u2019 and who (going by recent comments about the media) considers any criticism as \u2018sinister designs to bring him down and bring back the previous regime\u2019.   What we should fear is the lack of a credible candidate or set of candidates or any kind of leadership among the major political configurations.   That\u2019s something to worry about because it sets the stage for the default option.   We saw and we are seeing what that did after January 2015.   \nThe politically intelligent thing to do, then, is to enjoy this poster-bickering, laugh out loud, and look elsewhere for political leadership. \nMalinda Seneviratne is a freelance writer.   malindasenevi@gmail.com .    \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arambawelage don upali ranjith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ranasinghe premadasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gam udawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gotabhaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lasantha wickramatunga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janatha vimukthi pakshaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soththi upali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hector kobbekaduwa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gotabhaya rajapaksa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gothaa baya amathakada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith noyhr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vimukthi peramuna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peramuna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victor hettigoda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.r. jayewardene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malinda seneviratne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g.w. surendra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of defence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jvp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ekneligoda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gotabhaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biyagama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gotha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colombo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:24.001+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15141534, "moreResultsAvailable": 15141434, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512637824001&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 887}
