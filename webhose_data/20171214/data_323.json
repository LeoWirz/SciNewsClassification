Finally.", "text": "Down to 3 roasts in the freezer, until today. Scored not 2 miles out of town, after spending too much time digging out of 2 unseen holes I found on the unplowed road in flat, flat, flat light. Should have been out on the windswept lagoon ice. Or maybe not at all. Couldn't see much definition on the snow, bare eyes was best, but I was running with amber goggles for the wind.\nFunny thing, sweaty and exhausted, and with the dangerous flat light, I'd abandoned the idea of hunting, but decided to take the 6 mile loop back to town, on the higher, more windswept portion. I'd heard shots up by the AF radar dome when I was digging out the first time, so went up there (about a mile past the loop intersection road) to see what I could (and found another hole before getting there....that one only took 15 minutes to get out of- the first had been over an hour. Not a good idea to put a snow machine into a hole thats 6 feet deep and exactly machine sized in width and length!). Could be, but wasn't hard on the scope settings, it turned out.\nAt least one fresh kill site (blood spatter, head, lower legs), and maybe 1 or two more by blood spatter sites, but no remnants. Or all 3 of those guys might have shot her. They had passed me on the far side of the lagoon while I was digging out the first time. Over where I should have been traveling.\nHeadless and legless animals work better in the toboggans. Glassed lower ground from dome hill-top but saw nothing.\nHeaded back to the Loop intersection to follow that around, as it looked less drifted than the lower ground, ;just on a wild-hair off-chance. No one had been around the loop yet, from the lack of tracks.. Half a mile down the loop, I spotted an antler-less bull on a hillside 347 yards away. Easy shot, but not legal until February. Stupid regs!\nA quarter mile on, terrain feature change showed me about 20 animals, about 3/4 mile away back toward and in line with the dome, in a depression that couldn't be seen from up there. I had looked! A couple nice, still-antlered bulls in the bunch, but mostly cows and calves. Works for me.\nLow ground and 15 mile crosswind let me get within 124 yards, motoring slow and quiet. Windscreen for a rest, with a half body height, low hold under hair (rifle is zeroed for 300), and she was down. The rest took off, and I don't do running shots if I don't have to. One animal was enough for today, anyway. I've got all winter....\nGutted, legged, and headed, I loaded her in the sled with a tarp under for blood, and then it was just a 15 minute run back to the house.\nIt IS better to be lucky than good!\nI'll skin her tomorrow and check that Superperformance GMX hole first animal i've used it on. Looks about like the SST holes...\nLast edited by las; 12/03/17 . Whizzer of OTZ CMG 300 BP\n#12440724 - 12/04/17 Re: Got one. Finally.

She was at least twice- maybe three times the apparent size (from TV shows) of your Texas Whitetail does, Reloder. Probably as big or bigger than your bucks. So there! . Caribou up here tend to run a bit smaller on average than those farther south in Alaska.\nI'm not adverse to shooting the \"babies\" either, and have they are the best! If I'm going to have to shoot only cows by stupid regulation, I would willingly take her calf, also, if it hangs around, as it is likely doomed to predation, exposure, etc., without a clue how to survive alone. Can't - same time they restricted bull taking, they eliminated calf taking also. But not cows accompanied by calves....\nShe was a fully adult cow - her calf of the year started back to make contact, then went with the rest of the group. Hopefully it will survive by doing so. Many times they won't leave but will hang around where they last saw mom, and that is almost certainly a death sentence and waste, but I guess the predators and scavengers have to eat also. I did pick out a cow that did not have a calf in obvious proximity, but I guess it was off a little way goofing around with others. the Eskimos refer to lone cows as \"barren\", but likely their calf did not survive this time around. but they are almost certainly pregnant again, after rut.\nAs I may have said a few times before - this 3 1/2 month long \"pregnant cows only\" season is just ludicrous, when bulls are perfectly edible after rut by the 2nd week in November, and usually before. No fat on them tho, but I don't eat fat, so I'd take one of them by preference - and have when it was still legal. Calves also. I've taken two \"orphaned\" and all alone calves in past years, before current regs. With the the limit 5 a day, tagging a calf is no hardship in the meat department.\nPregnant cow hunting is a helluva way to \"slow the decline\" (the nominal reasoning for these regs- actually it is cultural/political) of a population which seems to have been stable for the last 3 years at just over 200,000. In fact, last year saw excellent calf survival, with the heaviest average birth weights ever recorded.\nObjectively, the current regs are just a PITA, and totally meaningless as to affecting the herd size either way.\nWith luck, I'll get one or two more this winter, and get the freezer fully stocked again.\nJust jerked the lower jaw for F&G's age/nutritional studies. From the looks of her most excellent teeth I'd guess she was no more than 3, maybe 4. Only sectioning and staining will be definitive, tho. So I killed all her future calves too.\nLast edited by las; Yesterday at 08:37 PM . Whizzer of OTZ #12448393 - Yesterday at 08:37 PM Re: Got one. Finally.

Neither result raises the odds that Malaysia will beat the middle-income curse. Neither aftermath keeps Malaysia from losing ground in an increasingly dynamic region that China remakes every 12 months. \n\u201cAnd neither ending will happily extricate Malaysia\u2019s 31 million people from the late 1990s. \n\u201cMalaysia needs a course correction towards a more open and vibrant future, and at warp speed. It doesn\u2019t seem that next year\u2019s election will provide one.\u201d \nPesek says Najib is talking about revival, epochal reform and about Malaysia zooming towards the ranks of the top-20 economies. \n\u201cBut the problem today, just as 20 years ago, is the quality of gross domestic product gains, not the quantity. The upswing in demand is driven by a populist, election-year budget, which Najib rightfully calls the \u201cmother\u201d of all stimulus plans. It\u2019s also the father of continued complacency \u2013 a US$1.5 billion treat for farmers, rubber traders, fishermen and other vested interests that does not raise competitiveness. \n\u201cWhat connects Najib\u2019s spending burst today with Mahathir\u2019s two decades ago is corruption. Najib is overcompensating for \u2013 and diverting attention from \u2013 the multibillion-dollar 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, which has Mahathir demanding his resignation.\u201d \nHe says cronyism and the patronage system perfected by Dr Mahathir during his 1981-2003 tenure fell like a house of cards in 1997 and 1998. \n\u201cFast-forward 20 years, and the ghosts of cronyism past \u2013 Mahathir\u2019s people \u2013 are returning to take on a leader scrambling to divert attention from his own controversies. Najib\u2019s people are pushing back with a questionable inquiry into foreign exchange losses at the central bank on Mahathir\u2019s watch.\u201d \nThis focus on the 1990s says much about Malaysia\u2019s plight. \nNajib\u2019s latest budget, for example, lavishes goodies on politically contested districts. Political gimmicks, like eliminating tolls on highways, won\u2019t increase innovation or boost incomes, writes Pesek. \nNajib, he writes, has also not dismantled the affirmative-action policy \u2014 instituted in 1971 by his prime minister father \u2013 which gives Malays priority in government jobs, housing and universities, even though it \u201cturns off foreign investors, curbs productivity and deadens the nation\u2019s animal spirits\u201d. \n\u201cThat headwind is bearing down on Southeast Asia\u2019s third-biggest economy. If Najib\u2019s henchmen manage to pin 20-year-old currency losses on Mahathir, those headwinds will gain force.

Essex H 1 , Parrott S 1 , Atkin K 1 , Ballard K 2 , Bland M 1 , Eldred J 1 , Hewitt C 1 , Hopton A 1 , Keding A 1 , Lansdown H 1, 3 , Richmond S 4 , Tilbrook H 1 , Torgerson D 1 , Watt I 1, 5 , Wenham A 1 , Woodman J 1, 2 , MacPherson H 1 .\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture and usual care, and Alexander Technique lessons and usual care, compared with usual GP care alone for chronic neck pain patients.\nMETHODS: An economic evaluation was undertaken alongside the ATLAS trial, taking both NHS and wider societal viewpoints. Participants were offered up to twelve acupuncture sessions or twenty Alexander lessons (equivalent overall contact time). Costs were in pounds sterling. Effectiveness was measured using the generic EQ-5D to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs), as well as using a specific neck pain measure-the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ).\nRESULTS: In the base case analysis, incremental QALY gains were 0.032 and 0.025 in the acupuncture and Alexander groups, respectively, in comparison to usual GP care, indicating moderate health benefits for both interventions. Incremental costs were \u00a3451 for acupuncture and \u00a3667 for Alexander, mainly driven by intervention costs. Acupuncture was likely to be cost-effective (ICER = \u00a318,767/QALY bootstrapped 95% CI \u00a34,426 to \u00a374,562) and was robust to most sensitivity analyses. Alexander lessons were not cost-effective at the lower NICE threshold of \u00a320,000/QALY (\u00a325,101/QALY bootstrapped 95% CI -\u00a3150,208 to \u00a3248,697) but may be at \u00a330,000/QALY, however, there was considerable statistical uncertainty in all tested scenarios.\nCONCLUSIONS: In comparison with usual care, acupuncture is likely to be cost-effective for chronic neck pain, whereas, largely due to higher intervention costs, Alexander lessons are unlikely to be cost-effective. However, there were high levels of missing data and further research is needed to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of these interventions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Richmond%20S%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Woodman%20J%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Ballard%20K%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Watt%20I%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Essex%20H%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Eldred%20J%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=MacPherson%20H%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Parrott%20S%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29211741#", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Tilbrook%20H%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Hopton%20A%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Keding%20A%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Lansdown%20H%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Atkin%20K%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Torgerson%20D%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Wenham%20A%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Bland%20M%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Hewitt%20C%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_u9211741"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "torgerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ballard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tilbrook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macpherson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hopton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parrott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hewitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander technique", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woodman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "atlas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "essex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wenham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richmond", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:00.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd8088056e359bdfb83313882295d54ae3a0e415", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYBXhkF0p0kPmyFrLPKLX7tb", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp;

This corrects the TV channel used for satellite viewing. When the SAT button is pressed, the remote sends that channel to the TV. In order to use this feature, first program the remote to operate the TV, then program in the correct channel for the TV, and finally enable (for 5.3 and 6.3 remote controls.) \nSetting SAT Auto-Tune Channel \nNote: These steps can also be used to change the channel used for SAT Auto-Tune. Program the remote control to operate the TV. Press and hold TV until all four mode buttons are lit. Press STAR (), then enter the channel used for viewing satellite TV. For example, if the TV needs to be on channel 60, enter 60. Press POUND (#). The TV button flashes times to indicate programming was successful. \nEnabling Press and hold SAT for three seconds until all four mode buttons are lit. Press STAR (), then press Volume UP. Press POUND (#). The SAT button flashes three times to indicate it was enabled. \nDisabling Press and hold SAT for three seconds until all four mode buttons are lit. Press STAR (), then press VOLUME DOWN. Press POUND (#), The SAT button flashes three times to indicate it was disabled. \nCompatible Remote Controls:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:01.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "324e9c40a0c6b0a64fb63dabc0b3ea9e48058a07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9aJiJMzv3pxIeiyBPZhpI53NoKYYpLueMPZ6ArZ.ARS7uk2C7aK_VZCWLBiG1yhIrpDBvpsmlUbLRR7lH3SvOWvLDs5DlXoznsbLEEM37ThA--", "site_full": "www.overclock.net", "site": "overclock.net", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/huddler-overclock?format=xml", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Overclock.net - Recent Changes", "title": "[Official] NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti Owner's Club", "title_full": "[Official] NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti Owner's Club", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.overclock.net/image/id/13591340", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6136, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "324e9c40a0c6b0a64fb63dabc0b3ea9e48058a07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9aJiJMzv3pxIeiyBPZhpI53NoKYYpLueMPZ6ArZ.ARS7uk2C7aK_VZCWLBiG1yhIrpDBvpsmlUbLRR7lH3SvOWvLDs5DlXoznsbLEEM37ThA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "feznz", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "[Official] NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti Owner's Club", "text": "I am having a frustrating issue where MSI AB won't allow me to adjust core offset per GPU.\nI tick off sync, then set my offsets accordingly, however when I run a benchmark, both cards still run at the lowest setting, instead of running individual settings as they should.\nI haven't tried any other OC tuners yet...

About Graphics Drivers: While installing the graphics driver allows the system to properly recognize the chipset and the card manufacturer, updating the video driver can bring about various changes. It can improve the overall graphics experience and performance in either games or various engineering software applications, include support for newly developed technologies, add compatibility with newer GPU chipsets, or resolve different problems that might have been encountered. When it comes to applying this release, the installation steps should be a breeze, as each manufacturer tries to make them as easy as possible so that each user can update the GPU on their own and with minimum risks (however, check to see if this download supports your graphics chipset). Therefore, get the package (extract it if necessary), run the setup, follow the on-screen instructions for a complete and successful installation, and make sure you reboot the system so that the changes take effect. That being said, download the driver, apply it on your system, and enjoy your newly updated graphics card.

About Bluetooth Drivers: Installing the system's Bluetooth driver will allow it to connect with various devices such as mobile phones, tablets, headsets, gaming controllers, and more. However, this wireless technology is recommended to be used for transferring data between compatible devices within short ranges. A newer version can include support for later technology standards or add compatibility with other Bluetooth chipsets; however, bear in mind that updating the driver might not improve your system at all.

There have been more tries, more points and more time spent playing this season compared to last. Points and tries have been constantly increasing since the 2014-2015 season, the year STATS became the official statistics provider of the TOP 14 for the LNR. Back then, an average of 3.9 tries and 43.8 points were scored per game, while this season those numbers have increased to 5.2 and 48.8. \nTOP 14 is also showcasing more drama with many more teams in the race for winning the Bouclier de Brennus. Surprises have come from Lyon OU and Castres Olympique, who played extremely well and will be serious challengers this season. Stade Rochelais are also keeping their standards from last year when they topped the league during the regular season before losing the semi-final to RC Toulonnais. They are currently first in the league after they defeated former leader Montpellier H\u00e9rault Rugby on Saturday 2 nd December. These two teams have been very impressive so far while displaying incredible skills in attack. They\u2019ve both scored 35 points and averaged more than three tries per game. \nLet\u2019s not forget about Stade Toulousain and RC Toulonnais, despite many changes in their coaching staffs during the mid-season. They\u2019ll have their say with the likes of Thomas Ramos (Stade Toulousain, TOP 14 No. 2 points scorer) and Chris Ashton (RC Toulonnais, TOP 14 tries leader with 13 scored). Racing 92, the 2016 champions, will also be close to the playoff with their galaxy of top players \u2013 Dan Carter, Pat Lambie, Leone Nakarawa (the league\u2019s second best carrier and leader for offloads). \nSurprisingly enough, many of TOP 14\u2019s top players so far are playing for teams that had a difficult start. Ben Botica (US Oyonnax) is the leader in points scored (134), while Willem Alberts (Stade Fran\u00e7ais) leads in tackles (already 200 made). The suspense will be intense even at the lower half of the league table as teams will fight very hard to maintain their position in the TOP 14 and not go down to PRO D2. US Oyonnax and SU Agen are currently closing the ladder, but they upset several big TOP 14 teams recently and could close the gap separating them from upper teams in the coming weeks. \nTOP 14 returns on 22 nd December for the last two rounds of 2017.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stade toulousain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leone nakarawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan carter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat lambie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "willem alberts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris ashton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas ramos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben botica", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "midpoint review   rugby union   stats llc", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lnr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stade toulousain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castres olympique", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montpellier h\u00e9rault rugby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stade fran\u00e7ais", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyon ou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "su agen", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:01.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f70ef747b5415067ddf41044de3afcc77236fb47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Ue75giFNnliH696wjQuhi0bzVLX.4SH5mi7Q9u8LxJHY5UgN8.kUA6FaBDHlmxis2SogUPF298.z50wZgZX42Ek24kvKdh3aeS4ADrcZmyZ_8CvnoXmPGBskrjcRhrwDCBnJjaGtku9wWPd6aiQrmfEoFgrfGxJ9pT4iG2zugngantnQmKpqbG6woAGwXg63yjdCCTF3vSB1w--", "site_full": "drivers.softpedia.com", "site": "softpedia.com", "site_section": "http://drivers.softpedia.com/backend.xml", "site_categories": ["windows", "tech"], "section_title": "Softpedia Drivers / All", "title": "Toshiba Satellite PSCFWC-00Y002 Synaptics TouchPad Driver 19.0.14.31 for Windows 10 64-bit", "title_full": "Toshiba Satellite PSCFWC-00Y002 Synaptics TouchPad Driver 19.0.14.31 for Windows 10 64-bit", "published": "2017-12-07T11:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.softpedia.com/_img/softpedia_logo_rss.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1630, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f70ef747b5415067ddf41044de3afcc77236fb47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Ue75giFNnliH696wjQuhi0bzVLX.4SH5mi7Q9u8LxJHY5UgN8.kUA6FaBDHlmxis2SogUPF298.z50wZgZX42Ek24kvKdh3aeS4ADrcZmyZ_8CvnoXmPGBskrjcRhrwDCBnJjaGtku9wWPd6aiQrmfEoFgrfGxJ9pT4iG2zugngantnQmKpqbG6woAGwXg63yjdCCTF3vSB1w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Softpedia Drivers", "published": "2017-12-07T11:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Toshiba Satellite PSCFWC-00Y002 Synaptics TouchPad Driver 19.0.14.31 for Windows 10 64-bit", "text": "Softpedia > Drivers > Keyboard & Mouse > Synaptics > Toshiba Satellite PSCFWC-00Y002 Synaptics TouchPad Driver 19.0.14.31 for Windows 10 64-bit GO DOWNLOAD 0 downloads File size: 171 MB Manufacturer: Synaptics Added on: Dec 7th, 2017 This package contains the files needed for installing the TouchPad driver.

If it's not maxing out, your close! Looking good! Played with some setting on my 16gb 4x4 set and have had some luck after a few hours of trial and error. Now posting and tested stable at 3600, no frame drops or or any of the other issues I was running into before. CPU at 5.1ghz @ 1.325, timings set to 17-17-38 375, removed the xmp and played with some vccio/vssa and other settings. Thanks for a good baseline, has helped me work out a few kinks. While I\u2019d love to go for a 2x8 set up on my TridentZ I think I\u2019m going to configure a separate mild oc and standard timings on my 4x8 and utilize it as a swap for when I\u2019m rendering. I\u2019m running a Corsair rm850i and it handles both GPUs with my oc settings and all the other bells and whistles just fun, my max load when testing at 5.2ghz was around 450-468w (depending on the testing) from the wall. my latest config on the build Edited by foxlite - Today at 1:06 am", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "psu", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:02.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06103c123aedfd6f5f5ed6b7ed3769ffa45c82c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSxGFYsnbQZyaptUVmLwwG_o-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "06103c123aedfd6f5f5ed6b7ed3769ffa45c82c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSxGFYsnbQZyaptUVmLwwG_o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ".sidebar .section .primaryContent h3, .sidebar .section .secondaryContent h3, .profilePage .mast .section.infoBlock h3 {\r\n    font-size: 13px;\r\n    color: rgb(83, 83, 83);\r\n    background: #ff8900;\r\n    background: -webkit-linear-gradient(to right, #ff8900, #ffe600);\r\n    background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff8900, #ffe600);\r\n    box-shadow: 0 19px 38px rgba(0,0,0,0.30), 0 15px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.22);\r\n    padding: 8px;\r\n    margin-bottom: 8px;\r\n    border: 0px solid rgb(226, 226, 226);\r\n    font-weight: 600;\r\n    margin-right: -9px;\r\n    margin-top: -9px;\r\n    margin-left: -9px;\r\n}", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:02.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5077955f2cd2fc2024c5a934e002fb5e56d374e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyR00IsoRycVC2e1vjVOgzv0e_pKVuATLiXwuOVIf41i3XNkn.joNBRyS0XAUa03LhhX83MwfoavSmX3WEQ2sLgFLC9jNdCIL1oUGSmd16dZTGTVIMW6EYBBmE0Oe4DYbEfO5jrcSW.znhkvzXxoBRb5YjKY5ApUGK1FMOLXQKz0Qg--", "site_full": "www.thelincolnianonline.com", "site": "thelincolnianonline.com", "site_section": "http://www.thelincolnianonline.com/feed", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "The Lincolnian Online", "title": "Liberty Interactive Corporation (QVCA) Expected to Announce Earnings of $0.47 Per Share", "title_full": "Liberty Interactive Corporation (QVCA) Expected to Announce Earnings of $0.47 Per Share", "published": "2017-12-07T12:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/liberty-media-corp-logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5077955f2cd2fc2024c5a934e002fb5e56d374e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyR00IsoRycVC2e1vjVOgzv0e_pKVuATLiXwuOVIf41i3XNkn.joNBRyS0XAUa03LhhX83MwfoavSmX3WEQ2sLgFLC9jNdCIL1oUGSmd16dZTGTVIMW6EYBBmE0Oe4DYbEfO5jrcSW.znhkvzXxoBRb5YjKY5ApUGK1FMOLXQKz0Qg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Donna Armstrong", "published": "2017-12-07T12:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Liberty Interactive Corporation (QVCA) Expected to Announce Earnings of $0.47 Per Share", "text": "Liberty Interactive Corporation (QVCA) Expected to Announce Earnings of $0.47 Per Share Posted by Donna Armstrong | Dec 7th, 2017 \nBrokerages expect Liberty Interactive Corporation (NASDAQ:QVCA) to report earnings of $0.47 per share for the current fiscal quarter, according to Zacks .

About Graphics Drivers: While installing the graphics driver allows the system to properly recognize the chipset and the card manufacturer, updating the video driver can bring about various changes. It can improve the overall graphics experience and performance in either games or various engineering software applications, include support for newly developed technologies, add compatibility with newer GPU chipsets, or resolve different problems that might have been encountered. When it comes to applying this release, the installation steps should be a breeze, as each manufacturer tries to make them as easy as possible so that each user can update the GPU on their own and with minimum risks (however, check to see if this download supports your graphics chipset). Therefore, get the package (extract it if necessary), run the setup, follow the on-screen instructions for a complete and successful installation, and make sure you reboot the system so that the changes take effect.

About Wireless LAN Drivers: Windows OSes usually apply a generic driver that allows systems to recognize the wireless component. However, in order to use all available features of this hardware, you must install the appropriate drivers. Enabling the wireless card allows systems to read chipset information and manufacturer name, as well as connect to a network without using an Ethernet cable. Updating the driver version can resolve different compatibility issues, fix related errors spotted throughout the product's usage, add support for new operating systems, improve transfer speed, as well as bring various other changes. As for applying this release, the installation steps should not pose to much of a challenge since each producer intends to make the procedure as easy as possible: just download the package, run the setup, and follow the on-screen instructions. Bear in mind that we do not recommend you install this release on OSes other than the specified ones even though other platforms might also be suitable. Also, when the update has finished, do perform a restart to ensure that all changes take effect properly. Therefore, if you wish to apply this package, click the download button, and setup the wireless card on your system.

About Graphics Drivers: While installing the graphics driver allows the system to properly recognize the chipset and the card manufacturer, updating the video driver can bring about various changes. It can improve the overall graphics experience and performance in either games or various engineering software applications, include support for newly developed technologies, add compatibility with newer GPU chipsets, or resolve different problems that might have been encountered. When it comes to applying this release, the installation steps should be a breeze, as each manufacturer tries to make them as easy as possible so that each user can update the GPU on their own and with minimum risks (however, check to see if this download supports your graphics chipset). Therefore, get the package (extract it if necessary), run the setup, follow the on-screen instructions for a complete and successful installation, and make sure you reboot the system so that the changes take effect. That being said, download the driver, apply it on your system, and enjoy your newly updated graphics card.

Nothing tacky.\nAlready have a private room reserved at their favorite steakhouse with family and friends to surprise them.\n<stumped>", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:02.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e08771362179dfbf92c5dc8c38fc240818509e93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwAKTPg6EMTT02yQ6YyIgqIZsYHD22O6qldrA1hBO4degwluIA4.QOrJNIlHrVzZaEFB24Z155urcRtwNfTDrvZCi0vHQVOivk-", "site_full": "forum.surfer.com", "site": "surfer.com", "site_section": "http://forum.surfer.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=1", "site_categories": ["surfing_bodyboarding", "non_standard_content", "adult", "sports"], "section_title": "Surfer Discussion | SURFER Magazine Forum | Surf News, Fantasy Surfer, Photos, Video, and Forecasting", "title": "Rotator Cuff", "title_full": "Rotator Cuff | Surfer Discussion | SURFER Magazine Forum | Surf News, Fantasy Surfer, Photos, Video, and Forecasting", "published": "2017-12-06T12:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e4153d80212ec72298eb7c239ce45b59ea969712", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwAKTPg6EMTT02yQ6YyIgqIZsYHD22O6qldrA1hBO4degwluIA4.QOrJNIlHrVzZaEFB24Z155urcRtwNfTDrvZ1Sl0tGvoNtFbPs0epm.66w--", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "b.r.", "published": "2017-12-06T08:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "my shoulders are pretty jacked, my left one got so bad i couldn't even do a few push ups, but I've got two cortisone shots over the last 5 years and they really helped with the pain, the last time my doc said this is the last one, so i've been much better about keeping up the light weights and push ups etc while the pain is minor, keeping the weight down is easier for paddling too, but lately the wife has been into drinking sculpin and i'm not gonna let her drink alone..", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:02.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e08771362179dfbf92c5dc8c38fc240818509e93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwAKTPg6EMTT02yQ6YyIgqIZsYHD22O6qldrA1hBO4degwluIA4.QOrJNIlHrVzZaEFB24Z155urcRtwNfTDrvZCi0vHQVOivk-", "site_full": "forum.surfer.com", "site": "surfer.com", "site_section": "http://forum.surfer.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=1", "site_categories": ["surfing_bodyboarding", "non_standard_content", "adult", "sports"], "section_title": "Surfer Discussion | SURFER Magazine Forum | Surf News, Fantasy Surfer, Photos, Video, and Forecasting", "title": "Rotator Cuff", "title_full": "Rotator Cuff | Surfer Discussion | SURFER Magazine Forum | Surf News, Fantasy Surfer, Photos, Video, and Forecasting", "published": "2017-12-06T12:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21b820ff2a06a753d9161314d5f8403450f28b7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwAKTPg6EMTT02yQ6YyIgqIZsYHD22O6qldrA1hBO4degwluIA4.QOrJNIlHrVzZaEFB24Z155urcRtwNfTDrvZ1Sl0tGvoNtEOpbBuzufiiw--", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "heelnipstr", "published": "2017-12-06T08:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "My left should has the same problem but not as bad.

Mazars also plans to take on a number of graduates in its bid to reach the target. \nAlongside the acquisition of RCL Consultancy, Mazars revealed it would lauch a joint venture with Embark in the employee benefits market. This will see both businesses' current activities in the space merged together in a single company called Vested Employee Benefits. \nThe new company will be aimed at small to medium sized businesses with between 100 and 750 employees. Mazars said Vested would go 'beyond traditional flexible benefits and auto-enrolment' to consider workplace saving schemes and other such initiatives. \nVested will be part of The Embark Group and owned 51% by Embark and 49% by Mazars. \nMazars UK senior partner Phil Verity said: 'The combination of these transactions continues our rapid growth in the UK financial planning market, a core sector for Mazars in the UK, and through Vested we will retain our engagement in the employee benefits consulting market, in a collaboration that greatly increases our chance of material success.'
