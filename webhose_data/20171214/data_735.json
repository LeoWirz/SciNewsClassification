The stark trend also helps explain why Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said tax increases are not a matter of if, but when.\nMr Tan sees the Government increasing the goods and services tax (GST) next year to 8 per cent from 7 per cent, with an equal boost in 2019.\nStill, he noted: \"The demographic time bomb starts ticking only in 2018 - it does not mean that it will explode yet. There is still a sizeable percentage of working-age population supporting the economy. That said, one will have to understand that this cannot last for ever.\"\nIn a briefing on the outlook for next year, OCBC Bank economist Selena Ling argued that it would be overly simplistic to immediately assume a broad-based GST hike.\nThere are many other options for taxes the Government could hike to substantially raise revenues, she said yesterday.\nThe timing for any tax hike has to be carefully considered, because next year will likely see a confluence of factors that will make the operating environment challenging for businesses in Singapore, and a GST hike would exacerbate matters, she noted.\nBLOOMBERG\nSingapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resident population A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on December 07, 2017, with the headline 'S'pore faces 'demographic time bomb''.

Yet, over half of the children in rural areas do not achieve their growth potential (stunting) and every sixth child is too thin (wasted). Those responsible for most of this produce, the female agricultural workers, have some of the poorest health and nutrition outcomes. How is this possible and what can we do to remedy this situation? \n\nThis and more was the theme of a policy dialogue on health and nutrition at the 10th Annual Conference on the International Day of Rural Women organized by Potohar Organization for Development Advocacy ( PODA ). The discussion, sponsored by National Commission on the Status of Women ( NCSW ) and Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia ( LANSA ) sought to raise the issue of recognition of women agricultural workers. It discussed the impact of their work on their own health and their children\u2019s nutrition. The panel, chaired by Chairperson National Commission on the Status of Women, Ms. Khawar Mumtaz and co-chaired by Executive Director PODA Ms. Kaukab Jehan, featured Ms. Akeela Naz (Member, Anjuman Muzareen), Dr. Huma Qureshi (Public Health Specialist, National Commission on the Status of Women), Ms. Benazir Jatoi (Lawyer and activist) and Ms. Sabiha Nazeer (Member National Assembly, PML-N) and was moderated by Mr. Haris Gazdar. \n\nThree-quarters of Pakistan\u2019s female workforce is employed in agriculture. Activities such as cotton picking and livestock care rely particularly on women\u2019s labour, but their toil is not recognized as work by the government, employers, communities, families or the women themselves. Akeela Naz said that despite undertaking much of the livestock work, and being responsible for producing nutrient rich foods such as fresh milk, the diet of a rural woman remains severely inadequate. Pakistan\u2019s key cash crops - cotton, sugarcane and wheat - are primarily dependent on the labour of female agricultural workers, but these women do not benefit from their income. \n\nMs. Sabiha Nazeer concurred, saying that many women agricultural workers have no agency over their income, and the money is spent by the male members of their family. According to her, women\u2019s work including farm work, domestic work and even embroidery work is not recognized as (paid) work by the male members of their households. She reinforced the fact that the work done by women agricultural workers is by far greater than what the men in rural areas do and perhaps getting them represented in the Kissan Board will begin the process of recognition of their rights by the state.\n\nDr. Huma Qureshi said that one of the reasons for such poor nutritional indicators is women\u2019s own lack of concern about their health while prioritizing their family, especially their children. Women must prioritize their wellbeing.\n\nBenazir Jatoi highlighted the need to step back and think about the underlying causes that limit the protection of the rights of women and children. In her opinion, the issue exists because the Pakistani state still has yet to recognize women as equal citizens. Even though our legal framework \u2013 the Constitution of Pakistan, and international conventions make special mention for provisions for women and children, little has been done when it comes to implementing their rights. Women in both urban and rural areas face \u2018poverty of time\u2019 by constantly trying to balance their responsibilities within the household such as taking care of elders and children, doing domestic chores, and working outside their homes. When faced with the time trade-off of working for the household or taking care of themselves and their children, women find themselves facing a harsh choice. There is need for laws around basic family training where both men and women have the same agency. She highlighted examples from other countries where the state has played a more active role in recognizing its female agricultural workforce, such as India where women are included in the definition of farmers. \n\nTo ensure the health and wellbeing of majority of Pakistan\u2019s female workforce, it is important to legally acknowledge their contribution by recognizing their rights over their incomes. \u201cEvery woman should be recognized as a farmer, and be paid minimum wage similar to that of a skilled worker\u201d said Ms. Mumtaz. In her opinion, the next general elections provide an opportunity for party workers to include this demand in their manifestos and invited all partners to come together to create a rural women manifesto that would look at women equally in the rural and urban context. The conference resolution [1] adopted these demands for recognition of women agricultural workers as farmers and labourers and called on the government for gender sensitized programmes and policies across all sectors.\n\nTo realize these objectives, we need all partners including government, legislators, activists, researchers, donors, media and the civil society to come together to ensure that women in agriculture are given their due recognition. To facilitate this, LANSA Pakistan aims to build a network of partners that work jointly on a sustained basis to further this agenda and champion the cause. To join the network or learn more, please reach out to LANSA Pakistan at  researchtoaction@researchcollective.org or +92-21-34551482.\n\n[1] The conference resolution stated: \na) All women who do any work in farming, livestock and fisheries, whether the work is paid or unpaid, whether it is as labourers or as family helpers, to be given legal recognition as 'farmers and agricultural workers' and entitled all rights of farmers and labourers [Conference Resolution 12] \nb) Policies and programs in agriculture, livestock, fisheries, health, nutrition and social protection must take into account and proactively mitigate any negative impacts of women's work in agriculture on their health and the health and nutrition of their children [Conference Resolution 13] ", "highlightText": "",

Virat Kohli and Bollywood diva Anushka Sharma are all set to tie the knot in the second week of this month, according to reports. \nThe wedding is scheduled to place in Italy and the tentative dates are December 9, 10, 11 and 12. The Indian captain had opted for rest after the Test series and this might well be the reason why Kohli wanted a break before embarking on the important tour of South Africa. Sources also said Kohli will soon be applying for a partner visa in the 'wife' category for Team India's tour that will be held early next year. \nIn place of Kohli, Rohit Sharma will lead the team in both ODIs and T20Is against Sri Lanka, starting December 10. \nAlso Watch: Kohli, Anushka sizzle at Zaheer and Sagarika's wedding reception \nReports further suggest that the posh wedding is going to take place in Milan and Kohli might be leaving for Italy in a day's time. \nFashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee was spotted at Anushka's house last week fuelling specualtions that he might design the bridal wear. \nThe occassion is going to be a private affair and till now no cricketer has been invited. \nAnushka and Kohli will be hosting a grand reception in Mumbai on December 21 where the couple would invite cricketers and Bollywood stars.

The coach added that he would be attending the wedding of his 'nephew'. \n\"Delhi will be playing the semi-final of the CK Nayudu Trophy after quite some time, but coach Rajkumar Sharma requested for leave as he has some family commitments. Robin Singh Jr will stand in for him in this game,\" a DDCA official told a news website.

Luckily he was one of the first guys I spoke to about this and he said whatever you do don't try to hide it because you'll stress yourself. And on top of that you're in a relationship, you're not doing anything wrong,\" Kohli had said. A post shared by Virat Kohli (@virat.kohli) on Feb 14, 2017 at 11:33pm PST \n\"I'm actually very grateful that my first interaction about this was with Zak. And he told me the right thing to do so I've followed it ever since.\" \n\"Luckily I have never tried to change myself over the years. But the flip has been because of her. That period in England in 2014. Anushka was there in my life, she understood what I was going through so she kept me motivated. A post shared by Sara (@virushka_folyf) on Nov 27, 2017 at 11:11pm PST \n\"Her support helped me push through, however bad it was for me. She was a constant in that time... And then Australia happened (the tour in 2014-15 when Kohli scored four hundreds in four Tests) and I ended up scoring runs, in her presence. So it was a special thing for both of us because she also faced a lot of flak. We were being criticised and people were saying this is what happens when you allow girlfriends on the tour. I thought, if you don't think this is right then no one can be in a relationship. According to you all -- either get married or remain single. How can that be?\" he said. \nSparks flew between Virat and Anushka when they were shooting for a shampoo commercial in 2013. Since then, fans have been falling in love with their displays of affection and their denials. \nWatch: \nWell, the news of the couple's marriage broke last December and turned out to be false. However, this time, something might just happen. \nAlthough there has been no confirmation about the couple's winter wedding and according to Anushka's spokesperson, these are baseless rumours.

While Hamilton started the season-opener from pole position Vettel hounded him then jumped ahead and was the first person to stand on the top step of the podium in 2017. Mercedes\u2019 fears and Ferrari\u2019s hopes were realised. \nWhat Ferrari had achieved was a car in the SF70H that worked in all conditions and was able to manage and manipulate the new Pirelli tyres \u2013 which allowed them to operate consistently every race weekend. Whilst they might not have had the best car in qualifying or down the straights, they dependably quick on race day across a broader range of conditions. This was the case for much of the first half of the season. \nUntil the summer break the team was in the fight for both world titles. Vettel led the driver\u2019 title fight for more than half the season. But defeat to Hamilton at the team\u2019s home race put the Merceeds driver ahead. \nAnd then came Ferrari\u2019s Asian collapse. Singapore typified their reversal in fortunes. Vetel claimed pole position and had his team mate plus the Red Bulls as a bulwark to the Mercedes, the team lost both cars in a first-lap crash while Hamilton took his most surprising win of the year. \nIf Vettel\u2019s risky gambit in Singapore handed Hamilton the initiative in the title fight, Ferrari technical problems in the next two races virtually killed off Vettel\u2019s championship hopes. Aside from a pair of punctures at Silverstone, Ferrari had a strong record of finishing races. But it failed to maintain that record as power unit problems wrecked its next two races. A spark plug failure which ended Vettel\u2019s race in Japan was blamed on a \u00a345 (\u20ac52) part. \n>> Find out more and sign up \nRaikkonen had his first pole since 2008 In contrast Mercedes were almost bulletproof. Revisions to the technical regulations on how engines consumed oil also eroded another of Ferrari\u2019s strengths. \nIn the latter years of Luca di Montezemolo\u2019s Ferrari championship near-misses resulted in a traditional rolling of senior heads. This has not happened so far. Inevitably paddock rumours swirled around president Sergio Marchionne\u2019s faith in Maurizio Arrivabene but Vettel gave his team principal a strong vote of confidence. He unsurprisingly did the same for Raikkonen, who largely failed to offer any serious competition in the second car. \n\u201cIn the end Mercedes was better,\u201d was Vettel\u2019s assessment of their season. \u201cThey were faster \u2013 look at the amount of pole positions, of race wins\u201d. However the fact Mercedes took 12 wins to their five somewhat embellishes the advantage the silver cars had for much of this year. It was a closer title fight than the final scoreline looked. \nFor Vettel, \u201cthe positives outweigh the disappointments\u201d and that is hard to disagree with. But if the team don\u2019t build on the progress they showed in 2017 he may yet regret committing to them for another three years. 2017 F1 season review", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hamilton", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "vettel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raikkonen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maurizio arrivabene", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ferrari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vettel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pirelli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red bull", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silverstone", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:55.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4dcd844c323621b2fb2521bdd1a278b62fcb7091", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWHt5tn._XwL8KAFUY3YtaEHbQ3rnWK6bRdO9C4XpY1diuNV3qO6iv4oOpf5PwSwmg-", "site_full": "nihives.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://nihives.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "NORTHERN IRELAND HIVEs", "title": "AFF Survey", "title_full": "AFF Survey", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4dcd844c323621b2fb2521bdd1a278b62fcb7091", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWHt5tn._XwL8KAFUY3YtaEHbQ3rnWK6bRdO9C4XpY1diuNV3qO6iv4oOpf5PwSwmg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HIVE Blog SW (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "AFF Survey", "text": "TAKE THE SURVEY HERE ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:55.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9a697d7eaf62d66f385d6d9c2ac2c42c075bf53", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyje0PKxJXngNtvYolSL63WiAXsIQDVdUoaQbeuJr3_rWgNoWirykvQM2VFFiwVgomGqnSCe3ue8BavP1pMZJTkMlEmsT6A228w3u1_a7yze_an1C_ThXt29Xhri4JzT6y6rBfXNIJqDDVyCsUrglwairYTw_X.QwbydDUwFYY.eA--", "site_full": "peopletoday24.com", "site": "peopletoday24.com", "site_section": "http://peopletoday24.com/page/3/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "People Today 24 \u2013 Page 3", "title": "DHA Algae Oil 30%-40% Manufacturer: DSM, Lonza, Cellana, JC Biotech, FEMICO and Roquette", "title_full": "Global DHA Algae Oil 30%-40% Market 2017 Top Manufacturer: DSM, Lonza, Cellana, JC Biotech, FEMICO and Roquette \u2013 People Today 24", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9a697d7eaf62d66f385d6d9c2ac2c42c075bf53", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyje0PKxJXngNtvYolSL63WiAXsIQDVdUoaQbeuJr3_rWgNoWirykvQM2VFFiwVgomGqnSCe3ue8BavP1pMZJTkMlEmsT6A228w3u1_a7yze_an1C_ThXt29Xhri4JzT6y6rBfXNIJqDDVyCsUrglwairYTw_X.QwbydDUwFYY.eA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "alton", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "DHA Algae Oil 30%-40% Manufacturer: DSM, Lonza, Cellana, JC Biotech, FEMICO and Roquette", "text": "DHA Algae Oil 30%-40% Market\nThe Market Analysis on Global DHA Algae Oil 30%-40% Market 2017 Research Report studies current as well as future aspects of the DHA Algae Oil 30%-40% Market primarily based upon factors on which the companies compete in the market, key trends and segmentation analysis.

Cushman & Wakefield\u2019 s UK Student Accommodation Report 2017/18 looks at the student accommodation market across the UK, including demand and supply of new developments. While the numbers of newly delivered en-suite and studio spaces have both increased significantly, the supply of studio rooms has increased by 106% since 2014. Overall rents per bed space in student accommodation increased 2.9% between academic years 2016/17 and 2017/18, marginally above the 2.7% seen during the same period in the previous year, indicating the sustained health of the student accommodation market as a whole. However, there were significant variations across the UK as well as by type and sector. In Manchester, which has the largest student population outside of London, annual studio rents increased by 5% despite the number of studio beds rising 61% thanks to tight restrictions on development. In Glasgow, however, the number of studio beds increased 29%, while annual rents decreased by 2%. En-suite rents have increased by the most in Birmingham and Bristol (4%), followed by Edinburgh, Manchester and Nottingham (3%). En-suite rents are highest in London, at an average cost of \u20ac 221.2 (\u00a3195) per week. In Manchester, they average \u20ac161.1 (\u00a3142) per week but the cheapest average weekly rent of the cities surveyed was in Sheffield - \u20ac136.1 (\u00a3120) per week. \nThe private sector continues to offer the most expensive accommodation in the market, with average annual rents per bed space (excluding London) in the private sector 21%- \u20ac1215.1 (\u00a31071) per year - more expensive than university managed accommodation. Within the private sector, the annual difference between studios and en-suites (excluding London) is 45% - \u20ac2964.6 (\u00a32613) per year. \nThe private sector dominates the supply of new developments, delivering 87% of all new beds so far in 2017/18. However, universities continue to provide the largest number of bed spaces, offering 57% of all rooms available in 2017/18. Overall en-suite bed spaces now represent 56% of the market, whilst studios account for 12% of all beds. \nDavid Feeney, Advisory Associate at Cushman & Wakefield, commented : \u201cIt is encouraging that the student accommodation market continues to flourish despite initial concerns following the EU Referendum and the impact of increased student tuition fees. However, in a number of cases studio development has been driven by higher prices rather than by true student demand, which now risks oversupply. En-suites and shared rooms provide a cheaper bed and more of a social experience, with communal and shared spaces. There is a real opportunity for developers to meet the demands for more affordable accommodation and provide more standard or en-suite rooms for students. Studios are 45% more expensive but do they offer a 45% better experience? It is all about the value of the experience and this will increasingly drive students\u2019 preferences for accommodation.\u201d Student numbers vs. Fees & Brexit More students than ever (1.04m) are studying away from home meaning the demand pool for accommodation continues to grow. Full-time student numbers are now 4% higher than in 2012/13, when maximum tuition fees rose to \u20ac10211 (\u00a39000) per year, and continue to drive growth in the sector. Higher-tariff universities grew enrolments by 1%, with medium-tariff institutions growing by 2%, proving that despite some concern about the impact of the Brexit vote on student numbers, there remains a considerable demand for new accommodation. In terms of the investment market, final recorded transaction volumes in 2016 of \u20ac4.6bn (\u00a34.1bn) were the second highest total on record but well below the 2015 total of \u20ac6.4bn (\u00a35.7bn). Transactions in 2017 to-date are ahead of this time last year at \u20ac4.1bn (\u00a33.61bn) (\u20ac3.69bn - \u00a33.25bn in 2016) but unlike 2016 there is a further \u20ac1.19bn (\u00a31.05bn) under offer and \u20ac1.7bn (\u00a31.5bn) in the market, double the totals for last year. David Feeney continued : \u201cThe UK is still a global education hub, attracting the best students from around the world. Even with Britain\u2019s exit from the EU progressing, the relatively weak Pound has attracted additional applications from non-EU students, with their numbers rising 5% over the last year. It is a key market, as 23% of the UK student population is now from overseas. In funding terms, foreign students have a much greater impact on the income profile of UK universities, making up 26% of all tuition fee income. It is clear that the UK remains a highly attractive place for students to study and this continues to be reflected in the growing student accommodation market.

Pushed the envelope a bit this one, partly because of new found ways of coping, to trial & error, and always the nature of it anyway, that may not change by the sounds.\nI\"m accepting now through hearing more form WK & Doc that it'll always be there but I'll be in full control over it. YEAH MAN! WOW mammoth to get hold of.\nRare the tiredness being so extreme that I get very dry in mouth, tongue, Doc said ? dehydration, could be but I do drink lot of water usually, have had times of mouth ulcers through sheer deep exhaustion, these days I don't hit the wall as such & then it'd keep pushing. But close to full exhaustion.\nWas very social this one, and here too, distraction been good, mood tried today after getting up from sleep to pull me but here's helped, migrainy family head not helping issue. Think from neck they reckon but don't know for sure, had brain scan, YES HAVE ONE, yehaaa for that and no bads.\nOnly one other slight mania amongst coming down.

And a woman, 10 days past her due date, has to be flown from Shetland to the mainland for specialist assistance giving birth.

They said if the EC does not respond immediately, they will approach the court. The All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary, Dipak Babaria, Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) General Secretary, Iqbal Sheikh, and GPCC legal cell chairman, Yogesh Ravani, approached the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), Gujarat, to complain against three tainted officials who have been assigned poll duties during the upcoming assembly elections. Asking that they be removed from poll duty, Babaria alleged that an IAS officer Mahendra Patel, promoted as Collector and District Magistrate (DM) Surat, has a \"dubious\" role as an official. Patel had made personal comments against Congress President Sonia Gandhi on his Facebook page. Patel was directly connected with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and had also sought BJP ticket from Unjha seat for the assembly elections, he said. \"We ask the EC to not allow him to oversee the election process and he must be removed immediately to ensure free and fair elections,\" said Babaria. The GPCC has also sought that \"tainted\" official, Rajkumar Pandian (IPS), Range IG, Junagadh/Porbandar at present, also be removed from overseeing the poll process. Pandian was jailed in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case for several years. Earlier, he had been the Superintendent of Police (SP) of Porbandar. There is apprehension of \"biased attitude and adverse effect\" on the election process in the area. They have sought that another \"tainted\" IPS official, Abhay Chudasam, posted as range IG, be removed from poll duty. Chudasam was also involved in the fake encounters of Sohrabuddin and Ishrat Jahan. He was jailed for several years for the same. His engagement in the election process is likely to prejudice the entire poll process and so he should be transferred from the duty immediately, they petitioned. CEO, Gujarat, B.B. Swain has accepted the contention by the GPCC and forwarded it to the EC Delhi. The GPCC spokesperson said that if the EC does not respond immediately, they will approach the judiciary.

Of course, even if you\u2019re this far ahead of the game, it isn\u2019t easy to be an agent of holiday magic; there are complications, mostly in the form of curious little brains, and fingers quite capable of rooting through the most well-concealed packages. \nYou need to hide those purchases and hide them well , because all children, whether or not they can count or tie their shoes or make a sandwich, turn into sophisticated, pint-sized Sherlocks this time of year. It\u2019s like these little sleuths are determined to not be surprised! They\u2019ve got their tiny eyes on us this month and they are not blinking. So here are some hiding places that are worth trying, although when it comes to outfoxing children around holiday time, there are no guarantees. \nUnder the Bed : If there\u2019s any space left under there, i.e., if you haven\u2019t already crammed all your summer clothes in that small space (most of which you\u2019ve \u201coutgrown\u201d), then this is an option. Just make sure no one suggests a game of hide-and-seek, because this is a perfect place for a small child to hide and also suddenly seek that new transformer he requested. \nTrunk of the car : Just toss the purchases in the back and secretly chauffeur them around all month. This works best if you have a trunk that fully closes and locks. It doesn\u2019t work as well if you have a hatchback or an SUV with free access all the way back and an acrobatic child who has to do a few rounds of full-car parkour before finally settling into his car seat. \nClothes dryer : What\u2019s nice about the dryer is that you can use it as an excuse to take a break from laundry all month\u2013i.e. Oh, well <sigh> the dryer is out of commission right now. While there is absolutely no chance your child will open that door in order to help you with household chores, he might go on a mission to find his beloved Superman T-shirt (still dirty, at the bottom of the hamper) and discover the passionately-requested Airplane LEGO kit you were trying to stow in there instead. \nHigh Cabinets : If you have space. Of course, that\u2019s unlikely thanks to those dusty margarita glasses you haven\u2019t used in seven years. The other requirement is that you have a child who is afraid of heights. Most other kids seem to be born with invisible ladders: they bust them out and climb them so quickly when we\u2019re not looking. \nStorage Space : Consider renting out a secure storage space a few miles away. Even though this is not cost effective and certainly cancels out all the deals you got on both Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it is the perfect keep-away. Just don\u2019t lose the key or forget the pass-code, or you\u2019ll have to start the shopping process all over again, like your own holiday re-make of Groundhog Day . \nUnder the Tree : Go ahead and just wrap up the presents and place them under the tree, based on the perfectly reasonable idea that wrapping paper is a disguise and deterrent. Then, ask your child politely to please not rip them open. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! \nThe Store : The absolute best way to make sure your child is surprised is to just leave all those gifts in the stores. In other words, run out on Christmas Eve or on each day of Hanukkah and pick up gifts at the very last minute. Yes, this diminishes the chances that you\u2019ll find exactly what was requested, but, to be honest, the spelling and penmanship in that letter was a little unclear anyway\u2026 besides, a different, un-requested gift could be the biggest surprise of all.

This cycle sounds very emotionally charged.\nTake your time with posts and replies. There\u2019s no rush. Just when you\u2019re feeling up to it. Your health comes first.\nI think GG and Butterfly Wings have pretty much said it all. Like both of them plus many others here, I also admire your determination and ability to track/self assess your mood.\nThe lack of sleep must be making things harder for you...2.5 hours isn\u2019t much, I don\u2019t think.\nAs an aside, and maybe it\u2019s not relevant, but I wonder if you\u2019re fighting your emotions a little too much. Maybe if you just let the emotions \u201cflow\u201d (i.e. run its course) without necessarily analysing or giving it too much attention...just riding out the wave of emotion (as opposed to swimming against the emotional tide), I wonder if it would be a tiny bit less distressing that way.\nAnyway, that might not apply to you plus I don\u2019t have bipolar so you probably shouldn\u2019t take my suggestions too seriously. Just sharing my thoughts, that\u2019s all....\nAw, thank you so much for caring and asking about me. I really appreciate it. You\u2019re a very wonderful friend to so many people here (including me).\nI\u2019m holding up as best I can.

citizenship of 'football match-fixer' \n\nHe is accused of travelling to other countries as part of match-fixing efforts and transporting bribe money.\nSINGAPORE: Singapore Thursday revoked the citizenship of a Malian-born footballer for allegedly being a member of a global match-fixing syndicate, authorities and reports said.\nLocal media said Gaye Alassane, who played with a local club, was first detained in 2013 as part of a sweeping crackdown on match-fixing groups amid allegations that Singapore had become a hub for the illicit practice.\nAnnouncing the latest move, the interior ministry said it had stripped citizenship from a 43-year-old who was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153active and trusted member\u00e2\u20ac of a major syndicate which operated out of the Southeast Asian financial hub.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious criminal cond uct not only undermined the integrity of Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system, but also law and order,\u00e2\u20ac said a ministry statement.\nThe Straits Times identified him as Malian-born Alassane, a naturalised Singapore citizen who first came to the city-state in 1993. He is accused of travelling to other countries as part of match-fixing efforts and transporting bribe money.\nAllegations of Singapore being used as base for football match-fixing stained the city-state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation as one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s least corrupt nations, and prompted authorities to launch a clampdown.\nAlassane was reportedly a member of a syndicate led by businessman Dan Tan, which experts said was one of the most aggressive in the world.\nTan was first arrested in 2013 after being repeatedly cited in Italian court papers for his role in transnational match-fixing.\nHe has not faced a trial or been charged \u00e2\u20ac\" it can be difficult to bring cases against alleged match-fixers as witne sses are sometimes fearful of testifying \u00e2\u20ac\" but remains behind bars under a tough law that allows for suspects to be detained without charge.\nAlassane was detained under the same law in 2013 but was later released and is now under police supervision. He has the right to appeal the decision to revoke his citizenship, during which time he will stay in Singapore.\nPolice say global match-fixing generates billions of dollars a year in revenues, fuelled in part by the popularity of online betting on match results and game statistics.\n\nSource: Google News ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaye alassane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan tan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alassane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "straits times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interior ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore\u00e2", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:56.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "369e115c4b383571aa0b778a3a6783c692042223", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Ve7L5GpSwXSSYlNAPyBVBN0rfIkofHERHisywifMvGFCsTiGIpupZ_eYMb6O_8PUCItptbuscLA--", "site_full": "www.mrsallnut.com", "site": "mrsallnut.com", "site_section": "http://www.mrsallnut.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Se\u5358ora Allnut", "title": "grey and cold autumn", "title_full": "grey and cold autumn", "published": "2017-12-06T00:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c70cc175ad2b5111afa9360a9dacb68090eb0fea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Ve7L5GpSwXSSYlNAPyBVBN0rfIkofHERHisywifMvGFCsTiGIpupZ_eYMb6O_8PXujXfUmdfkP_s2tO3uyddl", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Vix", "published": "2017-12-07T11:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Having a week off at this time of year makes perfect sense!

No armed robber has ever held the entire country on ransom as Anini. In fact, his reign was so bloody that he was even discussed at the State Security Council meeting. He held the old Bendel State captive in the 1980s. Bendel is now known as Edo and Delta State. His main area of operation was Benin City to be precise. His early life Anini was born in a village about 20 miles from Benin City in present-day Edo State.He was  dreadfully called \u2018The Law\u2019 or \u2018Ovbigbo\u2019. An only son of his Evbueisi-born mother, he had two sisters. His father died when he was still a young boy. Anini was brought to Benin where he was admitted at the Oza Primary School but from a young age, he started manifesting the signs of truancy. He struggled to finish his primary school then entered the Igiedumu Secondary School. He did not spend more than three years when he dropped out of school, preferring to be an apprentice at a local mechanic workshop. That was around 1976. He started work as a lorry driver (some say taxi driver) after his master fired him and slowly transformed into a leader of the local motor parks, controlling and commanding touts. Following the sudden overthrow of the politicians in the early 1980s and banning of politics in 1984 by the Buhari regime the highly-skilled driver (now of of criminal gangs and godfathers) discovered that armed robbery was far more lucrative and decided to form his own deadly gang which included, Monday Osunbor, Friday Ofege, Henry Ekponwan, Eweka and Alhaji zed zed or Zegezege who was never captured.They started out as car hijackers, bus robbers and bank thieves. He sealed a pact with corrupt police officers and ruled with reckless abandon. The complicity of the police is believed to have triggered Anini\u2019s reign of terror in 1986.Highway robberies, car jackings, bank raids, Anini was a specialist in all aspects of pilfering with the gun.  Gradually, he extended his criminal acts to other towns and cities far north and east of Benin. In early 1986, two members of his gang were tried and prosecuted against an earlier under-the-table \u2018agreement\u2019 with the police to destroy evidence against the gang members. The incident, and Anini\u2019s view of police betrayal, is believed to have spurred retaliatory actions by Anini. In August, 1986, a fatal bank robbery linked to Anini was reported in which a police officer and others were killed. That same month, two officers on duty were shot at a barricade while trying to stop Anini\u2019s car. During a span of three months, he was known to have killed nine police officers. In an operation in August of 1986, the Anini team struck at First Bank, Sabongida-Ora, where they carted away N2, 000. But although the amount stolen was seen as chicken feed, they left the scene with a trail of blood. Many persons were killed. On September 6, same year, the Anini gang snatched a Peugeot 504 car from Albert Otoe, the driver of an Assistant Inspector General of Police, Christopher Omeben. In snatching the car, they killed the driver and went to hide his corpse somewhere. Three months later, the skeleton of the driver was spotted 16 kilometers away from Benin, along the Benin-Agbor highway. A day after this attack, Anini, operating in a Passat car believed to have been stolen, also effected the snatching of another Peugeot 504 car near the former FEDECO office, in Benin. Two days after, the Anini men killed two policemen in Orhiowon Local Government Area of the state. Still in that month, three different robbery attacks, all pointing to Anini\u2019s involvement, took place. A day after the operation, Anini, visited a village near Benin and threw wads of naira notes on the ground for free pick by market men and women. Between August and December 1986, he led a four-month reign of terror. He also reportedly wrote numerous letters to media houses using political tones of Robin Hood-like words, to describe his criminal acts. The search for Anini The then military President, General Ibrahim Babangida, saw the nation\u2019s fear for the daredevil and ordered a massive manhunt for the kingpin and his fellow robbers. The police thus went after them, combing every part of Bendel State where they were reportedly operating and living However,  the more they were hunted, the more intensified their activities became. Some of the locals in the area even began to tell stories of their invincibility and for a while, it felt like they were never going to be caught. At the conclusion of a meeting of the Armed Forces Ruling Council in October 1986, General Babangida turned to the Inspector-General of Police, Etim Inyang, and asked, \u2018My friend, where is Anini?\u2019 At about this time, Nigerian newspapers and journals were also publishing various reports and editorials on the \u2018Anini Challenge\u2019, the \u2018Anini Saga\u2019, the \u2018Anini Factor\u2019, \u2018Lawrence Anini \u2013 the Man, the Myth\u2019, \u2018Anini, Jack the Ripper\u2019, and \u2018Lawrence Anini: A Robin Hood in Bendel\u2019. The Guardian asked, emphatically, in one of its reports: \u2018Will they ever find Anini, \u201cThe Law\u201d?\u2019 His arrest The Anini terrror finally came to an end thanks to the courage of Superintendent of Police, Kayode Uanreroro. On December 3, 1986, Uanreroro caught Anini at No 26, Oyemwosa Street, opposite Iguodala Primary School, Benin City, in company with six women. Acting on a tip-off from the locals, the policeman went straight to the house where Anini was hiding and apprehended him with very little resistance. Uanreroro led a crack 10-man team to the house, knocked on the door of the room, and Anini himself, clad in underpants, opened the door. \u201cWhere is Anini?\u201d, the police officer quickly enquired. Dazed as he was caught off guard and having no escape route, Anini all the same tried to be smart. \u201cOh, Anini is under the bed in the inner room\u201d. As he said it, he made some moves to walk past Uanreroro and his team. In the process, he shoved and head-butted the police officer but it was an exercise in futility. Uanreroro promptly reached for his gun, stepped hard on Anini\u2019s right toes and shot at his left ankle. Anini surged forward but the policemen took hold of him and put him in a sitting position. They then pumped more bullets into his shot leg and almost severed the ankle from his entire leg. Already, anguished by the excruciating pains, the policemen asked him, \u201cAre you Anini?\u201d And he replied, \u201cMy brother, I won\u2019t deceive you; I won\u2019t tell you lie, I\u2019m Anini.\u201d While in the police net, Anini who had poor command of English and could only communicate in pidgin, made a whole lot of revelations. He disclosed, for instance that Osunbor, who had been arrested earlier, was his deputy, saying that Osunbor actually shot and wounded the former police boss of the state, Akagbosu. The daredevil robbers also revealed that some policemen assisted them in the criminal operations in Bendel State and the entire country. Anini particularly revealed that George Iyamu, who was the most senior police officer shielding the robbers, would reveal police secrets to them and then, give them logistic supports such as arms, to carry out robbery operations. Because of the numerous gunshots, Anini had one of his legs amputated in a military hospital. When his hideout was searched, police recovered assorted charms, including the one he usually wore around his waist during \u201coperations\u201d. All charms were disposed after his arrest. His execution Due to amputation of his leg, Anini was confined to a wheelchair throughout his trial. He was sentenced to death by Justice James Omo-Agege and executed on March 29, 1987.

The election for a new legislature in the western state of Gujarat this weekend is turning out to be a greater challenge for Modi than anticipated, the polls show, as rival parties seize on discontent caused by a slowing economy. Gujarat is where Modi earned his spurs as a business-friendly chief minister who cut red tape and graft and turned it into an economic powerhouse. But an unpopular national tax and a shock move last year to withdraw most currency in a fight against graft has hurt Gujarat, like the rest of the country, and its businessmen are making loud complaints. Three big polls carried out in the run-up to the vote on Saturday and next week have predicted a victory for Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but with a greatly reduced majority. An ABP-CDS poll this week gave the BJP 91-99 seats in the 182-member state house and the main opposition Congress 78-86, suggesting a close fight. To win a party needs 92 seats. The surveys have often gone wrong, though, and Modi himself remains far more popular across the country than his rivals including Rahul Gandhi who is leading the Congress charge to weaken Modi in his home base. Modi has thrown himself into the campaign, addressing dozens of rallies over the past month, saying he alone could deliver on development. On Thursday, he was due to address party colleagues on their mobile phones to ensure a strong voter turnout. Amit Shah, the president of the BJP, said the party had full confidence in Modi\u2019s ability to deliver an emphatic victory. \u201cHe knows that only an absolute majority in Gujarat polls will legitimise his reforms and silence critics,\u201d Shah said. Votes from the election will be counted on Dec.18 and the results announced the same day. Gujarati businesses - who form the core of Modi\u2019s support base - have complained about the new Goods and Services Tax as aggravating tough economic conditions. Jagdip Desai, a sanitary ware manufacturer, said the complex tax procedures had come on top of slowing demand and he had to fire 3,000 workers. \u201cModi will have to pay a political price for our financial distress.\u201d Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra mod", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jagdip desai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahul gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit shah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bharatiya janata party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:57.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f99d6129364ccba1dde0f947ecc84c4800830cbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR98uB0fySmkef48VQHdROnSFvvkeS4gDx8ovj4wHL93gFY6_XXZ_qHjh4.VO2K8gc-", "site_full": "af.reuters.com", "site": "reuters.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/AFRICAegyptNews", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Reuters: Egypt News", "title": "RPT-EXCLUSIVE-European Investment Bank plans internationally-focused offshoot", "title_full": "RPT-EXCLUSIVE-European Investment Bank plans internationally-focused offshoot", "published": "2017-12-07T10:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/images/rcom-default.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f99d6129364ccba1dde0f947ecc84c4800830cbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR98uB0fySmkef48VQHdROnSFvvkeS4gDx8ovj4wHL93gFY6_XXZ_qHjh4.VO2K8gc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "RPT-EXCLUSIVE-European Investment Bank plans internationally-focused offshoot", "text": "December 7, 2017 / 8:22 AM / in 2 hours RPT-EXCLUSIVE-European Investment Bank plans internationally-focused offshoot Reuters Staff (Repeats story that ran on Wednesday) * European Investment Bank planning 7-8 bln euro subsidiary * EU members positive in principle, working group to be set up * Focus initially on countries fuelling Europe\u2019s migrant crisis * Could see Britain maintain EIB relationship post Brexit By Marc Jones and Francesco Guarascio LONDON/BRUSSELS, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Europe\u2019s largest development bank, the EIB, has laid out plans for a new subsidiary focused solely on non-EU projects that it hopes could also keep some of Britain\u2019s billions in the bank after Brexit, European Union sources said. The outline of the new offshoot, which would initially focus on countries fuelling Europe\u2019s migrant crisis and lend around 7-8 billion euros a year, was given to EU finance ministers at their meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, the sources told Reuters. It aims to bring more of the EU\u2019s international development spending into a streamlined and market-savvy unit that would also be able to work hand-in-hand with the EU\u2019s various national development banks. A working group will now be formed to provide a more thorough examination by early next year, so that it can be factored into the first round of discussions on the EU\u2019s next 7-year spending cycle which starts in 2021. \u201cNearly two-thirds of (EU) member states spoke in the meeting and in principle the reaction was positive, i.e. let\u2019s go on with the discussion,\u201d said one source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIt is at the very early stage so they asked for more information... but the idea is that it will be a way to bundle Europe\u2019s external development policy to make it more efficient than it is today.\u201d Two other sources confirmed the proposals and the plan to mainly work - initially at least - in countries at the source of the recent EU immigration flood. Build better infrastructure and creating jobs should help to boost the appeal of staying put. \u201cConsensus in EU countries is that one of the most effective ways to tackle the migration issues is to deal with it at the point of origin,\u201d said a second EU source. Another crucial element to the plan\u2019s chances of success could also be Brexit negotiations. The European Investment Bank currently invests between 70 - 80 billion euros a year, with around 10 percent or 7-8 billion of that spent outside of the EU from central Africa to Argentina in Latin America. This is the money that would be redirected into the new EIB subsidiary but there could be a snag. Britain\u2019s departure from the EU is expected to see it take its 16 percent stake in EIB leaving a hole of up to 9 billion euros in its finances. The complex web of long-term projects means Britain might have to wait decades to get all its EIB money back. However the sources said the new subsidiary may be a way for the UK to keep at least some of its money in. \u201cIt could be a way for the UK to continue engaging in development projects together with the EIB after Brexit,\u201d one source said pointing to the model could be the European Investment Fund (EIF) which is already open to non-EU members. Britain\u2019s finance minister Philip Hammond, was in Brussels for the ECOFIN meeting where the proposals were laid out. In a speech in June he said it may be \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d to maintain a post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EIB. Asked by Reuters for a comment on the new proposals, a UK Treasury spokesman said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s future relationship with the EIB will be determined as part of the negotiations on our exit from the EU.\u201d TURF WAR Though most countries were generally positive on the plan, one source said there were some concerns it could dilute the influence EU member states and the Brussels-based European Commission have in international development spending. Another potential issue is that it could lead to a turf-war with the smaller, London-based, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which the EU states and the EIB itself are also shareholders in. It invests around 10 billion euros-a-year in total but Turkey, which is central to the EU\u2019s migrant crisis, is now its biggest market and it also works in other countries in the nearby region like Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon. \u201cClearly we should avoid overlaps,\u201d the first EU source said. \u201cIt (new EIB subsidiary) should really lead to more efficiency and more synergies.\u201d What the EIB is also hoping for is that the EU\u2019s bigger national development banks will also be involved in the new arrangement. \u201cNo amount of public money is going to be enough to help meet the Sustainable Development Goals. We need to focus on \u2018crowding-in\u2019 private sector finance,\u201d the person added.
