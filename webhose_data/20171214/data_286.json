WCD is another 'topping-up' exercise which awards additional points and    I'll have a lot more to say about the WPBR in the days ahead, but just reflect on the fact that the NSWP part of the scheme introduced a bogus 'rule' which meant that only those employees contracted to work for 37 hours a week benefited from a working hours payment. \n\nNow this was, and is, completely outrageous and discriminatory because this invented 'rule' was designed to benefit the Gardeners, Gravediggers and Road Workers. \n\nYet, the GMB union kept its head down and didn't kick up absolute hell on behalf of Home Carers, for example, who were contracted to fewer than 37 hours and received no payment whatsoever, unlike their male colleagues. \n\nThe same is true of shift payments   the 'rules' of which   which tend to reward traditiona l  male jobs for changing their shifts more than twice during a working week. \n\nYet thousands of Home carriers have been working split shifts - the most unpopular shift of all - but don't receive any recognition for having to be at work twice during the same day. \n\nStay tuned for more from the blog site about Glasgow's cockamamy WPBR pay scheme - and in the meantime share this post with your friends and co-workers. \n\nBecause when it comes to the fight for equal pay - knowledge is power. \n\n    \nGlasgow Pay Arrangements (06/04/17) \nA Home Carer from Glasgow has been in touch to say that she (and many others) work a 50 hour week and a 20 hour week the week week, so why don't they qualify for a NSWP payment in Week 1 at least? \nNow that's a good question because fairness and common sense would suggest that such a shift working arrangement would qualify for an NSWP payment at Level B for at least half the year, perhaps more if overtime hours were also taken into account. \n\nBut I'm pretty sure that Glasgow City Council interprets these 'cockamamy rules' in a way that is to the disadvantage of Home Carers by treating the 2 weeks as a 35-hour average so that the staff concerned receive no payment.  \n\nMy own view is that the NSWP working hours payment ought to be paid on a 'pro rata' basis like other pay related benefits such as sick, holiday pay and sick pay - that way all Home Carers on a 35 hour working week would receive 35/37ths (or 95%) of a Level B NSWP payment. \n\nThe trade unions should be on to this as well if you ask me, because you don't have to work 37 hours before becoming eligible to join a union or to take part in a union strike ballot. \n\nThe real problem is that Glasgow City Council has just invented these 'cockamamy rules' which are impossible to justify as they go against the spirit and letter of the 1999 Single Status (Equal Pay) Agreement which is based on equal treatment for part-time workers. \n\n    \n\nCockamamy Council 'Rules'  (05/04/17) \nAs regular readers know, Action 4 Equality Scotland is challenging various aspects of Glasgow's WPBR (Workforce Pay and Benefits Review) which the City Council introduced back in 2006/07. \n\nOne of the most controversial aspects of the WPBR scheme is over additional payments that are made under the heading of NSWP (Non Standard Working Pattern) payments. \n\nI wrote previously on the blog site about how the Glasgow's predominantly female jobs seem to fare badly under the WPBR compared to their male colleagues, and this is also true when it comes to NSWP payments.   \n\nBecause one of the NSWP 'rules' is a requirement for employees to work 37 hours before they qualify for 7 'working hours' NSWP points. \n\nNow points mean prizes under the WPBR and 7 NSWP points means that a 37 hour a week employee qualifies for Level B Payment which was worth \u00a3800 a year in 2006 - almost \u00a310,000 over 12 years - and a whole lot more than people have been receiving in terms of annual pay increases, for example. \n\nSo who made up this barmy 'rule' and on what kind of twisted logic is this NSWP rule based? \n\nBecause it's completely crazy if you ask me - people don't have to work 37 hours to qualify for holiday pay, sick pay, or maternity pay - for example. \n\nAnd can it really be a coincidence that the vast majority of Glasgow City Council employees who work less than 37 hours a week are women?  \n\nCuriously all of Glasgow's hardworking Home Carers were placed on 35 hour a week contracts some years ago, so they miss out on a Level B Payment even though they work 95% of a 37 hour working week. \n\nThe 1999 Single Status (Equal Pay) Agreement was supposed to ensure equal treatment for part-time workers, but that seems not to have happened in Glasgow where mysterious rules have been invented (by whom?) to exclude the council's lowest paid workers. \n\nAs far as I know the trade unions in Glasgow haven't called or even threatened a single strike to defend the rights of thousands of part-time workers affected by this cockamamy 'rule' which is a complete disgrace, if you  ask me. \n\nBecause if points are to be awarded for hours worked, they should be pro-rated just like all other payments and benefits - not deliberately designed in such a way that treats women workers much less favourably than their male colleagues.  \n\nNo wonder the Labour leader of Glasgow City Council can't defend his party's position over equal pay, but readers are invited to drop Frank McAveety a note by email or Twitter and let him know what you think. \n\nEmail  -   frank.mcaveety@glasgow.gov.uk \nTwitter  -  @FMcAveety \n\n\n    \nGlasgow's Pay Arrangements (02/04/17) \nThe workforce at Glasgow City Council is predominantly female - around 70% of its 27,000 or so employees are women. \n\nSo, all things being equal, you would expect women to occupy around 70% or of each job category and for women to be involved in 70% or so of all work related issues - from sickness absence and disciplinary hearings to interviews for a promoted post. \n\nUnless, of course, there's a gender based explanation such as maternity or paternity leave - or there's some other factor at play such as discrimination, for example. \n\nHere's an interesting table which shines a light on the payments Glasgow City Council staff receive for doing shift work - the Non-Standard Working Pattern (NSWP) part of Glasgow's Workforce Pay and Benefits review (WPBR).  \n\nNSWP Percentage breakdown Grade 1 to 7 Grade Male Female Totals % of Males by grade in receipt of NSWP % of females by grade in receipt of NSWP 0 3293 15441 18734 39.71% 81.07% A 347 888 1235 4.18% 4.66% B 2528 1382 3910 30.49% 7.26% C 566 681 1247 6.83% 3.58% D 1213 210 1423 14.63% 1.10% E 20 43 63 0.24% 0.23% F 325 402 727 3.92% 2.11% TOTALS 8292 19047 27339 100.00% 100.00% In receipt of NSWP Gender yes no Grand Total % of All employees % of employees in receipt of NSWP by gender % of Gender in receipt of NSWP Female 3606 15441 19047 69.67% 41.91% 18.93% Male 4999 3293 8292 30.33% 58.09% 60.29% TOTALS 8605 18734 27339 100.00% 100.00% 79.22% Example: Total Female in receipt of NSWP divided by the overall total of both men and Woman in receipt of NSWP Example: Total percentage of Female in receipt of NSWP divided by the total number of females employed \nThe figures are based on the WPBR in 2007 and number of things jump straight out to me: Over 80% of women don't qualify for a NSWP payment because they score zero (0) points on the City Council's scoring system  Far fewer women (19%) than men (60%) qualify for an NSWP payment even though women make up a big 70% majority of the City Council's workforce Over 50% of male workers receive an NSWP payment at the higher paying B, C and D bands Yet only 12% of women fall into the B,C and D bands. Now I don't know who made up Glasgow's cockamamy scoring system, but if you ask me they have made up the rules in a way that punishes and discriminates against the jobs done by women.  \nIn the next few days I'll publish more information about the NSWP 'rules' and scoring system which I imagine will be of great interest to lots of readers in Glasgow. \n\nAs far as I know the unions in Glasgow have not called any  strikes  or even threatened industrial action over the operation of the NSWP scheme. \n   ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frank mcaveety", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wpbr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow city council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "road workers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "workforce pay and benefits review", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nswp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cockamamy council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gmb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:30.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "326ea502b114c59f692a61c47e995140c7af2810", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeARtRMfI8aLS02zaKOlOf50SQnZSoHLZZRuLBfRLuYjD3yL3UZ0wjWb4s3ToNLqRk3hZm.mSaKHu_GaFhpmoCP30F2h1YSwRnFRrPh7Fd8m.tHu5D1QQkEoYVcKhW6J0QqId820_4A2LVNkgdxaGEMA--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/cardio-training-equipment/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Cardio Equipment - Buy Cardio Equipment at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Home Office Sport Equipment Bike Bicycle", "title_full": "Gym Fitness Home Office Sport Equipment Bike Exercise Bicycle | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-03-31T12:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 33, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1d0ae0bd123b552433eabe267b1b8ad0f5dd8d76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeARtRMfI8aLS02zaKOlOf50SQnZSoHLZZRuLBfRLuYjD3yL3UZ0wjWb4s3ToNLqRk3hZm.mSaKHu_GaFhpmoCP30F2h1YSwRnFRrPh7Fd8m.tHu5D1QQkEoYVcKhW6J0QqId820_4A2ITtetSC4kBAhEMZREZjE3M", "ord_in_thread": 36, "author": "Chung S.", "published": "2017-11-21T06:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "Four Stars", "text": "Fast delivery.

EU tells Britain it must come up with a solution to the Irish border in 48 hours. May to hold talks with Irish government and DUP in an attempt to achieve \u201csufficient progress.\u201d \nLONDON \u2013 Michel Barnier has informed EU member states that Britain has just 48 hours to agree on a potential deal on the first phase of Brexit talks for talks to move onto trade and transition before 2018. \nThe EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator has told European ambassadors that the UK government is trying to come up with a proposal on the Irish border that will satisfy both the DUP and the Irish government, the Guardian reports . \nA last-minute meeting between representatives of the EU27 has been scheduled for Friday in case Theresa May is able to get both the DUP and Irish government on side with her plans. \nBoth parties have said that the prime minister must make key changes to what she is proposing on the Irish border before they can give their approval to a deal on the first phase of negotiations. \nIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said yesterday that he expects May to offer him a new deal on the Irish border today. \n\u201cHaving consulted with people in London, [May] wants to come back to us with text tonight and tomorrow. And I expect to move forward as well \u2013 I want us to move forward if it\u2019s possible next week,\u201d he said. \nIf Britain is unable to produce a potential agreement by Friday, then the EU will rule that \u201cinsufficient progress\u201d has been made on the issues of citizens\u2019 rights, Britain\u2019s financial settlement, and the Irish border. \nThis would mean talks on future trade arrangements and any transition deal could not begin until 2018, something the UK government is determined to avoid given the increased uncertainty it would mean for British business. \nA CBI survey conducted in last month found that 60% of firms based in Britain will trigger Brexit contingency plans in March if a transition deal isn\u2019t agreed. These plans would include moving staff abroad and slowing recruitment. \nThe EU has hinted that it might be prepared to hold an emergency summit in January or February of next year in order to speed up negotiations. However, this is not a chance the British side will want to take. \nThe Irish border issue turned from a headache into a crisis for May this past week after DUP leader Arlene Foster blocked the UK government\u2019s proposal for \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d between Northern Ireland and the EU after Brexit. \nIn practice, this would have major implications for Northern Ireland, as it would require it to stay as close as possible to EU rules in order to maintain seamless, free movement of goods and people across the border. \nThe DUP is adamant that it will not accept any deal that ties Northern Ireland to EU regulations and subsequently creates new trade barriers between Belfast and the rest of the UK. \nThe Republic insists that keeping the UK in the single market and customs union is the best way to avoid the return of a hard border. However, the UK government has pledged to remove Britain from both organisations.

If the team you picked wins the game, you are guaranteed a profit.

Lawrence Kohlberg argues that gender identity does not form until age three.[9] It is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age three.[7][8][9][10] At this point, children can make firm statements about their gender[9][11] and tend to choose activities and toys which are considered appropriate for their gender[9] (such as dolls and painting for girls, and tools and rough-housing for boys),[12] although they do not yet fully understand the implications of gender.[11] After age three, core gender identity is extremely difficult to change,[7][13] and attempts to reassign it can result in gender dysphoria.[9][14] Gender identity refinement extends into the fourth[13] to sixth years of age,[9][15] and continues into young adulthood.[13] Martin and Ruble conceptualize this process of development as three stages: (1) as toddlers and preschoolers, children learn about defined characteristics, which are socialized aspects of gender; (2) around the ages of 5\u20137 years, identity is consolidated and becomes rigid; (3) after this \u201cpeak of rigidity,\u201d fluidity returns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat.[16] Barbara Newmann breaks it down into four parts: (1) understanding the concept of gender, (2) learning gender role standards and stereotypes, (3) identifying with parents, and (4) forming gender preference.[11] Factors influencing formation Nature vs. nurture Main article: Nature versus nurture Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. In particular, the extent to which it is determined by socialization (environmental factors) versus innate (biological) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology, known as \u201cnature versus nurture\u201d. Both factors are thought to play a role. Biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels.[17] While genetic makeup also influences gender identity,[18] it does not inflexibly determine it.[19] Social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family, authority figures, mass media, and other influential people in a child\u2019s life.[20] When children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles, they are more likely to behave in the same way, matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns.[21] Language also plays a role: children, while learning a language, learn to separate masculine and feminine characteristics and unconsciously adjust their own behavior to these predetermined roles.[22] The social learning theory posits that children furthermore develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way,[23] thus being shaped by the people surrounding them through trying to imitate and follow them.[24] A well-known example in the nature versus nurture debate is the case of David Reimer, otherwise known as \u201cJohn/Joan\u201d. As a baby, Reimer went through a faulty circumcision, losing his male genitalia. Psychologist John Money convinced Reimer\u2019s parents to raise him as a girl. Reimer grew up as a girl, dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys, but did not feel like a girl. After he tried to commit suicide at age 13, he was told that he had been born with male genitalia, which he underwent surgery to reconstruct.[25] This went against Money\u2019s hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation.[26] Biological factors Several prenatal, biological factors, including genes and hormones, may affect gender identity.[17][27] The biochemical theory of gender identity suggests that people acquire gender identities through such factors rather than socialization. Hormonal influences are also complex; sex-determining hormones are produced at an early stage of foetal development,[28] and if prenatal hormone levels are altered, phenotype progression may be altered as well, and the natural predisposition of the brain toward one sex may not match the genetic make-up of the fetus or its external sexual organs.[citation needed][29] Hormones may affect differences between males\u2019 and females\u2019 verbal and spatial abilities, memory, and aggression; prenatal hormone exposure affects how the hypothalamus regulates hormone secretion later in life, with \u201cwomen\u2019s sex hormones usually follow[ing] a monthly cycle [while] men\u2019s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern.\u201d[30] Intersex people Main article: Intersex A survey of the research literature from 1955\u20132000 suggests that more than one in every hundred individuals may have some intersex characteristic.[31] An intersex human or other animal is one possessing any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, or genitals that, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, \u201cdo not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies\u201d.[32] An intersex variation may complicate initial sex assignment[33] and that assignment may not be consistent with the child\u2019s future gender identity.[34] Reinforcing sex assignments through surgical and hormonal means may violate the individual\u2019s rights.[35][36] A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria.[37] Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third \u2018X\u2019 sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an \u201cX\u201d or \u201cother\u201d option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. At birth, 52% of persons in the study were assigned female, and 41% were assigned male.[38][39] A study by Reiner & Gearhart provides some insight into what can happen when genetically male children with cloacal exstrophy are sexually assigned female and raised as girls,[40] according to an \u2018optimal gender policy\u2019 developed by John Money:[35] in a sample of 14 children, follow-up between the ages of 5 to 12 showed that 8 of them identified as boys, and all of the subjects had at least moderately male-typical attitudes and interests,[40] providing support for the argument that genetic variables affect gender identity and behavior independent of socialization. Biological causes of transgender and transsexuality See also: Causes of transsexualism Some studies have investigated whether or not there is a link between biological variables and transgender or transsexual identity.[41][42] Several studies have shown that sexually dimorphic brain structures in transsexuals are shifted away from what is associated with their birth sex and towards what is associated with their preferred sex.[43][44][45] In particular, the bed nucleus of a stria terminalis or BSTc (a constituent of the basal ganglia of the brain which is affected by prenatal androgens) of trans women is similar to cisgender women\u2019s and unlike men\u2019s.[46][47] Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.[48][49] Another study suggests that transsexuality may have a genetic component.[50] Research suggests that the same hormones that promote differentiation of sex organs in utero also elicit puberty and influence the development of gender identity. Different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the norm of their sex assigned at birth, and in a person acting and looking like their identified gender.[51] Social and environmental factors \nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(October 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1955, John Money proposed that gender identity was malleable and determined by whether a child was raised as male or female in early childhood.[52][53] Money\u2019s hypothesis has since been discredited,[53][54] but scholars have continued to study the effect of social factors on gender identity formation.[53] In the 1960s and 1970s, factors such as the absence of a father, a mother\u2019s wish for a daughter, or parental reinforcement patterns were suggested as influences; more recent theories suggesting that parental psychopathology might partly influence gender identity formation have received only minimal empirical evidence,[53] with a 2004 article noting that \u201csolid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking.\u201d[55] A 2008 study found that the parents of gender-dysphoric children showed no signs of psychopathological issues aside from mild depression in the mothers.[53][56] It has been suggested that the attitudes of the child\u2019s parents may affect the child\u2019s gender identity, although evidence is minimal.[57] Parental establishment of gender roles Parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles.[51] Recent literature suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities, as studies of parental coding of toys as masculine, feminine, or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine.[58] However, Emily Kane found that many parents still showed negative responses to items, activities, or attributes that were considered feminine, such as domestic skills, nurturance, and empathy.[58] Research has indicated that many parents attempt to define gender for their sons in a manner that distances the sons from femininity,[58] with Kane stating that \u201cthe parental boundary maintenance work evident for sons represents a crucial obstacle limiting boys options, separating boys from girls, devaluing activities marked as feminine for both boys and girls, and thus bolstering gender inequality and heteronormativity.\u201d[58]Research from Radical Lesbians untie the self definition of a woman and man regardless of their sexual orientation; Naples dives into the binary gender roles and how they should be enforced in queer couples to help their children have a heterosexual orientation. In a gay couple, cis-gendered persons from outside of the community label gay couples as having one be the \u201cwomen\u201d and the other the \u201cman\u201d. In reality that is not true, and queer couples should be open to how they raise their child and if they want to establish the normal mom and dad roles.Naples, Nancy A. \u201cFrom the SWS President: Queer Parenting in the New Millennium.\u201d Gender and Society, vol. 18, no. 6, 2004, pp. 679\u2013684. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4149389. Radicalesbians. \u201cWoman Identified Woman.\u201d 1970. Print. \nMany parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born, after determining the child\u2019s sex through technology such as ultrasound. The child thus arrives to a gender-specific name, games, and even ambitions.[27] Once the child\u2019s sex is determined, most children are raised in accordance with it to be a man or a woman, fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents. When considering the parents\u2019 social class, lower-class families typically hold traditional gender roles, where the father works and the mother, who may only work out of financial necessity, still takes care of the household. However, middle-class \u201cprofessional\u201d couples typically negotiate the division of labor and hold an egalitarian ideology. These different views on gender from a child\u2019s parents can shape the child\u2019s understanding of gender as well as the child\u2019s development of gender.[59] Within a study conducted by Hillary Halpern[59] it was hypothesized, and proven, that parent behaviors, rather than parent beliefs, regarding gender are better predictors for a child\u2019s attitude on gender. It was concluded that a mother\u2019s behavior was especially influential on a child\u2019s assumptions of the child\u2019s own gender. For example, mothers who practiced more traditional behaviors around their children resulted in the son displaying fewer stereotypes of male roles while the daughter displayed more stereotypes of female roles. No correlation was found between a father\u2019s behavior and his children\u2019s knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender. It was concluded, however, that fathers who held the belief of equality between the sexes had children, especially sons, who displayed fewer preconceptions of their opposite gender. Gender variance and non-conformance Main articles: Gender variance, Transgender, Transsexual, and Genderqueer See also: Cisgender Gender identity can lead to security issues among individuals that do not fit on a binary scale.[60] In some cases, a person\u2019s gender identity is inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics (genitals and secondary sex characteristics), resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way which is perceived by others as outside cultural gender norms. These gender expressions may be described as gender variant, transgender, or genderqueer[61] (there is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity),[62] and people who have such expressions may experience gender dysphoria (traditionally called Gender Identity Disorder or GID). Transgender individuals are greatly affected by language and gender pronouns before, during, and after their transition.[63] In recent decades it has become possible to reassign sex surgically. Some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity; others retain the genitalia they were born with (see transsexual for some of the possible reasons) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity. History and definitions Definitions The terms gender identity and core gender identity were first used with their current meaning \u2014 one\u2019s personal experience of one\u2019s own gender[1][64] \u2014 sometime in the 1960s.[65][66] To this day they are usually used in that sense,[4] though a few scholars additionally use the term to refer to the sexual orientation and sexual identity categories gay, lesbian and bisexual.[67] Early medical literature In late-19th-century medical literature, women who chose not to conform to their expected gender roles were called \u201cinverts\u201d, and they were portrayed as having an interest in knowledge and learning, and a \u201cdislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework\u201d. During the mid 1900s, doctors pushed for corrective therapy on such women and children, which meant that gender behaviors that weren\u2019t part of the norm would be punished and changed. The aim of this therapy was to push children back to their \u201ccorrect\u201d gender roles and thereby limit the number of children who became transgender.[68] Freud and Jung\u2019s views In 1905, Sigmund Freud presented his theory of psychosexual development in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the phallic stage, at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an Oedipus complex where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child\u2019s power to appease sexual impulses.[23] In 1913, Carl Jung proposed the Electra complex as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).[69] 1950s and 1960s During the 1950s and \u201960s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of homosexuality (which was viewed as a mental disorder at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the UCLA Medical Center for the study of intersex and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst Robert Stoller generalized many of the findings of the project in his book Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term gender identity to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in 1963. Behavioral psychologist John Money was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at Johns Hopkins Medical School\u2019s Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an interactionist theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book Man and Woman, Boy and Girl (1972) became widely used as a college textbook, although many of Money\u2019s ideas have since been challenged.[70][71] Butler\u2019s views In the late 1980s, Judith Butler began lecturing regularly on the topic of gender identity, and in 1990, she published Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, introducing the concept of gender performativity and arguing that both sex and gender are constructed.[72] Present views \nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Medical field As of 2014, there is some changing of views and new discrepancies about the best way to deal with gender nonconformity. Some members of the medical field, as well as an increasing number of parents, no longer believe in the idea of conversion therapy.[73] On the other hand, there are still a large number of clinicians who believe that there should be interventions for gender nonconforming children. They believe that stereotypical gender-specific toys and games will encourage children to behave in their traditional gender roles.[68] Transsexual self-identified people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both, because they feel they will be more comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.[74] In the United States, it was decided under the Affordable Care Act that health insurance exchanges would have the ability to collect demographic information on gender identity and sexual identity through optional questions, to help policymakers better recognize the needs of the LGBT community.[75] Gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder Gender dysphoria (previously called \u201cgender identity disorder\u201d or GID in the DSM) is the formal diagnosis of people who experience significant dysphoria (discontent) with the sex they were assigned at birth and/or the gender roles associated with that sex:[76][77] \u201cIn gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one\u2019s external genitalia and the brain coding of one\u2019s gender as masculine or feminine.\u201d[65] The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (302.85) has five criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of gender identity disorder can be made, and the disorder is further subdivided into specific diagnoses based on age, for example gender identity disorder in children (for children who experience gender dysphoria). The concept of gender identity appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in its third edition, DSM-III (1980), in the form of two psychiatric diagnoses of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the DSM-III-R, added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder.[78] In 2013, the DSM-5 renamed the diagnosis gender dysphoria and revised its definition.[79] The authors of a 2005 academic paper questioned the classification of gender identity problems as a mental disorder, speculating that certain DSM revisions may have been made on a tit-for-tat basis when certain groups were pushing for the removal of homosexuality as a disorder. This remains controversial,[78] although the vast majority of today\u2019s mental health professionals follow and agree with the current DSM classifications. International human rights law The Yogyakarta Principles, a document on the application of international human rights law, provide in the preamble a definition of gender identity as each person\u2019s deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person\u2019s sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Principle 3 states that \u201cEach person\u2019s self-defined [\u2026] gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity.\u201d[80] and Principle 18 states that \u201cNotwithstanding any classifications to the contrary, a person\u2019s sexual orientation and gender identity are not, in and of themselves, medical conditions and are not to be treated, cured or suppressed.\u201d[81] Relating to this principle, the \u201cJurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles\u201d observed that \u201cGender identity differing from that assigned at birth, or socially rejected gender expression, have been treated as a form of mental illness. The pathologization of difference has led to gender-transgressive children and adolescents being confined in psychiatric institutions, and subjected to aversion techniques \u2014 including electroshock therapy \u2014 as a \u2018cure\u2019.\u201d[82] The \u201cYogyakarta Principles in Action\u201d says \u201cit is important to note that while \u2018sexual orientation\u2019 has been declassified as a mental illness in many countries, \u2018gender identity\u2019 or \u2018gender identity disorder\u2019 often remains in consideration.\u201d[83] These Principles influenced the UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity In 2015, gender identity was part of a Supreme Court case in the United States called Obergefell v Hodges in which marriage was no longer restricted between man and woman.[84] Non-binary gender identities See also: Third gender and Genderqueer Fa\u2019afafine Main article: Fa\u2019afafine In some Polynesian societies, fa\u2019afafine are considered to be a \u201cthird gender\u201d alongside male and female. They are anatomically male, but dress and behave in a manner considered typically female. According to Tamasailau Sua\u2019ali\u2019i (see references), fa\u2019afafine in Samoa at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa\u2019afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against.[85] Fa\u2019afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks.[86] The Samoan Prime Minister is patron of the Samoa Fa\u2019afafine Association.[87] Translated literally, fa\u2019afafine means \u201cin the manner of a woman.\u201d[88] Hijras Main article: Hijra (South Asia) In some cultures of Asia, a hijra is usually considered to be neither a man nor a woman. Most are anatomically male or intersex, but some are anatomically female. The hijra form a third gender role, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes prostitutes, or long-term sexual partners with men. Hijras can be compared to transvestites or drag queens of contemporary western culture.[89] Khanith Main article: Khanith The khanith form an accepted third gender in Oman. The khanith are male homosexual prostitutes whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Khanith can mingle with women, and they often do at weddings or other formal events. Khaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their society, khaniths can marry women, proving their masculinity by consummating the marriage. Should a divorce or death take place, these men can revert to their status as khaniths at the next wedding.[90] Two-spirit identities Main article: Two-Spirit Many indigenous North American Nations had more than two gender roles. Those who belong to the additional gender categories, beyond cisgender man and woman, are now often collectively termed \u201ctwo-spirit\u201d or \u201ctwo-spirited.\u201d There are parts of the community that take \u201ctwo-spirit\u201d as a category over an identity itself, preferring to identify with culture or Nation-specific gender terms.[91] See also", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "judith butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert stoller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary halpern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reimer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john money", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbara newmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emily kane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sigmund freud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lawrence kohlberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david reimer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carl jung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tamasailau sua\u2019ali", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reiner & gearhart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gidc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obergefell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samoa fa\u2019afafine association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gender identity research project", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "statistical manual of mental disorders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hodges", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north american nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johns hopkins medical school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international psychoanalytic congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yogyakarta principles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dsm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naples", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stockholm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samoa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oman", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:30.184+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a292342f8c22137236e8dca196a69daa6260e7b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8RjMYmHraOQLOqC8We0m5xbPDsE8Zjx6vJZ9m5Pn81VCGghVeRdRyiM152Nfc7XwLWLE_WJcuuDgSVU_LlcGDQ", "site_full": "www.acousticguitarforum.com", "site": "acousticguitarforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.acousticguitarforum.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=17", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "AGF Classifieds -

Find a venue that falls within your budget and needs.\n<iframe src=\" https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d14031.649330480024!2d-81.489879 ! http://www.foodandwine.com/chefs/fero-restaurant-opening-akhtar-nawab !3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xeeb0eb55425a9848!2sChristinis+Ristorante+Italiano!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1512046365265\u2033 width=\u201d600\u2033 height=\u201d450\u2033 frameborder=\u201d0\u2033 style=\u201dborder:0\u2033 allowfullscreen>\nAvoid buying trendy wines. You may hear a lot of buzz about a new wine; however, this does not make it right for you. Just because a celebrity is seen drinking a wine, this does not make it noteworthy. The real truth is in researching the wine itself and knowing if it suits your palate.\nDo you need a wine all your guests will enjoy? Instead of choosing a rare wine people might not appreciate, choose a Beaujolais, a Chilean, a Sauvignon or a Cava from Spain. These wines are easy to find and offer enough diversity to remain interesting for connoisseurs without making novices feel like they are sophisticated enough to enjoy the wine.\nDo not write a certain wine off just because a wine tester does not like it. Just like with many other beverages, certain wines require an acquired taste. Even if he or she does not like it, you may find it to be to your liking. See if you can get a sample of it before buying a bottle.\nFind someone who can help you identify wines to try. This can be either a merchant who earns your trust through good recommendations, or a wine expert who seems to have a palate close to your own. https://sandiego.eater.com/2017/12/4/16733842/italian-restaurant-mia-trattoria-bankers-hill can keep you trying new wines without just picking bottles randomly.\nDon\u2019t base your opinion solely on that of an expert. Every person tastes wine differently, so let your taste buds be the judge whenever you can get your hands on a specific bottle. You may experience something very differently than the experts. You would have never known that without taking the leap.\nA decanter can be a useful product to have. If you have not been able to get one, or if you do not like them because of the time involved in using them, think about getting an aerator instead. They fulfill similar functions, and they are often easier to use.\nAvoid over chilling white wines. Many wine drinkers will buy a bottle of their favorite white and return home to pop it in the fridge. While chilling whites is important, too much cold will diminish flavors in the wine; sometimes the most important ones. Target a temperature around 60 degrees up to 68 degrees to achieve the prime flavor.\nIf you have a cellar or even just a rack where you can store wine, do not fill the space completely with the wines that you like right now. Your tastes are bound to change over time. You don\u2019t want to be stuck with many cases of a brand you no longer drink.\nVisit a wine tasting festival next time one is held in your area. It\u2019s a great way to enjoy the company of a few friends and can provide you with a mini-education on wines. Try different varieties and make sure you bring a notebook to mark down which types you really enjoyed!\nIf your recipe calls for cooking wine, think twice before purchasing this product, which is found next to the vinegar at your local grocers. Cooking wine contains little or no alcohol, and often contains extra salt and additives that can wreak havoc with a potentially tasty dish. Instead, opt for a wine that does not have \u201ccooking\u201d in its description!\nWine is a popular accompaniment for your holiday gatherings, and it is important that you choose the right variety to complement your entree. Generally, white wine goes well with chicken, turkey or seafood, and red wine is the best choice when the menu features beef or pork as the main entree.\n\nWhen buying wine, the year it was produced is not necessarily the most important factor. While the climate of a region can change the taste of a wine, most of the largest wine-producing regions have fairly consistent temperatures. This means that a bottle produced in California in 2005 and a bottle from 2007, for example, should taste pretty similar.\nIf you have a smaller space, you can create a wine cellar of sorts in an empty closet. Place racks in the closet to store the bottles on, and try to keep the door closed often to prevent light from entering. A closet will generally have a fairly consistent temperature, making it ideal for storing wine.\nSearch for online information about different wines. Look for a wine discussion forum and read the comments until you feel confident enough to add your own ideas. If you are unfamiliar with international wines, this is a great place to find information. You can gain enough information to try a few wines you would not otherwise have considered.\nMany red wines are matured in oak barrels for far longer than white wine would be. This adds tannins from the wood into the wine, creating a complex flavor. This would be too much for the subtle flavor of a white wine, so they are rarely aged in this manner.\nAs we said before, you can use wine in a lot of different ways. Pairing the right wine with your food can produce unforgettable results in terms of flavor and enjoyment. Apply the aforementioned tips to help make your wine enjoyment fulfilling.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:31.042+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0309eb32f7d96368d1be9cd44be2c28b7f54dd07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_YC4otLYwaKbmVVTbZYZNuo-", "site_full": "forums.d2jsp.org", "site": "d2jsp.org", "site_section": "http://forums.d2jsp.org/forum.php?f=204", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Football &amp; Rugby - d2jsp Forum", "title": "Tnf Blind Odds - Saints @ Falcons", "title_full": "Tnf Blind Odds - Saints @ Falcons - d2jsp Topic", "published": "2017-12-06T21:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46006, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa13b1666be066f13f7c9ffff87575d1080d3aef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_YC4otLYwaKbHM2DZ6PLGko.1FHeC1PIaA--", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Slowtoanger", "published": "2017-12-07T06:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "in", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:31.047+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5be8eabc94c0dd0060c7d2a27d58803ddd2f6e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2HT48I_PlzDc", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "/swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics", "title_full": "/co/ - /swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 493, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "97877034661e87336b1a8369dbf3961154029074", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2O8Y28vcGd_1KIUfP8L8kGo-", "ord_in_thread": 376, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T09:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97330600\nBecause the game doesn't simulate every inane conversation you have across the adventure dumbass.

That was the day it all changed for Curtis McGrath. A combat engineer with the Australian army who had been deployed to Afghanistan a couple of months earlier, McGrath stepped on an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) while patrolling the Taliban-infested region. It detonated, taking both his legs with it. \n\u201cI don\u2019t remember the blast but I remember everything after,\u201d says the Australian para-canoeist, gold medallist at the 2016 Rio Paralympics who is here in the city as part of the Australian High Commission\u2019s Development 4All, a disability-awareness campaign. \u201cI got up and noticed both my legs were gone. That is when the pain hit me; excruciating pain all over my body,\u201d says McGrath, a shadow flitting across his cheerful, handsome face as he remembers the horrific incident and its aftermath. \nThe unofficial medic of the patrol, he had to walk his mates through the First Aid Treatment he needed. When they had finished and put him on a stretcher to wait for the rescue chopper, he told them, \u201cYou will see me in the Paralympics.\u201d \nIt was partly because memories of the London Olympics were still fresh in his mind, laughs McGrath. \u201cAdvertisements for the paralympics used to be flashed a lot back then. We would come back from patrol, watch the Olympics and see the ads on TV,\u201d he says. But more importantly, it was to keep the morale of his patrol up. \u201cThe incident wasn\u2019t just traumatic for me, it was traumatic for everyone who witnessed it. Telling them that I had a goal, and I would be okay would help them as well, I thought.\u201d \nBack on track \nAn inherent athleticism and outdoorsiness clings to McGrath, even in the hushed, air-conditioned lobby of the Taj Club House in Chennai, where we meet. He loops towards us, offering a firm handshake and smile, sun-kissed skin crinkling around his eyes as he does. His stride is long and steady, in his Ottobock prosthetics that are, \u201ctop of the line. They\u2019re nicknamed the ferrari of prosthetics,\u201d he grins. \nHe was standing upright in them, three months after the injury. \u201cI was up standing when my friends who were serving with me in Afghanistan got home,\u201d says McGrath, who agrees that it was a good achievement. \nBut that was not enough, of course. He had lost a lot of weight and strength and needed to work on that. He spent the next year in physio and rehab. \u201cA big part of that was just walking: getting used to my prosthetics and gaining confidence,\u201d he says, adding that he also added in strength training and core work as he needed to be able to stand and stabilise himself. He also swam a lot for general fitness and to restore his mental health. \nHe began trying different sports by the end of 2013, as many as he could, he says. \u201cI have always been an outdoors person and played a bunch of sports including rugby, cricket and netball before my accident,\u201d he says. He had dabbled in canoeing back at high school and remembers enjoying it very much. So he decided to take it up professionally. \n\u201cYou commit so much time to a sport to get to the Paralympics so you really want to do something you enjoy,\u201d he says. \nWinning the gold \nIt is the sport that keeps him going through his darkest days. He remembers the lowest point of his life, immediately after the accident. \u201cThe physio came and said I was to start therapy so they transferred me to a wheelchair. That is when I realised that I was actually a disabled person, I hadn't till that point.\u201d But he takes it in his stride, adding with a shrug of his densely-muscled shoulder, \u201cEveryone has bad days and my bad days are worse than some. I just try to keep busy and focussed.\u201d He works very hard at maintaining his core and upper body, training six days a week, twice a day with Sunday off. One session a day is definitely in water, sometimes two, and he also lifts weights at the gym. \u201cIt is a busy schedule. Each session lasts 2-3 hours,\u201d says McGrath who works with multiple coaches on his fitness and game. \nHis hard work has certainly paid off. By the end of 2013, he was participating in paracanoe championships, winning medals at a number of tournaments including the 2014 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championship in Moscow, the 2015 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championship in Milan and the multi-sport Invictus Games, started by Prince Harry for wounded or injured army personnel. \nIn 2016, he won the Men\u2019s KL2 200 m at the 2016 Rio Paralympics, the first Australian to win a gold at paracanoe. K, stands for kayak which has a double-blade paddle unlike the other paracanoe boat, the va\u2019as that has a support float and a single-blade paddle. L indicates the level. \u201cI fall in the middle category, the trunks and arms one that indicates that while my trunks and arms are good, my legs are not,\u201d he explains. (L1 paddlers have no trunk function, only shoulder while L3 contestants can use both trunk, arms and legs) \nTokyo 2020 now beckons and he is now working towards that, he says. \u201cEveryone is now after you and your medal and I have to work twice as hard to defend it. But the opportunity to stand on the podium again will be great; I have to find the motivation to do it again.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "curtis mcgrath", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "harry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcgrath", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "taj club house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paralympics", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chennai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio paralympics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:31.158+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2788a300be4b3aaa1a9a97001d1891031d788157", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmaKYIfEmUjoFzXGdoJ57_pUwVw5UbbwLd0GoNjXzM0rz6ZkToZblKP2wwGyplxhEY2aGKWB.AYjiq7bH2D9IeVQRhB_jCOet35XQfZO6heGA--", "site_full": "rebeccahpedersen.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://rebeccahpedersen.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Rebecca Pedersen", "title": "Greens Want NDP To Kill Promised $400 Renters\u2019 Grant (in News)", "title_full": "Greens Want NDP To Kill Promised $400 Renters\u2019 Grant (in News)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2788a300be4b3aaa1a9a97001d1891031d788157", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmaKYIfEmUjoFzXGdoJ57_pUwVw5UbbwLd0GoNjXzM0rz6ZkToZblKP2wwGyplxhEY2aGKWB.AYjiq7bH2D9IeVQRhB_jCOet35XQfZO6heGA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rebecca Pedersen (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "Greens Want NDP To Kill Promised $400 Renters\u2019 Grant (in News)", "text": "Campaign commitment bad policy, says Andrew Weaver.\n\n\nRelated Stories Coalition Pushing New Housing Solutions for BC (in News) Original Post Seen: http://ift.tt/2B8Zivh \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "grant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew weaver", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:32.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5be8eabc94c0dd0060c7d2a27d58803ddd2f6e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2HT48I_PlzDc", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "/swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics", "title_full": "/co/ - /swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 493, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a47e3537061297c351fde92406ed8b802f6232b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2O8Y28vcGd_1VlQSbRiSwIs-", "ord_in_thread": 380, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T09:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97330670\n>Because the game doesn't simulate every inane conversation you have across the adventure dumbass.\nOf course not.

December 7, 2017 Although opium cultivation in Myanmar has fallen, it is not entirely a positive development, for it points to an increase in demand for methamphetamine. \nBANGKOK: A \u201cdramatic\u201d drop in opium cultivation in Myanmar underscored a regional boom in demand for illegal synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine, which many Asian countries are struggling to combat, a senior UN official said on Wednesday. \nThe area under opium poppy cultivation dropped by a quarter between 2015 and 2017, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in a report released on Wednesday. \n\u201cThe drop in opium production is welcome, but it is not a victory,\u201d Jeremy Douglas, the UNODC\u2019s chief in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, told Reuters. \n\u201cIt appears to confirm that the shift in the regional drug market to synthetic drugs is well underway, and that the opium economy is being disrupted.\u201d \nChina and most Southeast Asian countries have reported growing demand for methamphetamine, a highly addictive synthetic drug also known as speed, shabu, and yaba, and the Philippines is waging a bloody \u201cwar on drugs\u201d to tackle it. \nMeanwhile, regional demand for heroin, which is derived from opium poppies, has remained stable or decreased, with many younger drug users preferring methamphetamine, according to UNODC data. \nThe UNODC estimated that Myanmar\u2019s Shan and Kachin states cultivated 41,000 hectares of opium poppy in 2017, a 25% drop from the 54,500 hectares reported in its last survey in 2015. \nFor the previous decade, opium cultivation had increased annually before stabilizing at high levels, according to UNODC data. \nThe area under cultivation in Afghanistan, the world\u2019s biggest opium producer, hit a record high of 328,000 hectares in 2017, the UNODC said last month. \nMyanmar\u2019s interior minister, Kyaw Swe, said in a statement released by the UNODC that his government was \u201cpleased to see progress\u201d and would support programs that provide alternative livelihoods to opium-growing communities. \nMyanmar is the source of most of Southeast Asia\u2019s methamphetamine, which is mostly produced in lawless border regions outside the government\u2019s control. \nDouglas also said it was \u201creasonable to assume\u201d that Asian organized crime groups were making or planning to make fentanyl, a synthetic opioid many times more potent and profitable than heroin. \nIn October, President Donald Trump said \u201cthe flood of cheap and deadly fentanyl\u201d in the United States was fuelling a public health emergency of opioid addiction and death. \n\u201cPeople like to stretch profits in any business, and fentanyl is the ultimate profit-stretcher,\u201d said Douglas. \u201cYou can cut out the poppy farmers completely.\u201d \nGrowing opium poppies employs or provides incomes for hundreds of thousands of people in Myanmar, most of them in remote, mountainous areas of Shan and Kachin states. \nCultivation and production of opium poppies continued to flourish at 2015 levels in conflict-plagued areas of those states, which remained a \u201csafe haven for those who run the drug trade\u201d, said Douglas. \nGovernment troops have been fighting insurgencies by various ethnic minority guerrilla groups for decades, and both sides have been implicated in the drug trade. \nAccording to the UNODC survey, opium cultivation plummeted in 2017 despite the government scaling back its poppy-eradication efforts. \nMyanmar destroyed 3,533 hectares of opium poppies in 2017, down from 13,450 hectares in 2015. \nIts giant neighbour China remained the largest market for the heroin made from Myanmar\u2019s opium. \nBut China was also reporting what Douglas called \u201ca significant shift in market dynamics\u201d, with demand for heroin dropping alongside rising demand for methamphetamine. \n\u201cThe regional drug market is changing, and governments need to change how they deal with it,\u201d he said. \nHe urged countries to increase their focus on synthetic drugs and the precursor chemicals used to make them, and to do more to tackle demand through prevention campaigns and voluntary, community-based rehabilitation programs.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeremy

This is according to Suaram\u2019s Human Rights Report 2017 overview, that was launched today at the Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall. The report states that the restriction on freedom of expression in Malaysia \"took a turn\" this year, with prosecutions under CMA on the rise. \u201cWith the application the Sedition Act relegated to the back seat by the authorities, arrests, detentions and prosecutions made in relation to freedom of expression have largely fallen under the CMA and other laws.\u201d  It also quoted the Deputy Communications and Multimedia Minister Jailani Johari, who told the Dewan Rakyat last month that there were 269 cases investigated under the CMA from January to September this year. \n\nJohari also revealed that 146, or more than half of the 269 cases, were investigated under Section 233. Section 233 of the CMA criminalises, among others, the use of network facilities or services by a person to transmit communication that is deemed offensive, and that could cause annoyance to another person. Suaram program coordinator Dobby Chew said this trend has happened before, where they saw a rise in the Sedition Act being used right after the Internal Security Act (ISA) abolished. \n\nSimilarly, now that civil societies have strongly campaigned against the Sedition Act, the focus has instead shifted to using CMA instead, he explained. As the scope of the CMA is very wide and covers many things, Chew said it \u201cmakes prosecution very easy\u201d. There also appears to be very few legal challenges against CMA cases, as most people charged under CMA tend to plead guilty at the first instance without a trial, whereas there were many legal challenges against the Sedition Act, he said. Suaram executive director Sevan Doraisamy ( photo ) also said that using new laws to repress freedom of expression is a tactic used by the ruling party to keep civil societies from strategising. \n\n\u201cFor example, we (civil societies) came together and focused on the Sedition Act, and then they started to use CMA. \u201cClearly, it is to keep you busy fighting one law, then they use a new law, then you have to come up with a new coalition to fight that law. \u201cSo the government is being very smart, (by) not letting you strategise,\u201d he said. Suaram also said that the government has misrepresented some Human Rights Commision (Suhakam) statements on human rights issues, such as the conditions of detention centres. Chew quoted Parliament Hansard on April 4 this year, where Deputy Home Minister Nur Jazlan Mohamed had said that Suhakam had visited detention centres and that based on media reports on the same day, the commission appeared satisfied with the treatment by the police and conditions of these places. A quick check of media reports on April 4 quoted Suhakam as saying that there appeared to be \u201clittle interest in the human rights of detainees\u201d as there were issues such as overcrowding in detention centres. Other issues highlighted by the Suaram report include their prevalent concerns with detention without trial under laws such as Security Offences (Special Measures) Act (Sosma) and Prevention of Crime Act (Poca), as well as custodial deaths and the new incidences of alleged enforced disappearance. While they acknowledge that freedom of assembly has seen marked improvement over the years, Suaram said it is marred by crackdowns on several protests such as the  arrest of Kampung Gatco residents  who were trying to prevent lorries from leaving their estate with harvested rubber logs. On the other hand, freedom of religion is on the decline this year with \u201cgrowing intolerance and harassment of religious minorities\u201d, Suaram said. They also express concern over free and fair elections with the Election Commission attempting to implement a redelineation as well as judicial independence in the country, after the appointment of Md Raus Sharif as Chief Justice despite being over the retirement age as stated in the constitution. There were also attacks and harassment against LGBT activists by individuals or groups, they noted. Meanwhile, there were progress made by the indigenous people this year in bringing their plight to the forefront, Suaram said, though the situation of refugees and asylum seekers remain dire.
