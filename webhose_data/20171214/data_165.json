Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA \u201cbreakthrough\u201d has been made on the issue of parking in Cambuslang after talks between Cambuslang Community Council and South Lanarkshire Council. \nCouncil officials have now agreed to review the parking arrangements and to look at experimenting with longer parking times for shoppers. \nThe problems are centred around the lack of parking throughout the town centre and particularly on Cambuslang Main Street, caused by the increase in housing in the area. \nJohn Bachtler, treasurer of Cambuslang Community Council, attended the meeting along with Angeline Coyle, who owns the Tea Bay on Cambuslang Main Street, and community council vice-chairwoman Michelle Farmer. \nHe believes the meeting offered signs of real progress. \nJohn said: \u201cWe agreed that South Lanarkshire Council will identify options for some experimental measures that could be introduced quickly to provide longer parking times for shoppers. They will also review parking provision more broadly across the town centre, particularly whether it is possible to increase overall capacity, provide space for a park-and-ride, and relieve pressure on car parks that should be available for shoppers.\u201d \n\u201cWe are under no illusions that there are easy answers to acquiring land for new car parks, but we were pleased that there is a willingness to assess all options.\u201d \nThere has been growing anger in recent years over car parks, such as Allison Drive and Cherry Tree Court, being filled up by commuters heading to work in the morning, with other drivers then parking on streets, angering residents. \nAngeline Coyle was optimistic the possible moves could boost local businesses. \nShe said: \u201cMany shops on the Main Street are in trouble, with declining footfall and trade. \n\u201cParking is a big, big issue for us. We are losing customers because they have nowhere to park. The local car parks are full, and the limit of 30 minutes on Cambuslang Main Street is far too short for many businesses like cafes, restaurants, hairdressers, beauty salons, estate agents, opticians and others. \n\u201cI am really happy that some progress is being made at last.\u201d \nMichelle Farmer, vice-chairwoman of Cambuslang Community Council, praised local politicians for their support . \nShe said: \u201cWe are delighted with the support we have received from our elected members. \n\u201cWe really appreciate their contribution, working across party lines and showing that the community is united.\u201d \nGordon Mackay, head of roads and transportation at South Lanarkshire Council, said: \u201cWe have met with Cambuslang Community Council to discuss the issues facing the Main Street, and specifically car parking. \n\u201cWe are keen to ensure parking arrangements meet the needs of the community and businesses and will explore how the community council\u2019s aspirations for some changes may best be accommodated. \n\u201cThe meeting was positive, constructive and set out common areas where the council and the community council can work together to seek to address the issues. In this regard a follow-up meeting is being arranged early in 2018 to progress matters.\u201d Like us on Facebook ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "angeline coyle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelle farmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allison drive", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john bachtler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gordon mackay", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cambuslang council", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cherry tree court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambuslang community council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south lanarkshire council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cambuslang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambuslang main street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tea bay", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:35.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0426e0112780dcac14f8e735493a36afe73e4a90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSESAD3QjmWgxoSwF.CIRQPG.DUGgZiW1ZhqPNkXBS7MmhUUuDuEabgR9.XqWxX7A4VT1JSm.Lzgjjkqzf9wYEvdeX0KWwSzZve6y78lyrTzg--", "site_full": "forums.civfanatics.com", "site": "civfanatics.com", "site_section": "https://forums.civfanatics.com/forums/community-patch-project.497/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Community Patch Project | CivFanatics Forums", "title": "New Version - December 1st (12/1) | Page 8", "title_full": "New Version - December 1st (12/1) | Page 8 | CivFanatics Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T20:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.civfanatics.com/data/avatars/m/191/191587.jpg?1475248388", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 25863, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9b9f4c79ea847f40bf4ae1485661c6f909d00e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSESAD3QjmWgxoSwF.CIRQPG.DUGgZiW1ZhqPNkXBS7MmhUUuDuEabgR9.XqWxX7A4VT1JSm.Lzgjjkqzf9wYEvdeX0KWwSzZsTwGJ.x1LcDOJGctImlpqi", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Infixo", "published": "2017-12-06T10:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Gazebo said: \u2191 If anyone wants a graph to tinker with: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vva4aq0pb1\nG Click to expand...

They, however, bent over backward to screw with people who did it during the level up phase of the game after people used it to burn through fast in D1.\nIt also works out, anyways, because you could still move the gear over to say Titan #2 and Titan #3 to re-do quests like the MIDAS and get them at much higher light levels to rapidly level up, so it was kind of a wash.\nAnd I triple classed, thanks . Quote: : \u00bb yeah you get dimishing / no returns on multiple characters level grinding I know, my post wasn't about that. We figured out they screwed with people who did this without noting it anywhere a week or two in . Once again, their communication was shit.\\\nI love Titans and I didn't want to spend the extra time I did in D1 keeping three classes up to date, so I wasn't too upset....but it's just yet another thing where it makes me think less of Bungie. It's like the XP nerf they didn't tell anyone....like, just tell us. There are reasons to limit XP if someone's grinding, say, a Lost Sector over and over.

A civ doing nothing gets the same yields as a civ doing well. I like the triggers, and just think they should be tuned. Triggers should be either playstyle neutral or balanced (some wide some tall) but the AI should need to do SOMETHING to get it's bonuses. Click to expand... I disagree. The AI is getting those bonuses for not having human-level foresight. It doesn't suddenly stop not having human-level foresight because it doesn't do well. The bonuses should be success neutral. The point of the bonuses is to compensate for the difference between having human-level foresight and not having it. They should be largest for where human-level foresight is most advantageous (war and diplomatic matters), and smallest where human-level foresight has no real advantage or only limited advantage (assigning Citizens to work tiles, arguably).\nSeveral people have raised the idea of just rewards every X turns. I've thought about this and I think it has problems, because it isn't playstyle neutral. If I have 10 cities, a bonus 600 Gold Yield is a lot less useful than if I have 4 cities. A fixed yield considering only era and difficulty that triggers every few turns is not playstyle neutral, it favours tall.\nI also think it sort of misses the point. Some stuff the AI is very good at and doesn't need bonuses for. The intent of the bonuses is to help them where they're less good. That's why there are bonuses on founding a City.\nConsider a Tall AI and a Tall Player. The Tall Player won't found many cities. The Tall AI won't found many cities either. So the Tall AI isn't losing much relative to thee Tall Player for poor city placement. They don't need a bonus (for this specific thing), or at least, it only needs to be relatively small.\nConsider a Wide AI and a Wide Player. The Wide Player will found a lot of cities. The Wide AI will also found a lot of cities. Players are much better at city placement than AI. So the Wide AI is losing a lot relative to the Wide Player, and they do need a fair amount of bonuses.\nThat's why it is good to have bonuses for specific actions, and not per turn. Founding a City is an example of one of those specific actions. We are targeting those bonuses at areas wher ethe AI's decision-making is not on par with the player's.\nI agree with @Gazebo 's concerns about snowballing, but this is only helping the AI match the player. If the AI can snowball with these bonuses, which are intended to restore them to player-level, then the player must be capable of snowballing without those bonuses but using that playstyle.

China locks down the internet to control politics, but here politicians are largely corporate-owned, so these big ISPs simply paid (er\u2026\u201ddonated\u201d) to put their guy in charge of the FCC. Soon, they\u2019ll be able to block any protest activity you may be considering, particularly if it\u2019ll hurt their profitability. And, of course, ISPs want to stay in the good graces of the politicians they\u2019ve bought, so if busting you on behalf of the State ingratiates them to the political powers-that-be, all the better\u2026 Not only that, in order to lock down the internet and wring every single penny that can be wrung out of your identity and data, your ISP will, in all probability, radically ramp up their \u201coversight\u201d (aka spying) of/on you so they can determine what you might want to buy, who and where you are, and what you might be able to afford. This intense profit motive, to extract the last penny from every one of us, in both fees and by selling our browsing/posting/email history, has all but wiped out the possibility of anonymity. As we can see with the J20 websites\u2014where our government is demanding all the online activity related to protests against Trump on January 20, 2017\u2014once your ISPs begin monitoring and collecting all of your information, there\u2019s nowhere left to hide.

Arizona's Family", "text": "(AP File Photo) (Source: CNN) \nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 His once-promising political career in shambles, Minnesota Sen. Al Franken appeared on the verge of resigning after fellow Democrats led by female senators abandoned him Wednesday over the mounting allegations of sexual misconduct that are roiling Capitol Hill. \nA majority of the Senate's Democrats called on the two-term lawmaker to get out after another woman emerged Wednesday saying he forcibly tried to kiss her in 2006. That brought to at least seven the number of women accusing him of sexual impropriety. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" scheduled an announcement for Thursday. No topic was specified, but Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nSchumer called Franken immediately after the latest allegation \u2014 and before the torrent of demands for Franken's resignation from Democrats \u2014 and told him he needed to resign, said a Democrat familiar with the events. Schumer met later in his apartment with Franken and Franken's wife, Franni, and repeated that message, and he did the same in additional talks with the senator throughout the day, said the Democrat, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. \nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez weighed in, too, asking Franken to resign and saying, \"Sexual misconduct, harassment and assault have no place in the Democratic Party, the United States Congress, the White House or anywhere.\" \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable, and his office later issued a statement saying, \"Senator Franken will be making an announcement tomorrow. More details to come.\" \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nCapitol Hill has long had a culture that has erred on the side of protecting lawmakers. Franken, who is generally liked and respected by his colleagues, was initially afforded deference as he battled the initial allegations against him. But as the number of accusations grew, women in the Senate, who faced pressure from the public and the media for protecting Franken, grew increasingly frustrated. \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. \nSen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who spoke to Franken, said, \"He's devastated. He's ashamed and he's sorry and everything that he's been saying and it's hard, but I told him, Al, at the end of the day, this was wrong and so I'm sorry, but this is what we're going to have to do.\" \nOne irony: While Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nPerez, the DNC chair, was quick to point out the difference, saying in a statement, \"Instead of standing up for women and confronting the problems of misconduct within their own ranks, the Republican Party has chosen to pursue power and push their radical far-right agenda at any cost.\" \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\"\u2014 women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations. \nFranken was first elected to the Senate in 2008, defeating Republican Norm Coleman in a bitter recount that took seven months. Franken won that race despite attacks over bawdy humor and writings dating back to his days on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" including a proposed skit joking about rape. \nFranken said then that he regretted such writings, and once in the Senate, he cultivated a serious and policy-oriented image. Throughout his eight years in office, he fashioned a reputation as a populist Democrat and fueled speculation that he might run for president in 2020. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Juliet Linderman in Washington and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

I think it's a lot of factors at play, like the reduced powersets and slower movement.\nIt seemed like many of the changes were in fact to appeal to the sweaty community. Those players hated one-hit kill weapons (particularly shotguns). Think of all the hate for Felwinters/Mapador. They hated that stickies were one hit kills, or that some specs let you spam abiltiies. Sweaty tournaments disallowed things that took away from predictability and gun skill - they disliked specs that promoted variance in play (no full armor titans since it means I can't predict the exact number of shots needed to kill you), they banned Exotic. They wanted less super spam. Sweats also were 3v3 or 4v4 as preferred modes. That community wanted to make the game less Destiny, and more Guns and Teams. Less 6v6 Mayhem, more 3v3 Skirmish with rules restrictions.\nSo Bungie followed in kind, thinking that community would become their base for their push to Esports.

As a union, we will not bow down.\u201d \nHe added that allowing in railways in the state would be a bane for the people without the existence of proper mechanism to protect the indigenous people. \n\u201cWe will strive hard, but we are not trouble makers. Back in 1989, the same leader (Lyngdoh) opposed the railway project and was arrested and taken to Silchar,\u201d Marngar said. \nAccording to him, the jail should be the site of inspiration to the KSU members and he puts it as \u201ccome what may, the KSU will keep rolling out its work.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lyngdoh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marngar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lambok marngar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ksu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bull lyngdoh", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "shillong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhankheti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyngdoh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silchar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:36.051+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c90194b6f8a7ba7f3a15a2b8af77604dabc0937f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMoWrBLDsu_BvsvPFJHjQdQVhdJNccM5yG.s6x8sTxLxGcFAOBOW6wZYO4vCw9SEARMii0o2x5Jd87NisrVl5TnPrufnLbSuyOL9VpDqxIl6aQ--", "site_full": "teapartythreats.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://www.teapartythreats.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "People Against Tea Party Threats and Violence", "title": "Lawrence: Donald Trump Testifies About Obstruction Of Justice On Twitter", "title_full": "Lawrence: Donald Trump Testifies About Obstruction Of Justice On Twitter", "published": "2017-12-07T08:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/M0TiHbxP0EvdNKBG9tBBYZ8pBYwGr6-kR_y0W2CaFVaXR3pdfAfbbQxnT-TKUREKo_VGJzcEPkC433kSCLdl4GRkhAg=w1200-h630-n-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c90194b6f8a7ba7f3a15a2b8af77604dabc0937f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMoWrBLDsu_BvsvPFJHjQdQVhdJNccM5yG.s6x8sTxLxGcFAOBOW6wZYO4vCw9SEARMii0o2x5Jd87NisrVl5TnPrufnLbSuyOL9VpDqxIl6aQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (Mike)", "published": "2017-12-07T08:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "Lawrence: Donald Trump Testifies About Obstruction Of Justice On Twitter", "text": "Lawrence: Donald Trump Testifies About Obstruction Of Justice On Twitter Reactions:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lawrence", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:37.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e91958c5da0d7c583b474721261891ea8f1172f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl3uRssPHEeLTfUG2y4kaaz2MXkivJHJx0GstR3KQRdEeI16f7tzOFbOeXReZac0dF7Ik6TmUzDKNedIbTsc9LNTaLcSBvAGrE8.5285MBPns", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[Destiny 2] Curse of Osiris out now!

It's an MMO-esque game. This is basically how they work. You keep up with the expansions and whatnot to keep playing the game. These game's get whittled away and changed and such all the time and with zero regard for people who don't upgraded to the newest version.\nI guess my main thing is I can totally understand getting annoyed at it, I just don't get why you would be annoyed at it now rather then always. This should not be a surprise. This is always the kind of game Destiny has always been, just like WoW or the like. This is how they work. This is what you signed up for, eyes open.\n\"I don't wanna have to pay $20 every 3 months to keep playing the game\" is perfectly valid imo. I get looking at the Destiny expansions, both 1 and 2, and considering them overpriced. I'd certainly agree in many ways.\nI just don't get what people thought Destiny 2 was gonna be other then that though.\nThis is a bad argument because MMOs don't remove content, they just stop supporting them. \"Removal\" of content only happens over time, as players upgrade and level out of it. Every MMO has a small community of people at the turn of an expansion who are still doing the old content, just because they're not in a place where they can afford to upgrade at the time. Sure, matchmaking might take longer because it's a smaller pool of players, but the content remains. There's a huge difference between \"no longer the focus\" and \"no longer available\".", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/690/n9VT4P77QHJ96.png", "http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001341988", "https://i.imgur.com/yrapT1L.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:37.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4367217f3b61e1e878319f9dd6d6d1eef6865a23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SvlN_iJdOj6wIdoFQj.Z.LV2TwRWak2aQIxfDoKKWr9_sY.HJlUkMYUlcsfckWQea8wFzHOgyEbVJy07bKXNKDdTALcVLmAnwWE0fI7qHCR5OzJJRVMA6hixH7SlVhoPL4Icuos7AcQJBqEgsr6.", "site_full": "artemisgoddessblog.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://artemisgoddessblog.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "TOSHIBA microcomputer warm kettle 1.0L RC-10MSD C Light Beige P/O \u2013 Artemis", "title": "TOSHIBA microcomputer warm kettle 1.0L RC-10MSD C Light Beige P/O", "title_full": "TOSHIBA microcomputer warm kettle 1.0L RC-10MSD C Light Beige P/O", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4367217f3b61e1e878319f9dd6d6d1eef6865a23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SvlN_iJdOj6wIdoFQj.Z.LV2TwRWak2aQIxfDoKKWr9_sY.HJlUkMYUlcsfckWQea8wFzHOgyEbVJy07bKXNKDdTALcVLmAnwWE0fI7qHCR5OzJJRVMA6hixH7SlVhoPL4Icuos7AcQJBqEgsr6.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "artemisgoddessblog", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "TOSHIBA microcomputer warm kettle 1.0L RC-10MSD C Light Beige P/O", "text": "TOSHIBA microcomputer warm kettle 1.0L RC-10MSD C Light Beige P/O \u2013 Buy \u2013 TOSHIBA microcomputer warm kettle 1.0L RC-10MSD C Light Beige P/O ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "toshiba", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:37.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c653efe93adfeb3e20ca60d3cdc3b161c530fbfd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS7qymNfQA8Gv12pKQMteM3liDZY.bmgURdq.8URpmWQMDnWs5iy1pXD_ie7zMAKaRFu9czpj2EZs-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Australia", "title": "Who Paid No Tax?", "title_full": "Who Paid No Tax? : australia", "published": "2017-12-07T08:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b871346ca76facac20f1d21e18339dc2bc1f96a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS7qymNfQA8Gv12pKQMteM3liDZY.bmgURdq.8URpmWQMDnWs5iy1pXD_ie7zMAKaRjpP4A7FMr7i0ni4eKPxsIXF2BIED9asw", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Rational_Debate", "published": "2017-12-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It's disgusting, isn't it?

Iris Recognition for ...   Use of Technology for Convenience to Provide New Direction to Iris Recognition in Control Access\nIris recognition is an automated technology for biometric recognition that employs mathematical-pattern recognition of one or both human irises. The technology has several merits, including superior resistance to false matches, high speed of matching, and excellent efficiency due to the stability of the iris. Owing to these merits, the technology is emerging as a prominent technology for biometric verification for access control in various sectors, including government, transportation, and healthcare. \nRequest A Sample Copy Of This Report @: www.radiantinsights.com/research/global-iris-recognition-in-access-control-market-size-status-and-forecast-2022/request-sample?utm_source=briefingwire&utm_campaign=Mukta_07Dec2017 \nTransportation to Emerge as Promising End-use Segment in Future: \nGovernment organizations are expected to be one of the key end users of iris recognition for access control. High acceptance of the technology in national and civil IDs, law enforcement, e-governance, immigration and border management, and e-passports is contributing to the growth of the segment. Moreover, increasing cases of cybercrimes, terrorist activities, and other illegal activities are promoting the implementation of iris recognition technology for control access in public places. \nOn the other hand, the transportation sector is emerging as a promising end user in the global arena. Besides security purposes, the technology is being used to enhance convenience of passengers. For instance, in May 2017, Iris ID deployed biometric identification technology at Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar. This would allow travelers to pass through self-service security e-gates in about 10 seconds. \nMarket Insights: \nGrowing popularity of e-passport programs can stoke the growth of the global iris recognition in access control market. According to a report added to Radiant Insights Inc., incorporation of iris recognition technology into multimodal biometrics can allow the market to gain significant impetus. Besides this, increasing implementation of cloud infrastructure with iris recognition technology is likely to drive the market.

This also needs effort for you invest when researching for the correct place that can offer the safety and comfort you need. Failing to perform it can also make the result poor.\n\nConsider other issues as part of the overall process that you will face when you get the correct option. Think of also staying in a very luxurious area but consider your budget and all. It depends greatly on your specifications or preferences so decide carefully because it will be up to you at the end of the day.\n\nThe accommodation needs to be suitable for the activities and in the act of balancing the resources like travel schedule and money to have a place to stay. Deciding for it can certainly help you save your resources and how to make that experience good in a way. Spend time in researching online.\n\nOne needs to choose a comfortable area without problems or worries about not getting enough rooms to stay. Do this several months before the official trip or travel. Doing this is also vital to avoid high competition among those people who have planned similar itineraries with you.\n\nTo avoid rushing, perform the booking weeks or months before the date that is intended for the travel. There may be festivals, holidays and seasons during this time so be sure to book it first. Competition is also expected so to avoid it from taking place, you need to plan ahead of time.\n\nCheck their website to look again for another accommodation and receive updates about the booking and the selection of rooms. Avoid running out of choices by taking things too long or not deciding for it right away. Major considerations have to be made all the time. Finalize all the vital factors when you perform it.\n\nWhen you fail to consider its overall amenities, expect more problems to happen in just a short span of the stay. There could also be other hotels so make sure to decide properly before booking and paying for it.

He had laid the foundation stone of this Institute in April 2015. Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister expressed confidence that the Centre would play a key role in the dissemination of Dr. Ambedkar's teachings and vision. Noting that the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre for Socio Economic Transformation is also part of this project, the Prime Minister said that this will be an important centre for research on social and economic issues. He said the centre would function as a think-tank for inclusive growth, and related socio-economic matters. The Prime Minister said that thought-leaders and visionaries have shaped the direction of our country, at different points in time. He said the country is indebted to Baba Saheb, for his contributions to nation-building. He said the Union Government wants more and more people, and especially the youth, to learn about his vision and ideas. That is why, he added, that important places related to Dr. Ambedkar's life have been developed as centres of pilgrimage. In this context, he mentioned the sites at Alipur in Delhi; Mhow in Madhya Pradesh; Indu Mill in Mumbai; Deeksha Bhumi in Nagpur; and the house in London. He said that this 'Panchteerth' is the today's generation's way of paying homage to Dr. Ambedkar. He said that the BHIM App for digital transactions, is the Union Government's homage to the economic vision of Dr. Ambedkar. Quoting from Dr. Ambedkar's address to the Constituent Assembly in December 1946, the Prime Minister said despite his struggles, Dr. Ambedkar had an inspirational vision for the nation to overcome its problems. He said that we have still not been able to fulfil the vision of Dr. Ambedkar. He said today's generation has the capability and the potential to eradicate social evils. The Prime Minister recalled Dr. Ambedkar's words, that we should make our political democracy, a social democracy as well. He said that over the last three to three and a half years, the Union Government has worked towards fulfilling this vision of social democracy. In this context, he mentioned initiatives taken by the Government such as Jan Dhan Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, Swachh Bharat Mission, insurance schemes, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, and the recently launched Saubhagya Yojana. He said the Union Government is making every effort to complete schemes and projects within their intended duration, and the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre represents one illustration of this. He spoke at length about other schemes including distribution of soil health cards, Mission Indradhanush and progress towards rural electrification targets, to show the speed and commitment of the Union Government in implementing public welfare initiatives. The Prime Minister also mentioned the Stand-Up India scheme for generating self employment. The Prime Minister asserted that his call of \"New India\", is the India which Dr. Ambedkar envisioned, where everyone has equal opportunity and rights, free from caste oppression, and progressing through the strength of technology. He exhorted everyone to work towards fulfilling the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar; and hoped that we would be able to accomplish it by 2022. \u0921\u0949\u0915\u094d\u091f\u0930

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) \nBy CARLA K. JOHNSONAP Medical Writer \nCHICAGO (AP) - Modern birth control pills that are lower in estrogen have fewer side effects than past oral contraceptives. But a large Danish study suggests that, like older pills, they still modestly raise the risk of breast cancer, especially with long-term use. \nResearchers found a similar breast cancer risk with the progestin-only intrauterine device, and they couldn't rule out a risk for other hormonal contraceptives like the patch and the implant. \nBut the overall increased risk was small, amounting to one extra case of breast cancer among 7,700 women using such contraceptives per year. Experts who reviewed the research say women should balance the news against known benefits of the pill - including lowering the risk of other cancers. \n\"Hormonal contraception should still be perceived as a safe and effective option for family planning,\" said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital, who was not involved in the research. \nWomen in their 40s may want to consider non-hormonal IUDs, getting their tubes tied or talking with their partners about vasectomy, Manson said. \nStudies of older birth control pills have shown \"a net cancer benefit\" because of lowered risk of cancer of the colon, uterus and ovaries despite a raised breast cancer risk, said Mia Gaudet, a breast cancer epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society. \nThere was optimism that newer, low-dose contraceptives would lower the breast cancer risk, but these results have dashed those hopes, said Gaudet, who wasn't involved in the research. \nAbout 140 million women use some type of hormonal contraception, including about 16 million in the United States. \nResearchers analyzed health records of 1.8 million women, ages 15 to 49, in Denmark where a national health care system allows linking up large databases of prescription histories, cancer diagnoses and other information. \nResults were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Novo Nordisk Foundation funded the research, but played no role in designing the study. The foundation has ties to the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, which primarily makes diabetes drugs and does not make contraceptives. \nCurrent and recent use of hormonal contraceptives was associated with a 20 percent increased risk of breast cancer. Risk increased with longer use, from a 9 percent increase in risk with less than a year of contraceptive use to a 38 percent increase after more than 10 years of use. \nDigging further, the researchers found no differences among types of birth control pills. Because of fewer users, the results for the patch, vaginal ring, implant and progestin shot were less clear, but the analysis didn't rule out an increased breast cancer risk for those methods. \n\"No type of hormone contraceptive is risk-free unfortunately,\" said lead author Lina Morch of Copenhagen University Hospital. \nResearchers accounted for education, childbirth and family history of breast cancer, but they weren't able to adjust for several other known cancer risk factors such as alcohol use and limited physical activity, or protective factors such as breast-feeding. \nWomen with a family history of breast cancer may want to ask their doctors about other contraceptives, said Dr. Roshni Rao, a breast surgeon at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. \n\"Oral contraceptives are like any other medication,\" Rao said. \"There are risks and there are benefits. If you have a reason to be taking them, it's perfectly reasonable to do so.\" \n___ \nFollow AP Medical Writer Carla K. Johnson on Twitter: @CarlaKJohnson Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

APD   According to a new research study made available by Radiant Insights, Inc.; the worldwide Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) market is said to register a strong growth rate during the forecast period (from 2017 to 2022). Automated Peritoneal Dialysis is a type of Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) in which a machine performs exchanges when the patient is asleep during night time. It uses the peritoneal membrane of the patient to draw extra water and waste fluids from blood.\nMany APD system manufacturers are focusing on the research and development activities to devise innovative systems. To put this in perspective Baxter International, Inc. is working on a new system for peritoneal dialysis solution generation that will produce sterile PD solutions at the comforts of home for patients. The new system features the company\u2019s AMIA APD system and is cited to produce sterile PD solutions with a small device of water filtration. \nRequest A Sample Copy Of This Report @: www.radiantinsights.com/research/global-automated-peritoneal-dialysis-apd-market-professional-survey-report-2017/request-sample?utm_source=briefingwire&utm_campaign=Mukta_07Dec2017 \nThis system is also expected to minimize the storage and weight handling requirements. The new system is designed to offer doctors with the flexibility to prescribe dextrose concentrations depending on individual requirements of each patient. As stated by the company officials, this US FDA approved system can minimize overall barriers and can enhances therapy experience for the patients. It can offer the patients with lifestyle benefits with the help of this easy to access to home dialysis therapy. \nRising investments by private organizations to support new products and rapid technological innovations may further impel growth of the worldwide APD market over the next few years. Increasing expenditure on healthcare by government bodies across the world are also said to contribute toward the development of the global market during the forecast period. In addition, growing patient inclination toward home-based therapies is also expected help augment the overall market growth by 2022. \nSome of the dominant companies in the global market are Terumo Medical Corp.
