I weighed myself when I got home from my weekend away and thought it would be nice to get down to 12 stone (168 lbs 76 kgs) just to look nice in some of my \"Party Frocks\".   I wonder am I falling into the same trap that makes people want to have the \"Perfect Christmas\"\n\nThere was an excellent article in The Independent the other day suggesting that it's time we put a stop to the \"Cult of Christmas\".   I rather like Christmas not least because it's a bit of joy in what can be a pretty miserable time of year for me.   But I agree that there is way too much pressure on people who can't afford it to spend too much money, pressure to consume, to conform to a model of perfection that most of us simply cannot attain and should not aspire to.\n\nI will enjoy some Christmas music, I will enjoy my concerts and a couple of meals out, I may even put up a few decorations, but I will not be striving for perfection.   Perfection can only be achieved through Christ, and we will not find it in this World, now that is something to look forward to.

Clooney demuestra que las apariencias enga\u00f1an Julianne Moore as Margaret in SUBURBICON, from Paramount Pictures and Black Bear Pictures. Javier L\u00f3pez Iglesias 07/12/2017 Compartir: ' Suburbicon ' recibe el nombre del asentado y cl\u00e1sico barrio residencial estadounidense de mediados del siglo pasado en el que la acci\u00f3n se desarrolla. V\u00e9ase: calles tranquilas, seguras, y viviendas unifamiliares con porche y jard\u00edn delantero en el que corta el c\u00e9sped gente de bien . \"\u00bfRealmente de bien?\", se pregunta una pel\u00edcula que insiste en aquello de que \"las apariencias pueden enga\u00f1ar . Y mucho\". \nVerano de 1959. La familia Lodge vive en Suburbicon, el lugar perfecto para criar una familia. Pero la aparente tranquilidad esconde una realidad perturbadora.

The board of health voted and posted the order without consulting the town, water department or selectmen, despite the state Department of Public Health\u2019s recommendations. See  http://bit.ly/fluoridetool . Also see   http://bit.ly/fluorideDPH . \nWhen the order posting was discovered in the back of the Vineyard Gazette, many scrambled to interpret and understand the law, as the 90-day petition clock to stop the order was ticking. \nFact \u2014 The water department requested to meet with the selectmen, and it was confirmed that we were placed on their agenda for the upcoming Monday meeting to discuss the law and the power of the board of health order. \nFact \u2014 Health agent Matt Poole interfered, and had us removed from the selectmen\u2019s agenda. \nI reached out to the selectmen, and was told that I had nothing to worry about, as they were assured by Matt Poole that the decision was to go to the voters. \nWe then reviewed the law together, and they agreed that they misunderstood (hesitating to say they were misinformed by Matt Poole). They were extremely concerned, and allowed us to meet with them, at which time the selectmen agreed that they wanted the voters to decide, not the board of health. Chairman Art Smadbeck requested at least three times that they rescind their order during a board of health meeting. Under pressure, Harold Zadeh made a motion to vote to rescind the order in case a petition to allow the voters to decide at the next election failed. \nDr. Orazem refused to \u201csecond\u201d that motion. As you know, Kathie Case abstained. \nA petition had begun to stop the \u201corder.\u201d Matt Poole attempted to interfere with the petition multiple times by requesting that the language of the petition be changed, which would have voided the petition signatures already obtained and cut further into the 90 days allowed for a successful petition. He continued to attempt to interfere even after town counsel informed him that he could not be involved with the petition initiative. \nThe question remains whether the order was initiated by the DPH legitimately, and if the board of health completed an investigation regarding fluoride as required by the law before voting to \u201corder\u201d as required and illustrated in the language of the law. \nFor every fluoride pro, there is a con. The board of health has failed to educate anyone before voting the order, or schedule any education forums at the library as promised, since opposition began. \nI first was on the fence, as I was uneducated. So I educated myself. The fact is that fluoride helps minimize cavities, and the best way to receive fluoride is by application. The worst way to receive fluoride is by ingesting. \nVineyard Smiles is a state-funded program that provides free dental care to children at the town schools and to adults. Fluoride application (not ingesting) is part of the free program, in addition to other dental services. \nThere was a lawsuit filed on April 18  against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to stop the addition of fluoride into all municipal water supplies nationwide. See  http://bit.ly/fluoridelawsuit . The details of the lawsuit illustrate the cons/risks to human health. \nI asked Dr. Orazem during a public meeting who their target was. He replied by informing that it was children who are not from the \u201cBeaver Cleaver\u201d-type home environment. The board of health has failed to prove that their \u201ctarget\u201d actually drinks town water. It is most likely that their \u201ctarget\u201d drink sugar drinks, not town water. \nIn my opinion, it makes no sense to spend over $650K to add fluoride (which is a poison) to our water supply when there is a possibility that adding fluoride will be banned in the near future; or to add fluoride to a water supply for consumption, which causes harm to humans, as illustrated in the lawsuit. Most of the the fluoride would end up in the ground, causing other problems. \nIt makes more sense to promote a program that provides fluoride by application, which would effectively reach all those in need who want it, and avoid those who feel at risk if exposed and do not want fluoride in their bodies or the ground.

It\u2019s time you stop blaming indigestion and heart burn for the same. You could have an angina attack. \nWhat is angina? \nAngina is the medical term used to describe chest pain originating from the circulatory system and the heart. It is not a disease or condition by itself. It is rather a crucial symptom that indicates an underlying heart disease. \nCauses and types of angina \n\u2018Angina is chest discomfort caused due decreased oxygen supply to a part of the heart muscle. It is caused due to partial or complete obstruction to arteries supplying the heart,\u2019 says a consultant cardiologist. \nDepending on the type of pain and the duration for which it lasts, angina is classified into 4 different types: \nStable angina:  It occurs when the heart muscle has to work harder in order to pump blood. Situations like emotional stress, physical exertion and cold temperature may cause angina by interrupting the blood flow to the heart. This type of angina lasts for a short while and is relieved with medicines and rest. Unstable angina: It is also called angina pectoris. It can occur without any exertion, while you\u2019re at rest. Building plaque and obstruction of main coronary arteries usually is the primary reason causing unstable angina. The pain may last for 10-15 minutes. Prinzmetal angina/Variant angina: It occurs due to spasms in the coronary arteries. Pain occurs at rest, particularly between midnight and early morning.     Microvascualar angina: It is mild pain that usually lasts for longer than 10 minutes and may continue for 30 minutes or more. It occurs due to interrupted blood flow through the smallest coronary arteries. Signs of angina \nDr.  explains a few feature of angina that differentiates it from regular chest pain due to other reasons not originating from the heart. \n\u2018Angina is usually felt as pressure, heaviness, tightening, squeezing or aching across the chest, particularly behind the breastbone. This pain often radiates to the neck, jaw, arms, back or even the teeth. Patients may also suffer from indigestion, heart burn, weakness, sweating, nausea and shortness of breath.\u2019 \n\u2018Any chest pain or discomfort which occurs at rest and continues for more than 10 minutes requires medical attention if it is associated with: \nProfuse sweating Giddiness Weakness Nausea Light headedness \u2018The threshold to consult a doctor should be low if the subject has risk factors for atherosclerosis (fat acculumation in arteries) like advanced age, smoking,diabetes, hypertension, family history of heart disease and obesity/sedentary life style,\u2019 he explains. \nDiagnosis of angina: \nAccording to the Dr., angina can be difficult to differentiate from chest pain arising from other systems of the body. Therefore he suggests that it is best for you to let the doctor decide the cause of chest pain because self diagnosis could be misleading and may result in complications. \n\u2018Chest pain can occur from almost any organ in chest other than heart like lungs, ribs, esophagus (food pipe), aorta (largest artery of body) and pericardium (layers of heart).  Any chest pain which typically precipitates on exertion and gets relieved on rest favours heart origin. A well localised pain, varying with phases of respiration or posture and any chest pain which is reproducible on palpation are unlikely to be coming from heart. \nDepending on your explanation of chest pain and physical examination your doctor may recommend you the following tests to confirm angina and its underlying cause. \nBlood tests: Certain blood markers like cholesterol and triglycerides can help identify the chances the artery blockage and plaque formation causing angina ECG: Electrocardiogram is used to check the electrical activity of your heart using an ECG device Echocardiography: It is a test that helps the doctor to visualise the heart real time to analyse how effectively it works Coronary angiography: In this test, a specific dye is injected in the blood stream to check the rate at which blood flows through the arteries. It is an important test to identify CHD. Stress test: A simple exercise test can determine the electrical activity and functioning of your heart while you\u2019re exercising. Treatment and prevention: \n\u2018An untreated angina can result into full blown heart attack with severe damage to heart muscle. It can also result into shock like state resulting into irreversible damage to heart and abnormal heart rhythms,\u2019 says the Dr. Therefore, early medical attention is important to get appropriate treatment at the right time. Here are some medicines that your doctor may prescribe you: \nMedicines for unstable angina: \nBlood thinning agents like heparin and nitroglycerin may be prescribed to improve blood blow though narrow arteries Aspirin and clopidrogel may be prescribed to prevent blood clotting and reduce the chances of heart attack Medicine to control blood pressure may be required if you are hypertensive Statins may be prescribed to lower cholesterol Medicines for stable angina: \nNitrates are given to prevent angina Nitroglycerin, aspirin and clopidrogel may be prescribed to prevent blood clotting and improve blood flow through the arteries Beta blockers may be given to lower heart rate and help it work smoothly Surgical procedures \nAngioplasty- It is the most common surgery performed to open up blocked arteries using a small device called stent. A stent is a small device that is placed in the blocked artery to open it up and improve blood flow. \nBypass surgery: In this procedure, a healthy blood vessel (called a graft) is used to form a bypass or another route to supply blood to the heart . \nSince, heart disease is the underlying cause of angina, preventative measures include controlling risk factors that could lead to heart disease. \nEating healthy food, avoid junk is the mainstay for controlling cholesterol levels and maintaining a good lipid profile Exercising regularly, at least 30 minutes every day, will help you lose weight, boost your good cholesterol levels and improve your heart function. Smoking is the main cause of atherosclerosis that can lead to angina.

Cyber criminals will use AI to attack and explore victims' networks, which is typically the most labour-intensive part of compromise after an incursion,\" Kaura said in a statement. \n\nIn 2017, we saw massive DDoS attacks using hundreds of thousands of compromised IoT devices in people's homes and workplaces to generate traffic. \n\n\"This is not expected to change with cyber-criminals looking to exploit the poor security settings and management of home IoT devices,\" Kaura added. \n\nThe inputs and sensors of these IoT devices will also be hijacked, with attackers feeding audio, visual or other faked inputs to make these devices do what they want rather than what users expect them to do. \n\nBeyond DDoS attacks and ransomware, home IoT devices will be compromised by cyber criminals to provide persistent access to a victim's network. \n\n\"Home users generally do not consider the cyber security implications of their home IoT devices, leaving default settings and not vigilantly updating them like they do with their computers,\" Kaura said. \n\nPersistent access means that no matter how many times a victim cleans their machine or protects their computer, the attacker will always have a backdoor into victims' network and the systems that they connect to. \n\nWhen it comes to Blockchain technology, instead of attacking Blockchain technology itself, cyber criminals will focus on compromising coin-exchanges and users' coin-wallets since these are the easiest targets, and provide high returns. \n\nSupply chain attacks have been a mainstay of the classical espionage and signals-intelligence operators, compromising upstream contractors/systems/companies and suppliers. \n\n\"They are proven to have a high-level of effectiveness, with nation-state actors using a mix of human intelligence to compromise the weakest link in the chain,\" Symantec said. \n0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kaura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tarun kaura", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "economic times hackers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "symantec", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "symantec ians", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "product management", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:13.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c00b0ba1adf696b38a95a448efe64c78dbd2127", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQu.wM6SL793dwpH4yL6CDnZ_7FAD8FaHloXBYqGOBKykn0KEufKwqElg9lCWHbTCmbXVLjZCKpJIHwsbV7RoUGLH8WLgl1Bx0_bL5Vfvgiig--", "site_full": "syracuse.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://syracuse.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist syracuse | for sale search", "title": "2002 Honda Trx (9200) Amazingly Low Mileage $9200", "title_full": "2002 Honda Trx (9200) Amazingly Low Mileage $9200", "published": "2017-12-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c00b0ba1adf696b38a95a448efe64c78dbd2127", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQu.wM6SL793dwpH4yL6CDnZ_7FAD8FaHloXBYqGOBKykn0KEufKwqElg9lCWHbTCmbXVLjZCKpJIHwsbV7RoUGLH8WLgl1Bx0_bL5Vfvgiig--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "2002 Honda Trx (9200) Amazingly Low Mileage $9200", "text": "favorite this post 2002 Honda Trx (9200) Amazingly Low Mileage - $9200 hide this posting unhide   Professionally designed, high quality Honda Trx atv.

The vehicle is confirmed to be called an XT4 and is due on sale in the second half of 2018, as a 2019 model. \nThe prototype is heavily disguised but the general shape is similar to Cadillac\u2019s XT5 , albeit on a smaller scale. The C-pillar treatment and design of the lower part of the rear fascia and exhaust tips are also identical to what we see on the XT5. \nThe vehicle was first hinted at by Cadillac boss Johan de Nysschen in 2015. The Cadillac boss, speaking at the 2017 Geneva motor show, said sales of the XT4 will also take place in Europe. With General Motors having finally offloaded its struggling European unit Opel , it appears the Old Continent is now fair game for the automaker\u2019s other brands, namely Cadillac. \nThe XT4\u2019s underpinnings are borrowed from the latest Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain , which means powertrains and transmissions will likely be as well. Look for a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 to be paired to a 9-speed automatic in standard spec. Drive will be to the front wheels, though all-wheel drive should be available. A plug-in hybrid option is also thought to be in the works. \n2019 Cadillac XT4 spy shots - Image via S. Baldauf/SB-Medien Enlarge Photo \nPricing should start slightly above $30k, which is right in line with the competition. This will also provide a nice buffer with the XT5 which starts at $40k. Further down the track Cadillac will finally add a 3-row crossover to its lineup . \nProduction of the XT4 is expected to take place at GM\u2019s Orion Assembly plant located just outside of Detroit. \nCompact crossovers are typically targeted to a younger, hipper audience, a segment Cadillac needs to tap. A compact, fuel-efficient crossover would also be attractive to buyers in other markets, including every automaker\u2019s favorite land of opportunity, China. As mentioned above, it will also help relaunch Cadillac in Europe. \nStay tuned for updates as development continues.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "audi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mercedes-benz gla", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cadillac", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bmw", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:14.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d421b9497ea018b28d42bc09caf0e4a34ad8b1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGS1KjfL.8AmfVTbBp.fAa01P5gn5EGCj75", "site_full": "www.pistonheads.com", "site": "pistonheads.com", "site_section": "http://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/forum.asp?h=0&f=191", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_cars", "vehicles", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Boats, Planes &amp; Trains - Page 1 - PistonHeads ", "title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth 121", "title_full": "HMS Queen Elizabeth - Page 121 - Boats, Planes & Trains - PistonHeads", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.67, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8486, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "291328441206ec843136bed48ef73f09a6352a86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGS1KjfL.8AmfVTbBp.fAa01MmFJgu7o25ZlrrCC.iOQ9j0AIHrjnRPFA--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "RizzoTheRat", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Given the greater UK plc work share in the B, I can't really see them getting far with that despite it being the better aircraft.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:14.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "879479847f5cf7d1901c9537b88158ae38ff29ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.3X9jFiiy6j06HvPhVqU6C425Eq5r7Whw8XO97OEOM_DUQK_oYTRg97hQpx5EWeSX9Ph0mDHm4CWG2EcyAzw2186fl68s58TM-", "site_full": "www.inkvotary.com", "site": "inkvotary.com", "site_section": "http://www.inkvotary.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Inkvotary", "title": "Waiting On Wednesday #54 \u2013 Irgendwas Von Dir by Gayle Forman", "title_full": "Waiting On Wednesday #54 \u2013 Irgendwas Von Dir by Gayle Forman", "published": "2017-12-06T16:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e50e43b143cc1be284492d7b953f570535816d25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.3X9jFiiy6j06HvPhVqU6C425Eq5r7Whw8XO97OEOM_DUQK_oYTRg97hQpx5EWeSX9Ph0mDHm4CWG2EcyAzw215ecQszVSSCtokzwlgXI1dg--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Sam Kozbial", "published": "2017-12-06T18:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I've never read a book by Gayle Forman before, but they always look pretty good.

Library patrons can now check out telescopes using their library cards. \nThe telescopes are provided through the generosity of the Miami Valley Astronomical Society (MVAS) of Dayton. Part of the mission of MVAS is to provide opportunities for the public to enjoy astronomy. \u201cOur goal is to stimulate an interest in astronomy, help foster scientific literacy, and enable people who have never looked through a telescope a chance to experience the fun and excitement of astronomy,\u201d said Jim Ventling, Secretary for MVAS. \n\u201cThe society selected the StarBlast 4.5 inch Astronomical Telescope for the libraries because it is easy to use and robust. The telescope is lightweight and of manageable size, but has a relatively large optical tube. This means that the Moon and deep sky objects will show far more detail than one could see with the common beginners telescope,\u201d Ventling explained. \nAlong with the new telescopes, patrons can look forward to increased programming involving the starry skies in the coming months. The Beavercreek Community Library plans to hold a moon gazing class in early March as well as a program in August to view the Perseid meteor shower. \nIn order to check out a telescope, patrons must visit one of the five locations with telescopes: Cedarville, Beavercreek, Jamestown, Fairborn, or Yellow Springs. Patrons will have to fill out a short agreement form and receive a brief training on proper care for the telescope. Loan periods are seven days and are not eligible for renewal. \nFor more information please visit the library\u2019s website at www.greenelibrary.info. The library system consists of seven locations: Beavercreek, Bellbrook, Cedarville, Fairborn, Jamestown, Yellow Springs, and Xenia. \nGreene County News \nStory courtesy of the Greene County Library. \nStory courtesy of the Greene County Library.

The scenery is generally better by train, especially when there is snow. However, winter travel after a day of sightseeing is usually in the dark, so the next question is whether you ike train or bus better, and whether you are using JR pass. Taking the train from Takayama to Osaka takes about 3.5 to 4 hours (look at the Hyperdia page for options and note that the earliest departure is not always the earliest arrival, or the least number of transfers). Taking the last bus from Takayama to Osaka (at 4:50 pm) will get you into Osaka at 10:10 pm https://www.nouhibus.co.jp/english/highwaybus/osaka.pdf) and would not be covered by JR Pass. If I were doing this travel, I would travel via JR train the whole way because there is no value to riding the bus after dark, you won't see much and the train allows you to get up and walk around. Leave Takayama at 5:46 and get into Osaka at 9:17 pm, much faster. with two transfers. A word of caution, New Year's travel is pretty hectic on both busses and trains. It would be worthwhile to have reserved seating on the trains and to get your reservations as early as is possible. .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nouhibus.co.jp/english/highwaybus/osaka.pdf)"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:15.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2bb1c3d3dbab81533b39d471d520ac6d7a88408f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPTVBR9fMp6dJZP3SMeZZhTivl16svtXssuFmZ_nPEvPwGFigH4WW.Az1r5AFa6dQ21nYAev.siN.LhE6QLKZAzFpRl4X.2OSh5Ruw5PhiDTlkYCxfmpY0M_1UX33EeWfB5QAtVmEvudq", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g294232-i525-o20-Japan.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Japan Forum, Travel Discussion for Japan - TripAdvisor", "title": "Osaka to Takayama - Bus or Train?

They also come in Anery and just about every other color and pattern that you could want.\nKing snakes are hit and miss. Some are nice and some live to bite you, depending on the individual. They also vary quite a bit in size.\nStimson's pythons are another tiny Australian python from the genus Antaresia but they retain their juvenile colors / patterns better than the others and have a nice iridescent sheen as well. Very nice disposition. They can be hard to find though.\nA house snake is a good bet too. I love those little guys.\nI also agree with the rosy boa suggestion.\nSome milk snakes tend to be flighty and Hondurans can get fairly large. My picks would be #1 Mexican milk snake. Great color, mild disposition. #2 Nelson's milk snake. A little more shy but not spastic and also great color. My Mexican milks are gorgeous, easy to handle and never miss a meal.\nBall pythons are great. Males mostly stay smaller than females. They can be tricky to keep at the right humidity depending on your climate and some are very picky eaters. I'd say they would make a better second snake unless you read up on them and decide you're OK handling that. They also tend to be fairly sedentary.

Are we in that age or simply infected with that spirit? Come right down to it, it\u2019s a serious problem either way. Is our lack of soul winning traceable to the lack of a burden for lost people? Has separation faded in proportion to increasing involvement in the ways of this present world? Has an appetite for serious Bible study diminished and been replaced with (sanctified?) entertainment or with seeker friendly, spiritual Pablum? How many who lay claim to salvation have a strong prayer life? How many missionaries give reports without giving a serious challenge to young people to be involved in world missions? Is church just a nice place to enjoy a sermon and some fellowship or is it a disciple training camp? Is technology a tool or simply a fascination? Do we trust so-called science more than the Bible\u2019s straightforward Truth? How much thought and action have we devoted to being a disciple? What really captures our minds, hearts and time? Think on Mark 12:30 where Jesus commands: \u201c And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment .\u201d Could we honestly pray what is found in W.

This strategy looks for firms with persistent earnings growth that trade at a discount relative to their earnings growth and dividend yield.\nSUMMIT MIDSTREAM PARTNERS LP ( SMLP ) is a small-cap value stock in the Natural Gas Utilities industry. The rating according to our strategy based on John Neff changed from 60% to 79% based on the firm's underlying fundamentals and the stock's valuation. A score of 80% or above typically indicates that the strategy has some interest in the stock and a score above 90% typically indicates strong interest.\nCompany Description: Summit Midstream Partners, LP focuses on developing, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets. The Company's segments include the Utica Shale, which includes its ownership interest in Ohio Gathering, as well as Summit Utica; the Williston Basin, which includes Bison Midstream, Polar and Divide and Tioga Midstream; the Marcellus Shale, which includes Mountaineer Midstream; the Barnett Shale, which includes DFW Midstream Services LLC (DFW Midstream), and the Piceance Basin /DJ Basins, which includes Grand River and Niobrara G&P. The Company's assets are located in the producing areas of unconventional resource basins, primarily shale formations, in the continental United States. It provides natural gas gathering, treating and processing services, as well as crude oil and produced water gathering services pursuant to long-term and fee-based agreements with its customers.\nThe following table summarizes whether the stock meets each of this strategy's tests. Not all criteria in the below table receive equal weighting or are independent, but the table provides a brief overview of the strong and weak points of the security in the context of the strategy's criteria.\nP/E RATIO: PASS EPS GROWTH: PASS FUTURE EPS GROWTH: FAIL SALES GROWTH: PASS TOTAL RETURN/PE: PASS FREE CASH FLOW: FAIL EPS PERSISTENCE: PASS For a full detailed analysis using NASDAQ's Guru Analysis tool, click here\nSince its inception, Validea's strategy based on John Neff has returned 142.91% vs. 136.46% for the S&P 500. For more details on this strategy, click here\nAbout John Neff : While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as \"relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative.\" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund.\nAbout Validea : Validea is an investment research service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

The hosts dominated for a 72-32 win in Greater Western Ohio Conference, American South Division girls high school basketball action. \nFairborn coughed up nine turnovers and trailed 15-4 after eight minutes of play. \nTen more Skyhawks turnovers and eight more minutes later, Trotwood was in control of the game with a 36-11 halftme lead. \nUnofficially, Fairborn turned the ball over 40 times for the game. \nShai McGruder led the Rams with 20 points, including her 1,000th career point that she scored on a steal with 2:31 left in the game. \nShemya Leigh finished with 14 points, Mercedes Woodward had 10, and Heaven Gooden added eight in the win. \nFairborn never did seem to get untracked, as Trotwood-Madison played in-your-face defense for all but the final couple minutes of the game. \nFairborn coach Billy Harchick was heard talking to his players in the visitor\u2019s locker room roughly 15 minutes after the game had ended, and so he wasn\u2019t available for comment. \nDespite being hounded by the Trotwood defense throughout, Evelyn Oktavec managed to finish with a game-high 17 points, including three 3-pointers. Khala Powell (eight points), Cassidy Mustard (one), Jasmine McMoore, Sadie Smith and Mikayla Baughman (two points each) accounted for the other Skyhawk scores. \nTrotwood-Madison is now 2-0 overall, 1-0 in the GWOC American South, and they\u2019ll travel to South foe West Carrollton for their next game, at 1 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 9. \nFairborn has yet to get a win this season, and is now 0-4. They too get back into GWOC American South action for their next game. The Skyhawks will host Stebbins at 11:30 a.m. Saturday at Baker Middle School in Fairborn. Fairborn\u2019s Evelyn Oktavec (10) is triple teamed by the Trotwood-Madison defense, Wednesday Dec. 6 at Trotwood-Madison High School. Despite the constant pressure, Oktavec finished with a game-high 17 points in the 72-32 loss.

Those members include the University of Dayton and University of Cincinnati. \n\u201cThis study shows that we are clearly a leader in driving the economy in this region,\u201d said Wright State President Cheryl B. Schrader. \nThe study measured the impact of Wright State in the Dayton Metropolitan Statistical Area, a region that includes Greene, Montgomery, Miami and Preble counties. It did not measure the impact of Wright State\u2019s Lake Campus, which operates in Mercer County. \nWright State\u2019s $1 billion-plus impact was created by its operations, student spending and capital expenditures. The university directly supported 9,508 jobs and indirectly supported another 4,602, which led to about $408.8 million in wages being paid in the region. \nIn fiscal 2011, Wright State\u2019s total economic impact was $815 million, according to a previous SOCHE study. The university accounted for 7,511 jobs and had a total impact on wages of $342 million over the period, which encompassed Wright State\u2019s 2010-11 academic year. \nIn fiscal 2016, Wright State directly employed 6,895 workers, which led to the generation of about $63.3 million in local, state and federal sales, earnings and property taxes. About 11 percent, or more than $7 million, went to local governments; and 40.5 percent, or $25.6 million, to the state. \nAlso in fiscal 2016, Wright State spent $397 million on operations at its Dayton Campus. \nOperations that retained and supported students from the four-county region who may have gone elsewhere for post-secondary education increased economic activity by $335 million, supported 5,310 jobs and resulted in $155.6 million in wages. Supporting non-local students increased economic activity by nearly $193.6 million and led to 3,362 jobs paying total annual wages of $101.5 million. \nStudents from the four-county region themselves spent an estimated $165.8 million in the area, which led to further expenditures of $88.4 million and a total impact of more than $254.2 million. The student spending supported an estimated 2,608 jobs in local businesses paying a total of $70.5 million in wages. \nSpending by non-local students was estimated to have increased total economic output by $90.5 million and supported 936 jobs at local businesses paying total annual wages of $25.6 million. \nWright State also made more than $32.3 million in capital expenditures, of which $15.7 million remained in the four-county economy. This spending led to further local sales of nearly $10.1 million for a total impact of $25.8 million. \nXenia Daily Gazette \nStory courtesy of Wright State University. \nStory courtesy of Wright State University.

Jon's Table Tennis Training", "text": "The Table Tennis Coaching Ambush \nAmbush \u2013 a surprise attack by people lying in wait in a concealed position Does every table tennis club have one of these guys? On the surface they seem to be the friendliest player in the building. They are more than willing to help the newcomer, the novice, the beginner, the innocent victim. Maybe it\u2019s because I spend so many hours a week coaching that I find the self appointed coach so irritating. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I think it\u2019s great for table tennis players to help each other. Most players have had someone take them under their wing, show them the ropes, and point them in the right direction. There is however, a definite difference between showing someone the ropes, and roping them into a coaching session. \nThis usually plays out the same way every time. A new player shows up at a club and eagerly agrees to warm up with a more experienced player. After an unusually long warmup, the new player begins receiving some \u201chelpful\u201d tips. Other players don\u2019t challenge this table because they know this player/coach really doesn\u2019t want to play. He has a deep need to teach, whether you want to be taught or not. New players are inevitably too polite to extricate themselves from the situation. Before you know it three hours have passed, and one table has been monopolized by two players, one of which really didn\u2019t even want to be there. \nWas this time truly wasted? Did the new player end up getting three hours of free quality coaching? Perhaps some progress was made, but that is not the point. Players that show up for open play are not necessarily looking for a coaching session. My own policy is to respect new players enough to play them during open play if we end up on the same table. If I have any advice, I save it for after the match, make it brief, and move on. This does make for some lopsided scores, but I think most players would rather lose an honest match, than spend hours having a stranger tell them everything they are doing wrong. There are plenty of ways to make new players feel welcome. Simply talking with them between matches is a good way to actually get to know them, rather than trying to impart all your table tennis knowledge on them at once. \nEventually, new players will likely realize they do need coaching. Some of these ambushed players already have a coach, and really need some match experience. Some players really do have a calling to coach, and should definitely pursue getting credentials, and begin teaching in a more structured way. There are players that are looking for coaching, and are still a little insecure about their skills. They don\u2019t need to be ambushed.
