Namibia did not get any official communication for the deadline, as government was advised on different reporting dates, one on December 5 and the other on December 12. \nAccording to the EU, the 17 countries on its blacklist are those whose tax regimes were deemed unable or unwilling to effectively control taxes and allowed illicit financial flows. \nA memorandum on the listing says the 17 states \u2013 including Namibia \u2013 have harmful tax regimes that go against the principles of the EU code of conduct on harmful tax practices. Further, they either have not implemented, or did not commit to implementing the OECD base erosion and profit shifting minimum standards. \nIn addition, the countries are not transparent in their tax regimes, and the EU requires that countries comply with international standards on the automatic exchange of information, as well as information exchange on request. Namibia meets all of those requirements, Schlettwein contends. \nHe said Namibia\u2019s Inland Revenue officials had previously met with officials of the EU Embassy to Namibia to discuss the matter and seek clarification. \nHowever, since local officials could not provide clarity on all the questions, it was agreed there would be a further engagement with local EU staff or EU tax experts from abroad. Namibia was later made aware of the deadline to inform the EU of the commitments to implement proposed actions or how Namibia would respond to the proposal. The finance minister yesterday said the EU blacklisted the country as a tax haven, simply because Namibia did not sign up to four agreements that the EU \u201cunilaterally created but expected Namibia to sign as a sovereignty.\u201d \nThe EU is now using that against Namibia to conclude that it\u2019s a tax haven, although Namibia gave the EU positive signals that it wants to join, but has not concluded the process as a sovereign nation.Factoring in all measures the country has put in place, including the tax legal framework containing anti-avoidance rules on transfer pricing and thin capitalisation, \u201cthe Namibian government emphatically rejects this assessment.\u201d \nNevertheless, the country \u201ccommits to use its best endeavours to clarify outstanding questions and answers to correct this unfortunate misconception,\u201d he added. \n\u201cWe believe that we have not been treated equitably and call upon the EU to correct what has already caused serious harm to Namibia\u2019s outstanding reputation as a politically stable democracy with rule of law-based institutions,\u201d said a stumped Schlettwein. \n\u201cUnfair actions such as this against small and vulnerable economies harm our people, diminish our chances to prosper and perpetuate inequality. This action by the EU authorities is against the very spirit of our cultural and cooperation efforts,\u201d he said. \nThe government has meanwhile scheduled an urgent a meeting with EU Ambassador in Namibia Jana Hyb\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1 to take up the matter. \u201cWe will raise it at diplomatic level to ensure that the good relationship with the EU is not in jeopardy, but rather that we correct it. \n\u201cWhether we missed the deadline or not, factually it does not make us tax haven, or an uncooperative party. It does not. If you missed a deadline, then you should be alerted that you missed the deadline and that there are consequences \u2013 and not be classified as tax haven,\u201d he countered.

With one fell swoop, US President Donald J. Trump declared that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish state of Israel, and that he is putting in place beginning immediately the move of the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Watch President Trump's Speech:  (If you're reading this via email,  click here to watch speech .) \"With today's action I reaffirm my administration's commitment to peace in the region\", Trump said. \"Today we call for calm, moderation and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the voice of hate\". What the president did not say  was whether or not all of Jerusalem would be considered as Israel's capital, which could be a huge sticking point in the near future. The mythical Palestinians claim the Old City area with the Temple Mount as their capital. Still, Trump today did something that no other president in our lifetime can claim, reaffirming dramatically the unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel. Palestinians burned a poster of Trump during a protest in Bethlehem, West Bank, on Tuesday in anticipation of the announcement Appearing in the  White House's  Diplomatic Reception Room  against an elaborate backdrop of Christmas decorations, He also said the United States embassy in Israel would, over time, be moved there from Tel Aviv. Israel is the only country where the United States has an embassy in a city that the host nation does not consider its capital.

Read More Storm Caroline could bring snow to Cambridgeshire as temperatures plummet \nSnow in the UK only tends to fall when the temperature is 2C or less, and when it falls within 0C or below, it doesn't experience melting. \nThe chilly temperatures will continue this weekend with a high 4C and a low of -1C on Saturday and a high of 4C and a low of 1C on Sunday. \nA mix of snow and rain is also possible in Cambridge on Sunday and Monday. \nForecasters have notoriously difficult times pinpointing how much snow, if any, will fall more than a few days ahead - but it's best to stay prepared as parts of the UK are predicted to get at least 10 to 20cm of snow. \nThis is how you find out if schools in Cambridgeshire are shutting because of the snow \nA return to milder temperatures is possible nearer to Christmas, but again, there is still some uncertainty in long-range forecast. \nForecast Eleanor Bell, principal meteorologist at The Weather Channel, said colder air would start to affect the UK during Thursday when Storm Caroline clears the country and moves across the North Sea. \nShe said: \"Storm Caroline will continue to shift eastwards through Thursday becoming situated to the west of Norway by the evening. \n\"This will develop a cold northerly flow and as a result will drag cold Arctic air in across Britain late Thursday night into Friday resulting in a sharp drop in temperatures. \n\"It will feel much colder in the wind. Widespread frosts are also expected.\" \nThere is, of course, a chance of sleet or rain - but if the rain lasts a long time, temperatures will get lower. \nWater evaporates and cools the air, which can eventually facilitate an atmosphere which can turn rain to snow. \nYou can keep up to date with all the latest news in and around Cambridge by downloading our free app. It is available for the iPhone and iPad from Apple's App Store , or the Android version can be downloaded from Google Play .

(Laurent Fievet / AFP) \nICBC International predicts the H-share benchmark will rise 15 to 20 percent next year as good fundamentals will extend into the year ahead but warns that increased interest rates could bring liquidity pressure. \nThe investment bank sees more upside for the Hong Kong stock market next year, driven by a strong global recovery and solid growth of the Chinese mainland economy. \nProfit growth for listed companies remains a key factor for both A-share and H-share markets, the bank said. \nMainland non-financial companies posted a profit growth of about 30 percent this year, beating market expectation. \nStrong performance of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, such as technology giant Tencent and insurance company Ping An, keep drawing southbound capital flow from mainland investors. \nLooking ahead, the H-share market may gain additional support from the possible cooling of the mainland\u2019s real-estate market and an increase in government investment. \nMacroeconomic data shows that in October, fixed-asset investment - covering physical assets such as machinery, land and buildings - declined, especially private investment. \nThe lukewarm momentum in private investment is partly brought by mainland companies\u2019 high corporate debt. Yet the bank is not pessimistic about economic growth, saying its research showed that historically the first year following the Communist Party of China\u2019s five-yearly congresses features a significant rise in fixed-asset investment. Such fiscal stimulus keeps the profit growth of listed companies at a relatively sound level. \nICBC warned higher interest rates could put liquidity under pressure. \nAs the much-anticipated United States Federal Reserve interest-rate rise likely to happen later this month looms and year-end demand takes effect, the US dollar/Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is once again approaching the weak limit of the linked exchange-rate band. Flags of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (C) and Hong Kong (R) are seen at Exchange Square after the Hang Seng Index closed up by 0.3 per cent, at 28,458.04, its highest level in almost ten years, in Hong Kong on Oct 6, 2017. (ANTHONY WALLACE / AFP) \nUnder the currency peg, the Hong Kong dollar trades at between 7.75 and 7.85 per US unit and was at 7.815 on Wednesday, Bloomberg figures show. \nTo stabilize the depreciating Hong Kong dollar, The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city\u2019s de facto central bank, issued Exchange Fund bills, which in turn pushed up the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate. \nHIBOR rose to more than 1 percent for the first time since 2008 last week. One-month HIBOR reached 1.003 percent, while the three-month rate hit 1.189 percent last Thursday. \nThe rise of Hong Kong dollar interest rates will lead to a relative tightening of liquidity in the stock market, ICBC notes. \nThe blue-chip Hang Seng Index has tumbled from a sizzling performance last month, when it closed above the 30,000-point level on Nov 22, falling back to finish at 28,224.8 points on Wednesday, down 2.14 percent on the day. \nYet ICBC believes pressure will be limited since its research shows the H-share market is more sensitive to the 12-month HIBOR rather than shorter-term rates. The increase in southbound capital from mainland investors can also partially make up for the shortage of overseas capital. \nThe investment bank is long on the A-share consumer discretionary sector, Hong Kong\u2019s healthcare sector and financial sectors in both markets, based on their performance and relatively low valuations. \nREAD MORE: HK's Hang Seng index posts biggest weekly loss of the year \nThe telecoms service sector has the highest valuation in the A-share market. The price-earnings ratio of China Unicom alone, which was up to 152.07 on Wednesday according to Bloomberg, boosts valuations across the board. In the H-share market, the highest valued sector is consumer staples.

Earlier this year, FAI\u2019s last Learjet 35A aircraft was also replaced by a Learjet 60 (D-CFAT). \nSiegfried Axtmann, Chairman of FAI rent-a-jet AG, commented, \u201cI am delighted to see that our fleet replacement and harmonisation project is on track.

Aster DM Healthcare announced the launch of the \u2018Aster Volunteers\u2019 programme in June this year as part of the milestone \u2018Aster @30\u2019 campaign to mark their 30th anniversary. In line with the declaration of 2017 as the Year of Giving by the UAE President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the \u2018Aster Volunteers\u2019 programme reinforces the company\u2019s commitment to supporting the communities it serves and recognises volunteerism as a key pillar of giving. The programme includes several initiatives, such as providing free surgeries and investigations across all of Aster DM Healthcare\u2019s 96 clinics and 18 hospitals. 732 free surgeries have been completed to date, of which 6 were done in the GCC. Thousands of free investigations and treatments were also carried out for patients in need. Aster partnered with local, government and multinational organizations and institutions \u2013 in each country it operates \u2013 to train white and blue collar workers in Basic Life Support (BLS). More than 95,000 people have already attended the sessions and these will continue in 2018 and 2019 in order to reach the goal of training 300,000 participants. Throughout the year, Aster organised 1,276 medical camps \u2013 across the geographies it operates in \u2013 which offered free health care check-ups to the public. Aster\u2019s in-house doctors, nurses, paramedics and mobile clinics took part in disaster and refugee management in Somalia and Jordan this year, which included volunteers from Dubai. This was organised in partnership with the Dubai government\u2019s Awqaf and Minors Affairs Foundation (AMAF) for the Somalia Food for Africa initiative, and in association with The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and local NGO\u2019s for the Syria operation. \u201cWe are wholly committed to give back to society and support the growth and betterment of communities. Aster has crossed boundaries and geographies to reach out to communities that most need help, and the success of the \u2018Aster Volunteers\u2019 programme is testimony to how a vision can be turned into reality, through effort and perseverance. I am proud that Aster was able to initiate these platforms and programmes, and as of now we have 7,900 volunteers, out of which 2,541 are from the UAE. We are honoured by the success of the programme, which has prompted us to take it forward as part of our vision to give back to the communities we serve every day\u201d, said Dr. Azad Moopen, Founder, Chairman and Managing Director, Aster DM Healthcare. The \u2018Aster Volunteers\u2019 programme also included an initiative to provide equal employment opportunities for at least 100 \u2018differently-abled\u2019 candidates, which has seen 52 differently-abled people recruited into the Aster work force to date. Aster is also currently helping to drive and facilitate the donation of 30,000 units of blood across its clinics, hospitals and mobile clinics, with 12,000 units of blood targeted for the UAE alone. \u2018Aster Volunteers\u2019 is a programme aimed at bridging the gap between people who would like to help, with those in need \u2013 through a web portal www.astervolunteers.com . Running successfully across the nine markets Aster DM Healthcare operates in, the multi-layered programme targets communities in the Middle East, Africa, India and Philippines through platforms and programmes aimed at uplifting the quality of life of people and societies through providing free healthcare support alongside basic care and necessities. The \u2018Aster @ 30\u2019 campaign will culminate in a gala dinner on the 11 th December to honour all those who have supported Aster DM Healthcare over the last 30 years, as well as announce the next steps for the \u2018Aster Volunteers\u2019 programme.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "azad moopen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khalifa bin zayed al nahyan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "office of the united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aster dm healthcare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gcc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minors affairs foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ksa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unhcr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "somalia food", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "somalia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united arab emirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "awqaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bahrain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:31.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd82e38c15bfe5f76cb76e67673f9f486bc43999", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9EnZRaY.EbMlqnfGDUNNS0EOsAp1c4pnh5tRcvw2bJCcKK_4gS7oSbS65Lla7CW7aAbffbmfGGBlW.WoBinmBtUiBSYASWR.ELrE0cQwQu1y3jqQHLvLAROeidq4ZVohNDy8y1IutgML2Tc2M8ACm.", "site_full": "www.qtellbuyandsell.com", "site": "qtellbuyandsell.com", "site_section": "http://www.qtellbuyandsell.com/feed/posts/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Buy and Sell Free Classified Ads Free Post Buy and Sell Free Classifiedads Free Advertise World Global Free Post sell Free Classified  - Buy and Sell Free Classified Ads Free Post Buy and Sell Free Classifiedads Free Advertise World Global Free Post sell Free Classified", "title": "Car Security System", "title_full": "Car Security System", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fd82e38c15bfe5f76cb76e67673f9f486bc43999", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9EnZRaY.EbMlqnfGDUNNS0EOsAp1c4pnh5tRcvw2bJCcKK_4gS7oSbS65Lla7CW7aAbffbmfGGBlW.WoBinmBtUiBSYASWR.ELrE0cQwQu1y3jqQHLvLAROeidq4ZVohNDy8y1IutgML2Tc2M8ACm.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "Car Security System", "text": "Posted on : Thursday, 07 December, 2017 09:42 Updated On : Thursday, 07 December, 2017 09:46 Expires On : Friday, 07 December, 2018 09:42 Hits : 74 \nFind here car security system \u00bb manufacturers, suppliers & exporters in Florida.

Surprise them with a day trip to a new place they have been wanting to explore, keep the itinerary open, and see what happens. They\u2019ll love it. \n2. Taurus: Wine Tasting. If any sign appreciates the finer things in life (AKA wine), it\u2019s Taurus. An afternoon spent tasting an array of reds and whites at a scenic winery will appeal to their sensual side, and leave them feeling buzzed in more ways than one. \n3. Gemini: Seeing A Documentary (And Discussing It Afterwards). Geminis love to be engaged in something and learn new things. Take them for a night out to see that mind blowing new documentary, and don\u2019t forget to schedule ample time afterwards to sip cocktails and debrief every aspect of the movie in detail! \n4. Cancer: Dinner At Their Favorite Restaurant. Cancers really thrive in places that feel comfortable and familiar. Find out their most beloved restaurant and take them there. Even if they have been there a million times, trust us, they will thoroughly enjoy it and appreciate your thoughtfulness! \n5. Leo: Karaoke. Leo loves having your full attention. Take it up a notch and have them get up on stage for karaoke night. Cheer them on as they belt out their favorite tunes late into the night, but watch out: if anyone can convince you to join them for a duet of \u201cLivin\u2019 On A Prayer,\u201d it\u2019s a Leo. \n6. Virgo: Cooking Class. Virgos are practical by nature and love learning new things. Skip the predictable dinner and a movie routine and sign the two of you up for that cooking class they\u2019ve been talking about; they\u2019ll leave the date with a new skill they can apply to their lives and some fun memories (not to mention a killer recipe for spinach ravioli). \n7. Libra: Couples\u2019 Massage. Libras love to be pampered and relaxed. Plan a date that is calm and rejuvenating for both of you with a couples\u2019 massage. Not only will your Libra feel their stress melt away, they\u2019ll love the romantic aspect of getting side-by-side massages. After the masseuse has worked their magic, toast to your new-found relaxation with a glass of champagne and a bit of dark chocolate to round out this perfect evening. \n8. Scorpio: A Night In. Intimacy-craving Scorpios want one thing: to be alone with you. Invite them over to your place and create a private oasis for the two of you complete with candles, good music, great food, and red wine. They\u2019ll love being able to focus on you (and vice versa) with no outside distractions. \n9. Sagittarius: Hiking. If there\u2019s any sign that absolutely loves to be out doing things, it\u2019s Sagittarius. They tend to get antsy sitting around inside, so plan an outdoor adventure for the two of you. Pack a picnic and spend the day hiking and taking pictures. Bonus points for choosing a trail that ends at a romantic waterfall. \n10. Capricorn: Dinner At An Exclusive Restaurant. You know that awesome new restaurant that everyone has been raving about and is basically impossible to get reservations at? Pull whatever strings you have to pull to get a table, and take your Capricorn there for dinner. They\u2019ll be blown away by your tenacity, and super excited to be the first person in their foodie friend group to experience those famous saffron-seared scallops. \n11. Aquarius: Live Music. Aquarians crave experiences that are both social and stimulating. Oh, and they really love music, especially music that\u2019s a little under-the-radar. Going out to a bar or jazz club to see a local band perform is a perfect combination of all three. They can enjoy some great music, a few beverages, and conversation with you between sets. They\u2019ll love it. \n12. Pisces: Art and Wine. Pisceans love to express their creativity and appreciate the creativity of others.
