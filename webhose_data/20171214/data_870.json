In this section, we\u2019ll discuss some common life changes and how you might want to adjust your budget as a result. Getting a Raise \nWhen you get a raise, you should consciously choose how you will spend the extra money. First, keep in mind that if you get a raise of $200 a month, it won\u2019t be nearly that much after taxes. If your marginal tax rate is 25%, an extra $200 a month will leave you with $150 after federal taxes, even less after Social Security and Medicare taxes, and still less if you also pay state or local income taxes. \nJust as you\u2019ve done with the rest of your money, decide what the best use of your new income will be. Do you want to save it, and if so, for what purpose? Saving it is a good way to avoid the lifestyle inflation that tends to accompany raises. If you want to spend it, consider how much you\u2019re going to spend, where that money will go and why. Don\u2019t let your extra income disappear without thinking through the best way to use it. (Learn more in When Is the Best Time to Ask for a Raise? and How Getting a Raise Affects Your Taxes .) Losing Your Job \nIf you lose your job, you\u2019ll almost certainly need to scale back your spending. \nExamine your budget to see where you can cut back. You may be able to cut out a particular category entirely, like going out to eat, and easily save $200 a month (though you\u2019ll have to increase your grocery budget a bit to make up for the lack of restaurant meals). Or you may be better off making smaller cuts in several categories, like decreasing your grocery bill by $20 a month and swapping out cable television for a streaming service. You may not be able to reduce your expenses enough to fit the reduced amount of money you have to spend, but because you\u2019ve been budgeting, you should have at least some money stashed away for emergencies. This is the time to use that money if you need it. (For more, see Losing Your Job: From A to Z .) \nWhat if you\u2019ve been at a company so long that you receive a generous severance package \u2014 say, six months\u2019 worth of your salary and health insurance \u2014 that enables you to maintain the same quality of living for an extended time? You\u2019d still be wise to cut back as much as possible, for several reasons: You don\u2019t know how long it will take you to find another job. You don\u2019t know if your new job will pay as much as your old job. You don\u2019t know if your new job will offer better or worse benefits than your old job. You might have to go back to school to acquire the skills you need to get rehired. \nIn a best-case scenario, you\u2019ll get a new job quickly and can use your remaining severance pay to bolster your savings. \nA smaller severance package or state unemployment insurance can help tide you over, but neither will provide you with the kind of income or financial stability you\u2019re probably used to. In any case, losing your job should mean revising your budget to plan for lower spending. Experiencing a Financial Emergency \nLosing your job certainly counts as a financial emergency, but it\u2019s not the only one you may encounter. Your beloved old Honda might suddenly sputter its last breath \u2014 or at least the last breath it\u2019s willing to take unless you want to pay for some costly replacement parts and labor. If you don\u2019t have good public transportation where you live or a friend, relative or coworker who can take you to work, you\u2019ll need to find a new vehicle fast, and probably rent one in the meantime. \nAgain, your emergency fund is a good place to look for new car money. If you don\u2019t have an emergency fund, you\u2019ll have to find the money elsewhere in your budget. Even if you do have an emergency fund, you\u2019ll need to adjust your budget so you can replenish your fund over the upcoming months after buying your replacement vehicle. Yes, you could get an auto loan, but unless you qualify for an extremely low interest rate \u2014 say, 0% to 3% \u2014 we would advise against taking on debt to buy an asset that declines in value. If you must get a loan, minimize it by making as large of a down payment as you can afford. (See 5 Apps to Help Build a Financial Safety Net .) Saving for a Major Purchase \nAdjusting your budget so you can afford a major purchase, like a down payment on a house, is similar to adjusting it when you lose your job or have a financial emergency. You\u2019ll need to find significant ways to cut back in one or more spending categories and perhaps a way to increase your income as well. \nThe difference is that, since you\u2019re cutting back for something you\u2019ve chosen, it won\u2019t be as painful. It\u2019s also often possible to plan for major purchases several months to a year or more in advance, making them easier to fit into your budget without making major lifestyle changes. Buying a House \nIf you buy a house, you\u2019ll need to make long-term changes to your budget. \nTo prepare yourself for the change and make sure you can afford it, adjust your budget several months to a year in advance and pretend as if you already have the new expense. This way, if you find out you can\u2019t meet all your obligations, you won\u2019t incur any real damage and you\u2019ll have time to fix things before the real expense kicks in. Changing Your Habits \nAny time you change your habits, you will see a corresponding change in your finances \u2013 sometimes giving you more money, and sometimes less. Deciding to start eating healthier may not equate to healthier finances in the short run, for example. If you\u2019re trading in boxed mac and cheese for fresh fish, fruits and vegetables, your grocery bill is going to increase (though your health expenses will likely go down, at least in the long run). If you\u2019re trading in seven nights a week\u2019s worth of take-out meals for healthy home cooking, quitting smoking or cycling to work instead of driving, you\u2019ll probably save money. In any case, you\u2019ll need to adjust your budget. (See 7 Habits That Can Lead to Future Wealth and 10 Habits of Successful People .) Becoming Seriously Ill or Disabled \n\u201cIt won\u2019t happen to me,\u201d once thought everyone who has ever become seriously ill or disabled. But it can happen to you and being diagnosed with a major illness or experiencing a major injury can be one of the worst things that can happen to your finances, especially if it means you can\u2019t work for months, years or even the rest of your life. Few people will come out of such situations unscathed, since their medical expenses are increasing exponentially while their income has plummeted. \nThat\u2019s why you want to be proactive about taking steps to minimize the damage if something does happen to you or your partner. Always carry health insurance and private disability income insurance . Take full advantage of the money you might have in a health savings account or flexible spending account. Be proactive about reducing your medical bills by questioning the need for every procedure and test and getting things done in network whenever possible. Claim Social Security Disability Income if you\u2019re eligible. \n(For more ideas, see 10 Ways to Prepare for a Personal Financial Crisis and 20 Ways to Save on Medical Bills .) Getting Rid of a Major Expense \nIf you\u2019ve finally finished putting all your children through college and they\u2019ve all moved out and acquired jobs, not only will you no longer have tuition expenses, you\u2019ll be free of paying for someone else\u2019s food, clothing, medical bills and other costs. Paying off your mortgage is another time in your life when your expenses will significantly decrease. What will you do with all this extra money? Your budget\u2019s goals can guide you. Maybe you\u2019d like to work less and enjoy life more, take a major vacation or ramp up your retirement savings. Having a Child \nThis is the flip side of the above. The first costs of having a child are all the medical bills associated with pregnancy and delivery. There are also ongoing medical bills for your child\u2019s health. Having a child may mean moving to a larger home or to a neighborhood in a better school district, which can increase your budget substantially. Childcare, possibly private school and, one day, a college education are also major expenses. Then there\u2019s food, diapers, clothing, strollers, car seats, toys, birthday parties, braces, extracurricular activities and so much more. According to a Wall Street Journal calculator , the average cost for a middle-income family to raise a child born in 2013 to age 18 is more than $245,000. \nThis life change may require you to rethink every aspect of your earning and spending. For example, is there a way one spouse can make more money while the other stays home? Can you move closer to grandparents willing to provide childcare while you work? Do you really need cable TV? Why on earth do you still have a landline phone? Do you need that $70 a month cell phone plan when you could go with a low-cost carrier for $30 per month? Can you become a one-car household for a while? Can family vacations be road trips instead of plane trips? \nAs you can see, multiple factors can change your financial situation from month to month and year to year. It\u2019s important to be flexible and adjust your budget to reflect these changes so that you\u2019ll be able to continue making the best possible use of your money no matter what\u2019s going on in your life. \nAs with our earlier sections on how to cut your budget in different categories, major life changes require some careful analysis. Sometimes you will feel rich. Other times, you'll be glad you spent all that time figuring out how to assemble an emergency fund.

Before microneedling, a hyaluronic acid\u2013based moisturizer supplied by Dermapen, LLC was applied to the face. On the same day, the woman had received laser treatment (Fraxel re:store, Solta Medical Inc) for a scar on her chest, using 8 passes at 25 mJ and treatment level 9 with a 15-mm tip. Vita C Serum (San\u00edtas Skincare) was applied to the skin on the chest prior to laser treatment. A few days after the procedure, she noticed redness, pruritus, and blistering at the site treated with the laser. Two weeks later, she had a second session of microneedling performed on her face, this time using Vita C Serum. Within 3 days, she developed progressive facial redness and swelling.

You said that even CS told you not to accept the refund. So why do you think you will get a defect? Once the package is actually delivered, and tracking will show that, it's a different story. You don't have an actual \"dispute\" yet. Do not bow down to this Buyer. So far, you haven't done anything wrong, and it sounds like CS knows it. Just stay calm and do not play games with the Buyer.

There, Republicans from both sides of Congress generally agree on two big changes. \nSaving for private school \nTaxpayers can currently save money for college through a 529 plan, where earnings grow tax-free. Many states also offer deductions for contributions. In the proposals, Republicans want to let taxpayers use 529s to pay for K-12 tuition at private and religious schools, too. Families can already do that with a different plan \u2014 Coverdell Education Savings Accounts \u2014 but these have low contribution limits and aren't open to high-income Americans. The move to expand the 529 would dramatically increase who could use these plans and the money they could save. \n\"I think the only taxpayers who will be in a position to benefit from the 529 change are very rich people,\" says Nora Gordon, an economist and associate professor at Georgetown University. She says using these accounts to save for elementary or high school won't help much unless you can afford to set aside a lot of money early on. No wonder, when the Government Accountability Office studied 529s and Coverdells a few years ago, it found \"families with these accounts had about 25 times the median financial assets\" of those who didn't use them and \"about three times the median income.\" \nWhile the proposed expansion of 529 plans would largely help affluent parents who use private schools, Republicans are proposing another change that could hurt funding for the nation's public schools. \nThe SALT (State And Local Taxes) deduction \nUp to now, taxpayers who itemize their deductions \u2014 generally high-earners who make up about a third of households in the U.S. \u2014 have gotten a break from the federal government for paying state and local taxes. \nThink of it as a kind of rebate \u2014 courtesy of Washington \u2014 that ultimately helps state and local governments pay for important things, like schools, among other things. \nRepublicans now want to cut that discount, getting rid of the income and sales tax deductions and putting a $10,000 cap on the deduction for property taxes. \n\"This bill is gonna make it more painful for residents to increase local property taxes to pay for public schools,\" says John Friedman, an associate professor of economics at Brown University. \nOn average, nearly half of public schools' funding (45 percent) comes from local taxes, often property taxes. In the past, when locals hiked these taxes to help pay for their schools, the federal government made the hike hurt less with that SALT deduction. So imagine, if Congress caps the property tax deduction, for high earners who already pay a lot \u2014 in places like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, even Texas \u2014 a new hike would hurt more than it used to. \n\"This is a really big deal for some states and no deal at all for other states. And the states that it's a really big deal for are blue states,\" says Nora Gordon of Georgetown. \"They're states with higher cost of living, higher property values, and states that spend more on their state and local government.\" \nWhile local taxes provide nearly half of public school dollars, state taxes account for much of the rest (46 percent). Kim Rueben of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says states often use these sales and income taxes to help their poorest schools. \n\"The money from the state ends up helping to prop up school districts that have less ability to raise money from the property tax,\" she says. Getting rid of these deductions, Rueben says, will make state-level taxes more painful for some and, again, could make it harder to raise money for schools in the future. \nImportant context: All this is happening with many school districts still reeling from the Great Recession. According to a recent analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, after adjusting for inflation, \"twenty-nine states provided less overall state funding per student in the 2015 school year than in the 2008 school year, before the recession took hold.\" \n*** \nThe two tax bills are farther apart when it comes to higher education. \nIn the House: fewer tuition benefits \nWe've heard a lot about graduate students' reaction to the proposal to tax their tuition waivers as income. \nAs Ariana Figueroa reported for NPR: \n\"Many grad students \u2014 especially in Ph.D. programs \u2014 receive tuition waivers in exchange for teaching classes or doing research. Under current law, that money isn't taxed as income. But the House bill calls for those tuition waivers to be counted as income and subjected to income taxes. \nThat means graduate students would be paying taxes on money they never receive.\" \nThe House bill also cuts or reduces other higher education tax benefits: The Hope Scholarship Credit The Lifetime Learning Credit and tuition deduction The deduction on interest for those repaying student loans The American Opportunity Tax Credit, which students and families can use to offset college tuition payments, is limited to exclude part-time and graduate students, although it is also extended for a fifth year. \nTogether, the axed benefits are worth about $6.5 billion a year to students and families, according to the American Council on Education. \nThe Senate bill doesn't include any of the above. \nState funding for public higher education may also be in jeopardy, for the same reasons we discussed above \u2014 a consequence of getting rid of the deductions for SALT. Scaling back, or cutting federal discounts to taxpayers may cause a squeeze on funding for state universities and colleges. \nPrivate college penalties \nBoth public and private colleges have expressed concern that fewer people are going to be taking the charitable deduction, because of the increase in the standard deduction. They're worried this will lead, in turn, to less money in donations. The American Council on Education estimates about $100 billion less a year in donations across all nonprofits. \nThere are also some provisions in the House and Senate bills that target private colleges specifically. One provision would levy a tax on investment gains for a small group of private colleges that have very large endowments on a per-student basis. Currently, this money grows tax-free thanks to the colleges' nonprofit status. \nThis affects about 65 private colleges with extremely large endowments. But even more colleges are worried about it, says Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education. \n\"Even though public universities are not affected by the endowment tax, they are very much opposed to it, for fear it would set a precedent that would be applied to them in the future.\" \nCulture war? \nThe tax plans, which passed on party lines in both the House and Senate, are aligned with a broader Republican agenda. On the K-12 side, cuts that impact the source of public school funding are coming hand in hand with special tax benefits for families with means to put aside money for private school tuition. \nOn the higher education side, Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and adviser to the Trump campaign, told Bloomberg that Republicans are going after university endowments because \"universities have become playpens of the left.\" Amplifying that point, a recent Pew poll showed there is a sharply rising partisan gap on higher education, with 58 percent of Republicans saying colleges have a negative effect on the country, while 72 percent of Democrats say they have a positive impact.

Complement activation may proceed beyond the C3b formation step, resulting in C5 activation, formation of the membrane attack complex and intravascular hemolysis. Due to surface-bound regulatory proteins such as CD55 and Ipilimumab CD59, however, the complement activation is usually not sufficient to produce clinically significant activation of the terminal complement pathway. The major mechanism of hemolysis in stable disease, therefore, is the extravascular destruction of C3b-coated erythrocytes by the RES.[29], [30], [32] and [33] These mechanisms explain why the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is strongly positive for C3d in patients with CA mediated hemolysis and, in a majority, negative for IgM and IgG. In up to 20% of patients with primary CAD, however, DAT is also weakly positive for IgG, which should not lead to a wrong diagnosis \nof mixed-type AIHA.[6] and [34] Primary CAD accounts for about 15% of all cases Alectinib mouse of AIHA.[1], [2] and [35] The prevalence in Norway has been estimated to 16 per million inhabitants and the incidence rate to 1 per million inhabitants per year.6 The median age of patients with CAD is 76 years (range, 51\u201396) with a median age at onset of symptoms of 67 years (range, 30\u201392).6 By definition, all patients with CAD have hemolysis, but occasional patients are not anemic because the hemolysis is fully compensated. Most patients, however, have manifest hemolytic anemia. Of 16 patients described in an early publication, five had hemoglobin (Hgb) levels below 7.0 g/dL and one had levels below 5.0 g/dL.36 Hgb levels ranged from 4.5 g/dL to normal in a more the recent population-based descriptive study of 86 Norwegian patients.6 In the same study, the median Hgb level was 8.9 g/dL and the lower tertile was 8.0 g/dL. Fifty per cent of the patients had been considered transfusion dependent for shorter or longer periods \nduring the course of the disease, and 70% had received drug therapy. Although the term \u2018cold\u2019 refers to the biological properties of the CA, not the clinical features, approximately 90% of the patients experienced cold-induced acrocyanosis and/or Raynaud phenomena.6 These symptoms ranged from slight to disabling. Characteristic seasonal variations in the severity of hemolytic anemia have been well documented.37 In at least two-thirds of the patients, exacerbation of hemolytic anemia is also triggered by febrile infections or major trauma.[6], [38] and [39] The explanation for this paradoxical exacerbation is that during steady-state CAD, most patients are complement-depleted with low levels of C3 and, in particular, C4. During acute phase reactions, C3 and C4 are repleted and complement-induced hemolysis increases. This entry was posted in Uncategorized by admin . Bookmark the permalink .

The Tottenham boss has been reticent so far this season to give anyone other than a core of 15 or so players a chance to start matches under him and as a result the other players have looked rusty when eventually called upon. Players like Fernando Llorente, Juan Foyth and  Georges-Kevin Nkoudou  will all be better for getting 90 minutes in their legs. Two of them grabbed their first goals for the club and the other continued to learn how to be a part of the Spurs defence. Apoel certainly weren't top quality opposition, but they weren't pushovers. They wanted that point that might have brought Europa League qualification and they had held Borussia Dortmund home and away in order to get the opportunity to try to do so. Pochettino will have learned plenty about his fringe players and he also took the chance to give Kazaiah Sterling a moment he'll never forget - making his professional debut at Wembley in the Champions League. It will serve the teenager well going forward and he'll return to the development squad with bundles of confidence. \nDanny Rose in action against Apoel \nThe Rose reaction The advantage of the Wembley press box is that you've got a good view of both benches below. It was clear that  Danny Rose  signalled to the bench in the second half and then came over in order to get help with a cut above his eye. When the size of the cut was assessed, he went off down the tunnel to get treatment and Kyle Walker-Peters was ushered on. So it was a surprise to see social media blowing up with people slating his reaction to being substituted. It makes you question what you've seen, even when Rose returned to the bench towards the end of the game, holding a big ice pack against his forehead. So I asked Pochettino what exactly had happened with Rose. His answer was as straight forward as the incident had seemed. \"He had a massive cut. He needed stitches and it wasn't necessary to take a risk. He needed to go inside to get the stitches,\" he said. This was a prime example of fans thinking the worst of a player who has previously upset them. Rose gets a great reaction at stadiums from the Tottenham faithful, applauded at the beginning of every game and whenever he walks over to the corner flag. Yet he may never win back the affection of a section of the Spurs support, unhappy with that summer interview and his likely intention to move on either this January or next summer. Rose probably won't care, he's had it before, but the speed of social media means that there's not always the time taken to wait until all the facts are known before reacting. \nHeung-Min Son celebrates with Fernando Llorente \nThe Llorente/Son partnership Harry Kane's spot in the team is not in any immediate danger, but the partnership between  Fernando Llorente  and  Heung-Min Son  showed plenty of promise for the rest of the season. It's no surprise that when Tottenham finally started playing to the Spaniard's target man strengths, he flourished. Some of his control, flicks and headers into team-mates' paths were superb. His goal in the first half was excellent, a touch to control Serge Aurier's low cross and then a swivel and low finish. His reaction was one of pure joy and relief. It doesn't matter if you're 23 or 33, a goal drought for a striker is a painful thing. Llorente's understanding with Son was excellent. They've played a handful of minutes together and rarely as a duo, but the South Korean seemed to read his every move at Wembley. He almost scored within the opening minutes from a knock down from the big forward. Son's goal was another curling cracker for his collection. He's becoming a purveyor of fine goals and the fact that he was the first player to be substituted showed Pochettino wants him to keep up his form in front of goal against Stoke. \nKazaiah Sterling and Georges-Kevin Nkoudou embrace on the pitch \nThe return of Nkoudou Georges-Kevin Nkoudou  has seemingly been sent away in his room for the last few months, banished from playing with his friends until he proved he had taken on Pochettino's instructions. It seems that something finally clicked a fortnight or so ago and the Spurs boss has been impressed with his recent showings in training, but hasn't been able to give the French winger any match time. The match against Apoel finally provided an opportunity. It looked at first as if Nkoudou might not take it, with plenty of runs into blind alleys and crosses either hitting the first man or flying too high. But he grew into the game and had one shot cleared off the line, another deflected wide and then finally luck was on his side with an effort bouncing off a defender and past the helpless goalkeeper. His confidence was up from then on and the smile was firmly back on his face. \"When you come from France and a lot of things happen in your life, sometimes you need more time to adapt and to start performing,\" said Pochettino. \"He is a great kid, always a smile, he is very nice. All the people love him, we feel bad and I feel disappointed when you cannot give him the possibility to play. \"But it is trying to push him, trying to help him and of course today was a massive opportunity for him and we are so happy. Now we need to push him to improve and improve and improve.\" If he can improve and take on Pochettino's instructions then Nkoudou could yet prove to be a very useful option in breaking down those stubborn defences Spurs have been struggling with recently. \nMauricio Pochettino looks on at Wembley \nDaring to do The 'Group of Death' they called it. Yet here we are six matches later with Tottenham on top unbeaten, with 16 points from a possible 18. That's more points than any other team in the competition this year and the most for an English side since 2007. Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Apoel have all fallen by the wayside when they've come up against Pochettino's men and the Spurs boss can't help but start dreaming, even if he knows it's going to be tough. \"Of course we are going to try to win every game and go as far as we can,\" he said when asked if Tottenham could go all the way and win the competition. \"In football always you can dream and, why not? We can dream.\" \nThe performances over two legs, of sorts, against each of their group stage opponents, particularly the back to back reigning champions Real will give Tottenham confidence that they can beat which team is plucked out to face them in Monday's draw. With the Premier League title an unlikely target now, Pochettino's focus is likely to shift in February back to Europe's elite club competition. To match their run to the quarter-finals under Harry Redknapp would be impressive. But there's a determination among the manager and this group of players that as this year has already proven to be a somewhat magical one in the Champions League, maybe, just maybe, it's not such a crazy dream after all. \n\n\n\n\nUEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE\nGROUP H\nMATCHDAY 6\nWEDNESDAY 6TH DECEMBER, 2017\n(7.45pm \u2013 at Wembley)\nTOTTENHAM HOTSPUR 3(2) APOEL 0(0) \nScorers:-\nLlorente, 20\nSon, 37\nNkoudou, 80\nAttendance:- 42,679\nReferee:- Slavko Vincic (SVN)\nAssistant referees:- Toma\u017e Klancnik (SVN) & Andra\u017e Kovacic (SVN)\nAdditional assistant referees:- Rade Obrenovic (SVN) & Roberto Ponis (SVN)\nFourth official:- Grega Korde\u017e (SVN)\nTeams:-\nSpurs (4-2-3-1):- Vorm(Capt.); Aurier, Foyth, Sanchez, Rose (sub Walker-Peters, 70); Winks, Dele (sub Sterling, 88); Son (sub Dembele, 65), Sissoko, Nkoudou; Llorente\nSubs not used:- Gazzaniga; Vertonghen, Davies; Amos\nBooked:- Aurier (foul on Aloneftis), Rose (foul on Sallai)\nAPOEL (4-2-3-1):- Perez; Vouros, Rueda, Carlao, Lago; Vinicius (sub Sallai, 46), Morais (Capt.); Zahid, Ebecilio, Aloneftis (sub de Camargo, 75); Pote (sub Antoniou, 81)\nSubs not used:- Gudino; Merkis; Farias; Alexandrou\nBooked:- Sallai (response to incident with Rose), Rueda (foul on Nkoudou)\nZippy start, no bungles and even a goal for Georges! \nThe Rainbow laces campaign might have been and gone here in England, but in this dead rubber Champions\u2019 League Group H game against the bottom-placed team in our group Spurs made a zippy start; made no major bungles, and we even saw a second half goal for Georges! (Georges-Kevin Nkoudou, of course!) Mauricio Pochettino made 8 changes to his team with Juan Foyth playing beside Davinson Sanchez in a back four. Fernando Llorente made only his fourth start for Spurs; played 90 minutes for the club for the first time, and scored his first goal in our colours. He even got the assist for Son\u2019s goal, so had a great day, leading the line in traditional centre-forward style. Nkoudou\u2019s goal came in a second half which looked more like a training game, and was also his first for the club in an official game.\nIn Cyprus, APOEL had looked quite a threat to Spurs at times, especially Stathis Aloneftis on their left flank. He and striker Pote had one or two moments, but nothing to cause alarm to Spurs. When we won in Nicosia the 3-0 scoreline might have flattered us a little as we scored with our first three strikes on target, but tonight we won comfortably and deservedly. Spurs played the game at a good pace in the first half, and there was very little sideways or backwards passing. Dele started beside Harry Winks, with Son, Sissoko and Nkoudou in front of him. The crowd was somewhat disappointing, but the Cypriot section (no doubt some of them even travelled from Cyprus!) was full and vocal almost throughout the game, clearly determined to enjoy their trip to Wembley.\nSpurs\u2019 first attack was a counter from their own half with Nkoudou and Son combining on the left and crossing through Sissoko who passed to Aurier on the right flank, and Aurier hit a shot/cross which passed just outside the goalkeeper\u2019s right post. A minute later Son received the ball in the middle and took it on, hitting a fine left footed shot which the keeper must have got a touch to, as it went for a corner. After 6 minutes a deep centre by Rose was headed down by Llorente for Son, whose shot was blocked and ran away harmlessly. Son was fouled about 28 yards out and Harry Winks floated in the free kick. Llorente headed it down, Sanchez failed to score and Nkoudou\u2019s shot was cleared off the line at point blank range by Rueda. Llorente returned the ball in and this time Sanchez pushed a shot wide.\nSpurs built up a move from their own half after 17 minutes moving from left to right and the final cross from Aurier was cleared for a corner, with Llorente threatening. Spurs then had a second corner taken on the left met by Foyth who headed over across the goal. The deserved lead came with a stylish goal. Harry Winks is often the fulcrum of Spurs\u2019 play with his fine passing game, and he started this move with a smashing long pass to Aurier on the right. Aurier\u2019s cross was met by Llorente who scored in style, taking a touch, before turning and firing home with his left foot. It was a much awaited and welcome first club goal for a player who has often been maligned this season. Personally, I saw enough of what he can do in Madrid to realise his worth to the team.\nFollowing some good defensive play by Aurier against Aloneftis, Spurs attacked with Son passing out to Llorente towards the right. Llorente crossed and Sissoko\u2019s header was held by the goalkeeper.\nSpurs went two up with another fine goal. Son received the ball on the right channel, and played a nice one-two with Llorente before hitting a powerful left foot shot into the net right of the keeper. I saw enough in the game to suggest that Son and Llorente have forged something of an understanding, which clearly has potential for the team in the busy Christmas and New Year programme to come.\nAPOEL did have an effort on goal but it was all too easy for Vorm, after Aloneftis crossed and Pote\u2019s header looped into Vorm\u2019s hands. After 43 minutes, Aurier hit a good pass from a central position in his own half to Llorente. Llorente hit the ball to Son and was asking for it back as he had space on the right, but Son took an early shot with his right foot, well saved by keeper Perez, diving to his left to concede a corner.\nAPOEL coach Giorgos Donis made a second half change replacing defensive midfielder Vinicius (aka Oliveira Franco) with right sided attacker Roland Sallai. The Cypriots came out of the blocks well and it wasn\u2019t long before they had a good chance. It was right back Vouros who hit a shot which was deflected wide of the far post by Danny Rose\u2019s interception. Spurs weathered the mini surge by the visitors, and after 52 minutes Son and Dele fed the ball to Nkoudou who got into the box and hit a right footed shot which was deflected for a Spurs corner taken on the right by Rose. The corner came to nought. Five minutes later a Rose cross from the left fell for Llorente, but he could not fully connect with the ball. Aurier collected and tried a shot but this was cleared.\nThere was a break in play for treatment and I noticed Mauricio Pochettino seemed to be in conversation with Spanish left back Roberto Lago. Perhaps Pochettino knew him from his time in Spain, but Lago was with different teams to Mauricio.\nSpurs had a free kick on the right and Son hit a shot which looked as if it might be going in, but it just dipped too late and passed over the net. Sissoko made a powerful run from near the half-way line and passed to Nkoudou, but his shot was saved and cleared. Aurier got the first yellow of the night for a foul, on Aloneftis, and soon after that Son went off early to be replaced by Dembele, which allowed Dele to move forward. In truth, Dele had been carrying a knock since early in the game, and it was a surprise to many that he stayed on so long. Son\u2019s early substitution is an indication he will be starting on Saturday against Stoke.\nDanny Rose went into the book for a foul on Sallai, who also went into the book in the aftermath. I am not sure if that is for something he said, or for an incident which led to Danny Rose having to go off for a blood injury. Apparently, he only needed a stitch, but Kyle Walker-Peters came on and performed most competently. Perhaps with an eye to their own resurging league campaign and the quest for Europe next season, Donis replaced Aloneftis with de Camargo. It didn\u2019t help though, as Georges-Kevin Nkoudou received from Dele got into the box and twisted left and right before firing a right footed shot which took a deflection to pass goalkeeper Perez across the goalmouth, hitting the net.\nA subsequent free kick taken by Dele was held by the goalkeeper, and Kazaiah Sterling could be seen waiting to replace Dele. Sadly for him, the ball didn\u2019t go out of play for ages, with Spurs in possession most of that time. By the time he did get on, the game was in wind-down mode and many home fans (me included) were heading for their trains.\nNow we wait with bated breath for Monday\u2019s Round of 16 draw to see if we have to play Basel, Bayern Munich (no thanks!), Juventus, Porto, Sevilla or Shakhtar Donetsk.

decoration process, which really just meant that they dropped a tennis ball at my feet at a regular basis.  so hang a few ornaments, toss the tennis ball, hang a few ornaments, toss the tennis ball.  that is how that went. made a few attempts at forced photo ops\n as you can imagine they were thrilled.  these are some pics of the last few days sunsets...we've had some dandy ones, i  must say.  above was yesterday.  i walked down to the beach at Kincaid.  turned out to be well worth it.  great reflections off the pond there.\n i think Ivy was a wee bit better at these photo ops...still fun and some silly pictures to go with it.\n the mantel has filled in a bit more since i snapped this\n put the tree in the front entry.  tried to limit ornaments towards the bottom and on the outside part as the dogs will be flying past and will no doubt take some ornaments each time they do. i think only one as come off so far so not bad.\n these first pictures are iphone shots so not always the best quality anyway.  above is today's walk.  took the airstrip and then returned via homestead and the back biking trails.  cleats required of course.  it is icy out there.\n so many pretty ornaments.  not all of them made it on the tree this year. it's a perfect sized tree. \n Tusker kept his hat on for enough time for me to capture a photo\n can hardly tell Ivy has the Santa hat on.  oh well.\n the beach is pretty covered with ice.  it was low tide when we arrived.  hardly anyone out on the trails. the ice seems to have kept some away.  saw no moose either. \n pretty out there though.  I'm sure someone with a better camera and skills would take some incredible pics out here...what i have is that i get out there...that is half the battle to any photography..you have to be out there  to get a shot.\n we braved the beach with the ice a bit...not really great for beach walking at this time.\n pups climbed on some chunks of ice. i took the tennis ball away...gets too lost in those chunks of ice...never to be seen again.\n the side trail appears to have flooded over.  it was a good 6 inches at least from what i saw the pups walking through.  i had to go a bit off trail to prevent from getting too wet.  this always confuses the dogs...they just run through it. humans...we really have devolved rather than evolved in many ways.\n this one turned out super cute of Ivy Rose...such a ham!!  she's like those eager to please kids.  love this face!!\n more ice and sunset...this is the beach at low tide. the chunks of ice land and await the return of the tide...this is a beach i brought a few brothers too...looks i bit different I'm sure.\n my work of the evening.  put on the Christmas music, took a break from it all...which is nice.\n bummed about Franken. like him and like how he has been outspoken.  so it bites that he has been highlighted as having used his position to get a little here and there where he could.  the other Senators have spoken and i think everyone figures he will step down tomorrow. i do understand that it is time for a zero tolerance.  no more of these pay outs either...in the end it would be better for the Dems to be able to say, not in our party...while the GOP is seeming to welcome both racists and pedophiles.  such an interesting place we are in.  the party that caters to  evangelicals also caters to white supremacists and pedophiles. that is screwed up. \n i will be going to Dimond Nursery for my Christmas tree needs from now on.  they hang the trees up so you can walk around and spin them all and see the trees on all sides so easy...i had way too much fun tree twirling and it took me quite some time to select my tree but it was a very happy making experience. \n i may go back and twirl trees again, just cause it is so much fun!\n look at that sky!!\n and there is the cute puppy, Ivy Rose.\n these reflections were amazing.  photo's do not tell all.  tonight's sunset looked super pretty from my poor trail vantage point, i can only imagine how it would have looked from one of my favorite sunset spots.  there were some more lucky photographers today I'm sure.  seems there is always someone somewhere.  there are many amateur photographers up here.  so fun to see what everyone comes up with.\n i liked the simplicity of the above shot. this was on the airstrip today.  no wind and this one puffy cloud. \n just a few more jumbled pictures. the iphone loads in all jumbled. \n have had some great sunsets my days off.  tomorrow i head back to work for 3...\n the holidays come and go quickly.  i need to get my local gift projects all done.\n adorbs...\n everything gets down to the removal of the Rus sanctions.  Flynn may have been involved in an attempt to bring nuclear power plants across the middle east?  seems a bad idea with all the unrest that seems to always be there, but it would have also required the sanctions to be removed to be successful....we will all have to wait and see what turns up in the investigation...for Rus it has been about putting the person in power who would remove those sanctions.  that did not work out yet for them. \n seems to be the theme though.  we have paper ballots here and i hope we stay that way.  i hope the nation returns to this so that we can be more assured of safe and secure elections, much more difficult to hack into these.  we also need to do away with the gerrymandering and make the districts more rational so that the votes actually matter.  our Democracy needs lots of tweaking. we need to make more laws that will prevent these sorts of folks from trying what they have been trying to get away with...we need to get these folks out first though.\n the rest are from the night before sunset up at Basher trail\n kind of looked like an anvil out there.\n loved the contrast with the sunset and the dark clouds\n a 5 year old is dead after accidentally shooting himself. i have my paper back.  they went bankrupt, sold to someone else, changed the name back to Anchorage Daily News and now my paper has returned.  it stopped somewhere in there without notice.  not sure if i will get notice. i got an odd phone call.  another 5 year old passed away in a house fire last week.  rough week for kids.\n our nut job congressmen is now the most senior member in congress since Conyers is out after his sex scandals...he will be involved in the tax scam...i mean tax bill so he will no doubt insist the opening of ANWR stays in there.  thanks GOP.  drill and kill. \n chasing tennis ball with sunset in  background\n Rus is out of winter games...doping scandal.  somethings never change.\n many thanks to Patagonia and REI as they will join the fight to prevent shrinking of Utah monuments....the Native community is overall not too happy with this decision considering the iitoo never spoke to them to see what their thoughts were. he's not too keen on native sovereignty I'm sure.\nthe religious freedom to not sell a cake to a gay couple is being heard i guess.  it is funny that the same who fight for this are seemingly fine with the possibility of being represented by a pedophile....so silly.  who cares.   they can just put I'm Christian stickers in their shop windows which will tell others, i am a homophobe but i welcome pedophiles so if you want cake to lure small kids with come on in.   the GOP will hear more and more of this as they keep allowing men with histories of sexual deviant behavior into offices of power.  you can scream Clinton but if the future is the Dems having zero tolerance and the GOP welcoming...well, just saying get used to it.\n your religious freedoms are not stunted by making a cake.  your religious freedoms aren't prevented by others committing what you feel is a sin.  you are still able to practice your religion. that hasn't changed and that won't change because a cake is made and a couple is married.  i guess we shall see what the court says.\n seems late for fire season even by CA standards but they have some big ones going right now.  my brother and his family were temporarily evacuated.  thankfully, all is well.  global warming and the melting of the ice pack in the north could be partially responsible.  there is reports that CA will experience more droughts\n need to put my reading glasses in here.  seems i often end up reading the paper at night \n interesting article about women in prison in Afghanistan...some will have their kids with them.  i get the feeling that it can happen if the child is born in prison or if the woman has no one else to care for the kids or if they don't sign the kids over for others to care for.  the one woman they highlighted was in for life, got pregnant in prison, this changed her sentence to life over a death sentence. her daughter is now 11 and will remain until she is 18 it sounded like.  she has spent the entirety of her life in prison without committing any crime. \n I'd watched a documentary and it isn't the most unusual thing for kids to be in women's prisons.  the documentary i saw was about India i believe.  the kids that are born there stay with their moms until they turn 5.  i believe that they found many women did better, were less likely to be repeat offenders. \n there are a lot of ways to do things.  not all are right or wrong.  interesting concepts though.\n\n it's after midnight and I'm getting hungry.  may have to grab a snack before i crash. I've been liking the herb triskets lately...cheese and triskets.  tasty. \n should be some fruit though i guess.  i have a little watermelon downstairs and a pomegranate.  those are too messy for late night bed snacking though.\n\n guess i shall move on from this.  hope you  are all enjoying some of the holiday season.  at least you aren't my dog and were forced to wear silly head wear tonight.  hehe.\nthankful for:  A.  the music of the season.  B. the decorated tree which just brings a smile each time  i walk by  C.  twirling trees....a new pleasure.

These labels are known as printed labels. Information printed directly on the container of the product can also be considered as printed labeling. Printed labeling is used to identify products and to avoid counterfeiting of products and maintain credibility. They are also essential for creating brand identity and impart useful information to consumers. The global market for print labels is segregated on the basis of mechanism, type, raw material, printing technology, identification technology, end-use industry, and geography.  //www.transparencymarketresearch.com/print-labels-market.html On the basis of mechanism, the global market for print labels is segregated into pressure sensitive labeling, glue applied labeling, heat transfer, and others. Pressure sensitive labeling held the dominant market share in 2015 owing to the fuss-free technique and less chances of getting damaged. On the basis of type, the global market for print labels is segregated into branding labels, weatherproof labels, equipment asset labels, warning/security labels, and others. Warning/security labels held the dominant market share in this category in 2015 owing to   warning/security labels in end-use industries such as logistics & transportation, consumer durables, automotive, and construction among others. This segment is also forecasted to have the most rapid growth rate. On the basis of raw material, the global market is segregated into plastic/polymer labels and metal labels. Plastic/polymer label is further segmented into polyurethane (PU), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and others. Plastic/polymer label held the dominant market share in 2015 in this category. Metal label is forecasted to witness the most rapid growth rate owing to easy installation, cost effectiveness, and durability. On the basis of printing technology, the global print labels market is segregated into screen printing, digital printing, offset, flexography, and others. Digital printing held the dominant market share in 2015 due to the accurate finish and longevity of the prints. On the basis of identification technology, the global market for print labels is segregated into RFID, barcode, and others. Barcodes held the dominant market share in 2015 due to its varied uses in different end-user industries such as consumer durables, transportation & logistics, and automotives among others. On the basis of end-use industry, the global market for print labels is segregated into construction, consumer durables, automotives, transportation & logistics, and others. Transportation & logistics is forecasted to witness the most speedy growth rate over the forecast period. This is attributed to rise in warehousing & supply chain as online retailing is booming. Major drivers of the global print labels market include rise in production of consumer durable products. Compulsory use of print labels in these products is triggering overall market growth of print labels worldwide. Printed label application in the growing automotive industry is a major driver triggering overall growth of this market. Rise in raw material cost such as plastics in various forms increases overall cost of the labels which is a major restraint to the global market for print labels. Increased growth of various end-user industries in emerging countries of Asia Pacific and Middle East & Africa is a great opportunity for the growth of the overall print labels market.  //www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=18284 Geographically, the market is segregated into North   Africa, and Latin America. North America held the dominant market share in 2015 owing to larger presence of end-user industries in the region. Asia Pacific is forecasted to witness the most rapid growth rate owing to growth of various industries in emerging economies such as China, India, and Indonesia among others. Major players of the global print labels market include Dunmore (Pennsylvania, U.S.), Fuji Seal International, Inc. (Osaka, Japan), H.B.

In this scenario, your first $9,325 is taxed at 10%, the next $28,625 is taxed at 15% and the remaining $22,050 is taxed at 25%. Your entire income is not taxed at 25%, as many people mistakenly believe. The federal tax you owe is $5,226.25 plus 25% of $22,050 ($5,512.50), or $10,738,75. \nThe new tax bill will likely change the numbers for you, but the principle of working what you'll owe in taxes into your budget remains the same. \nOn top of these federal taxes, you\u2019ll also pay Social Security at a rate of 6.2% ($3,720) and Medicare at a rate of 1.45% ($870), along with any state or local taxes. ( If you're self-employed, double these numbers , though some may come back as a tax deduction.) \nYour annual $60,000 taxable income is therefore reduced by $10,738.75 in federal income tax plus $3,720 in Social Security tax and $870 in Medicare taxes, for a total tax liability of $15,328.75. That leaves you with an annual, after-tax income of $44,671.25, or $3,722.60 per month. (Learn more in Tax Withholding: Good For Government, Bad For Taxpayers .) \nNote that to have a taxable income of $60,000, you\u2019ll need to have a salary higher than that. Single tax filers for 2017 get a personal exemption of $4,050 and a standard deduction of $6,350. \nIf your employer deducts health insurance premiums or 401(k) contributions from your paycheck, your take-home pay will differ; those two expenses are taken out of your pre-tax income and reduce your income tax liability. Make Sure Your Necessities Fall Within After-Tax Income \nOnce you know how much money you bring home each month, start by listing all of your necessary expenses, like rent and utilities, and making sure their total cost is less than your take-home pay. If it isn\u2019t, can you cut back somehow? Housing expenses take up the largest chunk of most people\u2019s budgets, so that\u2019s the best place to think about reducing your expenses if you\u2019re having trouble making ends meet. \nAdding a roommate or moving out of your own place to live with your parents or rent a room from someone else aren\u2019t ideal, but the benefit of improving your finances may be worth the trade-off. A different, less-expensive living situation might even have unexpected benefits like a new friendship or the ability to save even more by sharing groceries, utility bills and household chores. \nIf you absolutely can\u2019t reduce the cost of your necessities, it\u2019s time to figure out how to earn more, which may involve both a short-term strategy such as starting a side hustle or getting a second job and a long-term strategy like furthering your education or starting a business. (To learn more, read 3 Freelance Gigs to Help You Earn More .) \nTaking this step can be difficult psychologically and practically if you\u2019ve been feeling stuck, if you\u2019re already exhausted from work and personal responsibilities, if you don\u2019t have the money to pay for school or if you have a disability that adds extra challenges to your life. In these situations, finding a new source of emotional support or life support like a mentor, coach or social group of people who share your circumstances and a desire to improve them might be the real first step you need to take to improve your finances. Also consider short-term strategies to increase your income, such getting a temporary or seasonal job or selling possessions you no longer use. (For ideas, see Increase Your Disposable Income and Start a Side Gig for Extra Cash and Fulfillment .) \nNext, start counting savings as a necessity. This mindset will make you more likely to save because you\u2019ll think of saving as a necessary \u201cexpense\u201d rather than an optional thing you do if you have money left over at the end of the month. As the saying goes, \u201cpay yourself first.\u201d Saving regularly will allow you to accumulate emergency savings, which helps keep you from going into debt when an unexpected expense comes up. It will also allow you to save for retirement and other major life goals. Even if you don\u2019t have much to save right now, opening a savings account or designating a jar in your house to put a few dollars into each month can get you going in the right direction. (Learn more in Why You Absolutely Need an Emergency Fund .) Leave Room for Occasional Expenses \nNecessary expenses like car insurance and visits to the doctor may not be monthly charges for you, but rather expenses you pay only once or twice a year. Nonetheless, you have to pay them, and you know they\u2019re coming, so don\u2019t forget to factor them into your necessities. One way to do this is to make a list of all your expenses that only occur a few times a year, add up their total cost, divide by 12, and add the result to your required monthly savings. This will ensure that you have enough cash on hand to pay these bills when they are due. \nDiscretionary expenses like gym memberships, vacations and gifts are not required and they may not occur every month or be the same amount each month. If you want to be able to afford them, you should also make a list of all optional expenses that only occur a few times a year, add up their total cost, divide that sum by 12 and add the result to your monthly savings. This way, you won\u2019t be tempted to go into debt, nor will you have to deny yourself these items \u2013 unless you see that you can\u2019t afford them, in which case you\u2019ll have to decide what you\u2019re willing to cut out. Calculate Long-Term Costs for Necessities and Nice-to-Haves \nHere\u2019s where you can play a mental game with yourself to look for more ways to save money. To figure out whether your spending in a certain category is really worth it to you, think of it in terms of a yearly rather than monthly cost. Maybe $1,700 a month for rent seems like an acceptable price, but how about $20,400 a year? And that\u2019s after tax; if your marginal tax rate is 25%, you have to earn $27,200 before tax to afford that apartment. Similarly, $300 a month for lunch with coworkers might sound reasonable, but is that how you want to spend $3,600 a year, especially if you\u2019re coming up short in other budget categories that are more important to you and you\u2019re struggling to save enough for retirement? If an expense is worth it to you and you can afford it, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s your money and you can spend it however you like.

Solicitor General Jose Calida attends a House hearing in September 2016. File photo by LeAnne Jazul/Rappler \nMANILA, Philippines \u2013 Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez on Thursday, December 7, dismissed concerns over Solicitor General Jose Calida's alleged conflict of interest should his office take over the functions of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) . \n\"It's unfair to say that [Calida] is a Marcos loyalist. If he supported [former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr] during the campaign, does that mean he's a loyalist? In fact, now, you don't hear any pronouncements from SolGen Calida supporting the Marcoses, right? He's just doing his job,\" said Alvarez in an interview with Pinky Webb on CNN Philippines. \nThe House committee on justice earlier approved a committee report seeking the abolition of the PCGG and the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC). Their functions would then be given to the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG). \nThe PCGG, created after the 1986 People Power Revolution, is tasked to get back the ill-gotten wealth of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, his family, and his cronies. \nWebb pointed out that during the 2016 elections, Calida was a supporter of President Rodrigo Duterte and former senator Marcos, who was then running for vice president. Marcos lost to Vice President Leni Robredo, a win which he is contesting. \nAlvarez had previously called the PCGG \"inutil\" or useless. (READ: What you should know about the agency hunting Marcos' ill-gotten wealth ) \n\"When [the late dictator] Marcos left, the PCGG was made. So until now, what are they doing? Haven't they recovered everything? So I think it's time it's put under the Office of the Solicitor General,\" said Alvarez. \nTransparency International estimated that Marcos and his cronies stole around $5 billion (P231.8 billion) to $10 billion (P464 billion) from 1972 to 1986 through shell corporations, real estate properties, and money in numerous offshore banks. \nAccording to the PCGG, it has recovered around P170,447,347,523.52 ($3.6 billion) since its creation. It's also working to get back P32 billion ($673 million) through 19 civil cases still pending at anti-graft court Sandiganbayan. \nAlvarez insisted that Calida is a \"decent person\" who is \"impartial.\" \nDuterte himself has pushed for the PCGG's abolition . The Marcos family had endorsed Duterte during the elections. They continue to be allies.

Bringing together the high-quality portfolios of both companies and supports opportunities for long-term growth. \n\u201cThe acquisition creates a leading pan-European platform of desirable retail and leisure destinations which are better positioned to serve the needs of our retailers, excite our customers and support our partners and communities.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "merry hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david atkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david tyler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john strachan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "merry hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hammerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brent cross", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bicester village", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trafford centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:39.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05d4a392a318927c67bc01bd1165222a1c3120ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQrj0poW.QRWEY6W8KwPuLF8qe6rE.BiFYO6.0Tp0GR3J3r3bThaW1Q4b9gQISrB79vuU3pi9ExrdjHVhjlV5Sz", "site_full": "www.boxingforum24.com", "site": "boxingforum24.com", "site_section": "https://www.boxingforum24.com/forums/british-boxing-forum.8/", "site_categories": ["boxing", "sports"], "section_title": "British Boxing Forum | Boxing News 24 Forum", "title": "Degale vs Truax | Page 2", "title_full": "Degale vs Truax | Page 2 | Boxing News 24 Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T10:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://www.boxingforum24.com/styles/faplusdark/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f9e50b098ca1722c06e7cc1f7fcc70f8c47470e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQrj0poW.QRWEY6W8KwPuLF8qe6rE.BiFYO6.0Tp0GR3J3r3bThaW1Q4b9gQISrB79vuU3pi9ExrWten4mN3UQc4xSTRZoxxsc-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Scyson", "published": "2017-12-06T17:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Cornish said: \u2191 Some fella on here a few weeks ago said he enters the Box Nation competitions for their cards and wins.

The Adamson Pep Squad set the tone for a party with their routine in this year's UAAP cheerdance competition. \nMANILA, Philippines \u2013 For one night only, Manila\u2019s San Marcelino Street became a party zone. And no, there were no seizure-inducing strobe lights nor generic techno hip-hop beats. Instead, people were dancing to the tune of The Boyfriends and VST & Co. For the millennials who are already searching Google for their identities, they were responsible for popularizing \u201cSumayaw Sumunod\u201d and \u201cAwitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko,\u201d respectively, back in the 1980s. At any other time, teenagers would have fled the scene in fear of association to such old, outdated tunes, but for one night on December 6, they unapologetically got down with the beat together with their more\u2026 age-advanced counterparts. For the Adamson University (AdU) Pep Squad, these '80s tunes were their ticket to their first-ever UAAP Cheerdance Competition Championship . On paper, that statement is a shocker, but to those who watched it live, online or on TV, they knew the happy-go-lucky, disco ball-toting upstarts had a real shot at the coveted title. Shock turned to appreciation, which in turn produced hefty rewards as the AdU administration held a Bonfire and Barbecue Party in the champions\u2019 honor. Free lechon was served and school hoodies were given away to Adamsonians who had the best cheer. Most importantly, the admin along with the AdU Sports Executive Group gave away checks for the team\u2019s use, totaling their winnings at more than half a million pesos. WINNING FORM. Another look at the historic winning form of Adamson Pep squad. ( WATCH: Netizens celebrate UAAP Cheerdance Competition 2017 on social media ) University President Fr. Marcelo Manimtim then told the crowd a story before the bonfire was lit. \u201cThe [AdU] Pep Squad looked with envy at UP and UST taking turns at the podium,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wanted to do something, not only to win medals, but to win the hearts \u2013 not only of Adamson \u2013 but of everyone watching their performance. And win hearts, they did.\u201d Fr. Manimtim then retold Rappler\u2019s own report of graduating Captain Dwyeth Vergeire and the moment during the CDC when a majority of the competing schools called for Adamson to win it all. \u201cHere was a moment of unity. Almost all the universities wanted our Pep Squad to be champions.\u201d ( IN PHOTOS: UAAP Cheer dance competition 2017 highlights ) Still, as Coach Jeremy \u201cJam\u201d Lorenzo repeatedly stated, he and his team were in total shock of the results. Nevertheless, he\u2019s now just thankful of everything that has happened. \u201c Sobrang thankful po ako sa lahat ng sumuporta po sa Pep, especially sa Adamson community, he said. (\u201cI\u2019m really thankful to all who supported Pep, especially the Adamson community\u201d) \u201cThank you po for trusting us. What to expect next year [from us] is a much faster, cleaner and fiercer Adamson Pep Squad.\u201d Although Vergeire is already exiting as Pep Squad captain, Coach Jam is just on his second year with the team.

Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.

(Western News & Info ) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Thursday, December 7, 2017, 5:12 AM \nThe co-owner of a newspaper in Arizona said he was poisoned by thallium, an odorless and tasteless heavy metal also known as \"inheritance powder.\" \nJoseph Soldwedel of The Daily Courier revealed in his own newspaper that the thallium levels in his body were 15 times higher than normal, according to lab tests. \n\u201cThe test findings are highly suggestive, but not confirmatory, of an intentional poisoning with an intent to kill,\u201d said Dr. Ernest P. Chiodo, who specializes in forensic toxicology. \nSoldwedel said he had a good idea of who was trying to poison him, but declined to name names, only going so far as to rule out his son, daughter and sister. \nPolice have opened a criminal investigation, according to the Arizona Republic . No arrests have been made. \nThallium was used as rat poison before it was banned in the U.S., although the toxin can still be found in some electronics and paints. \nThe heavy metal, which is hard to detect, has been used in murders before, according to the CDC. Chiodo also noted the substance is called \"inheritance powder\" or \"poisoner's poison.\" \nSoldwedel, who owns Western Newspapers with his family, created the paper to investigate law enforcement in Yuma County after his wife was arrested in 2000, the Phoenix New Times reported. \nHer arrest came after police found methamphetamine, marijuana and drug paraphernalia in her home, according to a police report cited by the local paper.
