But the UK is not at war with the IS network - so the same immunity is not automatically available for counter-terrorism purposes.\n\nThere has to be some other legal basis for justifying the killing.\n\nTwo years ago, the government sent a three-paragraph letter to the United Nations Security Council setting out the case for killing Cardiff extremist Reyaad Khan.\n\nThat strike was legal under the \"inherent right of self-defence\", it said, because 21-year-old had been directing \"imminent armed attacks\".\n\nMPs have pushed for more information on the decision-making process, that some critics say could amount to an unreviewable secret power to launch \"extra-judicial executions.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gavin williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reyaad khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rory stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael fallon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sally-anne jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max hill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daily mail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardiff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "independent reviewer of terrorism legislation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:52.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37053a6d07bdf43e1f000f299df90d418544c889", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlzr1oCwrvvqNvOFdF1N4FJ", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": ">gib paki gf plox xddd Fuck off they are all ugly", "title_full": "/int/ - >gib paki gf plox xddd Fuck off they are all ugly - International - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T11:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 28, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.218, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb20a5e6d1ff469f157e2b058f919375e4056da5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlzr1oCwrvvqPNqa6qO_T868GX.VPfCXqc-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>82715128\nNo they aren't.

The study is published today in The BMJ . \nMany studies have shown that certain risk factors are more common in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but determining whether these factors actually cause Alzheimer\u2019s is more difficult \nHugh Markus \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is the leading cause of dementia. Its chief hallmark is the build of \u2018plaques\u2019 and \u2018tangles\u2019 of misshapen proteins, which lead to the gradual death of brain cells. People affected by Alzheimer\u2019s experience memory and communication problems, disorientation, changes in behaviour and progressive loss of independence. \nThe causes of Alzheimer\u2019s are largely unknown, and attempts to develop drug treatments to halt or reverse its effects have been disappointing. This has led to increasing interest in whether it is possible to reduce the number of cases of Alzheimer\u2019s disease by tackling common risk factors that can be modified. In fact, research from the Cambridge Institute of Public Health has shown that the incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s is falling in the UK , probably due to improvements in education, and smoking reduction and better diet and exercise. \n\u201cMany studies have shown that certain risk factors are more common in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but determining whether these factors actually cause Alzheimer\u2019s is more difficult,\u201d says Professor Hugh Markus from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge. \n\u201cFor example, many studies have shown that the more years spent in full time education, the lower the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s. But it is difficult to unravel whether this is an effect of education improving brain function, or whether it\u2019s the case that people who are more educated tend to come from more wealthy backgrounds and therefore have a reduction in other risk factors that cause Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d \nProfessor Markus led a study to unpick these factors using a technique known as \u2018Mendelian randomisation\u2019. This involves looking at an individual\u2019s DNA and comparing genes associated with environmental risk factors \u2013 for example, genes linked to educational attainment or to smoking \u2013 and seeing which of these genes are also associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. If a gene is associated with both, then it provides strong evidence that this risk factor really does cause the disease. \nAs part of a project known as CoSTREAM , researchers studied genetic variants that increase the risk of a variety of different environmental risk factors to see if these were more common in 17,000 patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. They found the strongest association with genetic variants that predict higher educational attainment. \n\u201cThis provides further strong evidence that education is associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d says first author Dr Susanna Larsson, now based at the Karolinska Institute, Sweden. \u201c It suggests that improving education could have a significant effect on reducing the number of people who suffer from this devastating disease. \u201d \nExactly how education might reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s is uncertain. Previous studies have shown that the same amount of damage in the brain is associated with less severe and less frequent Alzheimer\u2019s in people who have received more education. One possible explanation is the idea of \u2018cognitive reserve\u2019 \u2013 the ability to recruit alternative brain networks or to use brain structures or networks not normally used to compensate for brain ageing. Evidence suggests that education helps improve brain wiring and networks and hence could increase this reserve. \nThe researchers also looked at other environmental risk factors, including smoking, vitamin D, and alcohol and coffee consumption. However, their results proved inconclusive. This may be because genes that predispose to smoking, for example, have only a very small effect on behaviour, they say. \nThe study was supported by the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme. \nReference Larsson, SC et al.

Sizes aren`t really compact, but the capacity isn`s poor.\n\u200b\nCthulhu Hastur MTL RTA parameters:\nHeight (with drip tip and pin): 57 mm;\nDiameter: 24 mm;\nCapacity: 3,5 ml;\nColor: Black, silver\u200b\nAtomizer consists of 6 parts: of base, glass tube, chamber with shaft, filling ring, top cap and 510 drip tip. All of them suits perfect without backlashes.\nThe base allows us to use only one middle-sized coil, which fixes with two screws based diagonally.\nYou can change the puff tightening and coil airflow not only with bottom airflow, but also with special changeable nozzles of 5 versions, which puts into a coil airflow shaft: 1, 1.6, 2, 2.5 and 3.5 mm. The manufacturer provides Hastur MTL RTA with additional nozzles, which you can buy separately: 1.2 mm, 1.4 mm, 2\u04451 mm \u0438 3\u04450.8 mm. I`m lucky and thanks the Cthulhu Co for the bonus: they`ve added the second version in my parcel)\n\u200b\n\u200b\nAs for bottom airflow, it regulates with 2 small holes with a really tough screwing.\nThe next part is chamber. You can see a Cthulhu on its face, who blows out huge clubs of vapor.\nIts top part gradually outgrows into a short narrow shaft with a thread, which fixes the filling ring. Such a construction affects the flavor, making it brighter.\n\u200b\nThe filling ring has two small holes for e-juice and an insert with 2 cuts from opposite sides. This is made not for beauty, but for to fix the top cap.\n\u200b\nTop cap appears as a monolithic alliance of flat deck with 2 nails and a pedestal, where we will set the drip tip.\nFor to fix such a part to filling ring, we need to combine its nails with filling ring cuts, then push it to the bottom and screw a little in any direction.\n\u200b\nBy default, with the help of 2 o-rings, an ultem 510 drip tip`s set into top cap. But if some complete nozzles and partially closed airflow \u2013 is less for you, please, use also a drip tip from the box with narrower throat.

You can name it as a a sense of taste or flair \u2013 there`s no difference.\nAnd Cthulhu Hastur MTL RTA is a bright example, which shows, that there are some really interesting MTL deviceS, which works good and do not let the user down at the right moment. It has many pros, which I appreciate and because of which, I can suggest device to people, but the inconvenient base spoils the appearance a little bit.\nAs for the price, Hastur MTL RTA costs about 28-37$, I think this is a an acceptable price.\u200b\nYou can buy Cthulhu Hastur MTL RTA here .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://vapepath.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/6-3.jpg", "http://vapepath.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/4-3.jpg", "http://vapepath.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DSC_0206.jpg", "http://vapepath.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/8-3.jpg", "http://www.cthulhumod.com/", "http://vapepath.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DSC_0227.jpg", "http://vapepath.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2-3.jpg", "http://vapepath.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1.jpg", "http://vapepath.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/9-3.jpg", "http://vapepath.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/7-3.jpg", "http://vapepath.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/10-3.jpg", "http://vapepath.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/11-2.jpg", "http://vapepath.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/1-3.jpg", "https://vapesourcing.com/cthulhu-hastur-mtl-rta.html", "http://vapepath.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5-3.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:52.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e55005418b948ec6577c07252ac5986720a6cf6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZmJZJly5Qy.6L1dUn.cjsEa", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "What do you think about Spain?", "title_full": "/int/ - What do you think about Spain?

Many I\u2019ve friended, especially in the early days of social media when we added friends simply because we knew them. In the early days of online interacting, it was like collecting baseball cards\u2014the more, the better. And often, that meant quantity over quality. \nBut as time progressed, social media evolved and it\u2019s no longer a place to simply update your status with your daily activities. It\u2019s a place to network, location check-in, have online coffee dates, connect with others over like-minded interests, promote your own business, and even find out the latest news. Every platform has its benefits and faults, and depending on which you use most frequently, you may decide that it\u2019s time to get serious. \nSo I\u2019m not sorry that I unfriended you. \nHaving always been a rule follower and someone who despises confrontation, I\u2019ve historically used Facebook to add friends and never delete them. For many years, I have been building an online presence with products I have sold, and then later as a blogger. So I wanted as many connections as possible. If you got bored with me, or my constant updating annoyed you, I would let you delete me. But I never deleted you. \nUntil recently. \nIn today\u2019s day and age, there\u2019s a lot of stuff occupying our attention, including our social media feeds. Platforms are changing and morphing, adding new features and benefits so that people can see exactly what they are interested in based on their online presence. Facebook has added many features to facilitate groups, which people were already using to find like-minded friends to have an online discussion. Now you can essentially find a group for anything you may be interested in: parenting, business, TV Shows, podcasts, you name it, there is usually a Facebook group supporting it. Our newsfeeds are no longer showing up chronologically, but rather are based on a complex system of analytics depending on your interests. Instagram has also followed suit. And when that changed, I used it as an excuse to delete accounts I was no longer interested in. Using Instagram for inspiration, I wanted to curate my feed to reflect my current interests. \nAnd that had nothing to do with whether or not you are my friend. \nEveryone is busy. So it stands to reason that we only want to see the things most important to us when we\u2019re scrolling through social media. Maybe you only have a few moments a day and you are simply interested in seeing news updates and local stories in your feed. So when I post pictures of my kids on a school field trip, I can see how that doesn\u2019t necessarily interest you. \nIt\u2019s just not personal. \nOn Facebook, however, I\u2019ve found that going through my friend\u2019s list can be a daunting task. There are people from different phases in my life that I know I will never see again, and yet, I like keeping up with them online, no matter how trivial it may seem. Somehow it makes me feel connected to that time in my life. It keeps the memories fresh. Memories that I guess I never want to lose. \nWith others, it\u2019s a geographical thing. I will probably never see those girls I used to work with who live in Texas or California again. But I am curious about their lives and how they live them. There are cultural differences between us, and even just watching them go through life in a different weather pattern is curiously interesting. So I keep them as friends. \nBut then there are people in my social media feeds that bring up feelings I don\u2019t want to deal with. Perhaps they are doing the job I used to do, and I can\u2019t help but feel bad about myself watching them continue on without me. It has nothing to do with them, and everything to do with me. Watching them in meetings together, toasting successes and smiling for the camera somehow makes me feel left out. Even though I chose to be where I am today, it still hurts. Just a little. \nAnd so I have chosen to unfriend. And I\u2019m not sorry about it. \nTen years into the social media game, it\u2019s really okay to streamline what you can see and who can see you. We are all experiencing this wave of social media innovation for the first time, and so I find it interesting to see how we have evolved in our online behaviours. Recently I saw a Facebook friend at the grocery store, and she looked right at me and walked past me. Call me old school, but if we\u2019re friends online, aren\u2019t we friends in real life? \nPerhaps it\u2019s time to unfriend a few more. \nThis post originally appeared on UrbanMoms .
