Humphreys did not attend Tuesday's regularly scheduled regents meeting in Oklahoma City, where about 100 protesters showed up asking for him to resign. Humphreys told the Associated Press in an email Tuesday he didn't mean to compare homosexuality with pedophilia and apologized for his \"lack of clarity.\" \nSHAWNEE, Okla. (AP) - An Oklahoma judge has dismissed a lawsuit to re-examine the case of a woman who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for failing to report that her boyfriend abused her children. The boyfriend served two years. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a petition calling 33-year-old Tondalao Hall's sentence disproportionate. Pottawatomie County District Judge John Canavan on Tuesday rejected the petition, saying it was filed in the wrong county. The ACLU says it will file a new petition. \nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - The Oklahoma State Board of Health has fired internal auditor Jay Holland as director of the Office of Accountability Systems. The board voted Tuesday to dismiss Holland, who was placed on leave following the resignation of Terry Cline as health commissioner amid what the board called financial mismanagement. Board spokesman Tony Sellars referred questions to the state attorney general's office, where spokeswoman Terri Watkins declined comment. \nMUSKOGEE, Okla. (AP) - A federal appeals court has revived an Oklahoma prison inmate's lawsuit alleging conditions at a state prison violated his constitutional rights. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals issued the ruling Tuesday in a lawsuit by Joseph Womble. Womble's lawsuit alleges temperatures in his cell at the Mack Alford Correctional Center in Stringtown exceeded 90 degrees 15 times in June 2016, causing him to become dehydrated. A prisons spokesman says the agency doesn't comment on pending litigation. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

The present study describes a two-step synthesis for the cobalt complex of tetra-2,3-(5,6-di- tert -butyl-pyrazino) porphyrazine ( t Bu-TPyzPzCo) starting from pivalil, 2,3-diaminomaleonitrile, metal salts, and urea. The product was ultrasonically impregnated onto carbon black (CB), wherein particle electrodes ( t Bu-TpyzPzCo/CB) were employed for the degradation of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) in a three-dimensional electrocatalytic system under xenon lamp. HPAM exhibited more efficient degradation in the presence of a supporting catalyst using the photoelectrocatalytic process than by photocatalytic or electrocatalytic oxidation or even the sum of the two in saline water. The effects of HPAM degradation on various parameters in the photoelectrocatalytic reactor, such as the catalyst dosage, following the application of a cell voltage and an electrolyte were investigated in detail. Hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals were determined as the main active species in the reaction. The reaction mechanism was also discussed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "p. r china d college of chemical", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shandong university of science and technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hpam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "p. r. china c qingdao technical college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china national petroleum corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china university of petroleum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "changjiang west road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qingdao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qianwangang road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qiantangjiang road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huangdao district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dongzhimen north street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dongcheng district", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:36.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba5b58d0e2fb5f0131e85dc12f58484c18666fc2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qqruij56f9CTtCE2q778.OkgCrhYZqADvaAVPv3vr8gy4GaxpRS_Z17me8N2wPigASNjzFbp2_gpSRie0hLDuUjyn6RTnxTO0vZEtI.HhnvGwZLmhYC.S_vLh99y2sA.VbHhB.idyEMJyruNed2vh", "site_full": "www.pressreleasepoint.com", "site": "pressreleasepoint.com", "site_section": "http://pressreleasepoint.com//prpage/all/feed", "site_categories": ["education", "business"], "section_title": "Latest Press Release", "title": "Dolter and Rivers - Connecting Canada with New High-Voltage Direct Current Transmission Lines", "title_full": "Dolter and Rivers - Connecting Canada with New High-Voltage Direct Current Transmission Lines", "published": "2017-12-07T09:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 60870, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba5b58d0e2fb5f0131e85dc12f58484c18666fc2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qqruij56f9CTtCE2q778.OkgCrhYZqADvaAVPv3vr8gy4GaxpRS_Z17me8N2wPigASNjzFbp2_gpSRie0hLDuUjyn6RTnxTO0vZEtI.HhnvGwZLmhYC.S_vLh99y2sA.VbHhB.idyEMJyruNed2vh", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CD Howe", "published": "2017-12-07T09:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "Dolter and Rivers - Connecting Canada with New High-Voltage Direct Current Transmission Lines", "text": "To: Canadian electricity system planners and government leaders \nFrom: Brett Dolter and Nicholas Rivers \nDate: December 7, 2017 \nRe : Connecting Canada with New High-Voltage Direct Current Transmission Lines \nCanada has one of the cleanest electricity sectors in the world. In 2014, Canada generated 78.4 percent of its electricity using low-carbon technologies such as hydropower plants (60.3 percent), nuclear power plants (16.2 percent), and wind turbines (1.8 percent). \nIn the light of the Paris Agreement on climate change, our clean electricity sector is a competitive advantage. With clean electricity, we can work to electrify everything from transportation to steelmaking and eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from our energy system. \nCanada\u2019s clean electricity advantage is not spread equally across the country. Power plants fuelled by coal and natural gas are still important sources of generation in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. \nFortunately, Canadians are known for being good neighbours. In Canada, we can think regionally and connect all of the provinces to our clean electricity advantage. \nOur recent paper looked at the cost of eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from the Canadian electricity system. We find that strategic investments in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines would allow us to get to zero emissions for a lower cost. \nThis is because the provinces that rely on coal and natural gas fuelled power plants are located beside provinces with hydroelectric power capacity. Connecting to this hydroelectric capacity has two advantages. \nFirst, neighbouring hydroelectric facilities provide a source of clean electrons. Provinces such as Quebec have spare capacity that can be used to supply neighbours in Ontario and New Brunswick. \nSecond, many of Canada\u2019s hydroelectric facilities have reservoirs that act as a giant battery. These giant batteries can help balance the variability of renewable energy sources like wind turbines and solar photovoltaic facilities. When the wind is blowing in southern Saskatchewan it can provide electricity to homes and businesses within the province. When it is not windy, an enhanced connection to Manitoba\u2019s hydroelectric system could provide backup power. \nWith the cost of wind turbines at an all-time low, this wind + hydro mix offers a cost-effective way to move away from coal and natural gas fired electricity. \nBuilding new transmission lines is not cheap. Manitoba's Bipole III transmission project will cost $5 billion for an additional 2000 MW of transmission capacity. \nInvestments in new transmission offer a payback by lowering the cost of getting to a zero-emissions electricity sector in Canada. Even in scenarios where new HVDC transmission lines are three times as expensive as Manitoba's Bipole III connector, our model recommends a 450 MW connection from Manitoba to Saskatchewan, a 1,300 MW connection from Saskatchewan to Alberta, and a 2,100 MW connection from Alberta to British Columbia. \nWe propose that new HVDC transmission connections are a worthy nation-building project for Canada. They promise to connect Canadians to our clean electricity advantage, allow for the integration of new wind facilities, and lower the cost of getting to a zero emissions future. Now, what\u2019s needed, is the willingness to co-operate and coordinate electricity trade across provincial borders.

Very clean and he even properly relieved the action screw holes, from the looks of it. Like you said, it won't take much to color it in with a sharpie. Black or brown, take your pick. The real proof in the pudding will be in how she shoots though. One of my questions is, did he make sure your barrel is centered down the barrel channel and does it have enough free float? Guys also need to keep in mind, this is a newer model 70, not quite a collectors piece yet: Maybe in another 50 years, it will hit that status. I glass bed all of my rifles, as I have no collectors, just shooters. When they are shooters, that's exactly what I expect out of them and they don't get that way unless they are properly glass bedded. Good luck with your rifle and I hope it shoots well...\nOriginally Posted by raybass I try to stick with the basics, they do so well.

My house is only a few minutes from the bay, and that is where I do most of my fishing. my buddy lives on the bay and has a nice pier that runs out into a large oyster bed in about 4' of water. We catch a ton of trout, redfish, croaker, sand trout there, with the occasional sheepshead. If I'm feeling adventurous, I get out my kayak. I've got a wilderness ride 135. It's big, but stable and moves pretty good.\nFrom the time I was old enough to remember, my dad had me out fishing. He was a serious angler back then, fishing a lot of big tournaments in the 80s (all fresh water, bass tourneys). We always fished fresh until I was around 12 or so and he traded the bass boat for a center console bay boat. Once we started on the salt, we rarely went back fresh water fishing. When he sold our land (had 2 stocked ponds) and the boat in '00, I quit fishing. A couple of years ago, i went on a whim with my buddy and was instantly hooked again.\nAfter I bought my kayak, I started getting back into bass fishing again. as much as I love a good spec or red, there is just some good nostalgia with bass. Typically, I also find the scenery better on/around fresh water. I stick to the bayou mostly. Lately, I've been stopping at Sheldon Reservoir just outside of Houston on my way home from work catching bass for a couple hours (I'm working nights, so no interruptions in family time). I am planning to get my yak out there soon. I hear it is absolutely beautiful when you get away from the road.\nI dont have a ton of pics of the fish I've caught, but here's a few. First is a red. It was about 23\" if memory serves me. Reds are some fighters, a lot of fun to catch. Next is a golf course bass (never kept them). before the course shut down, they started letting us fish the ponds. Last fish is a bass I caught at the reservoir. This bass and the golf course bass are the same species (largemouth bass). I've caught bass my entire life and have never seen one that dark. My theory is adaptation to the surroundings. The water is quite dark, and I think it is just natures camouflage.\nThe last pic is my kayak. It's currently hanging from the rafters in my garage, and the last time it got used was surveying flood damage in the wake of Harvey. I plan to change that soon.\nSorry for the novel.

It also provides opportunities to get involved in activities that make a direct and real contribution to the community. \nGroup companies encourage and support voluntary activities and projects year round, but make a special effort during CSR Month. December 5 is International Volunteer Day, a UN-designated event that encourages organizations and individuals to shine a light on their activities. Toshiba Group organizes special events on and around this date, to reinforce a long-standing support for volunteerism, and to invite the involvement of as many of the Group\u2019s employees as possible. \nThis year\u2019s activities include a month-long food drive at Toshiba Group facilities in support of food banks. An event to promote the drive featured guest speaker Nana Takamatsu, a Japanese self-described \u201cComedian Journalist\u201d, who spoke on Sustainable Development Goals, the 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all defined by the United Nations as a sustainable development agenda. This was followed by a dialogue on CSR between Ms. Takamatsu and Satoshi Tsunakawa, Toshiba\u2019s President & CEO. \nOther events include hands-on volunteering and clean-up at the Minamisoma Solar Agri Park in Fukushima. Established by an NGO that focuses on empowering the younger generation in Fukushima, Minami Solar Agri Park is a solar power plant with plant factory that provides a hands-on introduction to clean power generation. Toshiba has supported the project since its inception. \nOther local activities will take place around the world, including the following. Africa : Personnel of Toshiba Africa (Pty) Ltd will visit high schools focusing on training students in mathematics and science and give lectures to motivate them. The company will also donate money to rent containers to be used as classrooms. China : Toshiba Group companies collect clothes and books from employees to donate them to elementary schools through an NGO. US : Toshiba Group companies are carrying out holiday toy, food, and hygiene kit drives to benefit underprivileged children and homeless people living in shelters.

To overcome this issue, electrocatalysts are sought, which need to be an alternative to expensive and unsustainable metallic catalysts. Herein we report the synthesis of nitrogen doped nanoporous graphene (NPG), which is a competitive alternative to currently employed metallic catalysts. The NPG is synthesised through a chemical vapour deposition methodology followed by a chemical functionalization step introducing oxygen functional groups (carbonyl and hydroxyl groups), which is then doped with nitrogen via ortho -phenylenediamine (OPDA). The NPG is physiochemically and electrochemically characterised. The NPG demonstrates outstanding electrocatalytic activity towards the ORR in alkaline media proceeding via a favourable 4-electron pathway and is comparable to commercially available platinum\u2013carbon (20%). We demonstrate that the electrochemical activity of the NPG is tailorable such that through increased nitrogen doping the ORR transforms from a 2-electron process to that of the favourable 4-electron process via increasing the proportion of pyridinic nitrogen while the content of graphitic nitrogen remains almost constant. The NPG exhibits excellent electrochemical performance towards the ORR in alkaline media, long-term stability and appropriate methanol crossover as benchmarked to commercialised Pt/C electrodes; this outstanding electrocatalytic activity is related to the high proportion of defects, high porosity and (pyridinic) doping.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "manche", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "manchester fuel cell innovation centre", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "manchester metropolitan university", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "npg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chester street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:37.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ec135952ba5372c40f6a4b0085c770f02e7f7e76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1Fjad4h8wJCkFjO7AdYchZr", "site_full": "www.ozbargain.com.au", "site": "ozbargain.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.ozbargain.com.au/forum/30", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Automotive: Discussion Forum -

\nPopular Nollywood actress, Joke Jacobs, has revealed the most intimate secret of her fifty-six year old existence in Lagos. \nWait for it! Joke Jacobs was an adopted child. \nShe was adopted by the late E.A. Silva, a lawyer, and his late wife, Abimbola Silva, who was the third Nigerian woman to qualify as a medical doctor. She died in July 2015. \nMrs Jacobs, who had starred in many television programmes said she was adopted from a foster home ran by the Red Cross at Yaba, Lagos. \nShe revealed the closely-guarded family secret at the first Annual Conference of Heritage Adoption Support and Advocacy Group, which held at Federal Palace Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos. \nPresent at the occasion was the wife of the Vice President, Dolapo Osinbajo. \nNarrating her childhood experience, Mrs. Jacobs said: \u201cLiving in a foster home of the Red Cross in Yaba, Lagos, Everybody would be calling me whenever my adopted mum (Dr. Silva) came with cakes and a lot of things during her visit. I went to YWCA Nursery, which was not too far from the Silva\u2019s home in Yaba. I also have memories of moving in with them when they moved to Glover Road in Ikoyi. \n\u201cI remember reading newspapers to my Dad in our sitting room and pronouncing Brig-General Aguyi Ironsi, the then Nigeria Head Of State, \u2018Agolo Iresi!\u2019 My father could not stop laughing at my hilarious interpretation of the newspaper. Also, I remember making them proud, when performing at St. Saviour School. My parents would be standing and were congratulated by other parents too for my acting skills. My parents were so excited that this child was incredibly talented. \n\u201cI remembered going out with my cousin and we met a big cousin. She introduced me as \u2018my cousin\u2019s daughter and this is Dr Silva\u2019s daughter.\u2019 Then, the older cousin was like, \u2018Dr. Silva ke? Se Doctor Silva bimo ni? (Meaning does Dr. Silva have a child?). Did Dr Silva ever have a child? \n\u201cI was so confused and when I got home I told my mum, \u2018I met this lady that says you never had a child.\u2019 My mum froze and she said, \u2018don\u2019t mind them, they are used to rubbish talk.\u2019 \n\u201cBut I got to know years later when I wanted to travel and was looking for my passport where my mum kept it. Since she was not around, I opened the box in her absence and I saw my adoption papers. I never discussed it with my mum because I felt it was something that would hurt her that was why, it was kept secret from me.\u201d \nThe actress also revealed that she was protected in the Silva\u2019s family will. \n\u201cEven in their wills, I was well protected. My daddy, being a lawyer said in his will, that all his children, both adopted and biological should be treated equally. I was not stressed in anyway. We were all well taken care of till my mum died at the age of 89. \n\u201cAt 56, I still miss her but I know she has definitely gone back to her father. On her sick bed, I always sang her favorite tunes, she would be imputing the melodious tunes and she died singing to her Lord. She had prepared her family before my coming into her life because I had an incredible big Silva family. \n\u201cI have a very big family I am the first daughter, I carried the responsibility of a first daughter. Everybody in my family cannot take any decision until sister Joke has come. I can\u2019t call my parents, adopted parents. They are my parents.\u201d \nIn his remarks, the HASSAG founder, Ituah Ighodalo, said his foundation aims at changing the negative perception of adoption in the society and render support to prospective adopters, adoptive parents and adoptees. \nAccording to him, adoption is the solution to the growing problem of abandoned and vulnerable children in the society. The process will help make thousands of homeless children to be settled in loving homes. \n\u201cAdoption would depopulate our streets of children who can easily fall prey to all kinds of vices and become criminals and ultimately a threat to the society. Adoption transforms the lives of both childless couples and adopted children. Through adoption, loving and caring parents are able to fulfill a lifelong desire of having their own child.
