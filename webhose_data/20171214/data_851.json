Their plan was to have a store that specialized in local and sustainable agricultural products for city dwellers. After moving to Oregon in 2014, their business dreams finally started to take root. The Store In July, the couple opened Urban Ag Supply in a small space in downtown Albany, where they sell everything from soil amendments to hydroponic supplies, and books with an ecological tilt. Selling only local and environmentally friendly products, the purpose of the store, according to Sara, is to be a \u201ccommunity garden hub\u201d for Albany and the surrounding area. Perusing the shelves, there are bags and bottles with funny-sounding names like \u201cdiatomaceous earth and nectar of the gods.\u201d There are, of course, supplies for emerging urban farmers, backyard chicken handlers, beekeepers, urban plot gardeners, and hobby farmers. They\u2019ve even garnered some small business from pot harvesters, possibly because of their assortment of grow lamps. Gifts abound at Urban Ag Supply for the holidays, or for any time of year. The store focuses exclusively on small, handcrafted products and locally made artwork. Shoppers can browse a healthy collection of instructional books, selected per customer requests on the company\u2019s Facebook page, that span the topics of urban agriculture and ecologically conscious living. Sara explains that they\u2019ve always had an interest in supporting local businesses, the farmers market, and handmade goods. The shop was an opportunity to offer these products to the public. Most importantly, they wanted to bring back the \u201cjoy of going to work.\u201d Sara, Patrick, and their 20-year-old son, Nick, all take turns tending the shop. They recently bought a house down the street, and can now walk easily to and from work. Over the summer, the couple signed a lease with R&R Enterprises to rent and renovate their small space. Located along Ellsworth Street \u2013 one of the two main drags running through downtown Albany \u2013 the store has huge visibility in an area that has seen a recent resurgence in small shops. Logistics, Goals Running a small, locally owned store is not an easy task. Brick and mortar stores rely on foot traffic and visibility. Events sponsored by the Albany Downtown Association can help bring people to downtown. The soon-to-be-completed streetscape improvements might also lend a hand. But mainly, the Chonaiew family and their business rely on people that are proactive when it comes to shopping locally. Sara and Patrick are not too worried about online shopping dipping into their sales figures. Instead, they look forward to the influx of business activity and new residents that have come to Albany in recent years. More than a store, the Chonaiew\u2019s hope to turn their business into an educational venue. They\u2019re busy planning outreach classes for the spring, possibly taught by volunteer Master Gardeners or County Extension workers. Some classes may be offered for free, while others might charge a small fee. For now, pay the family a visit in downtown Albany, and consider investing in their dream of more sustainable, locally-focused urbanization and agriculture. Urban Ag Supply is located at 124 SW Ellsworth Street in Albany, Oregon. Opening hours are Tuesday through Saturday , 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Visit them online at urbanagsupply.com or reach them by phone at 541-497-2988 .

Disease classification and methods of diagnosis are also provided. \nDermatology is a highly diverse therapy area that deals with diseases of the skin, hair and nails. Over 3,000 types of dermatological conditions are thought to exist, ranging from the autoimmune disorder psoriasis to the very common condition acne vulgaris. The scope of dermatological disorders is diverse in terms of severity and clinical presentation, and if a condition is not sufficiently kept under control, it can significantly impair the patient's quality of life. For example, patients with severe atopic dermatitis (the most common form of eczema) may experience mobility impairments and debilitating itching, which may interfere with daily activities. Furthermore, most dermatological conditions are visible, and as such can have a profound impact on patient confidence. There are 850 products in the dermatology pipeline with a disclosed stage of development, but the majority of these drugs are at an early stage of development. Some 42% of the pipeline is in the Preclinical stage, while 14% is in the discovery stage. However, 32% of the pipeline is in clinical development, but only 3% are in the Pre-registration stage and less than half are novel.Four drugs that were approved for psoriasis are Cosentyx, Otezla, Eucrisa and Taltz. The most notable of the four are Cosentyx and Otezla, which were approved in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are forecast to generate $3.8 billion and $2.7 billion from the therapy area in 2023, respectively. The two most recently approved psoriasis treatments, Taltz and Eucrisa, are not expected to achieve the same level of commercial success as Cosentyx or Otezla because they are entering a market that is already saturated with entrenched competitors that have reduced the level of unmet need.Dermatology therapy area is dominated by top 20 pharma companies. In 2016 the most commercially successful companies in the therapy area were Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Amgen, Novartis and Pfizer. Across the forecast period these companies will continue to generate high revenue, but the companies will all see their market shares change. In depth, this report provides the following: Provides an overview of the dermatology marketed products landscape, including product profiles of key marketed products and revenue projections for each of these drugs. Analyzes the dermatology pipeline, detailing, among other parameters, drug distribution by stage of development, molecule type and molecular target, plus an analysis of the key indications in the pipeline: atopic dermatitis, acne vulgaris and psoriasis. Presents forecast projections to 2022 on a global level, with forecasts provided for the US, plus aggregate revenue forecasts of the top five EU markets (the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and Japan. Additionally, revenue forecasts for the major product categories and key players are provided. Assesses the company landscape in dermatology, with an analysis of the key players, the types of company involved in this therapy area, and whether this therapy area composes a large proportion of each company's pipeline portfolio and total revenues. \nScope: Global revenue from the dermatology market is forecast to increase from $19.8 billion in 2016 to $36.6 billion in 2023, at a compound annual growth rate of 9.13%. Which drugs will achieve blockbuster status and how will the key player companies perform during the forecast period? What are the leading companies in terms of market share? Which companies are forecast to experience the largest growth in market share? Which companies rely heavily on revenue derived from antibacterial drugs? How will the market respond to recent approvals? Will generics and biosimilars have a significant impact on the market over the forecast period? What class of drugs dominate the market? What molecular targets are most popular in the pipeline? What are the commercial prospects for the most promising late-stage products? \nKey Topics Covered:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "epidemiolo", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "eucrisa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taltz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "otezla", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cosentyx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interleukin receptor inhibitors for psoriasis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amgen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson & johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pfizer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novartis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eucrisa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "otezla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:18.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "43d212c3a9fb896cfe2d2498ed341e9be1b4e9b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSttB_hD1IIFV0WQfwfOfgB_D4fap..jCFJxXwUoIX3Sp9_0wiqBhfsQkddCUgFbxAQIO5_ejRaBxkWZSEKA_pTuuYKyxQf._0Kh.2HHCuvFiVYaaVsvp5Wg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/IOTA", "title": "The thing on every IOTA HODLR\u2019s mind is when can we get our official wallet?

A 3D ventral view of Protasterina flexuosa. \nThe fossil, a specimen of Protasterina flexuosa , is a brittle star that is some 450 million years old. Brittle stars, sea stars, and sea urchins all have an internal system of fluid-filled canals connected to an external system of tube feet. This water vascular system is a unique feature that distinguishes these animals, called echinoderms, from all other animals. \n\u201c This fossil brittle star is remarkable as one of a very few to preserve direct evidence of the soft tissues of the canals and tube feet. However, we found no evidence in the fossil of specialized muscles along the canals used by modern brittle stars to regulate pressure in their tube feet,\u201d said Elizabeth Clark, a Yale graduate student in paleobiology and first author of a study in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters. \n\u201c Our results suggest that these specialized muscles might have evolved after the evolution of symmetrical paired tube feet along the length of the arm,\u201d Clark said. \nCo-authors of the study are Bhart-Anjan Bhullar and Derek Briggs of Yale and Simon Darroch of Vanderbilt University. \n\u201c In living forms the tube feet are arranged in pairs along each arm and controlled by a series of muscular sphincters along the radial canal to which they are attached. This Ordovician brittle star differs in that the canal zig-zags and the tube feet are not paired but offset, and there is no evidence of sphincters,\u201d said Briggs, Yale\u2019s G. Evelyn Hutchinson Professor of Geology and Geophysics and curator at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History. \u201cThey were probably controlled individually by muscles in the tube feet and in short lateral branches that connect them to the radial canal.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhart-anjan bhullar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derek briggs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon darroch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g. evelyn hutchinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "briggs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth clark", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "posted today  yale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal society journal biology letters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yale peabody museum of natural history", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanderbilt university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:18.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3315c46bc9914f5054428330330a0b212e88097e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8t.wkdSsM4bMjimqwEbNUx7GO_ddMlqZ8s2VcZFba05YVROc6OPNS9EKyR8i2xOsk-", "site_full": "www.corvallisadvocate.com", "site": "corvallisadvocate.com", "site_section": "http://www.corvallisadvocate.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Corvallis Advocate", "title": "8 Days a Week\u2026", "title_full": "8 Days a Week\u2026", "published": "2017-12-07T07:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.corvallisadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3315c46bc9914f5054428330330a0b212e88097e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8t.wkdSsM4bMjimqwEbNUx7GO_ddMlqZ8s2VcZFba05YVROc6OPNS9EKyR8i2xOsk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Corvallis Advocate", "published": "2017-12-07T07:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "8 Days a Week\u2026", "text": "Thursday, December 7 \nMovie Showing \u2013 Elf.

Her two eldest made each other laugh as they shared a pack of Nerds; the youngest was in Harrison\u2019s arms for most of the interview, reaching for anything she could grab \u2013 including her mother\u2019s hair. But Harrison didn\u2019t skip a beat as she explained the impetus behind Kanaine. Kanaine began as a response to being a new mother, and Harrison still needing something else to keep her busy. Inspired by hardworking parents, Harrison loves to push herself further \u2013 as a mother, graduate student, and as the founder and creator of clothing inspired by her own Native American roots. Keeping Herself Busy Harrison grew up on the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, with her enrollment at Yakama Nation in Washington state. She describes moving to Corvallis as a huge culture shock. \u201cI went all the way through [school] with some kids that I\u2019m still friends with now, so coming here right after that was a very big difference. I struggled when I very first came here,\u201d she says. She left Oregon State University her junior year, accepting an internship and eventually a full-time job doing cultural resource management and consulting at the Hanford Site in Washington. After working there for five years, Harrison decided it was time to return to OSU. She finished two undergraduate degrees \u2013 one in public health and the other in anthropology \u2013 and then quickly entered the public health master\u2019s program, never wanting to sit still for too long. \u201cI picked a broad master\u2019s program purposefully because I like to be busy. I like to take on different projects, and I can\u2019t do the same thing all the time,\u201d says Harrison. Between having three kids, finishing school, and working a fast-paced job, Harrison still found time to become a creative and talented seamstress. From Consultant to Clothing Designer Sewing started out as a hobby, something to keep Harrison busy as she adjusted to life as a new mom. She kept things simple at first, making square bags and learning how to follow a pattern using YouTube. Harrison had already been using wool from Pendleton Woolen Mills when her father shared something extraordinary with her. \u201c[My mother] passed away when I was three, but she had made me a little jacket similar to the ones that I make, out of a blanket. I didn\u2019t know about this blanket until years and years down the road. I had been sewing some things and my dad finally shared it with me, so that was a neat connection that I had,\u201d Harrison said. Harrison\u2019s mother was many things. She was an athlete and artist, and, like her daughter, she was also an entrepreneur and clothing maker. Her parents started a construction business before Harrison was born, picking mushrooms in the Blue Mountains and selling them to finance their new endeavor. \u201cI always liked that story,\u201d says Harrison. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of where I built my work ethic\u2026I don\u2019t really have a need for rest. I like to be busy, and I like to be doing things all the time.\u201d Her shop Kanaine \u2013 inspired by the ridge she grew up on \u2013 has gained popularity through word of mouth. Most of her sales come from Pendleton, from people she grew up with or who knew her family growing up. A lot of work is custom-ordered, including coats and purses, but she started making cowls more frequently. Having her products featured in the October issue of Cowboys and Indians Magazine was definitely a boost. While people have repurposed Pendleton wool before Harrison, she wants to push her designs further. She\u2019d like to create something for people who aren\u2019t what she calls \u201cWestern-y\u201d \u2013 people who may not have that Western vibe or be on their way to a rodeo. She wants her clothing to be for everyone. Sharing Her Culture I asked Harrison how she felt about people wearing her designs, modeling part of a culture that isn\u2019t theirs. While she has feelings about it, Harrison tries not to go too deeply into this idea of cultural appropriation. Using Pendleton wool is something she thinks about, though. \u201cPart of using Pendleton is they use tribal names, but I can\u2019t use their name. So, part of me is like, hey, but you got this from me. I follow the rules, but I have more of a sense of ownership and pride,\u201d she says. \u201cMy dad is also Korean and was adopted from Korea in 1960, so I\u2019ve had plans and more of a desire to incorporate some of that side, though I know very little about it\u2026But I think that\u2019s also another thing that makes me feel more like sharing because I am multicultural, not just an Indian,\u201d Harrison added. When it comes to wearing this Native American inspired clothing, Harrison sees it as a celebration. She chooses to view things positively, to be on the other side of the argument. So, be bold and think about adding some Kanaine to your wardrobe. Harrison would love to see a little more Pendleton in Corvallis. Harrison is currently working on her new website: www.kanaine.com . For now, you can find her creations at her Etsy shop: www.etsy.com/shop/kanaine .

A month ago, IOTA, a coin for Internet of Things (IoT) transactions, was priced at $0.35 per pop and had a market valuation of less than one billion dollars. (See also: Bitcoin Price Continues To Fall As Other Cryptocurrencies Gain .) At 21:09 UTC Wednesday, it was trading at $4.17 and had a total market capitalization of $11.6 billion. This past week, IOTA overtook Ripple to become the world\u2019s fourth most-traded cryptocurrency. In a CNBC interview, IOTA's co-founder David Sonstebo described it as a \u201csleeping giant.\" (See also: 3 Obscure Cryptocurrencies To Watch .) Here is a brief primer on IOTA. What Is IOTA? In a blog post discussing IOTA\u2019s road map, David Sonstebo, co-founder of cryptocurrency, wrote that it was developed to enable the \u201cparadigm shift\u201d to the Internet of Things by establishing a \u201cde facto standardized \u201cLedger of Everything.\u201d Simply put, this means the cryptocurrency will enable data exchange between sensor-equipped machines that populate the Internet of Things. IOTA does not use the traditional blockchain design used by most cryptocurrencies. Instead, it has developed a new platform called Tangle, which uses a mathematical concept known as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG). For its own transaction to be valid, each node in a DAG Tangle must approve two previous transactions at other node. This has two consequences. First, it removes \u201cminers\u201d as entities to validate transactions, thereby removing a possible bottleneck when transaction speed and numbers are high. Second, the network\u2019s growth and speed becomes directly proportional to the numbers of its users. IOTA also does not have transaction fees and claims to have solved scaling problems, such as network delays due to block congestion, related to bitcoin. IOTA use is expected to simplify transactions and processes involving objects that have sensors. A simple use case is that of an IOTA-enabled vending machine, which can dispense soda without the associated transaction costs and latency of bitcoin. A more advanced use case is illustrated in this Reddit chain. For example, you might be able to scan the code at the bottom of your milk carton and have it delivered to your door from Amazon using IOTA funds. Again, this is not possible with bitcoin because of its high transaction costs and network delays. What Caused the Recent Spike in IOTA\u2019s Valuation? According to consultancy firm Bain, the IoT market is expected to be worth $470 billion by 2020. Through IOTA Foundation, the German nonprofit behind the cryptocurrency, IOTA is an early mover in this space. It has already partnered with companies which will play a leading role in IoT, such as Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO ) and Samsung Electronics Ltd. ( SSNLF ), to create a data marketplace that can be monetized later. IOTA has also partnered with Innogy, an energy company. \u201cWe can expect that a machine will be able to pay its assembly, its maintenance, its energy and also for its liability insurance by giving data, computing power, storage or physical services to other machines,\u201d said Kerstin Eichmann of Innogy. The network effect of these partnerships is expected to popularize IOTA and nanotransactions on its platform. At the end of 2016, IOTA claimed to have processed more than 3 million transactions on its platform. What\u2019s The Catch? The Internet of Things is a glamorous buzzword but it might be a while before a sensor-filled future of machines becomes a reality. Also, IOTA is a technology under development and is still improving flaws in its protocol. For example, the MIT Media Lab recently uncovered a security problem with Tangle. According to the MIT team, the IOTA protocol\u2019s hash function, Curl, produced collisions or a situation where different inputs hash pointed to the same output. \u201cOnce we developed our attack, we could find collisions using commodity hardware within just a few minutes, and forge signatures on IOTA payments,\u201d Neha Narula, director of MIT\u2019s Digital Cryptocurrency Initiative, wrote . IOTA later rectified the problem. The cryptocurrency\u2019s adoption rates could also be stymied if players within the IoT and ecommerce ecosystem, such as Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ), develop their own cryptocurrencies or form their own separate alliances for data sharing.

Gluing together brownish-yellow macaroni noodles to make trees, painting hands and making handprint wreaths \u2013 those were the days. As adults, some of us try to emulate those nostalgic DIY gifts, either for heartfelt or low-cost motives, but how many of them are happily received? To help avoid awkward moments this season, we have compiled a surefire do-it-yourself list that will make the receiver smile instead of cringe. Personal Grooming Gifts When buying anything for the holidays, think local. The money stays in the community and you get a great product. For the essential oils in this category, check out Funke Essential Oils at 1402 SE Kiger Island Drive in Corvallis. Learn about their farm, how they make their products, and find the best oils for your friends. Beard Oil Beards are all the rage, especially with no-shave November giving guys everywhere a reason to grow out their facial hair. So, why not give them some masculine beard oil to tame that new mane? Instead of spending a veritable fortune on oil at the store, it only takes a few minutes and a handful of ingredients to make an oily gift for someone. The recipe requires essential oils, a funnel to pour the mixture, and a small bottle that you could easily find at a thrift store. Go to beardoilrecipes.com for some great ideas, including a DIY article about oils you can make at home. Hand-Crafted Soap What better gift than soap, something that most people use every day. There are four ways to make soap, but if this is your first time, depending on how adventurous you are feeling, stick with melt and pour, or the cold process. With the former, you buy premade soap in the form of glycerin or otherwise, melt it down, and add your own essential oils for scent. The cold method involves the chemical process of mixing fat oils and lye to make the soap from scratch. If you want something fast and thoughtful, melt and pour may be best. However, if you would like complete control over your ingredients, use the cold process. For whichever process you choose, you\u2019ll need a mold, base ingredients, scents, and any additives for the soap blocks. For more instructions, go to thespruce.com and search, \u201chow to make soap.\u201d Hand Scrub One of the easiest DIY gifts is a good hand scrub to smooth out rough and dry winter hands. All you need is coconut oil, sea salt \u2013 some people use sugar instead \u2013 the essential oil of your choice, and a glass jar. Go to thekitchn.com and search for \u201cexfoliating hand scrub\u201d for a great recipe that anyone can make. Food and Drink Gifts Vanilla Anyone who bakes will use vanilla, and homemade vanilla is substantially tastier than store-bought, brand-name extracts that often have multiple artificial ingredients. All you need is a glass jar, one to seven vanilla beans, and the leftover vodka from the holiday party you just hosted. Bourbon, rum, and brandy all work too, as long as the alcohol source you use is 35 percent alcohol or 70 proof. Also, try to get fresh vanilla beans, they are available at the local Alternative Co-op in the refrigerated bulk section. The one trick with vanilla is that it needs to sit at least eight weeks. Luckily, whoever you\u2019re giving it to will likely be so fed up with baking after the holidays that it will take them until Valentine\u2019s Day to break out the vanilla anyway. For the recipe and instructions, go to beanilla.com and search, \u201chomemade vanilla extract.\u201d Beverage-Based Basket This gift is a catch-all and can be easily modified for any recipient. It is also very easy to make. Grab a basket or tin from a local thrift store, wrap some ribbon around it, and maybe use some festive cloth or paper within the basket. Choose a theme, for instance a holiday theme could include homemade gingerbread cookies, loose-leaf spice chai tea from Oregon Coffee and Tea, and a small bottle of cinnamon-flavored liqueur. If the person loves coffee, grab a bag of locally roasted beans, include a small bottle of Irish cream liqueur, and a jar of crushed peppermints. Also consider what else that person enjoys. A book suggested by a local bookseller or some knitting yarn from a local merchant are great pairings for warm drinks. Beer An obvious gift that many Oregonians, and frankly most Americans, enjoy is beer. If you haven\u2019t tried making it yet, this holiday season may give you a good excuse. You can get as fancy or as simplistic as you\u2019d like with this hobby, experimenting to make your own batches or using sets for a particular style of beer. To get started, one of the best options is to head to Corvallis Brewing Supply at 119 SW 4th downtown to get all your questions answered and determine what you need for the brew you want to create. Remember that with any fermented gift, it needs to sit before it is ready. Typically, that can take three to six weeks, so try to plan ahead. Kombucha Kombucha may sound and look fancy in its dark brown, prettily-labeled bottles, but it is quite easy to make at home. All you need is a few basic ingredients, materials, and some time. The process is simple: brew concentrated tea, add sugar, wait to cool, add kombucha or raw cider vinegar, add the SCOBY, and wait. Kombucha can take as few as five days, so it is one of the more DIY-friendly fermented gifts for those who enjoy procrastinating. For more specific instructions about what a SCOBY is and how long to wait, go to zerowastechef.com and search for \u201ckombucha.\u201d Sauerkraut, Krautchi, and Kimchi A personal favorite, sauerkraut is known as the gateway drug to fermenting because of how easy it is to make. Anyone who goes to the farmers\u2019 market likely sees the kimchi and sauerkraut flying off the shelves, and now is the time to make your own. Cabbages are getting larger and prices are dropping before winter fully hits. The steps are simple: chop the vegetables, salt them, pack them in a glass container, and wait. For full instructions and some tidbits about why fermented food is tasty and good for you, go to zerowastechef.com and search for \u201csauerkraut\u201d or whichever version you are interested in. Gifts That Take Time But Cost Less Crocheted or Knitted Items From scarves to elaborate sweaters, there are numerous ways to crochet or knit your way to a spectacular gift. Warm wool booties for children, stockings for adults, mug coozies for everyone who uses mugs, the possibilities are endless. For those who are new to knitting or crochet and want to learn, Stash, a local yarn shop at 110 SW 3rd Street, has classes that provide you with the materials, tools, and know-how to create all sorts of items. If you are wanting a more self-directed option, mooglyblog.com has lots of free patterns for blankets, coozies, and everything in between. Don\u2019t forget to shop local for your materials. Pallet Furniture Making furniture is satisfying and useful, especially when it is created by reusing materials like pallets. As Pinterest fame has shown, pallets have a surprising amount of versatility. From side tables to bars, stools, outdoor furniture, and book shelves, they can be converted into any number of useful and rustic items. Some lesser known options include a pot rack, outdoor swing bed, a fold-down outdoor bar, or a wine rack. Find some pallets in the alleys downtown or go to local hardware and box stores to see if they have extra pallets. Sometimes they give them away or sell them for as little as five dollars per pallet. Beyond that, expect to buy tools, screws, stain, and sandpaper. Go to wonderfuldiy.com and search, \u201cpallet furniture\u201d for a list of options and tutorials.

While some covet the wrapped and displayed staples of consumerism this season, others may find more interest in snuggling up to a classic tale or new adventure. Anyone who loves a good story, holiday-themed or otherwise, is sure to find something, for themselves or for those they\u2019re shopping for, from this list of books recommended by Corvallis bookstore employees. \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d by J.R.R. Tolkien Savannah Worman, an employee at the Book Bin, suggests \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d this holiday season. The book holds a special place in Worman\u2019s childhood when, during the holidays, her dad would read her this classic tale, of Bilbo Baggins\u2019 unintended journey through Middle-earth. \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d the first in the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d trilogy, is written for children, but entertaining to all ages. Dragons, trolls, and other mythical creatures roam throughout the novel, as Tolkien takes readers along on Bilbo\u2019s adventures. Questions arise over what heroism and war mean for individuals and communities, and readers are left with a sense of what \u201cgoodness\u201d means in different circumstances. Since it was first printed in 1937, \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d has never gone out of demand, due to consistent popularity. The movies, while also popular, somewhat deviate from the text, and offer a separate experience, which may be why so many still hit the shelves for this fictitious favorite. \u201cThe Book of Dust: La Belle Sauvage\u201d by Philip Pullman Suggested by Sarah Hershberger from Grass Roots Books & Music, \u201cThe Book of Dust\u201d is Philip Pullman\u2019s series installment. Pullman is best known for the series, \u201cHis Dark Materials,\u201d featuring \u201cThe Golden Compass.\u201d Released in October, Pullman\u2019s new installment begins with \u201cLa Belle Sauvage,\u201d set 10 years before \u201cThe Golden Compass.\u201d Still focusing on Lyra Belacqua, the \u201cGolden Compass\u2019\u201d heroine, and occurring in a similar arctic landscape, Pullman shares the story of Malcolm, the man who keeps Lyra safe. Reading any of his books beforehand is unnecessary for enjoying this action-packed novel. Pullman continues themes about free speech and fighting against totalitarian governments, making the book a thought-provoking thriller. Hershberger says \u201cThe Book of Dust\u201d is \u201cgreat to escape into when you need some quiet time.\u201d \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d Series by Stephen King Jannett Brinkley of Browser\u2019s Bookstore suggests Stephen King\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d series. Another fantasy setting, \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d expands into the genres of horror, Western, and science fiction. Stephen King himself described the series as his \u201cmagnum opus,\u201d because it ties together so many of the worlds created in his former books. King incorporates a unique language in the books, using Tolkien for inspiration in creating the world, and Clint Eastwood as inspiration for the hero. Within the book, there are gunslingers, feudal governments, and magic \u2013 a little bit for everyone. \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d series includes eight novels, totaling over 4,000 pages. The first book in the series is called \u201cThe Gunslinger.\u201d The series was also made into a movie earlier this year, of the same name. Jan Brett\u2019s Children\u2019s Books Suggested by Megan Louden from the Book Bin for her wintry themes, Jan Brett is a staple in holiday children\u2019s books. Brett has written multiple holiday titles, including \u201cThe Hat,\u201d \u201cThe Mitten,\u201d \u201cGingerbread Baby,\u201d and \u201cCinders.\u201d Brett\u2019s books feature her own illustrations, a rarity in children\u2019s literature today. Each of Brett\u2019s books are strongly tied to a particular place; she has written stories from Russia to Scandinavia. Brett incorporates many animals, and encourages readers to consider the natural world in a new and magical light. From the dressed-up chickens in the icy tundra of \u201cCinders,\u201d re-enacting a Cinderella story, to a hedgehog\u2019s experience getting a stocking off his prickles with the help of many hilarious woodland animals in \u201cThe Hat,\u201d Brett provides a little something for any child with a love of animals. \u201cThe Polar Express\u201d by Chris Van Allsburg Jannett Brinkley from Browser\u2019s Bookstore recommends this holiday classic. \u201cThe Polar Express\u201d is a Christmas tale about a young boy whose belief in Santa is reignited after a trip on the polar express train. Made into a movie in 2004, the book still awes children with its soft illustrations and relaxed cadence. Inspired by various places in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the story follows a boy who is trying to determine reality from fiction. Throughout his journey, he comes to realize what it really means to believe in Santa. The book is appropriate for intermediate readers, or can be read to younger children.

I\u2019m a fantastic poker player. 2. I don\u2019t lie about my poker skills. And 3. I don\u2019t like to move around a whole hell of a lot. I\u2019m serious. That moment when I wake up and have to move \u2013 the worst. Sports? Get the hell out of here. No, really. Go away. You\u2019re still here. See, isn\u2019t it nice to not go anywhere? In fact, despite having viewed every season of Star Trek: [Insert Text Here] fifteen times, I\u2019m still not ready to buy into Gene Roddenberry\u2019s utopia because they never introduced a race that just kind of sat there. Nope, just a sh*tload of people into classical music and vests. Seriously\u2026 Maquis freedom fighters, armed to the gills with sleeveless knits. Er, what the hell was I inappropriately getting on about? Oh yeah, Portland\u2019s \u201cNo-Sit Zones,\u201d which, good God. Great Scott. All of those phrases. What the F*CK, even. Yes, the city\u2019s Sidewalk Management Plan, as they call it, has criminalized sitting \u2013 and according to some people, homelessness. Mayor Ted Wheeler and all those folks say that\u2019s not what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re trying to discourage crime. Because criminals are typically stationary. Okay, well, fine. Let\u2019s say we both know this is going to disproportionately affect the homeless, because, yeah. It did in Eugene, where their six-month statistics said that\u2026 said that it did. Like I just said. So here\u2019s a solution: let\u2019s call it a \u201cHomeless Exercise Initiative\u201d then. Maybe divert shelter funds to sustainable sweat bands and short shorts\u2026 and also those goofy cell-phone arm bands, because running is weird (just think about it), and you might as well get to soak up a little Jackson 5 while you\u2019re avoiding being cited for sitting and getting some sweet ass abs. Now, according to the coppers, they haven\u2019t been told to actually enforce the signs, whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean. I guess this makes it a \u201cpossibly empty threat,\u201d which translates to people who are hungry and have no place to live as \u201ca sick joke.\u201d If this is where our time and resources are going, no wonder we\u2019ve got a homeless crisis. And credit. And homeowner\u2019s associations. And Nickelback. Portland Art Museum Changes Thing About Thing The Portland Art Museum\u2019s plans for the Rothko Pavilion, a building that would connect the two main structures of the museum, have been modified to some end or another because the initial design has pissed off a ton of people. This includes the disabled, cyclists, and all of the homeless people that are now a part of the Homeless Exercise Initiative (and therefore really need to keep moving). For the record, they are totally justified, because the new structure would constitute a major disruption for one\u2019s ability to travel in the area. What I find amusing is that their grand plan to solve the current issue of having to go underground, travel down a long ass hallway, and then use a freight elevator to get to Jubitz Center, was to create another massive obstruction. What\u2019s extra hilarious? The Jubitz Center is currently home to WE, an exhibit on the fourth floor from regional artists with developmental disabilities that does a pretty good job at making all those fancy Van Gogh\u2019s and Monet\u2019s look boring. I\u2019m also for damn sure that both Vincent and Claude would agree with me. Portland Takes Its Toll (And We\u2019re Not Talking House Cookies) The PDX city council has announce that tolling will be a thing, and that you can look forward to it on both I-5 and I-205. $400 million (that\u2019s a lot of burritos\u2026) has been allocated for new lanes and that sort of thing, and the hope is that tolls will not only bring in money, but help prevent further congestion. If you ever find yourself driving up there, especially around the Rose Quarter, you\u2019re probably aware that more lanes isn\u2019t going to fix a situation where the roads are clogged literally half the day. Some important city humans are suggesting the use of congestion pricing, which is a system where the tolls will change depending on time of day and traffic levels. At least one group, No More Freeway Expansion, has been loudly making the case that congestion pricing should be the only thing that happens.

Yes Y's actions are distinct from X in the case you provided, it is worth pointing out that often times the division is not so clear. Often times the actions of Y may have been inspired by or in response to X and to ignore the wrongdoings of both is foolish. This is in no means a justification for Y's actions, but merely serves to further the point that the system is flawed. Does Hillary's email scandal or Trump's brutish language absolve others of wrongdoing? Of course not, but so long as we have a system in place which allows for these actions with impunity, they will continue, just with different names. It is true that you can predict the behavior of others, but be wary of stereotyping people. In rare circumstances even an angel can sin, just as a demon can be virtuous.\nThe reason I felt you were against action was your response to my statement explicitly urging a call to action to prevent future incidents. You took it as a chance to make a dig at Cernovich, and dismissed my statement. Hence I assumed that you simply wanted to complain about the actions of others without being willing to make a move yourself.\nI will say though, it is really sad that MSNBC was so quick to cut ties with an employee without taking a second to explore the veracity of the statements.

Not once did I say I condone the actions of either group engaging in these activities. I was merely pointing out that when one side uses a certain tactic, it is often not long before the other reciprocates in kind. I stated this twice, once explicitly and again as an analogy. If you weren't so busy dissecting one sentence and presenting each part of it as a separate statement, you may have been able to recognize that.\n>So everyone is being disingenuous\nYes. There is no person you can wholly trust to be honest all the time. They may be decent people and have standards, but everyone has their secrets. Neither you, nor me, nor Trump, nor Obama are exempt from this. In a similar vein, it is human nature to have a scapegoat, since taking responsibility for ones actions is inherently detrimental to survival. As for whataboutism, it is a common tactic and, in moderation, can be useful as a self reflection tool so long as the statements are accurate. Much like the slippery slope, its use is not an inherent fallacy unless it is a crutch for the argument as a whole. To ignore the arguments presented in this way is as foolish as to wholly accept them. Nuance is a facet of life, after all.\n>I don't think you and I are talking about the same rules\nThe rules are that when one side engages in disingenuous behavior, the other side will respond in kind. You get what you give, so to speak. Unfortunately, there will be people caught in the crossfire, as is the case with Seder.

What is 'Accrual Accounting' \nAccrual accounting is an accounting method that measures the performance and position of a company by recognizing economic events regardless of when cash transactions occur. The general idea is that economic events are recognized by matching revenues to expenses (the matching principle) at the time in which the transaction occurs rather than when payment is made (or received). This method allows the current cash inflows/outflows to be combined with future expected cash inflows/outflows to give a more accurate picture of a company's current financial condition. BREAKING DOWN 'Accrual Accounting' \nAccrual accounting is considered to be the standard accounting practice for most companies, with the exception of very small businesses. This method provides a more accurate picture of the company's current condition, but its relative complexity makes it more expensive to implement. \nThe need for this method arose out of the increasing complexity of business transactions and a desire for more accurate financial information. Selling on credit and projects that provide revenue streams over a long period of time affect the company's financial condition at the point of the transaction. Therefore, it makes sense that such events should also be reflected on the financial statements during the same reporting period that these transactions occur. \nAccrual accounting is the opposite of cash accounting , which recognizes transactions only when there is an exchange of cash. For example, consider a consulting company that provides a $5,000 service to a client on October 30th. The client receives the bill for services rendered and makes her cash payment on November 25th. The entry of this transaction will be recorded differently under the cash and accrual methods. The revenue generated by the consulting services will only be recognized under the cash method when the money is received by the company. A company that uses the cash accounting method will record $5,000 revenue on November 25th. \nAccrual accounting, however, says that the cash method isn't accurate because it is likely, if not certain, that the company will receive the cash at some point in the future because the services have been provided. The accrual method recognizes revenue when the services provided for the client are concluded even though cash isn't yet in the bank. Revenue will be recognized as earned on October 30th. The sale is booked to an account known as accounts receivable , found in the current assets section of the balance sheet. \nA company that incurs an expense that it is yet to pay for will recognize the business expense on the day the expense arises. Under the accrual method of accounting, the company receiving goods or services on credit must report the liability no later than the date they were received. The accrued expense will be recorded as an accounts payable under the current liabilities section of the balance sheet, and also as an expense in the income statement. On the general ledger , when the bill is paid, the accounts payable account is debited and the cash account is credited. \nUnder accrual accounting, firms have an immediate feedback of their expected cash inflows and outflows, which makes it easier for businesses to better manage their current resources and plan effectively for the future. \nFor more on Accrual Accounting and other accounting basics, check out our Accounting Basics Tutorial .

Then look no further! Telestrations is a fast paced game of sketching and guessing. It is almost like the Chinese Whispers game but in this you simultaneously sketch, pass, guess and laugh to reveal hilarious and unpredictable outcomes from each player\u2019s original word! This is suitable for four to eight players, for aged eight onwards.

SUGAR TAXES WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON ECONOMY NEW SUGAR TAXES WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON ECONOMY Posted By: Zamazethu Qwabe on: December 07, 2017 Print \n\nThe new sugar taxes on sugary drinks is said to have no economic implications on the South African economy says an economist. \nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) has passed the sugar tax bill. The bill now awaits the President\u2019s signature. \n\u201cThere could be an impact for demand, for instance, and the profitability of certain companies. Pretty soon, things will return to normal and sales will bounce back. I also don\u2019t think it will impact employment that much,\u201d said Chief economist Dawie Roodt. \nRoodt says there will be no long-term negative impact on soft drink manufacturers. \nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) says taxing sugary drinks can lower consumption and reduce obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay. \nIn the meantime, Magda Pieters a dietitian, says government needs to implement educational programmes instead, adding consumers need to know why they are paying more.
