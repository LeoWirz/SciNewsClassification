Mark Smith says many of the students were buying things for other people. (Monty Kruger/CBC)\n\"We love doing these type of events. It's all about building relationships as well. A lot of youth, sometimes they might be a little bit afraid of police and we just want to show that we are human as well. We are on the same team.\"\nStudent Newon Dissee says he liked the experience.\n\"We have a police officer in our school.

They have a working product that is being used in the Netherlands, with over 100k tickets being sold each year so far (1 Million by 2019). The protocol they have built called the GET protocol allows artists to sell tickets to their fans directly. The cryptocurrency GET powers the smart tickets which aim to get rid of ticket touting as they have several pieces of technology in place to prevent the re-selling of tickets! The website is here: https://guts.tickets/ . They act as both a B2B and B2C ticketing solution which is awesome as event companies can either choose to use the protocol and sell directly or use the already built application that GUTS has, as an investor of GET both ways benefit you as GET is always bought off the market when each ticket is created which helps build demand for the currency. There is also a buy back event that occurs where a % of all GET bought using the Event Organiser contract which is burnt!\nSome videos of GUTS in progress: https://vimeo.com/gutstickets I've written an article on GUTS here: https://decentralize.today/guts-revolutionizing-the-ticketing-industry-e07218a9c74d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://vimeo.com/gutstickets", "https://decentralize.today/guts-revolutionizing-the-ticketing-industry-e07218a9c74d", "https://guts.tickets/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:00.038+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4baab906b55406b179ef2b11c6986956d2c88e09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa7GTmsgJ5wUM3LqnaKrOXfUPNsbSJy7LYro5yrPF4aF1OpcoAFMkEGKUCOzKn.T5YggEEASYMgDk-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "So who are we buying low right now?", "title_full": "So who are we buying low right now? : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2017-12-07T07:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 178, "participants_count": 120, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6099f622f17db61539c3119d82f4c92e0a2fe68c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa7GTmsgJ5wUM3LqnaKrOXfUPNsbSJy7LYro5yrPF4aF1OpcoAFMkEGKUCOzKn.T5Y4B1btQYWDXTcF_SraZxxFZWYH4Wcd35a", "ord_in_thread": 178, "author": "itsjevans", "published": "2017-12-07T18:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "BTC", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:00.038+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d60daee6fe7fe5c94c325627c2fdb0ea3facea3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoEsZVzh35l9KCOi.mXxTMx1PtIwnFpoF6v1u7sAACA8CHDEJ.juqjHsqU24b5uWhZuRKpqF7y_arRSiC95DMk9lPrfZkrrhf5lDv5dAqXtMMjQvAyfD.frYoUIH4XcnEY-", "site_full": "babab.net", "site": "babab.net", "site_section": "http://babab.net/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Babab RSS Feed", "title": "Pua Slams Ministers On Luxury Property Ban Loophole For Developers", "title_full": "Pua Slams Ministers On Luxury Property Ban Loophole For Developers", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://babab.net/img/pua-slams-ministers-on-luxury-property-ban-loophole-for-developers.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 78178, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d60daee6fe7fe5c94c325627c2fdb0ea3facea3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoEsZVzh35l9KCOi.mXxTMx1PtIwnFpoF6v1u7sAACA8CHDEJ.juqjHsqU24b5uWhZuRKpqF7y_arRSiC95DMk9lPrfZkrrhf5lDv5dAqXtMMjQvAyfD.frYoUIH4XcnEY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Pua Slams Ministers On Luxury Property Ban Loophole For Developers", "text": "papar berkaitan -

Only 1.8 % of Auris, 18 % of Avensis and 1.3 % of RAV4s were sold with a diesel powertrain. \nThe Land Cruiser and the Hi-Ace and Pro-Ace vans keep their diesel options in the future. \nA number of car manufacturers such as Volvo have recently announced their ambition to stop the production of diesel engines.

The SF Board of Supervisors voted on Tuesday, December 5 to severely restrict the machines, which roll on sidewalks and autonomously dodge obstacles like  dogs and buskers . Now startups will have to get permits to run their robots under strict guidelines in particular zones, typically industrial areas with low foot traffic. And even then, they may only do so for research purposes, not making actual deliveries. It\u2019s perhaps the harshest crackdown on delivery robots in the United States\u2014again, this in the city that gave the world an app that sends someone to your car to  park it for you . Actually, delivery robots are a bit like that, though far more advanced and less insufferable. Like self-driving cars, they see their world with a range of sensors, including lasers. Order food from a participating restaurant and a worker will load up your order into the robot and send it on its way. At the moment, a human handler will follow with a joystick, should something go awry. But these machines are actually pretty good at finding their way around. Once one gets to your place, you unlock it with a PIN, grab your food, and send the robot on its way. Because an operator is following the robot at all times, you might consider the robot to be a fancied-up, slightly more autonomous version of a person pushing a shopping cart. \u201cBut that's not the business model that they're going after,\u201d says San Francisco Supervisor Norman Yee, who spearheaded the legislation. \u201cThe business model is basically get as many robots out there to do deliveries and somebody in some office will monitor all these robots. So at that point you're inviting potential collisions with people.\u201d Unlike  self-driving cars , or at least self-driving cars working properly, these bots roll on sidewalks, not streets. That gives them the advantage of not dealing with the high-speed chaos of roads, other than crossing intersections, but also means they have to deal with the cluttered chaos of sidewalks. Just think about how difficult it can be for you as a human to walk the city. Now imagine a very early technology trying to do it. (Requests for comment sent to three delivery robot companies\u2014Dispatch, Marble, and Starship\u2014were not immediately returned.) MORE ON DELIVERY BOTS MATT SIMON San Francisco Tries to Ban Delivery Robots Before They Flatten Someone's Toes MATT SIMON The Crazy-Hard Technical Challenges of Robots Delivering Falafel ALEX DAVIES This Delivery Robot Isn\u2019t Just Charming. It\u2019s Stuffed With Pizza What happened in that Board of Supervisors meeting was the manifestation of a new kind of anxiety toward the robots roaming among us. Just this last year has seen an explosion in robotics, as the machines escape the lab (thanks in part to cheaper, more powerful sensors) and begin rolling and walking in the real world. They've arrived quickly and with little warning. And that\u2019s made folks both curious and uneasy. Go to a mall and you may well find a  security robot  scooting around keeping an eye on things. Robot nurses  roam the halls of hospitals . Autonomous drones fill the air. The question is: How are we supposed to interact with these machines? It\u2019s a weird and fundamentally different kind of relationship than you\u2019d form with a human, and not even experts in the field of human-robot interaction are sure  how this is going to play out . The big thing is safety. Machines are stronger than us and generally unfeeling (though that\u2019s changing with robots that  have a sense of touch ), and can be very dangerous if not handled correctly. Which is what spooked Yee. San Francisco\u2019s sidewalks are bustling with pedestrians and runners and homeless people and dogs and the occasional  rat stacked on a cat stacked on a dog . How can the city make sure that roaming delivery robots and citizens get along? For San Francisco, that means a crackdown. The legislation will require delivery robots to emit a warning noise for pedestrians and observe rights of way. They\u2019ll also need headlights, and each permittee will need to furnish proof of insurance in the forms of general liability, automotive liability, and workers\u2019 comp. It\u2019s sounds so very un-Silicon Valley. You know, move fast and break things, potentially literally in the case of the delivery robots. But states including Idaho and Virginia have actually welcomed delivery robots, working with one startup to  legalize and regulate them early . Though really, San Francisco can better afford to put its foot down here\u2014it\u2019s not like it\u2019s hurting for startups to come in and do business. Might that seem like San Francisco isn\u2019t as tech-friendly as it may seem? No, says Yee. \u201cIf you want to approach delivery, figure out how to do it and be as compatible with our values here,\u201d he says. \u201cCould robots do other things, for instance? Could it be that somebody's accompanying a robot that's picking up used needles in the street?\u201d If only Silicon Valley wasn't so busy developing parking apps.

(AP) \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin won't boycott the Pyeongchang Olympics. \nPutin said his government will allow Russians to compete as neutral athletes at the upcoming games in South Korea. \nThe International Olympic Committee has banned the Russian team from games as punishment for doping violations at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. The IOC, however, plans to invite individual Russians to compete under the Olympic flag. Never miss a local story. Sign up today for unlimited digital access to our website, apps, the digital newspaper and more. SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"Without any doubt we will not declare any kind of blockade,\" Putin said in televised remarks after launching his re-election campaign at an automobile factory. \"We will not block our Olympians from taking part, if any of them wish to take part as individuals. \n\"They have been preparing for these competitions for their whole careers, and for them it's very important.\" \nA Russian boycott would have been the biggest at any Olympics since the Soviet Union and its allies missed the 1984 Los Angeles Games. That itself was in response to the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics four years earlier. \nPutin also said Russia still did not accept accusations that it ran a state-backed doping system around the Sochi Olympics. He called the IOC ruling \"politically motivated\" and unfair \"collective punishment.\" \nPRO FOOTBALL \nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Roger Goodell has signed a five-year contract extension to remain commissioner of the NFL through 2024. \nA memo from the NFL's compensation committee to team owners and obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press confirms that Goodell and committee chairman Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons, have signed the extension. \nThat extension has been a source of controversy because Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones objected to the process. \nAll 32 owners approved in May the compensation committee's power to negotiate and sign a deal with Goodell, who replaced Paul Tagliabue in 2006. \nSince then, the league's total revenues have more than doubled to $14 billion. \nA person familiar with the contract told The Associated Press it is worth almost $200 million, with a base of $40 million. But the deal is incentive-laden, the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity because the contract numbers are not made public. \nHall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon has been accused of sexual harassment by an assistant for his sports marketing firm, according to a lawsuit filed in California. \nThe civil lawsuit was filed Monday in Orange County Superior Court. According to court documents, Wendy Haskell alleges Moon made \"unwanted and unsolicited\" sexual advances as part of her role as his assistant working for Sports 1 Marketing. Moon is the co-founder and president of the company. \nThe Washington Post first reported on the lawsuit Wednesday. The 61-year-old Moon has been working as a radio commentator for the Seattle Seahawks. The team announced later Wednesday that \"We have accepted Warren Moon's request for a leave of absence as the club's radio analyst.\" \nMoon played parts of 17 seasons in the NFL with Houston, Minnesota, Seattle and Kansas City. He threw for 49,325 yards and 291 touchdowns in the regular season and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2006. The former University of Washington star led Edmonton to five Canadian Football League titles before playing in the NFL. \nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier has been transferred from a Cincinnati hospital to Pittsburgh to continue treatment for a spinal injury suffered during Monday night's game against the Bengals. \nThe Steelers say Shazier will continue to undergo tests before offering an update on his status. \nShazier left Paul Brown Stadium on a stretcher less than four minutes into his team's 23-20 victory over Cincinnati following a tackle that left the 25-year-old writhing on the turf, his legs motionless. He underwent extensive testing at University of Cincinnati Medical Center under the care of neurosurgeons David Okonwko and Joseph Cheng. \nRICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014 A former University of Virginia and pro football player has been sentenced to 40 years for running a $10 million fraud scheme that victimized more than 50 investors. \nFederal prosecutors say in a news release that 37-year-old Merrill Robertson Jr. of Chesterfield was sentenced Wednesday. He was convicted in August on 15 offenses, including mail and wire fraud and money laundering. \nProsecutors say Robertson and a co-conspirator operated Cavalier Union Investments in Richmond. Authorities say Robertson targeted former coaches, donors, alumni and employees of schools he had attended. \nAccording to the documents, Robertson sold promissory notes that he claimed would pay an annual return of up to 20 percent. \nInstead, prosecutors charged, Robertson used the invested money for cars, vacations and a luxury suite at a football stadium. \nPRO BASKETBALL \nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Hornets coach Steve Clifford will be away from the team for an undetermined period of time to deal with a \"health issue.\" \nThe team made the announcement Wednesday in a release. \nThe 56-year-old Clifford missed Monday night's game against Orlando because he was not feeling well. Associate head coach Stephen Silas filled in for Clifford against the Magic. \nClifford has battled heart problems in the past, but a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press the issue was not a heart-related. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team has not released details of Clifford's health issue. \nThe team said there is no timetable for Clifford's return and that officials would have no further comment. \nBASEBALL \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Giants general manager Bobby Evans confirmed on San Francisco's flagship radio station KNBR that the club has reached the parameters of a potential trade for Miami slugger Giancarlo Stanton. \nEvans said Giants executives gathered with the NL MVP and his representatives in \"a good meeting\" last week. \n\"The specifics of the deal are not something that we feel comfortable discussing, but ultimately our hope is that if he does choose to come here, we'll be able to fold him in with a winning club,\" Evans said Wednesday. \"In terms of our deal it just has a number of contingencies, one of course that's paramount is relative to his full no trade and that's a decision that really comes from him. But our terms with the Marlins are clear.\" \nMarlins CEO Derek Jeter said Tuesday that Miami has not decided whether to trade Stanton, still owed $295 million over the final decade of his record $325 million, 13-year contract. When asked specifically about absorbing the majority of that contract, Evans didn't address it. \nStanton is due to make $25 million in 2018 after he led the majors with 59 home runs and 132 RBIs this season.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vladimir", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paul brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph cheng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shazier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bobby evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goodell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul tagliabue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen silas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merrill robertson jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clifford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david okonwko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giancarlo stanton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arthur blank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren moon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan shazier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger goodell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wendy haskell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robertson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve clifford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derek jeter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry jones", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "orange county superior court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cavalier union investments", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle seahawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edmonton to five canadian football league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of cincinnati medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knbr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hall of fame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta falcons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steelers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international olympic committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas cowboys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ioc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nl mvp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marlins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richmond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "va.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cincinnati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyeongchang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sochi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soviet union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chesterfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richmond", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:02.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f23159bb1239e8b821f3475446b0fef631aa76b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZShcLv2AiNvM8MAQEb8fCRCp73TrC3NQWSa.sgObY1jhEzxXiE4l0x35FG__._0.6zJ65jTxFsXitS2afZ1EYUi", "site_full": "forums.somethingawful.com", "site": "somethingawful.com", "site_section": "https://forums.somethingawful.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=158", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Ask / Tell -

He tendered his resignation letter to the National Judicial Council (NJC) on Thursday morning, Channels Television reports. Earlier in the year, he was discharged and acquitted by an FCT high court on charges of money laundering and abuse of office. This followed a raid on the homes of some judges by the Department Of State Services (DSS), which termed the operation a sting operation. In January, an official of the DSS had testified that the sum of 38 million Naira, two pump action rifles and some foreign currencies were recovered from his house during their search at his residence in October. Justice Ademola, his wife and Mr Joe Agi, a senior lawyer subsequently faced trial on allegations of bribery and illegal possession of firearms. The FCT high court, however, ruled that the DSS could not prove beyond reasonable doubt it\u2019s allegation against the Federal High Court judge. He was subsequently recalled by the National Judicial Council (NJC) after which he resumed sitting on June 7. Justice Ademola did not give reasons for his retirement.
