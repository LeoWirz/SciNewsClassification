If this happens, you should consider calling a locks expert to come for your rescue. An experienced locksmith knows what to do to ensure you get access to the inside of your house. You, therefore, need to do your homework pretty well before settling with any service provider out there. For the right professional San Mateo locksmith company homeowners can search locally or online.\n\nIn order to avoid choosing a locksmith in a hurry, you need to start hunting for one when you do not need their services. At such a moment, you will have sufficient time to interview several candidates so as to settle with the best. You need to have telephone numbers of at least two locksmiths that you can call when an emergency occurs. Explored in this piece are some of the factors to consider before hiring a locksmith in San Mateo.\n\nFirstly, consider hiring a local locksmith. A locally-based company is quite helpful because they can come to your rescue whenever an emergency strikes. Remember their offices are just around, so they can respond quickly whenever they are contacted. Also, local companies always want to preserve their good reputation. As such, they deliver high quality services to their locals.\n\nIndustry reputation is also a good aspect to look at when hiring locksmiths. You need to look for companies that are known for delivering outstanding services. Consider researching their relationship with past clients. Consider settling with a company that has no pending issues with previous customers. Contact your local Better Business Bureau to get more info about these professionals before hiring.\n\nThirdly, consider their level of experience before hiring. An experienced locksmith is able to execute the given task quickly and efficiently. Look for someone who has been undertaking similar tasks for the past several years. If you are considering a contracting firm, it is wise to choose one that is well-established in your local area. Be wary of companies that are very new in this industry.\n\nAlso, ensure the company you want to hire is licensed to operate. A license is a sign that a particular contractor has receive proper training. The State Board of Contractors issues licenses only to qualified people. So, if you hire a licensed person, rest assured you are working with a real specialist. Always examine their licenses closely in order to ascertain their validity.\n\nYou also need to check on the insurance cover they have prior to hiring their services. A reputable contracting firm must be carrying enough insurance to cover for any possible damages or injuries. It is your responsibility to check whether the insurance is sufficient. You can do that by asking to see their certificates of insurance. Any company without enough workers compensation and liability insurance covers must be avoided.\n\nEnsure you get at least three names of people who have worked with your prospective locksmith before. Contact such people to know more about their experiences with the service provider in question. If they liked the services, you can go ahead and hire that particular contracting firm. But if there are a lot of negative responses from previous customers about the company, do not hesitate to look elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are looking for the facts about San Mateo Locksmith Company , visit our website today.

Without this process in place, companies aren\u2019t able to give themselves unique identities, which can hinder the selling of various products and services. Needless to say, branding isn\u2019t without its trials, of which there are several. When it comes to the trials in question, here are just a few that New York web design agencies prepare for, so that they are more likely to see the desired results. To say that there are numerous branding trials would be an understatement, with originality being one of the most prominent. In the business world, standing out is a priority, which a number of New York web design agencies can attest. With that said, it\u2019s important to understand how to go about branding in a way that helps your company stand out. For advice on how this can be done, it would be wise to consult a reputable authority such as Avatar New York.\nAnother challenge to be mindful of is the ability to stay relevant. The digital world moves at a rapid pace, meaning that those that are unable to keep up are likely to be left behind. One of the ways to stay relevant \u2013 and any Internet marketing company will agree \u2013 is by staying on top of news stories and trends alike. By doing so, you\u2019ll be able to keep your brand at a high level, which will be nothing short of integral in the long run.\nWhat about business strategies and, more importantly, how they should be changed on a regular basis? Everything from marketing to business in general will change on the digital front, meaning that certain strategies won\u2019t be effective forever. Fortunately, those that specialize in branding will be able to update their strategies so that they remain effective. By proxy, more clients will be serviced, satisfied by the results that arise.\nLastly, branding can be an obstacle when it comes to competition. There are various companies that offer the services that you do, but there\u2019s more to consider than this. In order to rise above the competition, your services and prices alike must be attractive to potential consumers. By remaining competitive in your market, you\u2019ll be able to receive more business, which will go a long way in building your company.\n\nAbout the Author: \nPlease visit Avatar New York for further details regarding what you\u2019ve just read. \nNew York Web Design: The Biggest Challenges Of Branding\nfrom top of http://ift.tt/2k1PVCM ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arthur williams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:36.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f4e57a1361f947c5ac3d9d27a20c8b675b7bb82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21SkQXgiy_6lzuy7kb3IP6WjS7DpQfhWkuwwbFoeO890yjBya6GZRvF5pwCK8KOMbVuz0hWT9MZeL8MVDJ4MSXcsm7gXtKXPGvlL65Ec5ZdVtAjir0e.ngCMQ8dNfqY.XJBXixvi.PBjaw--", "site_full": "abcnews.go.com", "site": "go.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.abcnews.com/abcnews/internationalheadlines\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "ABC News: International", "title": "Hamas leader calls for new uprising against Israel in wake of US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital", "title_full": "Hamas leader calls for new uprising against Israel in wake of US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 72, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f4e57a1361f947c5ac3d9d27a20c8b675b7bb82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21SkQXgiy_6lzuy7kb3IP6WjS7DpQfhWkuwwbFoeO890yjBya6GZRvF5pwCK8KOMbVuz0hWT9MZeL8MVDJ4MSXcsm7gXtKXPGvlL65Ec5ZdVtAjir0e.ngCMQ8dNfqY.XJBXixvi.PBjaw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hamas leader calls for new uprising against Israel in wake of US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital", "text": "Hamas leader calls for new uprising against Israel in wake of US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n  Hamas leader calls for new uprising against Israel in wake of US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital   Air Force secretary tells Congress of concerns about reporting criminal activity Patagonia, coalition of conservationists sue Trump to protect Utah monuments 2 toddlers hospitalized after ingesting opioids   Hormonal birth control linked to increased breast cancer risk, study says Kentucky lawyer who vanished pleads not guilty to escape Driver recounts moment woman was pushed in front of bus by jogger Temporary OK for travel ban puts focus on Wednesday hearing Court to hear bid to dismiss lawsuit in Freddie Gray case North Dakota: Refinery near national park could win permit Putin announces 2018 re-election bid, ends long speculation Congressman: Whistleblower alleges Flynn texted about Russia nuclear deal Donald Trump Jr. to face questions about Russia contacts on Capitol Hill Mueller issues subpoena to Deutsche Bank in Russia probe Lionel Richie cancels show to help family evacuate California fires Homeless numbers rise for the first time in 7 years, officials say Striking images show California wildfires from space 'French Elvis' Johnny Hallyday dies at 74 Tonya Harding joins Margot Robbie on red carpet Comedian releases novel inspired by his Irish roots Female high school quarterback throws TD on 1st pass in varsity game", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "contact us contact us   hamas", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:36.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1e97ab6eb1272cb42b6158fa33b2418540201db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qUeg0cTQg9vGcDF3wwoLd_Q_n2kxoodA2Q--", "site_full": "www.bbc.co.uk", "site": "bbc.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/news/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BBC Newsround -

70 miles north of Los Angeles - have been the worse affected areas, and have now been completely evacuated. \nHigh winds meant the fire swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours. \nFirefighters warned the fire was moving so fast they were unable to control it. \nMore than 1,000 firefighters are now battling the fires, and they have said 150 buildings have been destroyed by fire, with more than 260,000 people left without power. \nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Ventura County, promising to attack the fire \"with all we've got\".

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA 19-year-old from Cornwall who beat thousands of hopefuls in securing a place in Britain's Next Top Model has revealed that the competition was \"very tiring and nerve wracking\". \nTamsin Hough, from Sticker , was one of only 13 girls chosen out of more than 2,500 applicants nationwide to take part in the iconic modelling programme. \nThe teenager, who still lives at home in Cornwall, shone during the competition, particularly when working with major brands Ghost Fragrances and Debenhams. \nUltimately the judges eliminated her from the competition in episode four as they were concerned she wasn't versatile enough. \nTamsin said: \"I wasn\u2019t actually too upset about being eliminated. I knew I was going to be, so when Abbey called my name I wasn\u2019t shocked at all. \n\"I was, however, really gutted that I couldn\u2019t have gone further in the competition. Although, tenth out of over 2,500 applicants isn\u2019t too shabby. It was nice though to get home and see my family and boyfriend once I was eliminated, after not speaking to them for two weeks.\" Britain's Next Top Model contestant Tamsin Hough (Image: Tamsin Hough) \nShe continued: \"The experience was so much fun, but very tiring and nerve wracking. \n\"Every day we were doing something new, which was exciting, however you have no contact with the outside world, so that part can be quite scary. \n\"Once we all got to know each other, though, it was like one big sleepover every night. So, once I was settled in the experience was amazing. \n\"I had many favourite moments. I really enjoyed moving into the house, that day was one of the best as we got a lot of chill out time and we weren\u2019t filmed much. \n\"I really enjoyed the Debenhams shoot, and finding out I was the client's favourite was such an amazing feeling and something I am very proud of. Meeting all of the girls though was the biggest highlight. I\u2019ve really made some friends for life.\" \nTamsin added: \"My plans for the future are to get signed. I\u2019ve been approached by multiple agencies now, so I\u2019ve been going to meetings with scouts and agencies for a week or so now. \n\"The show taught me a lot so I\u2019m hoping to grow as a model and an individual. \n\"I\u2019ve been in contact with Julianne from Creative Nature, the brand we worked with on the naked advert in episode three. \n\"She\u2019s asked me to do some work for her in the new year, so that\u2019s exciting! I\u2019ve also been approached by a couple of other brands, and like I said before, agencies. So, things are looking good for the moment.\" Meet teenage Britain's Next Top Model contestant from Cornwall \nDuring her final episode after being eliminated, Tamsin said: \"I am feeling obviously really disappointed. I know personally that I did a lot of different things and two of the brands said that I was one of or the best on the day so I'm taking that as positive and I'm really proud of myself. \n\"I'm definitely going to carry on modelling this has just been the start for me. I am going to take all of the criticism that the judges have given me, really work on it and show them that they should have kept me in and that I could have won.\" \nTamsin counts Cara Delevingne and Leomie Anderson among her modelling icons. \nSeason 12 of the hit show stars celebrity judge, model and Strictly Come Dancing winner Abbey Clancy . \nSpeaking before the competition, Tamsin told Cornwall Live: \"My family and friends are over the moon for me. \n\"When I got told I had made it on the show I wasn\u2019t allowed to tell barely anyone, so I rang up my really close friends to let them know and they started screaming down the phone with excitement. And obviously my parents were so happy, they\u2019re very proud and have supported me all the way. \n\"I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve always wanted to be a model, but it\u2019s definitely something I\u2019ve always been interested in. \n\"Throughout my young life I would often get told that when I grew up I had the looks to be a model, but after trying modelling for the first time on the show, I know it takes much more than just looks to do well in the modelling world. \n\"I currently still live at home in Cornwall, but that could all be set to change due to whatever happens on the show. London is where the work is, so I\u2019ll be looking to spend a lot of my time there. However, my heart will always in Cornwall.\" \nEpisode 1, which aired on Thursday (October 19), saw the teen on her first ever photo shoot with international male model Max Rogers. \nMax said after the shoot: \"She hit every single frame with something.\" \nCelebrity fashion photographer Nicky Johnston remarked that she was \"fabulous\". \nTamsin added: \"I'm so proud of myself for my performance, especially considering I had no modelling experience whatsoever before entering the competition.\" \nBritain's Next Top Model airs every Thursday at 9pm on Lifetime.

The company will also be required to issue a public notice acknowledging the court orders in major Australian newspapers and on all Daiso websites. \nIn Australia, the subsidiary of the discount retailer based in Higashihiroshima in Hiroshima Prefecture sells many items at AU$2.8 apiece. In Japan, many products on sale at Daiso outlets are priced at \u00a5100 each.

Well recovered next day, the travel to Huashan included a compulsory stop at the terracotta warriors, for most the first time to visit here. \nOn a perfect cool but clear day, more than half the party walked all or some of the peaks of Huashan. Certainly a magnificent dramatic collection of peaks, cliffs and never-ending steps, to be paid for over the next several days with some stiff calf and thigh muscles. A very strong representation of the strong Kiwi spirit from some young-at-heart but ageing walkers! \nThe five hour flight westtook us over some very dramatic landscapes, in mainly clear skies. Below, we passed the Qilian mountains and the Hexi corridor, the Tarim basin and Taklamakan desert, and in the far south west, the Karakoram mountain range loomed large and white before landing at Kashgar. \nImmediately in a different place, the hotel was near the square, the mosque, and lanes of smallholder stalls including local crafts. With a full day to explore, we discovered the antiquity of this city through mainly Islamic and commercial activity over the centuries. But, to our chagrin, the livestock market was closed this Sunday and the next \u201cfor maintenance\u201d . The opening of the 5 year meeting in Beijing fell between these two Sundays. Security in the city was also very high. Could there have been a link to discourage gatherings of people at the market? \nSeveral days of long travel through desert landscapes, with occasional patches of intensive agriculture around the Yarkland river, and some oases. We went south through Hotan, then east through Niya. The biggest day was 670 km, north again across the Taklamakan desert to Kuqa and Korla, Turpan to Urumqi. A big distraction that became vexatious was the regular security checks, which sometimes required one hour to pass through. The spirit stayed strong, if frustrated, and we sympathised with the local people. \nAncient cities; vast desert and semi-desert that had to be experienced to be appreciated; the incredible Karez irrigation system that had been built over 2000 year ago linking snow melt to the cities and fields with a network of over 5000 kilometres of underground channel; and the occasional new city developments, designed to rehouse hundreds of thousands of people in the harsh environment made possible by the building of a new irrigation infrastructure all stand out. \nMutton kebabs, pilaf, bread and noodles were the staple by day on the road. Some Chinese restaurants filled in the need for some vegetable dishes at night. Dates, raisins, almonds and nuts were daytime snacks. \nThen to Dunhuang, the Mogao grottoes and camel rides, to Zhangye and the Danxia geological park. Arriving in Shandan for most it was the first introduction to the legacy of Rewi Alley, his collection of artefacts, and NZCFS connection to Shandan Bailie School, represented by Michelle, our current teacher there. \nIn Lanzhou, the opening of the Rewi Alley Memorial Hall was coordinated with our arrival. Joined by two representatives from the NZ Embassy in Beijing, this occasion showed the significance of NZ in general, and NZCFS in particular. I had the honour of drawing the curtain from the plaque alongside LCU President. \nThe NZers were impressed with the very high degree of respect that Rewi Alley received, even 30 years since his passing.

His previous book was Perils of Dominance: Imbalance of Power and the Road to War in Vietnam (University of California Press, 2005).\nThe rockets that landed in the Damascus suburbs on August 21, 2013 \u2014 immediately regarded by the Obama administration and the news media as a nerve-gas attack \u2014 brought the United States to the brink of war with the Assad regime. President Barack Obama stepped back from launching cruise missiles only at the very last moment, August 30, according to the most detailed account of the episode. 1\nThe presumption that the Syrian government had crossed Obama's \"red line\" against the use of chemical weapons was already full-blown: In mid-June 2013, the administration had announced an intelligence assessment affirming that the regime had used chemical weapons, including Sarin, several times over the previous year. This assessment was crucial in establishing a political climate within and outside the Obama administration that made it very difficult for the president to avoid treating the claims of a Sarin attack in August as a fact. But it was an allegation, the truth of which still had to be established.\nA review of what is known about the June assessment and the alleged Sarin attacks shows that it was a major intelligence failure on the order of the Iraq WMD error. It failed to reflect accurately the evidence the administration said supported the overall conclusion. Moreover, it ignored substantial evidence indicating that the incidents in question did not involve Sarin or anything else recognized as a banned chemical weapon. Finally, the evidence of responsibility for the alleged Sarin attacks did not confirm the accusation that they were carried out by the Syrian government.\nTHE APRIL 2013 ASSESSMENT The June 2013 intelligence assessment was preceded six weeks earlier by an intelligence assessment that appeared, on the surface at least, to endorse the view that Syria had used chemical weapons. However, it stopped short of doing so. The April 2013 assessment was carried out in the context of new international pressures on the Obama administration to accuse the Assad regime of chemical-weapons attacks. Letters from the British and French governments to UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon in mid-March had claimed that evidence supported the opposition charge that nerve agents had been used in attacks near Aleppo, Homs and possibly the Damascus suburbs. It cited what the two governments said was conclusive evidence from soil samples and interviews with witnesses. 2 U.S. allies, including those in the Middle East, were reportedly \"irked\" by the failure of the Obama administration to do more to assist the armed opposition to the Assad regime. 3\nFar from being disinterested parties on the questions at issue, however, the British and French governments were exploiting opposition charges of Sarin use to bolster their joint campaign to get the European Union to end its embargo on providing weapons to either side in the Syrian war. 4 In mid-March, when the British and French launched their push to end the arms embargo \u2014 but before either government was claiming to have evidence of chemical-weapons use \u2014 French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande declared, \"We must go further\" to assist the Syrian rebels against the regime, because of \"some potential threats as to the use of chemical weapons.\" 5\nIn any case, the evidence that the two countries claimed to have was clearly inconclusive regarding what was used in the attacks and who was responsible. The soil samples did not prove that the substance was Sarin or another nerve gas. The Times reported on April 13 that the British Ministry of Defence research facility in Porton Down had found traces of what it called \"some kind of chemical weapon\" in the soil samples, which were said to have come from Khan al-Assal near Aleppo, the target of an alleged chemical-weapon attack on March 13. The researchers had determined that the chemical used in the attack wasn't Sarin, though they had been unable to identity it precisely, according to The Times . 6\nObama administration officials further noted that it had not been established who had handled the samples before a laboratory had analyzed them. The Syrian government had immediately called for a UN investigation of what it claimed was a Sarin attack on the government-controlled enclave of Khan al-Assal, suggesting that it was carried out by opposition forces. 7 But opposition commanders in the area had argued both that a government chemical-led shell had missed its target and that the government had deliberately attacked its own people to make the opposition look guilty. And the Obama administration, apparently recognizing that its position on the incident could not be separated from its need to reassure its allies on U.S. Syrian policy, had immediately rejected any possibility that the opposition could have carried out the attack on Khan al-Assal. 8\nOn April 13, British Foreign Minister William Hague claimed to have \"very strong evidence\" that chemical weapons had been used in Syria. However, Hague made a damaging admission to Parliament: improvised chemical weapons may have been used by both sides \u2014 \"by the regime to show that the opposition are using chemical weapons, and by the opposition to show that the regime is using them.\" 9\nDespite political pressure from U.S. allies for more aggressive U.S. military assistance to the opposition, the Obama administration was still guarding its freedom of action on the issue of intervening in the war. As the foreign ministers of the core group of the \"Friends of Syria\" (the United States and 11 other states supporting the opposition) met in Istanbul on April 20, a Turkish Foreign Ministry official explained to a journalist the main issue at the meeting: the Obama administration's continued resistance to the proposal from the two European governments and the Middle Eastern allies (Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar) to step up the flow of arms to the opposition. 10\nThe White House's presentation of the April intelligence assessment nevertheless sought to reassure allies that President Obama was taking the allegations of chemical-weapons use seriously. At a press briefing on April 25, an unidentified White House official announced that the intelligence community had concluded with \"varying degrees of confidence\" that the Assad regime \"has used chemical weapons on a small scale in Syria, specifically the chemical agent Sarin,\" and that the assessment was \"based in part on physiological samples.\" However, the official went on to say, \"Our standard of evidence must build on these intelligence assessments as we seek to establish credible and corroborated facts. For example, the chain of custody is not clear, so we cannot confirm how the exposure occurred and under what conditions.\" 11\nThe Obama administration also leaked to CBS News that the intelligence community had expressed only \"low to moderate confidence\" in the conclusion. 12 According to the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate on the Iranian nuclear program, in the parlance of intelligence assessment, \"low confidence\" means that either there are serious concerns about sources or the information itself is implausible or can't be corroborated. \"Moderate confidence\" generally means that the information is credibly sourced and plausible but requires corroboration to be deemed sufficiently reliable. 13 In other words, the claims at best still had to be verified, and at worst, they were regarded as lacking in credibility.\nIn a television interview, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said, \"We still have some uncertainties about what was used, what kind of chemical was used, who used it.\" And a letter from White House aide Miguel Rodriguez to members of key Congressional committees made it clear that the assessment had not resolved fundamental questions. \"Only credible and corroborative facts that provide us with some degree of certainty will guide our decision making,\" said the letter. 14\nUnder pressure from Congress and the media, as well as foreign allies, Obama approved a secret presidential \"finding\" authorizing the CIA to initiate a covert program to train and arm a small group of rebels loyal to the Western-backed \"Supreme Military Council\" in Turkey. The plan would involve moving weapons to Jordan with the cooperation of U.S. allies and then distributing them to a small set of selected Syrian rebel groups. This new overt program also included the establishment of two-week training courses in Jordan.\nBy agreeing only to a covert operation rather than a publicly acknowledged program, however, Obama was able to maintain the official stance was not involved in providing lethal military aid to the rebels. For the next two months, the covert program stalled, and no weapons were actually moved to the rebels. 15\nA \"HIGH-CONFIDENCE\" ASSESSMENT A few weeks after the inconclusive intelligence assessment was announced, the intelligence community provided a new one that was presented to the public as accepting the chemical-weapons-attack claims without reservation. According to a statement issued by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, the assessment found that the Assad regime \"has used chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin, on a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year.\" The intelligence community was said to have \"high confidence\" in the assessment, in sharp contrast to the obviously weak support offered in April. 16\nThe claim of strong confidence in the assessment's conclusion seemed to suggest that the intelligence community now had much more conclusive evidence of chemical-weapons attacks. But the public record makes it clear that no such conclusive evidence was ever obtained. The information provided by the administration about the basis for the conclusion came entirely from a formal statement and press briefing by Rhodes and from an unpublished letter from UN Ambassador Susan Rice to UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon that was leaked to the Associated Press. Rhodes said that an estimated 100 to 150 people had been killed in alleged chemical attacks, but there was no accounting of where and when or even a total of how many such attacks were alleged.\nBoth the Rhodes statement and the Rice letter mentioned four incidents as being \"associated with\" the assessment, of which only two were said to involve the use of Sarin gas \u2014 Khan al-Assal on March 19 and the Sheikh Maqsood district of Aleppo city on April 13. The other two alleged chemical-weapons attacks to which the official statements referred were identified as Qasr Abu Samra on May 24 and Adra, near Damascus, on May 23. Rhodes and Rice provided no information about the kind of chemical weapon allegedly used in those two other attacks.\nAll known chemical weapons can be identified relatively easily, so the Obama administration's refusal to be more precise appears to have been aimed at covering up a political problem. A major clue can be found in a New York Times story in mid-April, just as British and French pressure on the administration to charge Assad with Sarin attacks was growing. The Times reported that the testimony of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper before the Senate Armed Services Committee \"reflected a growing assessment within the American intelligence community that the Syrian government may have used some kinds of chemical agents, like a powerful tear gas, but not the most deadly ones, like sarin.\" 17\nThe State Department had leaked to CNN that its investigation into the alleged Sarin attack on Homs in December 2012 had concluded that the chemical agent had been a \"powerful riot-control gas\" such as those used by U.S. forces for decades, including in the war in Iraq. 18 The United States had consistently refused to consider riot-control agents as \"chemical weapons,\" unlike every other state that had negotiated the chemical-weapons convention. 19\nBut those were not the only weapons on the Syrian battlefield that the Obama administration was reluctant to acknowledge and discuss explicitly. As reviewed in detail below, there is overwhelming evidence that alleged Sarin attacks in April 2013 had involved smoke grenades, which can create symptoms similar to those caused by Sarin, but are much less lethal. 20 Other signatories to the chemical-weapons convention would consider such weapons to be banned \"chemical weapons.\" But the United States continues to manufacture and stock such weapons and would certainly argue, if forced to do so, that they are not \"chemical weapons.\" It had strong motivation, therefore, to refuse to discuss them explicitly in the context of the Syrian chemical-weapons issue. This explains why the Obama administration would not say anything further about the chemical weapons other than Sarin that it was citing as part of its indictment of the Assad regime.\nNeither Rhodes nor Rice claimed that the intelligence community now had what it had conspicuously lacked in April: physical evidence of a Sarin attack or any other genuine chemical-weapons attack for which the chain of custody could be verified. 21 An intelligence source revealed to Foreign Policy that U.S. intelligence had possessed at least three physiological samples when it issued the inconclusive April assessment, and that it now had six blood, urine and hair samples testing positive for Sarin gas. But the source acknowledged that it still had not been able to establish the chain of custody for any of the samples. 22\nKhan al-Assal was one of the locations from which U.S. intelligence had obtained physical samples supposedly taken from victims, according to a New York Times report. The samples reportedly had tested positive for Sarin, but the U.S. official who confirmed that fact also said it had not been established precisely how, where and from whom they had been drawn. 23 Furthermore, the final report of the UN investigating mission cast doubt on the physical samples it had obtained from Khan al Assal. The mission was able to take blood samples from two survivors of the attack whose DNA had been collected at the time and could be verified, and it found no traces in them of the signature of any chemical-warfare agent. Moreover, there was no evidence whatever that the Khan al-Assal attack had been carried out by the Assad regime. The UN mission observed that the village of Khan al-Assal was \"under the control of Syrian Government forces on 19 March 2013,\" and that the village had been the object of ongoing shelling by opposition forces from areas surrounding it. 24\nDespite two trips to Turkey to interview doctors from Syria in late June and early July, the UN mission was unable to reach alleged witnesses or to obtain biomedical samples related to the April 13 Sheikh Maqsood incident. The UN team concluded that it couldn't corroborate the allegation that chemical weapons had been used there. 25\nFurther evidence that the Sheikh Maqsood attack was probably not carried out by regime forces came from a report published by the Global Post later that month, shedding more light on the confused political situation surrounding the attack. The opposition sources said the Kurdish YPG, which controlled the Sheikh Maqsood neighborhood, had been allowing rebel forces to enter it to attack government forces \u2014 but had also been informing the government of the plans in advance. Less than two weeks after the alleged Sarin attack, the rebels accused the Kurds of \"double-crossing\" them, and a serious military clash between the YPG and the rebels killed several people. 26\nThe alleged chemical-weapons attack on Adra, reported by opposition \"campaigners\" on May 23, was said to have taken place when opposition troops were surrounding the town, which was under Syrian government control. The opposition reported that the gas attack killed one opposition fighter and wounded 23. 27 No press report on any alleged chemical attack at Qasr Abu Samra can be found. Despite Ben Rhodes's claim was seeking to provide evidence to the UN mission investigating alleged chemical attacks, the mission's final report noted that it had not been given \"sufficient or credible information\" about those two alleged incidents to merit further investigation. 28 A complete list of alleged chemical-weapons attacks up to the time the June assessment was released does not mention one in Qasr Abu Samra. 29\nIGNORING CONTRARY EVIDENCE The June assessment ignored an important new stream of information that became available after the April 25 assessment for determining what had actually happened in the alleged chemical-weapons incidents. The new information pointed clearly to the conclusion that the Sheikh Maqsood attack, cited by both Rhodes and Rice as evidence of Sarin use by the Assad regime, almost certainly did not involve Sarin or any other chemical weapon in the common usage of the term \u2014 and was probably not carried out by the Assad regime.\nOn April 29, immediately after the alleged chemical-weapons attack on Saraqeb, British blogger Eliot Higgins, who was systematically tracking munitions in the Syrian war under the name \"Brown Moses,\" published a series of photos showing that the same means were used in both that attack and the April 13 attack on Sheikh Maqsood. 30 The delivery vehicle was a tiny white polymer canister, the body of which was little more than three inches high, with a lid and \"fly off\" lever. A close-up video showed that it had four holes distributed evenly around its surface. 31\nThe new stream of information also showed that al-Nusra Front and other opposition troops were definitely in possession of that type of canister. On May 8, the website published a photograph of the same plastic canister hanging from the jacket of a Nusra Front fighter in the Aleppo area. 32 The photographer, Jeff Ruigendijk, recalled in an e-mail to this writer that he had taken the picture on April 2, 2013 \u2014 eleven days before the Sheikh Maqsood attack \u2014 and that the Nusra Front cadre carrying it was not a military specialist but a low-level functionary whose task was to sort out the lines at the bakery every morning. 33\nJournalist Alfred Hackensberger of Die Welt visited the fighting front in and around Aleppo during the summer of 2013 and talked with two Nusra Front fighters who recalled seeing the same canisters being carried by rebel troops, although they weren't sure whether they were from Nusra Front or their allies Liwa al-Tawhid. They confirmed to Hackensberger that the munitions were smoke grenades, not chemical weapons. In Aleppo, Hackensberger found two more Nusra Front fighters who recognized the canister and showed him and his photographer other canisters of the same type. They, too, told Hackensberger they were smoke grenades, and that they came from Syrian Army depots that Nusra Front had captured. 34\nThe Brown Moses blog published interviews with two experts on chemical weapons who agreed that it was highly unlikely the canister shown in the pictures from those attacks had been used to deliver Sarin gas or any other deadly chemical weapon. 35 Steve Johnson, the deputy editor of CBRNe , the bimonthly periodical for professionals on chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, observed that the device had no \"fragmentation jacket\" and was therefore most likely a grenade for delivery of riot-control gas or smoke. The Nusra Front fighter carrying the canister in Ruigendijk's photo wore no protective equipment \u2014 meaning that it was not a chemical weapon.\nA chemical-weapons expert from the security consulting firm Allen Vanguard, identified only as \"Paul,\" observed that Sarin is \"not suited to being deployed in hand-thrown canisters;\" as doing so would obviously endanger the person delivering it. He also noted that Sarin \"would not leave marks next to the hole in the canister as shown in the image,\" whereas a smoke grenade would.\nIn the case of Saraqeb, the implausibility of a Sarin attack was further magnified by the account provided to the UN investigating mission by an opposition figure who was their main source on the incident. The final report recalls that a \"source close to the opposition\" provided an account of the attack evidently seeking to prove it was carried out by the Syrian government. The source claimed that the tiny gas grenade had been dropped from a helicopter using a cement cinder block with round holes. The source said the cinder block had served to \"secure\" the small hand grenade from exploding until it hit the ground, upon which the handles of the grenades would become activated and discharge. The source further claimed that some of the canisters contained tear gas, whereas others contained Sarin.\nHowever, the source's story, which appears to have been an effort to show that the tiny white canister found on the scene must have been delivered by the regime rather than by opposition troops, was not supported by any visual or other evidence. It describes a highly implausible method of delivering any chemical weapon, much less Sarin. The UN mission's final report observed that the information from the opposition source about the Saraqeb attack \"could not be independently verified by the United Nations Mission.\" 36\nEyewitness accounts in news reports of the Sheikh Maqsood and Saraqeb attacks provide still more evidence that the chemical used in the two attacks was not Sarin. After the Sheikh Maqsood attack, neighbors who entered the home in which two children died described \"smelling a sharp, bitter odor that stung their eyes.\" 37 Similarly, after the April 29 Saraqeb attack, which appears to have been very similar to the Sheikh Maqsood attack, the son of the woman who died recalled, \"It was a horrifying, suffocating smell.\" 38 Sarin, by contrast, is an essentially odorless gas. 39\nTHE MISSING PIECES The series of anomalies for which the June 2013 intelligence assessment failed to account should have raised serious doubts about the claims of the opposition and their external supporters that the regime had used Sarin in Khan al-Assal and Sheikh Maqsood. In neither of those two cases was the regime seeking to take control of the area. In one case, it was clearly under attack from opposition forces at the time; in the other case, there is evidence of serious tension between the Kurdish authorities and the opposition forces in the area at the time of the attack. The delivery vehicle found in both places made a Sarin attack implausible, and the specific delivery vehicle used in both cases was clearly in the possession of opposition forces. Finally, the foul odor eyewitnesses had reported was inconsistent with Sarin gas, and the only physical samples reported whose chain of custody could be verified tested negative for Sarin.\nAgainst these indications that the assessment's conclusion was false, defenders of the assessment could cite the set of reported symptoms that coincide with those for Sarin exposure and the fact that some physical samples from one or more attacks tested positive for Sarin. But an alternative explanation for the symptoms is more consistent with other evidence, and the claim of positive test results for Sarin does not prove that Sarin was used in either of the cases cited by Rhodes and Rice.\nThe symptoms reported by survivors and eyewitnesses \u2014 blurred vision, difficulty breathing, foaming at the mouth, nausea, vomiting, loss of consciousness, and convulsions \u2014 are not unique to exposure to Sarin. They are also consistent with exposure to conventional smoke munitions, which produce highly toxic phosphine gas when they make contact with the moisture in the air, causing symptoms like those associated with Sarin. 40 Exposure to both gases involves severe damage to the body's ability to produce cholinesterase; this causes neurological symptoms, including convulsions. 41\nThe evidence surrounding the canisters involved in the attacks on Sheikh Maqsood and Saraqeb, moreover, indicates that they were apparently used to dispense smoke. Such use of smoke munitions would account for the symptoms reported in both cases as well as the serious anomalies in the assessment that Sarin gas was used in those two attacks. The U.S. military and other militaries have long stocked grenades and mortars firing red-phosphorus munitions that form highly toxic phosphine gas upon contact with moisture in the air.42 Exposure to phosphine gas can cause unconsciousness, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, fainting, convulsions and even pulmonary edema \u2014 just as does exposure to Sarin. And because it is heavier than air, it may cause asphyxiation and death in enclosed, poorly ventilated or low-lying areas, as does Sarin. 43 The descriptions of the foul odors accompanying the attacks on Sheikh Maqsood and Saraqeb also indicate the presence of phosphine gas, which has an odor of rotting fish or garlic. 44\nThe Obama administration provided no information about what criterion was used by the intelligence community in determining that it had evidence of Sarin exposure in either the Khan al Assal or Sheikh Maqsood cases. But the final report of the UN mission states that a physical sample was \"considered positive when either the Sarin metabolite isopropyl methylphosphonate (iPMPA) or the fluoride reactivation product of IMPA (Sarin) is detected at three times above base-line level.\" This means that a positive result of either of two very different tests would be considered evidence of exposure to Sarin.\nFor many years the only test of blood, urine or tissue for Sarin exposure was based on the detection of the Sarin metabolite breakdown product, designated as either iPMPA or IMPA through gas or liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. This is because Sarin itself begins to break down in the body within hours and because IMPA is considered a reliable marker of Sarin exposure. 45 But IMPA is easily obtainable from any chemical company as a \"reference\" material for research and could be administered to the source of a blood or urine sample unobtrusively in a glass of water without any threat of harm to health. In fact, 300 parts per million of IMPA in drinking water for 90 days is officially regarded as a \"no effects\" level. 46 Thus the opposition could, without being detected, have falsified one or more physical samples that were ultimately obtained by the U.S. government.\nMore recently, new technologies using \"fluoride reactivation\" have made it possible to reconstitute Sarin itself even after it has broken down. 47 The newer tests would obviate the possibility of a false positive through introduction of IMPA into the body of the source of the sample. But if the rule adopted by the UN mission that a positive for either IMPA or Sarin itself was also used by the Obama administration, the possibility of falsified physical evidence of Sarin exposure remains.\nThat possibility would explain why some within the Obama administration were suspicious of physical samples that had tested positive for Sarin. Those officials believed the opposition, well aware of Obama's \"red line\" on chemical weapons as a potential route to drawing the United States into the war against Assad, was motivated to \"falsify\" the samples that found their way into French government hands. The combination of the motive and the technical possibility of cheating is presumably why the Obama administration had raised the issue of the \"chain of custody\" in April as a problem that had to be settled before a conclusion could be reached on the issue. In June, however, as the political calculations of the White House shifted, the administration chose to ignore that problem in presenting the revised intelligence assessment.\nPOLICY, POLITICS AND INTELLIGENCE The glaring weaknesses of the case for accusing the Assad regime of a series of chemical-weapons attacks in spring 2013 pose an obvious question: Why did the Obama administration embrace that assessment so enthusiastically in June \u2014 after having insisted on much more conclusive evidence in April? The answer appears to be the perceived need to support a policy shift in Syria with which the assessment had become tightly linked. During the weeks prior to the June assessment, the heavy pressure from foreign allies and domestic critics to begin a serious program of assisting the anti-Assad armed opposition intensified. So did the demand support the accusation that Assad had used chemical weapons. The Obama White House was evidently not convinced the line had been crossed in April, and the intelligence community had delivered an assessment supporting the need for corroborative evidence. But, as the White House contemplated the acceptance of a more active program of assistance to the armed opposition, its position on the issue of chemical weapons shifted as well.\nIn fact, the linkage between the two issues had become a simple problem of political messaging. The administration did not believe it could present itself as the champion of the anti-Assad forces while at the same time resisting the argument of the opposition and its external supporters that Assad had used chemical weapons. When Deputy National Security Adviser Rhodes briefed the news media on June 13, he said the administration had \"already taken action\" on \"both the scale and type of support that we're providing to the opposition\" and explained it as a consequence of the new intelligence assessment. \"We now have a high-confidence assessment that chemical weapons have been used on a small scale by the Assad regime,\" said Rhodes. \"And so he [the president] has said that the use of chemical weapons would change his calculus, and it has. Since April, as we've reviewed this evidence, we have increased our support and provision of assistance to the opposition.\" 48\nThe evidence clearly shows, however, that Obama agreed to announce military aid to the anti-Assad forces, not because of new evidence of chemical-weapons use, but because both Obama's senior advisers and the rebel commanders were warning that Assad's military was threatening to wrap up the armed opposition.\nThe primary motive driving Obama's decision making at that point was apparently the fear that the entire anti-Assad war could collapse and hand a victory to Assad's Iranian allies \u2014 and that he would be blamed for it. A series of high-level meetings were hastily organized in the wake of the recapture of the town of Qusayr by a combined force of Syrian-government and Hezbollah troops on June 5 after a bloody two-week battle in the single biggest defeat for the rebels up to that time. 49 Just before the rebels retreated from Qusayr, a Syrian rebel commander warned in an \"emergency phone call\" at the end of the week of June 3, 2013, that a combined Syrian-government-Hezbollah military force gathering around Aleppo was threatening to eliminate the armed opposition's military presence in that strategic city. A source familiar with the internal discussion recalled that Secretary of State John Kerry had warned in a meeting between Obama and his senior advisers that, unless he agreed to step up support for the anti-Assad forces, regional \"partners\" would withdraw their support for the rebels, threatening a complete collapse of the entire anti-Assad effort. 50 Gulf Arab commentators were treating the victory of Syrian-Hezbollah forces as a tipping point for Iranian dominance in the entire region, and the Washington Post 's coverage adopted that viewpoint. 51\nThe administration's policy making and the accompanying intelligence assessment on Syria in June 2013 thus dramatically illustrate the strong aversion of officials to revealing the actual facts surrounding an issue when those facts conflict with policy decisions they regard as politically necessary. This analysis of the June 2013 intelligence assessment shows that arriving at an intelligence assessment in conjunction with major policy issues tends to be a quintessentially political process.\n1 Jeffrey Goldberg, \"The Obama Doctrine,\" The Atlantic , April 2016, http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/\u2026 .\n2 Colum Lynch and Karen DeYoung, \"Britain, France Claim Syria Used Chemical Weapons,\" Washington Post , April 18, 2013.\n3 Karen DeYoung, \"U.S. Reluctance to Aid Rebels Irks Allies,\" Washington Post , March 17, 2013.\n4 Steven Erlanger, \"Seeking to Arm Rebels in Syria, France Urges End to Arms Embargo,\" New York Times , March 15, 2013.\n5 Charlotte McDonald-Gibson, \"Fran\u00e7ois Hollande Tells EU: It's Time to Send Arms to Syrian Rebels,\" The Independent (London), March 14 2013.\n6 Michael Evans, \"Chemical Weapons Used in Syria: The First Evidence,\" The Times (London), April 13, 2013, http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/middleeast/article3738391.ece .\n7 \"Secretary-General's Press Encounter on Syrian Government Request,\" United Nations, March 21, 2013, http://www.un.org/sg/offthecuff/index.asp?nid=2745 .\n8 \"Syria Rebels, Regime Blame Each Other for First Alleged Chemical Weapons Attack,\" CBS News, March 19, 2013; and \"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney, 3/19/2013,\" https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/03/19/press-briefing-p\u2026 .\n9 \"Evidence of Nerve Gas in Aleppo Deaths,\" ABC News, April 17, 2013, http://abcnews.go.com/International/evidence-nerve-gas-aleppo-deaths/st\u2026 .\n10 Tulin Daloglu, \"Friends of Syria Deliver Nothing New,\" Turkey Pulse, al-Monitor, April 21, 2013, http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/04/syrian-opposition-rad\u2026 .\n11 \"Background Conference Call by White House Official on Syria,\" April 25, 2013, https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/04/25/background-confe\u2026 .\n12 \"Syria Has Likely Used Chemical Weapons on a 'Small Scale', Chuck Hagel Says,\" CBS News, April 25, 2013, http://www.cbsnews.com/news/syria-has-likely-used-chemical-weapons-on-a\u2026 .\n13 \"Iran: Nuclear Intentions and Capabilities,\" National Intelligence Estimate, Office of Director National Intelligence, November 2007, https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Reports%20and%20Pubs/20071\u2026 .\n14 \"Syria Has Likely Used Chemical Weapons on a 'Small Scale'...\" CBS News, April 25, 2013.\n15 Mark Mazzetti, Robert F.

Carothers Library and Learning Commons for the last 20 years was The Daily Grind, a 20-by- 40-foot coffee space comprised of three mobile units. \nAs the 2016-2017 academic year concluded, it seemed as if the coffee shop had run its course; the espresso machine finished its last brew, the refrigerators were unplugged and lost their cool touch. Items were moved into storage and disappeared from students\u2019 view. \nThis September, students returned to Kingston only to find the Daily Grind had not been revived. Tables and chairs replaced the space the kiosk previously occupied. As fall semester progressed, there was still no indication that the Daily Grind was slated to return. \nHowever, construction is occurring that was not visible to the student\u2019s eyes, and a newly expanded Daily Grind is slowly being completed. \nThe new location of the Daily Grind will still be in the 24-hour room, but will replace the old meditation and mother\u2019s rooms. The original timeline for the construction of the coffee stop was two months, with all necessary work to be completed between the end of freshman orientation in June and the start of the fall semester in early September. In reality, the project has reached six months. \n\u201cNo one could start work until July 1 because we had freshman orientation in here, and they were using all of this space,\u201d associate administrator of dining services Jo-Anne Stephens said. \u201cUnfortunately, with the permits and with different outside vendors we\u2019ve been put behind so many different times.\u201d \nThe expanded timeline has been caused by a number of factors\u2014 namely, the acquisition of necessary permits, as well as ensuring on-time performance from electricians and plumbers, according to Stephens. In Rhode Island, anyone wishing to obtain a permit for new construction must first fill out a project certification form, in which they attach blueprint plans for the project, and then must complete a demolition application outlining any possible hazardous materials and outside companies that have installed service connections, or sewer lines, electrical and gas piping, and finally have the building cleared by a local fire marshal before any work can be started. \n\u201cThe permits did set us back, and I\u2019ve actually postponed the health inspection four times already,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the coffee maker hooked up yet because the electrical inspection hasn\u2019t been done yet, because the electrical hasn\u2019t been finished yet. It\u2019s like one thing leads to another.\u201d Adding to their setback was the fact that the old meditation room needed to be prepared in a manner that allows for the storage and production of food. Fiber reinforced with plastic panels needed to be placed on the walls behind any sink or coffee machine to be in compliance with health department regulations. Additionally, the refrigerators would not fit through the existing doorway, and a brick wall had to be taken down so they could be brought in. \nThe Daily Grind\u2019s absence has affected students and the University alike. The coffee stand employed 20 students, who have not been able to work this semester. \n\u201cUp to this point in the fall semester last year, we had almost $75,00 in sales, which of course, we don\u2019t have any of this year,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cI\u2019ve got 20 employees who haven\u2019t worked all semester.

but locked into specific item or skill loadouts.\n- Having a few of seperate classes with different mechanics.\n- Having only a single class - with player skill and weapon choices being the determining factor.\nNow, the first one is Overwatch and similar games. Lots of classes, lots of counters, lots of options.\nThe second one is Battlefield and other similar FPS/TPS - each class gets it's specific weapons, but various customization functions such as perks, or attachments.\nThe second one is WOWS. Everything is different in each class, with only a bit of overlap.\nThe last one is pubg/fortnite stuff. Pure player decision determining the 'class' that they are.\nSo, how do we make WOWS into something people will complain less about, and enjoy more? It truly is simple.\nMake Destroyers the only class available in the game. Problem solved.\nYou forgot that the other games set you up against players at the same level. What is \"level\" you say? Experience. Level. Experience.\nNow, I'm not that good, but I'm not that bad. Granted, there are are players who are really awesome. AND, there are are players who are, well, not so good.\nPlaying against players that are equal to \"your own\" level, would give a much better match. Unfortunately Match Maker isn't configured like that. Be nice, but there aren't enough players to make it happen.\nAs for playing against just one type of ship. Had a battle the other day....(6) DD's & (6) BB's on one side. (5) DD's, (1) Cruiser & (6) BB's on the other. In a battle like this all it takes is for one side to know what to do, and the other to know what not to do. But this is typical of just about every battle.\nYou mention WoW. I assume you mean WoW and not WoW. Well there, you are against only those that are at the same level. Level, meaning, earned. Yes. Experienced. Here. A new player can buy a ship, never played before and get into a battle, knowing nothing what their doing. So I agree.

What is \"level\" you say? Experience. Level. Experience.\nNow, I'm not that good, but I'm not that bad. Granted, there are are players who are really awesome. AND, there are are players who are, well, not so good.\nPlaying against players that are equal to \"your own\" level, would give a much better match. Unfortunately Match Maker isn't configured like that. Be nice, but there aren't enough players to make it happen.\nAs for playing against just one type of ship. Had a battle the other day....(6) DD's & (6) BB's on one side. (5) DD's, (1) Cruiser & (6) BB's on the other. In a battle like this all it takes is for one side to know what to do, and the other to know what not to do. But this is typical of just about every battle.\nYou mention WoW. I assume you mean WoW and not WoW. Well there, you are against only those that are at the same level. Level, meaning, earned. Yes. Experienced. Here. A new player can buy a ship, never played before and get into a battle, knowing nothing what their doing. So I agree.

That\u2019s because he\u2019s caught in the middle between Ashely (Eileen Davidson) and Victoria (Amelia Heinle) as things are about to get pretty ugly in Genoa City with a Jabot versus Newman Enterprises battle.\nRelated: The Young and the Restless RUMOR: Abby Hooks Up With J.T. Hellstrom For Revenge On Victoria \nFor Ravi, he sees that Ashley is having a hard time keeping her promises. He also thinks that Ashley is using him for her own personal pleasures, and he thinks that he deserves more respect than just that. That\u2019s when he makes a move that leaves Ashley in shock: he leaves Jabot to work with Newman Enterprises. Not only will this make Ashley angry, but it will also put her against Victoria.\nBut for Ravi, he\u2019s doing what\u2019s best for him. The only thing that matters is his career. But Victoria might not see it that way. Spoilers tease that she soon finds him rather attractive and makes quite a few subtle moves on him. Victoria is well aware that Ravi\u2019s move to Newman Enterprises will not only rile up Ashley, but it will benefit her both personally and professionally.\nSomeone is making a move on Ravi tomorrow on #YR ! https://t.co/WgtyKdZzvh pic.twitter.com/7fczDT7AFf \n\u2014 Young & The Restless (@YRInsider) December 5, 2017 \n\nBut at the same Ravi is enjoying all of the attention that he\u2019s getting from both Ashley and Victoria. But at the same time, by moving to Newman Enterprises, he\u2019s joining the dark side. Not only is she betraying Ashley, but he\u2019s also putting himself in grave risk that might jeopardize his future. Will it all be worth it in the end?\n\nWho Do You Prefer Ravi With?

Chiropractor Wilmington come in different scales and with different objectives. This means that any patient seeking their services must be very keen not to fall victim of manipulation that is likely to occur in the event of unverified persons. This article offers some factors that you can look at before settling on an individual for this service.\n\nEvery business, whether in the official capacity or the private one, needs to have the authority to transact its activities without being suspected. Anyone offering these services is supposed to be qualified and recognized by the relevant bodies. Thus, in cases where you feel that you may be dealing with someone who may be unqualified, please ask him or her to show you his or her license and any other relevant document.\n\nCosts is a very important factor when it comes to making any choice. It is vital for an individual to develop and maintain a budget that can guide his or her expenditures. As much as possible, do not do blind expenditures since these have a negative effect on your financial stability. As much as it is a medical issue, you also need to stay sober and realistic about what you can afford and what you cannot.\n\nMake sure that you take enough time to do a background check on the person or facility that is offering that service. This will put one on the right path towards making the right choices. Any professional review or information from friends and acquaintances who have had that kind of experience will be very helpful. You can find someone who is offering the same services at a lower cost or even better services, only if you give yourself time to look around.\n\nEnsure that, before you make your decision, you are sure that he or she is the best option available to all who are on the market. Options are good because they increase your ability to demand what is of the quality that you want. This is even made easier when you have any prior experience with someone else or something of that kind. Do not be in a hurry to pick someone before checking out if there is someone else who is better than him or her.\n\nThe location of the specialist is another key aspect that should not be downplayed. There are those who will be too far away for your comfort while you are likely to have others being close to you. Avoid long distances, especially if you are the one going to the facility. If it is the expert who will be coming to your house, the distance can affect the total cost since he or she will factor the time spent on the way.\n\nYour service provider ought to be professional. By this, it is meant that he or she needs to know the boundary between your social self and the client that you are. Being too social sometimes can affect perspectives and end up destroying relationships that would have otherwise been fruitful, professionally speaking.\n\nEverything needs a proper understanding for success to be achieved. You can keep a list of the things to consider to increase your chances of getting it right. Avoid rush decisions since they mostly lead to situations that could otherwise be avoided.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are looking for the facts about a chiropractor Wilmington residents can visit our website today.

Out of the many submissions to Chemical Engineering magazine, only six finalists were selected. Criteria for winner selection include novelty of the technology, the difficulty of the chemical engineering problem that was solved and the overall engineering excellence. The awards were announced at the Chem Show in New York on November 1, 2017 .\n\"We have been working together with our technology partners for several years to develop a commercially viable and safe option to produce high-quality alkylate without the use of liquid acid catalysts,\" said Silvio Ghyoot, president of Albemarle's Refining Solutions global business unit. \"We are honored by this prestigious award and recognition of the unique AlkyClean technology for its potential as a game-changing technology for our refining customers.\"\nThis technology, which applies the proprietary Albemarle AlkyStar\u00ae catalyst, eliminates the use of liquid acids for the production of motor fuel alkylate, and thus eliminates the hazards and environmental and operating issues associated with handling liquid acids. The world's first solid catalyst alkylation process was commercialized with this new catalyst and process in Shandong , China , in August 2015 . The AlkyClean\u00ae process offers environmental benefits due to the reduction of waste streams, such as spent acids and acid-soluble oils, and is also inherently safer when compared to technologies employing liquid acids.\nThe AlkyClean\u00ae process technology was also the recipient of the 2016 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award presented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in cooperation with the American Chemical Society.\nAbout Albemarle\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB), headquartered in Charlotte, NC , is a global specialty chemicals company with leading positions in lithium, bromine and refining catalysts.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nPrime Minister Theresa May has blasted a Devon MP whose team sent out a leaflet promising that Labour would cancel student debt. Plymouth MP Luke Pollard has apologised after sending out the leaflet. \nMr Pollard says the information was sent out by 'over-enthusiastic volunteers' on his behalf. \nHe says he did not see the leaflets before they were printed, but would take the blame nonetheless. \nThe MP confirmed Labour's policy is that they want to scrap tuition fees, rather than existing debt, the Plymouth Herald reports. \nMr Pollard said: \u201cI\u2019m quite disappointed about what happened and for those folks that have been effected by it \u2013 I want to say sorry, we should have done better on this one. \n\u201cNow I\u2019ve spoken to all the volunteers involved in making leaflets. It\u2019s a leaflet that I hadn\u2019t seen before it went out.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn with Sutton and Devonport MP Luke Pollard \nPrime Minister Theresa May waving one copy around in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Question Time on Wednesday, declaring it was evidence of Labour making promises they could not keep. \nThe Prime Minister said: \u201cWeek in, week out, the right honourable gentleman comes to this house making promises he knows he cannot deliver, and Labour Members keep doing it. \n\u201cAt the election, he told students that they would write off their student debt, and then he said, 'I did not commit to write off the debt'. But what is the Labour party doing? \n\u201cIt is putting around leaflets that say 'Labour will cancel existing student debt'. \n\"It is time he apologised for the grossly misleading Labour leaflets.\u201d \nGary Streeter, Conservative MP for South West Devon, tweeted: \u201cI am sure that @LukePollard will recall all of these leaflets and issue one telling the truth. It is a serious matter to mislead young voters.\u201d \nThe official leaflet was delivered to its recipients on November 30 - Plymouth University student, Jake Thurman claimed on Twitter that he had sent it to the Prime Minister. \nDuring a 30-minute Facebook Live hosted by Luke for Plymouth residents to ask him various questions, he addressed the situation and apologised. \nHe said: \u201cSome of you will have seen today at Prime Ministers question time that the Prime Minister being unable to answer any questions on Brexit decided to attack Jeremy Corbyn on student debt which is something that the Tories like going on about. \n\u201cIn that she used a prop which was a Labour party leaflet. That leaflet came from Drake ward in the constituency that I represent and she used that as evidence that Labour were not being or saying things that were not party policy. \n\u201cTuition fees are helping students graduate with \u00a350,000 worth of debt, it\u2019s simply unacceptable that, that level of debt is occurred for gaining skills that people needs, that Britain needs people to have in the 21 Century.

He added that G10 rates- and G10 currencies-trading have been challenged in quarter, although the woes were offset by Citi\u2019s co-brand credit-card deal with Costco Wholesale Corp. which has been a bigger success than expected. However the bigger surprise was the Gerspach's disclosure that he expects the bank to take a noncash earnings charge of about $20 billion, or 10% of shareholder equity, if the Senate\u2019s version of the tax reform bill is enacted. He explaine that the hit to profit would result in part from writing down deferred tax assets in the period the bill is signed. The number is far greater than what the company had provisioned, and analysts had expected previously expected a writedown of around $12 billion. Which is odd since the entire tax law was written with banks pardon corporations in mind. Confused why the deferred tax asset could suddenly vaporize? Doug Kass has written a useful primer on the topic: As the largest \"owner\" of deferred tax assets generated during the past financial crisis, Citigroup is the most vulnerable bank to the likely introduction of lower corporate tax rates. Deferred tax assets accumulate when losses pile up and those \"benefits\" can't be utilized. A reduction in the effective corporate tax rate and the lower value of unused foreign tax credits likely will result in a one-time hit at Citigroup of about $12 billion to $13 billion in the form of a write-off of deferred tax assets held. Keefe Bruyette estimates that writedowns also would be seen at Bank of America (BAC) ($6.6 billion), Wells Fargo (WFC) ($4 billion) and Goldman Sachs (GS)($1.6 billion). That is because the bank's deferred tax asset account will have to be written down - it is not as valuable as in the previous (higher) tax regime. As Cass concludes, \"I have long expressed the view that investors looking at Citi's share price relative to book value was misplaced in its calculation. When I have mentioned this possible hit to Citigroup's book value in my appearances in the business media, I usually got a dazed stare! This issue has been ignored by many, but it will be no longer\"... He was right, and now that the CFO has confirmed Kass' concerns, the stock closed at session lows, dragging other money-center banks down with it...
