In this way, large enterprises can respond in a more agile way to change and disruption, such as damaged infrastructure, stock substitutions, route variations, price increases, or product improvements. \nManaging multiple point-to-point communication \nThe opening up of APIs can also enable organisations to provide uniform interfaces to internal and external developers, partners and customers, to help improve data exchange and transactions. In addition, APIs enable the open source community to create new functionality and value. \nAt your service \nMicroservices, whereby application functionality is developed as independently deployable services, enable organisations to experiment with new features and more rapidly respond to changes and disruption. \nMicroservices architectures still require integration capabilities such as transformation, orchestration and connection, so that data can be shared across multiple systems and services. An agile integration approach, taking advantage of APIs, containers, and distributed integration technologies, can be used to bring integration into the application development processes. \nChanges to client-side functionality require equal flexibility on the backend. Using an integration platform, developers can more quickly create and scale lightweight integration services, based on APIs. Business workflows rely on core systems of record and supporting IT infrastructure. In addition to AI and IoT datastreams, the Intelligent Digital Mesh will still require data from back-end systems to power apps and help deliver business value. \nEnabled by containers \nWith an increasing number of different applications running in an enterprise, from the newer AI, mobile, and IoT applications to the more traditional business intelligence, web, and other industry-specific applications, the delivery and management complexity can quickly escalate. This is where the role of containers and a container-based platform can come into play. \nBy deploying microservices in containers, independent development teams can deliver them. Container technologies are designed to eliminate bottlenecks in performance and facilitate agile integration that underpins independent app development and scalability. \nAs AI and IoT combine and users become accustomed to an increasingly connected and data-driven environment, apps can become subject to continuous updates and unpredictable demands for elastic scalability, often independently from one another. Containers enable the continuous development of lightweight, tested units of app deployment that can scale independently on demand. Most importantly, containers enable consistent version management of system units and provide portability for existing apps so that they can be deployed in different environments without too much retooling. \nEmbrace the mesh \nAs with enterprise mobility, successful implementations are more likely to be strategic rather than tactical. Organisations should avoid working in silos and view AI, IoT, data analytics and mobile developments as part of the overall technology roadmap. Clare Grant \nI expect the emergence of the intelligent digital mesh to help drive enterprises to adopt modern app development practices and enable them to bring applications to market faster. This can call for the adoption of DevOps practices, using flexible microservices architectures and APIs to support an agile approach, and containers to enable portability. \nConclusion \nIn the age of digital services, enterprise software should satisfy many new business objectives, incorporating transformative technologies including cloud, mobile, social, big data, IoT and AI, as a means of helping to improve business outcomes. \nThe ability to integrate data from multiple sources at speed is important for organisations that hope to benefit from IoT, big data and AI. Adopting an agile integration approach, using platforms that can manage and scale applications with independent development and delivery cycles, can help organisations to take full advantage of existing and emerging technologies. \nCIOs can learn from existing successes within their own organisation, other industries, or the open source community to strategically focus resources, helping to make a clear business case for development and integration efforts, so that early successes can be more quickly scaled. \nThe author of this blog is Clare Grant, general manager at Red Hat Mobile \nComment on this article below or via Twitter: @IoTNow_ OR @jcIoTnow Posted In ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zenobia hegde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clare grant", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "red hat mobile  comment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red hat mobile", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:01.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a873d3a52e1a2a7b7d433e35331866fffd711f50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTyzfeOBw4R2D7cU.TkIhFON0ZBABF2vAq7hSHDi9sUunrGhcRo4e8BgY_UQnnb0406L80Yyn6fDzXAMIutk5Q3Ct___D4P_fW.m5ctdMLomePBVbcE6UY_Qsx___102q2agEDyzMBwQ--", "site_full": "job-openings.monster.com", "site": "monster.com", "site_section": "http://rss.jobsearch.monster.com/rssquery.ashx?cy=nl&#038;where=Den%20Haag&#038;where=%20Zuid-Holland&#038;rad=5&#038;rad_units=km&#038;qlt=1420833&#038;qln=1843000&#038;lid=778&#038;re=130&#038;baseurl=vacature.monsterboard.nl", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "Monster Job Search Results", "title": "Verkoper (Junior) Keukens", "title_full": "Verkoper (Junior) Keukens", "published": "2017-12-07T06:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a873d3a52e1a2a7b7d433e35331866fffd711f50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTyzfeOBw4R2D7cU.TkIhFON0ZBABF2vAq7hSHDi9sUunrGhcRo4e8BgY_UQnnb0406L80Yyn6fDzXAMIutk5Q3Ct___D4P_fW.m5ctdMLomePBVbcE6UY_Qsx___102q2agEDyzMBwQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T06:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "Verkoper (Junior) Keukens", "text": "Verkoper (Junior) Keukens at Grando Keukens & Bad Emmen, DR 7825 About the Job Ben jij een gedreven verkoper en staat bij jou de klant centraal?

NAFTA Still Unresolved \nThe North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), adopted in 1994, was intended to create a North American market where goods could move across borders between the U.S., Canada and Mexico tariff-free. As part of his presidential campaign, Trump threatened to withdraw from the accord unless it was made \u201cfairer\u201d for the U.S., claiming that it had dented American manufacturing and caused a $60 billion trade deficit with Mexico. \nOne of the major sticking points in negotiations has been the U.S. insistence on the rules of origin for the auto industry. The U.S. wants to raise the minimum threshold for sourcing auto production to be 85% from NAFTA members and 50% of the total from the U.S. itself, compared to the current agreement for 62.5% to be sourced from the member countries. \nU.S. automakers are actually lobbying against the plan. In a November 27 meeting with Vice President Mike Pence, executives from Ford (NYSE: F ), General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ) asked for the idea to be scrapped, arguing that it would add thousands of dollars to car costs in the U.S. \nRegardless, ending NAFTA without a deal would imply the return of the World Trade Organization rules on free trade, hiking tariffs between the three countries. There is further speculation that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda would lead to a hike in tariffs even beyond WTO guidelines, which could be mirrored by retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico. \nA November 27 report from the Bank of Montreal calculated that a failure to renegotiate terms would lead to a 0.2 net reduction in real U.S. gross domestic product over the next five years, while Canada would see a 1% decline. \nThe report further indicated that the U.S. industries to be hardest hit by the lack of a deal would be automotive, as prevailing agreements currently straddle all three economies, followed by textiles with Canada and Mexico accounting for 15% of U.S. manufacturers\u2019 sales. \nAfter negotiations in November failed to resolve any issues, so-called inter-sessional talks are scheduled for the week of December 11 in Washington. Those results would be reported to chief negotiators before a January 23-28 meeting in Montreal, Canada. 2. $1 Trillion in Infrastructure Policies on Tap \nInfrastructure policies have been a part of Trump\u2019s plans since day one of his presidency and his election caused an immediate furor in construction and materials firms, including United States Steel (NYSE: X ), Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC ), Fluor (NYSE: FLR ), AECOM (NYSE: ACM ), Chicago Bridge & Iron (NYSE: CBI ), Jacobs Engineering (NYSE: JEC ), and Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM )\u2014on the back of increased proposals and funds for the sector. Infrastructure Stocks \nAs can be seen in the graph above, the aforementioned companies all received a boost in the run-up to the elections through the end of 2016. U.S. Steel saw the most dramatic rally though enthusiasm appeared to taper off as time moved on and policy promises had yet to materialize. Fluor and Chicago Bridge & Iron have also been unable to hold post-election peaks. \nFrom a wider perspective, only the gains of 42%, 36% and 33% in U.S. Steel, AECOM and Jacobs Engineering beat the 23.35% return in the S&P 500 since the election, while all the other firms underperformed by more than half. \nIt was back in April of this year that President Trump renewed his promise for a \u201cvery big infrastructure plan,\u201d tagged at being around no less than $1 trillion. As political battles have raged over other issues, none of those big tag policies have actually materialized. Trump did note on November 20 that he planned to unveil the massive plan after Congress pushes through tax reform. \u201cWe\u2019ll be submitting plans on infrastructure\u2026 soon after taxes,\u201d Trump declared from the White House. \nTo the President\u2019s credit, he has moved forward with the Keystone pipeline and also streamlined regulations to speed up the permitting process for builders. \nOne of the major sticking points for the passage of infrastructure policy is interwoven with tax reform and the budget. Many Republicans are wary of the pricing for the $1 trillion dollar package. Originally, Trump hoped to achieve about $200 billion in federal seed money to incentivize private investment in the projects. \nHowever, it is currently unclear not only whether politicians will give the green light on the government spending, but whether the tax bill already passed by the House, which eliminated the deduction for firms using tax-exempt private activity bonds, will form part of the final law. These are often used in public-private relationships to help build roads, highways, hospitals, airports, housing and other crucial projects. The elimination of the tax deduction, if included in the final compromise, may well disincentivize private company participation. \nChina\u2019s own infrastructure policy, known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), may serve to provide clues for the possible outcome of Trump\u2019s planned investments, although the \u201cAmerica First\u201d ideology is diametrically opposed to the BRI\u2019s attempt to promote development and \u201ceconomic cooperation\u201d along five corridors out of China: land routes through Central Asia to Europe; to the Middle East, and Southeast Asia; and sea routes connecting Chinese ports to Europe and to the South Pacific. \nThe Belt and Road Initiative will benefit China, as well as other countries across the globe. In the first three quarters of this year, trade between China and economies along the route amounted to $786 billion, an increase of 15% year-on-year, according to a China Daily interview with Joao Mendes De Faria, president of the multinational mining firm Vale China. \nMendes calculated that Chinese businesses had increased their investment in the economies along the BRI by 29.7% to $9.6 billion, while those participating economies had upped their investment in China by 34.4% to $4.24 billion. He further noted that Chinese businesses had helped build 75 economic and trade cooperation zones in 24 markets along the Belt and Road, generating more than 209,000 jobs. \nPointing to number of BRI and Public-Private Partnerships as the major factors supporting the Chinese economy, Mendes emphasized that the infrastructure project \u201chas greatly fueled economic growth\u201d. \nMarkets are still awaiting the details of Trump\u2019s massive plan, not to mention how it will be funded, but it appears clear that $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, if approved, would give a big boost to not only the American economy but to stocks that would reap the benefits. 3. Immigration Beyond the Wall \nWhile most thoughts regarding Trump\u2019s immigration policy naturally turn to his promise to build a wall between the borders of the U.S. and Mexico to stop illegal immigration (yet another topic intertwined with tax reform and spending policies as estimates range from Trump\u2019s own $12 billion projection to price tags as high as $70 billion without including maintenance), many of the President\u2019s first attempts at wider measures, such as the travel ban, have faced judicial resistance. \nJust this last Monday, the Trump administration did win a small victory as the Supreme Court allowed a third version of its travel ban to go into effect while legal challenges continued. Despite two dissents from Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor who preferred to deny the request for the ban to go into effect, the Supreme Court approved the move, urging appeals courts to move more swiftly to decide on its lawfulness. \nThis allowance for the third ban means that the U.S. will be allowed to fully enforce restrictions on entry into the country from eight nations: Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea. In essence, citizens of those countries will be denied entry to the U.S. although details vary on the restrictions. Many will be unable to emigrate permanently to the U.S. while others will be barred from working, studying or even vacationing in the United States. \nTo avoid drawn out legal battles on other immigration topics, the Trump Administration has concentrated this year on tightening current legislation. In the fight against what Trump considers to be unneeded competition for Americans from legal foreign workers, a Wall Street Journal article recently highlighted that the administration is more closely scrutinizing applications for the high-skilled visa program known as H-1B. According to the financial paper, more than one in four applicants between January and August received \u201crequests for further evidence\u201d compared to a year earlier under the Obama Administration when those requests were fewer than one in five. \nThe article suggests that the tactic was being used to purposely slow the process, thus reducing legal immigration via an increase in bureaucracy, rather than embarking on new legislative measures that could face political opposition. \nAccording to the report, other methods to slow down the process have included ignoring past approvals for the same person\u2014forcing renewals to take longer\u2014requiring more applicant interviews which bog down the system, along with the suspension of premium processing which provided the opportunity to fast-track an application for a fee. \nFurther changes to regulations could also include the elimination of the right for the spouses of H-1B holders to work in the U.S. or allowing foreign graduates in science and technology from U.S. universities to work for an additional two-years. \nH-1B visas are used to a large degree by tech companies who argue that these workers are needed to fill critical jobs, while opponents claim that they simply displace American workers, generally at cheaper compensation levels. \nTech firms initially took a hit following the presidential elections as market participants postulated that Trump policies would hinder their business. Obviously, those worries were not solely based on immigration, but also on overseas operations and other issues such as attacks from Trump when Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) refused to unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernadino shooters. \nStill, what appeared post-election to be the start of a full-on feud between the President and Silicon Valley seems to have faded into the background. In fact, since the election, tech shares have led the Wall Street rally. Tech Stocks \nUnlike the materials and construction companies mentioned earlier whose returns have shown a mixed reading as they wait for policy follow-through, the graph above shows how top tech firms have skyrocketed. Apple has returned 53% since the elections, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) 48%, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) around 44%, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) 38%, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) 34% and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) 26%, compared to gains of 34.2% for the NASDAQ Composite and \u201cjust\u201d 23.35% for the S&P 500. \nStill ahead will be the outcome of Trump policies on tech stocks, whether he further clamps down on the firms' ability to access top tech talent outside of U.S. borders and whether he makes good on threats to force manufacturing back to the States. \nWith tax reform almost behind him and Congress expected to tackle spending before the end of the year, 2018 could see the door open for action on NAFTA, infrastructure and immigration with its consequences\u2014whether bullish or bearish\u2014for stocks. 3 Trump Initiatives Beyond Tax Reform That Could Move Markets ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":

Posted Dec 7, 2017 4:00 am EST Last Updated Dec 7, 2017 at 4:20 am EST David Decary-Hetu, assistant professor of criminology at the University of Montreal, is seen on Friday, November 3, 2017 in Montreal. Technological advances in artificial intelligence are fuelling a new race between hackers and those toiling to protect cybersecurity networks.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson \nMONTREAL \u2013 Technological advances in artificial intelligence are fuelling a new race between hackers and those toiling to protect cybersecurity networks. \nCybersecurity is always a race between offence and defence but new tools are giving companies that employ them a leg up on those trying to steal their data. \nWhereas past responses to cybercrimes often looked for known hacking methods long after they occurred, AI techniques using machine learning scan huge volumes of data to detect patterns of abnormal behaviour that are imperceptible to humans. \nExperts expect machines will become so sophisticated that they\u2019ll develop answers to questions that humans won\u2019t clearly understand. \nDavid Decary-Hetu, assistant professor of criminology at the University of Montreal, says defenders have an edge right now in using artificial intelligence. \n\u201cBut who knows what\u2019s going to happen in a few years from now,\u201d he said in an interview. \n\u201cThe main issue is that if you\u2019re defending a system you have to be good 100 per cent of the time, but when you\u2019re attacking the system you only have to be successful once to get in.\u201d \nDecary-Hetu said a growing list of corporate and government officials, including Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz, who say infiltrations are their top worry have a very good reason to fear. \nThe Bank of Canada warned in its semi-annual review released this month that the high degree of interconnectedness among Canadian financial institutions means any successful cyberattack could spread widely throughout the financial system. \nReports suggest cybercrime costs the Canadian economy between $3 billion and $5 billion a year, including ransom paid to foreign criminals. \nHacks of Sony Pictures, Uber, Ashley Madison, Yahoo and multinational retailers have sparked unsettling headlines about security of personal information. \nOne of the latest to face scrutiny is global credit-reporting firm Equifax. Hackers accessed the personal information, including names, social insurance and credit card numbers, as well as usernames, passwords and secret question/secret answer data of 19,000 Canadians and 145.5 million Americans. \nCurrent detection systems tend to only recognize improper activity based on past events, often long after the damage is done. \nAn example of this is Equifax, which discovered the breach in July, months after hackers first infiltrated the system. It only notified the public in early September. \nNiranjan Mayya, founder and CEO of Toronto-based Rank Software, said it takes on average 143 days for a breach to be detected. \nThe challenge is growing as the number of connected devices in the world continues to soar. \n\u201cClearly the old style techniques of looking at cybersecurity threats and having people go through each threat aren\u2019t working anymore, so automated means of detecting threats has become more and more important,\u201d he said. \nDavid Masson, Canadian manager for U.K.-based Darktrace, said artificial intelligence will help to keep up with threats by quickly identifying and stopping attacks by picking up on subtle markers that identify bad behaviour. \nHe said his company\u2019s systems map a customer\u2019s entire network, including every user and device, to discern even the slightest deviations as they emerge. \nMasson said AI is needed to keep up with threats by automating defence responses to growing machine-on-machine attacks launched by sophisticated hackers. \n\u201cYou\u2019re kind of looking at a cyber arms race,\u201d he said in an interview. \n\u201cIf you want to keep up with this threat and put the advantage back in the hands of the defenders you\u2019re gonna have to use AI.\u201d \nOntario-based utilities company Energy+ Inc. said installed Darktrace technology alerted it to a user going to a malware site in Russia and uploading undisclosed sensitive data to a third-party cloud provider that its existing security was unable to catch. \nSome observers temper the current exuberance about AI, saying it\u2019s not a silver bullet and these are nascent days for the technology. \nReceptiviti CEO Jonathan Kreindler says the hype around artificial intelligence has accelerated and has almost become a branding exercise for some companies that aren\u2019t even offering truly leading edge technology. \n\u201cThe term AI is now being applied to any sort of algorithmic reasoning unfortunately,\u201d said Kreindler. \nHis firm uses AI to scour writings for unconscious use of language to understand the psychological state of company insiders who are responsible for 80 per cent of cybersecurity issues. \nCanada\u2019s largest IT company, CGI Group, said artificial intelligence is a growing field of interest for customers, although the average client is in the fairly early stages of considering AI adoption in cybersecurity. \nCGI cybersecurity expert Andrew Rogoyski said that still puts them one step ahead of most hackers, who are typically interested in stealing data using the cheapest tools possible. \nRogoyski added that he expects a strengthening of defensive mechanisms might force hackers to also adopt innovative techniques such as AI. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a race, it\u2019s been going on for 20 years plus and the race just keeps evolving. We keep leapfrogging each other,\u201d he said. Join the conversation Sign in to comment (not connected to your Insider Club login). You're logged in as Loading profile... Unexpected error.

(PRWEB) December 07, 2017 Janet Lerner PhD, LCSW, a former housewife, turned hippie, turned social worker, has completed her new book \u201cThe Lord Told Me, \u201cBe Available.\u201d: an intriguing recounting of the author\u2019s life, from her humble beginnings, to finding religion, and to accomplishing both educational and professional pursuits. According to Lerner, \u201cThis book describes my life and many of the experiences I have had. If it can help one person to hang in there and not give up, everything related in the book will be worth it. When I was ready to go to Columbia for my doctorate, my father kept telling me that I should not bother because I was always going to be a secretary anyway. Thank God, I didn\u2019t listen to him.\u201d Published by New York City-based Page Publishing, Janet Lerner\u2019s revealing work invites the reader to glimpse into her life to find inspiration for their own. Lerner started as a country farm girl, who grew into a woman that married but did not feel like a housewife. She got divorced, got into trouble, went back to college to become a social worker, and went through the \u201970s as a hippie. At the end of the \u201970s, she was born again and went back to school to get a master\u2019s degree at the same university as her bachelor\u2019s\u2014Ohio State. She was later accepted into Columbia University School of Social Work and received a doctorate in social work research. When she finished the social work program, she wanted to go back into the field of drug treatment, as she felt this area needed as much expertise as possible. Since then she has been blessed to develop and obtain funding for many drug treatment programs and other supportive services, which have been widely beneficial for the patients she serves. Readers who wish to experience this inspiring work can purchase \u201cThe Lord Told Me, \u201cBe Available.\u201d at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Kobo, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.

However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we\u2019ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: Enrich the conversation Stay focused and on track. Only post material that\u2019s relevant to the topic being discussed. Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically. Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases. NOTE : Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user. Don\u2019t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse. Only English comments will be allowed. \nPerpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com\u2019s discretion.

I'm glad to be of your assistance!\nI see that you are facing issues with the HP Officejet printer while using the ADF. Please try the steps listed here to try and fix the issue: http://hp.care/2tZCx6I\nPlease try the steps listed under \"Printer does not pick up paper from the ADF\". Make sure to clean the rollers and check.\nOnce done, then please perform a hard reset on the printer as suggested below:\n Remove the cartridges from the printer. With the printer turned on , disconnect the power cord from the rear of the printer and also unplug the power cord from the wall outlet. Remove USB cable, if present. Wait for 2-3 minutes, press and hold the power button on your printer for about 30 seconds to remove any additional charge. Now plug back the power cable straight to a wall outlet without any surge protector or an extension cord (This is important) and then plug back the power cord to the printer. Turn on the printer and wait till warm-up period finishes and the printer is idle.\nPlease let me know if this resolves the issue, or if you require further assistance!\nGood luck\nPlease click \" Accepted as Solution \" on the post that solves your issue to help others find the solution.

Bodkin Design OEM Blackbody designed for automated self-calibration of infrared systems \nBodkin Design and Engineering is a valued supplier that we know we can depend on for OEM components and subassemblies that meet our most demanding requirements. NEWTON, Mass. (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 Bodkin Design & Engineering has custom-engineered a blackbody infrared radiance standard for Marvin Test Solutions, to integrate into their modular target simulators. The blackbody unit supplied by BD&E is a derivative of their MRDT-50 infrared calibrator product, originally developed to calibrate infrared tracking cameras at White Sands missile range. Marvin Test Solutions incorporates the device into its MTS-916 series of Modular Target Simulators. The MTS-916 is part of a suite of armament and munitions test solutions that support the testing and verification of optically-guided weapon systems such as Maverick or Hellfire missiles. The testing of optically-guided weapons is complex, and a complete test solution requires a device such as the MTS-916 to simulate either a stationary or moving target. Target simulation ensures that the optical seeker can track and terminally guide the weapon to the target. \u201cBodkin Design and Engineering is a valued supplier that we know we can depend on for OEM components and subassemblies that meet our most demanding requirements,\u201d said Lowell Parsons, Director of Test Engineering for Marvin Test Solutions. \u201cTheir focus on quality and customer support enables us to continue delivering the advanced mil/aero test solutions our customers need.\u201d Bodkin Design & Engineering has recently been working with MassMEP, a resource committed to manufacturing growth in the state of Massachusetts, to grow their OEM business profile. The Company considers this particular opportunity a stepping stone to success in increasing their manufacturing capabilities, as well as helping the state to reach their goals.

Throwaway account because of the topic.\nI\u2019ve been in an amazing relationship for about 14 months now with my boyfriend, whom I love very much. He\u2019s such a sweet, kind, loving person and I consider myself to be super lucky. After coming out of a very sick, abusive relationship, it\u2019s nice to be in a quite healthy relationship.\nAnd the sex is awesome. I\u2019m a very sexual person (been with multiple partners over 5 years), and have really explored my sexuality. I\u2019m kinky as hell (BDSM, masochist, daddy kink, etc.). My boyfriend is on the opposite side of that, though. I\u2019m the first person he\u2019s been with sexually, and he\u2019s just now getting into BDSM, and is beginning to get more rough with me every time we have sex. Which is amazing, might I add!\nHowever, I want to take him outside of his comfort zone. I absolutely love the rush of having sex outside of a house. I love car sex, outdoors sex, behind a building sex, you name it. I love the risk of getting caught, and it\u2019s just an intense feeling! I would love to introduce my boyfriend to this feeling, but he\u2019s very hesitant. He doesn\u2019t want to run the risk of being caught - if I even try to touch his dick through his pants while driving, he gets flustered.\nI definitely understand his concern, but I also want to have him try it at least once. I brought it up to him tonight as he was dropping me off at my place, and he looked so appalled. So, any advice on how to safely and slowly ease him into trying this at least once? I\u2019d like to just do car sex, because I think that\u2019s the easiest and would be the most comforting for him, but I\u2019m just not sure where to begin with easing him into this mindset.

Why should I care what people thought about the clothes I was wearing?\nI once worried about what my hair looked like. But then most of it disappeared, and I just cut what was left myself, into a short crop that looks like I have no hair at all. Why worry about hairstyles, when there\u2019s nothing left to style?\nI stopped worrying about looking old, and became interested in the change instead. I couldn\u2019t do anything about it, and I certainly wasn\u2019t about to endure a lot of painful surgical procedures to restore my youthful look. Better to just stop worrying. And it worked.\nHaving strong opinions is not always acceptable in polite company. But I got to that time when I realised I had been keeping them to myself when meeting new people for far too long. So, I became true to myself, and stopped worrying about what they thought.\nI used to actually worry about all the places I had never seen, and the countries that I had wanted to visit, but never had. It dawned on me that save for a lottery win, that was never going to happen. So I stopped worrying about that too.\nI worried about losing touch with people, especially after moving away to a place that few would ever visit. I tried my best to maintain contact with everyone, but it wasn\u2019t easy. They had their lives to live, and it wasn\u2019t their fault that I had moved 130 miles away. So I stopped worrying about that.\nAs my list of things not to worry about became longer, it got easier to accept more additions.\nFor a long time, I worried about upsetting people with blog comments, or alienating them by writing about things that they didn\u2019t agree with. But one day I realised that a lot of those bloggers were no longer around, and new ones had replaced them. I decided that such things have a way of sorting themselves out, and stopped worrying about them.\nThen I stopped worrying about doing things. So what if I said I would go to the post office today, and didn\u2019t? It will keep until tomorrow, and there is no point worrying about something I didn\u2019t do, when it is too late to do it. The lawn wasn\u2019t cut on the day I said I would do it. No matter, let the grass grow.\nThere is real freedom in not worrying, I assure you. Everyone should try it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:05.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08cfa445ea79afe63376a281da6a18bd62b8aed0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSeV51wHjiU38VCVwS8QJmjpIsMY4G7_XHw_Y6og07vSCjdQ4cDqZfg2pR_2c.5DdpbBNNe53Tq51kiiOdr2I49WxKyLKH05XndsrSKmNIDH0zqC4__M4sQqSqg1AHNt6G5fKboc361W8Uk1ZEMvdgwbCEhDyAQBMtHBqnK.HlDskj5PlQOk.Y9tFoiGIhtrtI-", "site_full": "seminan.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://seminan.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "=Vok\u0102\u2018r #MOSFET #IGBT #Consultant #Semiconductors #SiC #Transistor #SiPM http://www.slideshare.net/EvgenyChernyavski \u2013 seminan", "title": "=Vok\u0102\u2018r #MOSFET #IGBT #Consultant #Semiconductors #SiC #Transistor #SiPM http://www.slideshare.net/EvgenyChernyavski", "title_full": "=Vok\u0102\u2018r #MOSFET #IGBT #Consultant #Semiconductors #SiC #Transistor #SiPM http://www.slideshare.net/EvgenyChernyavski", "published": "2017-12-07T12:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08cfa445ea79afe63376a281da6a18bd62b8aed0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSeV51wHjiU38VCVwS8QJmjpIsMY4G7_XHw_Y6og07vSCjdQ4cDqZfg2pR_2c.5DdpbBNNe53Tq51kiiOdr2I49WxKyLKH05XndsrSKmNIDH0zqC4__M4sQqSqg1AHNt6G5fKboc361W8Uk1ZEMvdgwbCEhDyAQBMtHBqnK.HlDskj5PlQOk.Y9tFoiGIhtrtI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "seminan", "published": "2017-12-07T12:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "=Vok\u0102\u2018r #MOSFET #IGBT #Consultant #Semiconductors #SiC #Transistor #SiPM http://www.slideshare.net/EvgenyChernyavski", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:05.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c2117f87d55dc2f7d65b24dca73a5879627f6856", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfeywdb.AKOplWwQpDr2w2g5XYPH5Q1U1LPBSLeM.LL2MITGQ4fH7AOohxFOoEM34vwujbhkws9xz2L4XYUEmoTG2ztIzKPNhF9mdmVgVHIcg--", "site_full": "confederationhq.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://confederationhq.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Confederation Of Central Government Employees & Workers", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c2117f87d55dc2f7d65b24dca73a5879627f6856", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfeywdb.AKOplWwQpDr2w2g5XYPH5Q1U1LPBSLeM.LL2MITGQ4fH7AOohxFOoEM34vwujbhkws9xz2L4XYUEmoTG2ztIzKPNhF9mdmVgVHIcg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Confederation Of Central Government Employees (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Regarding tests/investigations at private hospitals/diagnostic laboratories/imaging centres empanelled under CGHS/CS(MA) Rules. \n\nClick here to view orders \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:05.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "118d5f04b708d4b8a078523ff3241b46ac02e509", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrkvIihAjYHZrxZT4Awn8P20BM7zfvinpBaMblbt24jJRprGw0BssnGBmHNXctT0p0B0hjU5t_pvp6KroDxoVhA", "site_full": "gall.dcinside.com", "site": "dcinside.com", "site_section": "http://gall.dcinside.com/list.php?id=compose&page=12", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "\uc791\uace1 \uac24\ub7ec\ub9ac", "title": "\uc694\uc998 \uace1\uc4f8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2f9", "title_full": "\uc694\uc998 \uace1\uc4f8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2f9 -

But it stuck with me and I still think about it frequently. It is written by a woman who learns to meditate when she is pregnant, but it is all about her experience of motherhood.\nSomething Drastic, Colleen Curran, novel, 4/5\nMy grandmother loaned me this book. She met the author in Canada. It was a fun read. Basic plot: a woman\u2019s boyfriend leaves her around Christmas time. She is devastated but then discovers a whole new life without him and learns a lot about herself and the people around her.\nAnne\u2019s House of Dreams, LM Montgomery novel, 4/5\nIn 2017 I have got back into the Anne books. This one is set in Anne\u2019s first year of marriage. The book is particularly good because it has a strong sense of possibility in it, tempered with some hard-won maturity on Anne\u2019s part. I appreciated the hope of the ending.\nFebruary \nRilla of Ingleside, LM Montgomery, novel, 5/5\nThis was a new read for me. It is in the Anne series but from her youngest daughter, Rilla\u2019s perspective. I enjoyed this war novel which takes the perspective of the women left at home. Set in WW1 which sparked widespread atheism, I found the theology of the characters interesting.\nThe Little Shop of Happily Ever After, Jenny Colgan, novel, 5/5\nThis novel was like a bowl of chicken soup: comforting in all the right ways. It is the story of a newly retrenched librarian who decides to open her own bookshop out of a van, in Northern Scotland. The heroine was charmingly bookish and the book benefitted from romantic side-plots.\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F***, Mark Manson, non-fiction, 4/5\nBlogger Mark Manson wrote this swaggery self-help guide. The bluster of the title and his style of writing belies the concepts which are pretty basic \u2013 live by your values and also have good values. This book\u2019s worth is in its unique style, which sets it apart from other self-help books.\nFlying Too High, Kerry Greenwood, novel, 4/5\nI had to look up the plot of this novel, which doesn\u2019t bode well, but it is more that the Phryne Fisher novels all blend together. I enjoy Phyrne\u2019s character, her love of expensive things and sleeping with handsome young men, but equally her strong sense of justice and morality.\nMarch \nThe Ocean at the End of the Lane, Neil Gaiman, novel, 5/5\nThis book takes you down in the ocean hidden in the pond at the end of the lane and doesn\u2019t let you go until the last page is closed. I had read it before but still enjoyed the twists and turns. Fantasy blends with reality in a perfectly executed masterpiece.\nMan\u2019s Search For Meaning, Viktor Frankl, non-fiction 5/5\nThis book presents the theory of logotherapy, which deals with the problem of human suffering by finding meaning in life. Frankl puts this theory in the context of his personal experiences in a concentration camp in WW2. Once I got past the gender exclusive language I found this book helpful.\nAnne of Ingleside, LM Montgomery, novel, 4/5\nAnother comfort re-read of an Anne book. In this book Anne is a mature mother of six but is still a starry-eyed dreamer. I both enjoyed and was challenged by the domesticity of this novel. After early ambitions, Anne is now a fulltime homemaker, but maybe that\u2019s a valid vocation?\nApril \nSense and Sensibility, Jane Austen, novel, 5/5\nI recently labelled this my favourite Austen novel. A big call, but I\u2019m making it. I love the sister relationship at the centre. I admire Marianne\u2019s capacity to feel her feelings and Elinor\u2019s superhuman ability to \u2018exert herself\u2019. I made a video at the time about how Marianne has Asperger\u2019s.\nMay \nAmerican Gods, Neil Gaiman, novel, 5/5\nThe version I read of this novel was the equivalent to the \u2018director\u2019s cut\u2019, so it was long but well worth it. There were heavy concepts about gods and culture to digest. Gaiman writes vividly and compellingly, and the ideas, messages and images of the book have stuck with me.\nJune \nStuffocation, James Wallman, non-fiction, 3/4\nI was excited to read this book. His premise is that the world has reached \u2018peak stuff\u2019 and our culture heading from materialism to \u2018experientialism\u2019. Unfortunately, the book was a disappointment. It seemed padded out and found his tone irritating. The ideas are still important, though, and worth a read.\nFirst We Make the Beast Beautiful, Sarah Wilson, non-fiction, 5/5\nI can\u2019t express how amazing this book is. It broke my heart open. Ostensibly about anxiety, it is really about neurodiversity, and how we should stop worrying about being normal, and accept ourselves as we are, mental challenges and all. I recommend this book to anyone who has felt different.\nThe Spark, Kristine Barnett, non-fiction, 5/5\nWriting by mothers of autistic people can be problematic but this book was brilliant. As a childcare worker, the author\u2019s approach was to meet each child where they are in order to unlock into their potential. She took her genius, non-communicative son out of school and it paid off massively.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jacinta tynan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gaiman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james wallman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viktor frankl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark manson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristine barnett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phryne fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elinor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenny colgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerry greenwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jane austen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colleen curran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lm montgomery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marianne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaiman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phyrne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rilla", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of dreams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lm montgomery", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "northern scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ingleside", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:06.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9a8817c65d07f66ac798d33f1ac1531a5665d7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6g0yMyR7roAZqrBJqNgz4W_g5tm3zowaX6MC_OGB3uIil1pFhS1qcbDa4wuuAnA8-", "site_full": "jeffsteinport.livejournal.com", "site": "livejournal.com", "site_section": "https://jeffsteinport.livejournal.com/data/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Jeff Steinport", "title": "Nur vom Edeln kann das Edle stammen\u2014Only from the noble soul can what is noble come.", "title_full": "Nur vom Edeln kann das Edle stammen\u2014Only from the noble soul can what is noble come.", "published": "2017-12-07T10:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/sign.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9a8817c65d07f66ac798d33f1ac1531a5665d7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6g0yMyR7roAZqrBJqNgz4W_g5tm3zowaX6MC_OGB3uIil1pFhS1qcbDa4wuuAnA8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "Nur vom Edeln kann das Edle stammen\u2014Only from the noble soul can what is noble come.", "text": "Next Nur vom Edeln kann das Edle stammen\u2014Only from the noble soul can what is noble come. Fine also denotes a fictitious suit at law, which played the part of a conveyance of landed property. As such, he can entirely repeal the law: for it is the nature of all human laws, to depend upon the will of the maker, not only for their origin, but also for their duration. And now I am content that the word expedient, should more generally be understood of those things which we otherwise call middle things, or things indifferent; as health, wealth, and the like. I could see the transport coming in, and could dimly make out Wood's figure thereon. Hall (1810-1874), later a member of Congress and postmaster-general in his cabinet. Catalogue, British Museum). So long as you live and work, you will not escape being misunderstood; to that you must resign yourself once for all. Besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following the details of her husband\u2019s plans, thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted through her mind. He carried and held the rifle-pits. In Schuking there is also a chapter on Chinese wisdom, where the five elements from which everything is made make their appearance. For instance, it has been asked whether the philosophy of Thales is, properly speaking, Theism or Atheism, [5] whether he asserted a personal God or merely an impersonal, universal existence. His behaviour to others was not only just, true, open, without rudeness, and honourable, but we also see in him an example of the most perfect Attic urbanity; i.e. The officer evidently had complete control of his face, and while Kut\u00fazov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression. \u201cYour honor!\u201d said he. We love peace, as we abhor pusillanimity; but not peace at any price. Let him avoid these vain and uncivil images of authority, this childish ambition of coveting to appear better bred and more accomplished, than he really will, by such carriage, discover himself to be.

My aim is to find topics in those reviews which are perceived either positive or negative. Therefore I performed a LDA on this data where each input row is either a positive or negative review, i.e. my documents are of the two types 'positive review' or \"negative review\". The output of the LDA gives me rather diverse words within each topic, which are not easy to interpret. \nHowever, when summing up the assigned probabilities for positive and negative documents, some of the topics receive clearly more probability mass from either positive or negative documents. I see this as an indicator that the topics are able to separate positive and negative documents. \nIn order to better interpret the output, i wanted to map the top 10 words in each topic of each document to the real vector space with w2v. This is done separately for the positive and negative documents. Then i want to do a k-means clustering on the two sets of vectors. My hope is that i will get clean interpretable clusters where i can take each centroid as a topic. The role of the LDA would then be a dimensionality reduction to a few words instead of the full review before i can do the clustering. \nDoes that approach make sense?
