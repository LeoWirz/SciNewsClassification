Complex geometry and rich textures intrigue viewers who are often surprised to learn that the paintings are in fact both imaginary abstract worlds and human spaces, often filled with water and constantly with an architectural reminiscent.  \nJuan Cruz has moved away from figurative painting and drawing and begun experimenting with large format abstracts pieces. His new work is heavily influenced by life experiences he had while working as an architect in Maui and New York. In both his paintings and drawings Juan Cruz Reverberi use color, light, texture and extensive layers to create abstracts symbols that are extremely colorful and expressive. He has engaged in an intellectual and sophisticated but also a spiritual style since the beginning of his career. He states that part of the process is to paint something that speak back to him while painting, inviting him to experience it in a introspective or inward looking manner.  \nCurrently, he resides in New York, still greatly influenced by Maui\u2019s majestic shoreline, life experiences and a profound respect for the environment. Juan Cruz continues to express his spiritual art. His work appears in public and private collections in the U.S, England, New Zealand and Argentina. In his free time he can be seen windsurfing out East New York or dancing tango in Manhattan. \nThank you for reading this blogpost.

Cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), a family of proteins that are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, are frequently overexpressed or mutated in cancer. Hence, CDK-inhibiting drugs have been developed and evaluated as cancer therapeutics. Clinical trials have shown CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) to be relatively safe and effective, and these are now standard of care treatment for advanced hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Some CDK4/6i drugs are also able to cross the blood brain barrier and may, therefore, offer effective therapy for primary and metastatic central nervous system malignancies. Ongoing research is also evaluating CDK4/6i for additional breast cancer subtypes and non-breast malignancies with promising early phase clinical trial results. Finally, pre-clinical research has identified potential biomarkers for CDK4/6i efficacy and is exploring potential resistance mechanisms to this treatment. Further clinical-translational research is needed to advance patient selection and combinatorial treatment strategies with CDK4/6i in breast cancer and other malignancies.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2k4GJgN", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:43.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7cb61423ec981ca61b15f47e02ca0f849dc1d88e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wApEIwj8x2RG0dUOmOZuheyauCPJLbaZUWzhA_a32TVWMg6ubsyLg", "site_full": "www.vwgolf.net.au", "site": "vwgolf.net.au", "site_section": "http://www.vwgolf.net.au/forumdisplay.php?4", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Parts", "title": "Great cond stock golf r intercooler", "title_full": "Great cond stock golf r intercooler", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.028, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7cb61423ec981ca61b15f47e02ca0f849dc1d88e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wApEIwj8x2RG0dUOmOZuheyauCPJLbaZUWzhA_a32TVWMg6ubsyLg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "the_stig", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Great cond stock golf r intercooler", "text": "Great upgrade for mk5 and mk6 golf gtis, can come with modified gti hoses to suit also.\nLooking for $200 ono\nLocated in adelaide sa, can ship at buyers expense\nAlso on gumtree", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:43.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f6ea0f97e872b7c824fa3153bc7d89712d1cd15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Cae5_sjm.DYpQ5_SlbyQ1utW9ClCYx.j1SSWs5_f7x2AmHboqt2qs", "site_full": "www.bta.bg", "site": "bta.bg", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tennis", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "U.S.-WASHINGTON-CAPITAL CHRISTMAS TREE-LIGHTING - Photos - BULGARIAN NEWS AGENCY", "title_full": "U.S.-WASHINGTON-CAPITAL CHRISTMAS TREE-LIGHTING - Photos - BULGARIAN NEWS AGENCY", "published": "2017-12-07T07:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "BG", "spam_score": 0.214, "main_image": "http://www.bta.bg/gallery/images_620_wm/20171207/4555822_1652731.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f6ea0f97e872b7c824fa3153bc7d89712d1cd15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Cae5_sjm.DYpQ5_SlbyQ1utW9ClCYx.j1SSWs5_f7x2AmHboqt2qs", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T07:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "U.S.-WASHINGTON-CAPITAL CHRISTMAS TREE-LIGHTING - Photos - BULGARIAN NEWS AGENCY", "text": "Twitter \u00a9 2010-2017, \u0411\u0422\u0410 - The content of the information database of the Bulgarian News Agency (BTA or the Agency) and the technologies used thereby, are under protection from the Copyright and Neighboring Rights Act.

Multiple organizations including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend universal screening for distress and depression. Herein, we describe a universal screening program in patients with hematologic malignancies and factors associated with distress and depression. Between December 2013 and February 2015, patients with hematologic malignancies took the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and Distress Thermometer (DT) prior to receiving their first outpatient parenteral chemotherapy. Patient demographic information as well as information regarding visit burden and baseline use of psychiatric medications were recorded. A PHQ-9 score of \u2265\u20099 and a DT score \u2265\u20094 suggested a high risk of major depression and distress. Intergroup comparisons of categorical and continuous variables were performed via chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Multivariate models were constructed using the stepwise selection technique using all potential variables. Two hundred forty-six patients with a median age at diagnosis 65 years (range 18\u201394 years) were included. In the multivariate analysis, a PHQ-9 score \u2265\u20099 was associated with living alone ( P \u2009=\u20090.007), positive PHQ-2 ( P \u2009=\u20090.003), and high Charlson comorbidity index (CCI; P \u2009=\u20090.02), while a DT score \u2265\u20094 was associated with being married ( P \u2009=\u20090.03) and female ( P \u2009=\u20090.03). There was no other association with high scores on either questionnaire. Patients with hematologic malignancies often have prolonged treatment and surveillance. We identified subpopulations within this group who may be at high risk of developing distress and depression and who should be aggressively screened even when universal screening programs are not available.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2kxMnfC", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wilcoxon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national comprehensive cancer network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:44.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f2e649f23c8528aa2a41040963ff7ac77c98077", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUtXeLpuZZWffLwFB0g55MFlTJT98erUVsA--", "site_full": "vk.com", "site": "vk.com", "site_section": "https://vk.com/id383336433", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Vika Murkova", "title": "Vika Murkova", "title_full": "Vika Murkova", "published": "2017-12-02T13:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f2e649f23c8528aa2a41040963ff7ac77c98077", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUtXeLpuZZWffLwFB0g55MFlTJT98erUVsA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Vika Murkova", "published": "2017-12-02T13:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Vika Murkova", "text": "Vika Murkova", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:44.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d3435b32552e5a4b362254d144f99db24e6e7642", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94ou7G2GJrcr7AAxBjuvk4fMP9zgR_4SjiuHmOvJ_H7il_ab_jY3aYT7C6LrELZDtZxTP1sgK95E2GuCNokGMDJvwKFo00H5Mkjkd8RdAG1RdT", "site_full": "www.amazon.ca", "site": "amazon.ca", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.ca/Cancelling-Headphones-Wireless-Bluetooth-Cellphone/product-reviews/B075WWMKVN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_hist_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Noise Cancelling Headphones Wireless Bluetooth Headphones on Ear by Meidong Headphones with Mic 8hs Playing Time for Cellphone Tablet Mp3 MP4 (Black)", "title": "Active Wireless Bluetooth headphone Bluedio T4S (Turbine) Over-ear Swiveling Headset with Mic(White)", "title_full": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Active Noise Cancelling Headphones Wireless Bluetooth headphone Bluedio T4S (Turbine) Over-ear Swiveling Headset with Mic(White)", "published": "2017-09-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a39207a109972509a3985f6c23ca22a8571c7f87", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94ou7G2GJrcr7AAxBjuvk4fMP9zgR_4SjiuHmOvJ_H7il_ab_jY3aYT7C6LrELZDtZxTP1sgK95E2GuCNokGMDJvwKFo00H5Mkjl_29nBxHo52_wz0Gbdi7ws-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Jonathan Par\u00e9", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "J'\u00e9tais sceptique mais s\u00e9rieusement pour le prix wow.

Bluetooth connectivity was surprisingly impressive; it stayed connected rather well over a 30-foot distance with a couple walls between. Active noise reduction works as expected. Not the best for listening to music (you lose much of the lower frequency spectrum), but works remarkably well for cleaning up spoken word when listening to audiobooks, podcasts, and the like.\nThe fit of these is not great if you have a large head. At the widest setting on the adjustment bands, it barely covers the bottom of my ears. This, combined with the extra tension in the headband leads to some significant ear fatigue if you have a larger head.

It these headphones, I have them fully extended and fit my head quite comfortably even when worn for an hour or so. They cup around my ears nicely and isolate a good amount of ambient noise.\nSound: The sound quality is more or less what you would expect for what you pay. With noise cancelation off, the range is not very good. These headphones are definitely bass heavy and lack dynamic range and separation. With that said, they're good enough for podcast use. With active noise cancelation on, the range is even worse and doesn't seem to make much of a difference in cancelling noise. I do not recommend these headphones for audiophiles.\nDurability: These headphones are heavy, lots of metal and seems like they would last a long time. With that said, I haven't traveled with them yet or tossed them around.\nConclusion: I recommend these headphones for people who like bass. The range especially in the mid to highs is lacking which causes a lot of detail in your music to be missed. If you're not overly picky about sound quality and like me mainly use them to listen to podcasts they are wonderful and would recommend these. stars: 4", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:44.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee7d9030ed1241e5d6071c4a8ef0403a5dc5203e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_UDrigpuk92zsA1X3IVX0w", "site_full": "texasfishingforum.com", "site": "texasfishingforum.com", "site_section": "http://texasfishingforum.com/forums/ubbthreads.php/forums/27/1/", "site_categories": ["saltwater_fishing", "freshwater_fishing", "fly_fishing", "sports"], "section_title": "Kayak Fishing | Texas Fishing Forum", "title": "Kayak Tow Behind Bait Cage", "title_full": "Kayak Tow Behind Bait Cage | Kayak Fishing | Texas Fishing Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T17:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.992, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee7d9030ed1241e5d6071c4a8ef0403a5dc5203e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_UDrigpuk92zsA1X3IVX0w", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Phish Matanzas", "published": "2017-12-06T17:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "Kayak Tow Behind Bait Cage", "text": "Had one of these original design Live Bait Mates, and there was a little drag on my boat.

Something we\u2019d all want. Something we all do want \u2013 desperately. A common thing to utter is \u201cxyz is so happy; wish I could be this happy.\u201d\nHold up now. A realization dawns. Feelings are fleeting, wouldn\u2019t you agree? Happiness, sadness, excitement, despair, etc\u2026 all feelings/states. All come and go. Happiness is an illusion blinding most of us, thus keeping us from something far more important. Peace. Contentment. Serenity. \nYou see, if we don\u2019t have inner peace, we have nothing. What is happiness without contentment? Sadness with tranquility can drive one to commit rather irrational acts. Anger without calm can lead an individual to lifetime regret. Contentment needs to be our core. In my opinion, peace comes from acceptance, even when we find it impossible to accept certain happenings. Sigh. There is a way \u2013 a precise system \u2013 through which life works, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re mostly incapable of understanding. The main course of action would be to just accept it. Without a doubt acceptance leads to contentment. Mind you, I\u2019m not talking about accepting what\u2019s wrong. Wrong is wrong, and you do your best to fix that. \nRestlessness of the inner self is suffocating, and powerful enough to make you hit rock-bottom. Understandably, there are outlets that bring us temporary highs and doses of happiness. And in addition to that, also a sense of contentment. From personal experience, most of these fixes aren\u2019t healthy for us in the long run. They have quite the contrary effect. If one was to analyze their fixes, and these fixes we use to aid us, we\u2019ll find that they just act as catalysts to increase the restlessness. \nOn the other hand, there are some among us who have a firm grip on their peace. Happy, sad, angry\u2026 their stance remains the same. I truly believe it\u2019s because they accept, first and foremost, and secondly, because whatever happens they know and believe that it\u2019s all meant to be for the best. \nSo happiness is nothing but a fleeting illusion. Someone\u2019s brief moment of it, that you may perhaps witness, shouldn\u2019t define your goals of happiness. Try and achieve inner peace. It\u2019ll last you a long, long time.

Amanda seems to have it all, absolute perfection. She projects all the accoutrements of a lady who lunches. Sadly, the reality is a soulless home, an unfaithful husband and a very lonely heart. By comparison, in the basement flat, unwanted tenant Tess has spent a lifetime hiding and shutting her heart to love. It takes a bossy doctor, a handsome gardener, a pushy teenager and an abandoned cat to show these two women that sometimes letting go is the first step to moving forward and new friendships can come from the most unlikely situations. Review Tess Cuffe and Amanda King have shared the same house for almost twenty years and yet they know nothing about each other. Amanda has lived in the top three floors of their Georgian townhouse with husband David and their children Casper and Robyn. Tess has lived alone in the basement flat, an unwanted tenant that Amanda and David have battled to be rid of. But both of these women have one thing in common they\u2019re both lonely and as the new year beckons they both begin to question their life choices and slowly the hostility between them begins to thaw. Helped along by a stray cat, a sexy gardener named Carlos, a meddling Doctor and Amanda\u2019s caring daughter Robyn and the pair begin to form an unlikely friendship as they set about resolving the mistakes from their past. This was an incredibly well written story and I can\u2019t believe Faith Hogan is an author I\u2019ve not come across before, her story-telling is so heartfelt and engaging. I loved the journey that Tess and Amanda went on in this book. At the beginning Tess comes across as a grumpy and rather sarcastic old woman and Amanda as a preened and polished airhead, luckily through the flashbacks to their earlier years we realise this is not the case. Both women have deeply hidden passions which have been crushed by unthoughtful men in their lives. This is a wonderful story of friendship, family, love, loss and betrayal. It\u2019s a story about second chances and how it\u2019s never too late to change your life, no matter how old you are. It\u2019s about forgiveness and following your dreams. It\u2019s one of those books where you find yourself just reading one more chapter because you just need to know what happens next. I loved every page of this book and can\u2019t wait to devour more of Faith Hogan\u2019s writing.

Developed by Bell Media, Music Canada and Re:Sound, the new process aligns terrestrial broadcast data with digital, ensuring all music industry stakeholders are served with efficiency, transparency, and accountability, while setting a new industry standard for data reporting. With this game-changing initiative by Bell Media, the automation of the existing music content distribution tool allows the industry to streamline sound recording data within the Canadian music ecosystem. \nThe new system is part of an ongoing project to develop administrative efficiencies by Music Canada and Re:Sound. Through consolidating multiple data sets, maximizing the use of ISRC (International Standard Recording Codes), and other improvements, the project has so far resulted in faster payouts and 28% more revenue for major labels and members of CIMA (the Canadian Independent Music Association). \nBeginning with a successful pilot program of the new system by Toronto\u2019s 104.5 CHUM FM in early 2017, Bell Media radio stations are now tracking complete sound recording data including ISRC automatically on new tracks from major record labels and independent label partners. With the elimination of manual processes, the new reporting system has resulted in cleaner data, which significantly benefits all rights holders in the Canadian music industry including artists, background musicians, songwriters, and music publishers, through organizations (SOCAN, CMRRA, SODRAC, etc.) relying on broadcast data to get royalties to rights holders. \n\u201cI commend Bell Media, and specifically Randy Lennox, for showing remarkable leadership on this project,\u201d says Graham Henderson, President and CEO of Music Canada. \u201cThanks to this collaboration, achievements in data efficiency from projects completed by the major record companies and Re:Sound will now yield even greater results, generating savings throughout the royalty chain, while resulting in more dollars in the pockets of creators.\u201d \n\u201cAs someone with love for Canada\u2019s music industry, I am thrilled by the results of this project,\u201d said Randy Lennox, President, Bell Media. \u201cWhen Music Canada\u2019s Graham Henderson approached us to help resolve what has been a longstanding issue within Canada\u2019s music industry, it was an easy decision to lend Bell Media\u2019s resources and expertise. The automation of the tracking process establishes international best practices that benefit creators while making the entire system considerably more efficient.\u201d \n\u201cAt Re:Sound, we only exist for the artists and sound recording owners we represent,\u201d says Ian MacKay, President of Re:Sound. \u201cEnsuring that the absolute best quality data flows through the entire music ecosystem is a huge step forward for rights holders, and will help us (and other organizations) to ensure that we pay the right people as quickly and efficiently as possible. We couldn\u2019t have done this without the strong leadership of Bell Media and Music Canada.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "graham henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian mackay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "randy lennox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bell media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "music canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canadian independent music association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bell media and music canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "music canada   toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international standard recording codes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isrc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cmrra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sodrac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:45.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68d3f4bd98351cadc00eaf3415c99b09ba69193f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg92paSvURTmQFvhXL_upPg9fPV7TcSTOJdMzk1EGPzU2fkMCEvjazYImkOJEntm8fH1CvkfAukDoXed1YskFbZm", "site_full": "wincoin.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://wincoin.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Win Coin", "title": "Google Alert - litecoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - litecoin", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68d3f4bd98351cadc00eaf3415c99b09ba69193f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg92paSvURTmQFvhXL_upPg9fPV7TcSTOJdMzk1EGPzU2fkMCEvjazYImkOJEntm8fH1CvkfAukDoXed1YskFbZm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Stan Reichenbach (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - litecoin", "text": "litecoin As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS Revolut launches cryptocurrency trading Verdict Mobile banking startup, Revolut is merging traditional banking and cryptocurrency by adding Litecoin and Ether trading to its app-based services.

The second of the Findouters books with a \u201ccat\u201d in the title and theme. In this one, Goon is going away on holiday and is being replaced by a much-friendlier PC Pippin who is in every way Goon\u2019s opposite. However, when it starts off Pippin is quite eager to please Mr Goon though he doesn\u2019t quite believe what he has to say about the children. But Goon\u2019s behaviour towards the children, and particularly Buster soon changes his mind. The children in the meantime have decided to make up a mystery, yet again for Pippin to \u201csolve\u201d\u2015clearly not having learnt very much from their past experiences. Their \u201cmystery\u201d as is usual leads Pippin to stumble onto a real one, a robbery at the village pantomime. Someone has broken into the safe and stolen all that was in it. Goon\u2019s (who is back by then) chief suspect is the pantomime cat Boysie Summers, and his friend, one of the actors Zoe (who plays Dick Whittington). And it doesn\u2019t at all help that Boysie is somewhat slow and can be browbeaten into a confession, while the clues the children \u201cplanted\u201d included a handkerchief with the initial \u201cZ\u201d as well as the cigarette ends of the brand she used, making Goon\u2019s case stronger. So of course, it falls on the children to solve the mystery and clear their names. So starts off a new adventure where the children interview suspects and witnesses, check alibis, and of course, beat Goon to it. But this time around, only just.\nThis one had quite a few of the trademarks of the Findouters books with Fatty using his disguises (mostly to fool poor Goon), Bets stumbling upon the right answer in the nick of time, and quite a bit of food. In fact, on the \u201cfoodmeter\u201d, this one rates the highest so far (plenty of sandwiches and snacks, biscuits and buns). The solution to the mystery had some obvious elements but also some creative ones so it was good fun overall. The children still come across as rather arrogant about their own skills and intelligence, believing themselves \u201cfree\u201d to trick just about anyone, despite obvious disapproval from their parents, and Inspector Jenks. [But without their tricks of course there would be no mystery.] Still, despite this, in this one their behaviour was far better than the previous book with Ern where I felt they simply gave no thought to their actions. I enjoyed their investigation though\u2015approaching the actors and other witnesses, checking alibis, and all in a way that children could do (and Goon certainly couldn\u2019t), but alongside also having fun with a trip to the pantomime and a picnic as well. Overall, this was a fun instalment with an interesting mystery element. \nView all my reviews ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "enid blyton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boysie summers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dick whittington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boysie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenks", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:46.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7712b02c812fe452930941c5b416377655b03ed3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRjqLEK5IXQp9PMZCHADAqILiOTgE1jSgB0nxzOfYMn8NU7pJ_zN8jCZmoch5TFnvw1QUmgxa6ZoNBEvArem_4Pib1Uxe2hsiw-", "site_full": "patient.info", "site": "patient.info", "site_section": "https://patient.info/forums/discuss/browse/citalopram-2618", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Citalopram.

The lab is tucked away in the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology\u2019s Collections Research Center in Bristol. Founded in 1973 by Douglas Anderson, the lab was created as a part of the University\u2019s program in anthropology. It is the \u201cfederal repository for important ethnographic and archaeological collections primarily from northwestern Alaska,\u201d according to its website. In celebration of the Haffenreffer\u2019s 60th anniversary, the museum created an exhibition entitled \u201cNorthern Horizons, Global Visions: J. Louis Giddings and the Invention of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology.\u201d The exhibition, currently held at Manning Hall, explores the life and work of the Haffenreffer\u2019s first director and displays some of the artifacts from the Circumpolar Lab\u2019s collections. Despite its vast archives and rich history, the Circumpolar Lab appears to be largely unheard of by the Brown community. The reason for this seems to be twofold: The Haffenreffer\u2019s Research Center is not open to the public, and it is not located on campus. Nevertheless, individuals involved with the Circumpolar Lab and with Arctic research appreciate the value of the laboratory and the artifacts it houses. A chilly history The history of the Circumpolar Lab begins with the Haffenreffer\u2019s first diector, J. Louis Giddings, said Kevin Smith, deputy director and chief curator of the museum. Until 1955, the museum was privately owned by the Haffenreffer family. But when its founder passed away, the family gave the museum to Brown. Since Brown had no archeology department at the time, the University hired Giddings, a \u201cpioneering Arctic archeologist,\u201d to be its first director, Smith explained. Giddings came to Brown in 1956 and began taking students with him to the Arctic to conduct research, Smith said. The artifacts Giddings and his students excavated came back to Bristol, where they were housed in the Haffeneffer. \u201cUnfortunately in 1964, at the peak of his productivity, Giddings was involved in a car accident and passed away a week later,\u201d Smith said. Douglas Anderson, a former Brown graduate student of Giddings, took over Gidding\u2019s position in the Department of Anthropology and continued on with the Arctic program at Brown. \u201cIn 1973, I established the lab for circumpolar studies,\u201d said Douglas Anderson, emeritus professor of anthropology. He aimed to enable students to take courses in Arctic studies and provide research opportunities for them in Alaska and Northern Canada. When the lab was first established, it was formed as a part of Brown\u2019s program in anthropology, Anderson said. However, \u201cin the last four to five years, the Department of Anthropology has shifted its geographical focus away from the Arctic\u201d and it became clear that \u201cfor the laboratory to function well, it could no longer be a part of the academic program \u2014 it needed to be fully handed over to the (Haffenreffer).\u201d The laboratory continues to be run by the museum in Bristol. The lab today While the lab may be located \u201c19 miles off campus, and it is hard to bring students down to work with the collections,\u201d it still remains \u201cvery active,\u201d Smith explained, adding that in the past 10 years, the lab received almost $2 million in federal grants to conduct research. One of the lab\u2019s ongoing projects concerns viking and medieval archeology. Another research project focuses on \u201cthe roles of women and their production \u2014 from the Canadian Arctic, all the way to Norway and Denmark,\u201d Smith described. The lab is also currently working with x-ray fluorescence, Smith said \u00ad\u00ad\u2014 \u00ada method used to examine the elemental composition of objects, in order to trace where they came from and how far they moved. The collections at the Circumpolar Lab continue to fascinate many researchers. \u201cThe collections we have here go back to the end of the last ice age, spanning 11-12,000 years of pre-history,\u201d Smith described. They consist of various \u201carcheological materials \u2014 anything that has been brought back from the Arctic on expeditions,\u201d Anderson said. The 800,000-850,000 objects in the lab\u2019s collections include a unique pair of snow goggles. Snow goggles, in general, help to keep the glare of the ice and snow from blinding the wearer, Smith said. \u201cBut these ones are actually made to also make the face of the hunter take on the characteristics of the seals that he\u2019s hunting,\u201d he added. \u201cThe holes for the eyes actually have the tear ducts that the seal has.\u201d Another feature that sets Brown\u2019s circumpolar lab and Arctic researchers apart is their approach to consulting with native communities. This originates from Giddings\u2019 own method of collaborating with indigenous groups, which was unlike the reseach of most archeologists at the time and made everything that Brown did \u201cdifferent and important \u2014 and very ethically responsible from a very early time,\u201d Smith explained. Gentis said these consultations with the native peoples have a dual benefit: They enable researchers to identify the artifacts and understand how they were used and give indigenous communities \u201ca window into their past.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "liyaan maskati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haffenreffer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. louis giddings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gentis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gidding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giddings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anderson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "circumpolar lab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "circumpolar laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haffenreffer museum of anthropology\u2019s collections research center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haffenreffer museum of anthropology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giddings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "research center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of anthropology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "northern canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bristol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manning hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "circumpolar lab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arctic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:46.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a2ac4182ab01a6b9e41ed28807a8cbb647e1c180", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnd0ER29vKNus-", "site_full": "www.blowoutforums.com", "site": "blowoutforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.blowoutforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=6", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "BASKETBALL - Blowout Cards Forums", "title": "Goodbye Balls", "title_full": "Goodbye Balls - Blowout Cards Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T12:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 23, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "79404b6b0335aaf4e94681883b277fe21c2d0a6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnB6hUQEjem1UUP9G4BB.KzYnkPmmvjJT7", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "yankeesfan24", "published": "2017-12-06T14:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : Exactly.

The Conservative leader and byelection candidate weren't shopping just to soothe a sugar craving. They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they're pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck \nSURREY, B.C. \u2013 Inside a colourful candy shop in a bustling Vancouver suburb, Andrew Scheer and Kerry-Lynne Findlay marvelled at delicate British chocolate bars, chewy Red Vines and an edible Monopoly board. \nThe Conservative leader and byelection candidate weren\u2019t shopping just to soothe a sugar craving. They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they\u2019re pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. \n\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I\u2019m paying a lot higher taxes than I was before. I\u2019m being called a tax cheat because I\u2019m an entrepreneur with a small business,\u2019\u201d said Findlay, 62, a former national revenue minister. \nThe riding is one of four across Canada where a byelection will be held Monday, but it\u2019s anticipated to be the closest race. Conservative Dianne Watts won by just 1,400 votes over the Liberal candidate in 2015, while the NDP placed a distant third. \nThe vote arrives midway through Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s term and it\u2019s expected to test his popularity, as well as the potential of rookie leader Scheer, ahead of the 2019 election. Both men have visited the riding twice and both have suggested the outcome will indicate whether the Liberal surge of 2015 is continuing or waning. \n\u201cTwo years ago, in the election, Canadians didn\u2019t randomly or suddenly change who we are,\u201d Trudeau said at a recent rally to support Liberal candidate Gordie Hogg, 71. \n\u201cWe have always been progressive, forward-thinking, open, compassionate, ambitious people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just about getting a government that recognizes that.\u201d \nSouth Surrey-White Rock has older, wealthier and whiter demographics than other ridings in Surrey, which is the fastest-growing city in Metro Vancouver. It\u2019s home to a picturesque waterfront and an array of restaurants, shops and other small businesses. \nIn July, Trudeau\u2019s government announced plans to close loopholes that it said have allowed high-earning business owners to avoid higher taxes. The measures included changes to \u201cincome sprinkling,\u201d which allows owners to split income among family members. \nAfter a backlash, the government said it would cut the small business tax rate from 10.5 per cent to nine per cent by 2019. \nHogg said he and Trudeau are committed to cutting taxes for small businesses, while the Conservatives voted against a tax cut in 2015 for \u201cmiddle-class\u201d Canadians earning between about $45,000 and $90,000 a year. \n\u201cTo me, their record is more important than their rhetoric,\u201d said Hogg. \u201cThis byelection is about electing the strongest positive voice for our community, and only Justin Trudeau and I have a positive plan to strengthen our middle class and offer real help for families.\u201d \nThe seat became vacant after Watts resigned to run for leader of the B.C. Liberal Party, an informal coalition of federal Conservatives and Liberals. \nByelections will also be held in Battlefords-Lloydminster in Saskatchewan, previously held by the Conservatives; Bonavista-Burin-Trinity in Newfoundland, a Liberal seat; and Scarborough-Agincourt in Ontario, also won by the Liberals in the last election. \nIn South Surrey-White Rock, Hogg has name recognition and deep roots. He was White Rock mayor for 10 years before being elected to the B.C. legislature for two decades. Findlay, meantime, represented Delta-Richmond East in Parliament from 2011 to 2015. \nAsked about her connection to the riding, Findlay said her parents lived in the community and she has also lived there at various points, including after she was widowed at 34 and was raising her children alone. She said she moved to White Rock this summer. \nThe NDP candidate is Jonathan Silveira, 40, a real estate agent and founder of advocacy group Surrey Kids Matter. He said the byelection was an opportunity to train new volunteers and strengthen relationships, but added he was serious about winning. \n\u201cThere are two big sharks fighting here. I am not afraid of the fight as well,\u201d he said. \nNew Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has not joined Silveira in the riding. \nTrudeau\u2019s recent rally with Hogg in Surrey drew hundreds. Some were not local voters, however, including a Syrian refugee who said she wanted to thank Trudeau, and a visitor from Singapore who wanted to see the famous Canadian politician in person. \nThe prime minister is pictured alongside Hogg on campaign signs, indicating confidence among Liberals in Trudeau\u2019s popularity. \nScheer and Findlay, however, said they\u2019ve heard from people who have \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d after voting Liberal in 2015. \nIt\u2019s hard to predict a general election based on byelections, Scheer added, because the latter generally have lower turnouts, and local issues become amplified over national ones. \n\u201cBut I think we would love to send a signal, mid-term, that what the Liberals have been doing for Canadians isn\u2019t working.\u201d \n\u2014 Follow @ellekane on Twitter.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew scheer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trudeau", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "laura kane", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "scheer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerry-lynne findlay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dianne watts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gordie hogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jagmeet singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonavista-burin-trinity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "findlay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan silveira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silveira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dyck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watts", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "b.c. liberal party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surrey kids matter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ndp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "surrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metro vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south surrey-white rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newfoundland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saskatchewan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarborough-agincourt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "battlefords-lloydminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surrey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:48.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2825b5a802225444f808f252c59135c4e9113e35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxaFDXgYKl3HrQ--", "site_full": "forums.moneysavingexpert.com", "site": "moneysavingexpert.com", "site_section": "http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.php?f=33", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Old Style MoneySaving - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "title": "Repurposing a piano?", "title_full": "Repurposing a piano?

(Markus Schreiber/Associated Press) By Associated Press By Associated Press December 7 at 4:23 AM \nBERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s center-left Social Democrats are discussing Thursday whether to open talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives on extending their governing coalition, or at least backing a minority government. \nThe Social Democrats\u2019 leadership insisted the party would go into opposition after a disastrous election result in September. It reinforced its refusal to join a new coalition after Merkel\u2019s talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. \nHowever, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear that he doesn\u2019t want a new election, and Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz reversed course. \nAt a previously scheduled party congress Thursday, Schulz is seeking members\u2019 approval for a resolution approving talks on \u201cwhether and in what form\u201d the Social Democrats can support a new government. \nHowever, some members \u2014 including the party\u2019s youth wing \u2014 want to specifically rule out another coalition, leaving only a minority government or a new election as options. Merkel has said she is \u201cvery skeptical\u201d about leading a minority government, which hasn\u2019t yet been tried in post-World War II Germany. \nSocial Democrat parliamentary group chief Andrea Nahles said the collapse of Merkel\u2019s talks with other parties produced an unexpected new situation. \n\u201cWe can\u2019t play the ostrich and stick our heads in the sand,\u201d she said. \nThe Social Democrats have been part of Germany\u2019s government for 15 of the past 19 years \u2014 first leading a center-left government under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder from 1998 to 2005, then twice governing in a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d under Merkel, from 2005 to 2009 and again from 2013 until now. \nThe party suffered historically poor election results after both Merkel coalitions, with support slumping to a post-war low of 20.5 percent in September. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

2017 4:00 am EST Laura Babcock is shown in a Toronto Police Service handout photo. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Toronto Police Service MANDATORY CREDIT \nTORONTO \u2013 The judge at the trial of two men accused of killing a young Toronto woman five years ago and then burning her body is to begin his legal instructions to the jury today. \nDellen Millard and Mark Smich have pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the presumed death of 23-year-old Laura Babcock. Babcock\u2019s body has not been found. \nIn its closing address on Wednesday the Crown said a \u201cmountain\u201d of circumstantial evidence points to Millard and Smich killing Babcock at Millard\u2019s home some time after 8 p.m. on July 3, 2012 and then disposing of her body at Millard\u2019s farm near Waterloo, Ont. \nThe prosecution alleges Babcock was killed after becoming the odd woman out in a love triangle with Millard and his girlfriend. \nSmich\u2019s lawyer told the jury on Wednesday that his client had no motive to kill Babcock because he was never part of a love triangle and all the Crown has is a rap song in which Smich says he killed a girl and burned her body. \nMillard, who represented himself, told the jury in his closing address Tuesday that several witnesses testified to having seen or heard from Babcock after July 4, 2012.

A Reuters analysis of port and ship tracking data showed that oil tankers have turned away from Hudaydah, without unloading. \nThe United Nation's body tasked with inspecting ships seeking to enter the area said on Wednesday that the Saudi-led coalition have denied tankers permission to enter the Red Sea port despite its approval, \"and repeated attempts by the vessels to proceed.\" A spokesperson for the UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism for Yemen (UNVIM) said the coalition has turned away up to 12 tankers in recent weeks, adding, \"UNVIM is unable to say when the coalition will allow fuel tankers to enter Yemen\u2019s Red Sea ports' anchorage areas.\" Hudaydah records showed that at least six oil tankers were ordered to leave the port before unloading last month. Captain Mohammed Ishaq, executive chairman of the Yemen Red Sea Ports Corporation, which runs Hudaydah, said on Tuesday that no fuel shipments had reached the port since Saudi Arabia imposed the blockade last month. On November 6, Saudi Arabia announced that it was shutting down Yemen\u2019s air, sea, and land borders, after Yemeni fighters targeted an international airport near the Saudi capital with a cruise missile in retaliation for Saudi\u2019s devastating aerial bombardment campaign against Yemen. The United Nations made a plea for the Saudi-led coalition to remove its blockade, warning that without aid shipments \u201cuntold thousands of innocent victims, among them many children, will die\u201d and that its partial lifting was not enough. The lack of fuel means areas hardest hit by Saudi aggression, malnutrition and cholera lack functioning hospital generators and water pumps. It also makes it harder to move food and medical aid across the country. Residents of Hudaydah said the fuel shortage has pushed up the prices of existing fuel and other products. Iman Ahmed, a 43-year-old teacher, said in late November the high price of diesel was having a devastating effect in rural areas outside Hudaydah. \"Fishermen have stopped working because of warships and coalition airstrikes. Farmers have stopped work because of a sharp rise in the price of diesel.\" Meanwhile, a 43-year-old father of seven said, \"Life has become so hard.\u201d \"Before the war things were going OK, there were jobs. I was able to feed my family. Now ... gas is barely available and basic necessities cost double. Most of the time our food is now bread and tea,\" Abdo Haidar added. Saudi Arabia has been incessantly pounding Yemen since March 2015 in an attempt to crush the popular Houthi Ansarullah movement and reinstate the former Yemeni president, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, who is a staunch ally of the Riyadh regime. More than 12,000 people have been killed since the onset of the campaign more than two and a half years ago. Much of the Arabian Peninsula country's infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and factories, has been reduced to rubble due to the war.
