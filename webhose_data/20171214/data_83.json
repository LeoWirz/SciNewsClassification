The levels of misinformation and expectation is yuge!. It doesn't matter how successful SC becomes. It could become the critical gaming success of all time. It doesn't matter. Because of the long development time and the high level of ambition, large groups of people WANT this game to fail, just to see it crash and burn.\nWhat do you mean \"fake news\"? There is essentially very little \"news\" when it comes to SC, except when they launch a bunch of new ship concepts and try to sell everyone on the game play \"concepts\" they envision adding.\nWhen you consider just development costs, SC is turning into the single most expensive PC video game ever created. And it's being done via crowdfunding, which of course raises the level of scrutiny. Instead of having a single publisher or company behind the game, you have about 1.5 million people who've thrown money in the pile to help this come to life. And when you couple that with the fact that Chris Roberts and company have been openly touting how incredibly ambitious this project is and how they're looking to put all other video games to shame with this project, you bait the skeptics into paying more attention to it.\nFurther combined with their own tendency to throw hype-oline on the hype-fires themselves, and it is what it is. This isn't some crazy conspiracy that Star Citizen is being a victim of. Every time they raise the funding bar...from $10 million to $20 million to $50, $100, $150+ million, they turn up the volume on expectations. But that's been their choice. They CHOSE to sell land grants at $50-100. They CHOSE to release a new battleship at $650. They're CHOOSING to spend time on a community contest that let's people pick the next funding grab. They're making their bed, and I don't think we need to bring ridiculous political metaphors into this discussion as a means to detract from the discussion around the fact that at some point they're also going to have to sleep in it.\nAnd I'll stick by my comment above. I truly 100% believe we WILL absolutely get the game that was laid out in the original Kickstarter. But it's not going to be this universe changing monster of a game. It'll still be a great game. And ultimately, if people have fun playing it...does it matter if by accounting or industry standards it should've cost $20-50 million to make, even if the final \"cost\" ends up being north of $200 million? No, it doesn't.\nProud member of Unrepentant Gaming !

That's my reference. I know typing more than 5 letters on the internet is hard, but do you have more to offer than \"lol no\".\nAnd going back to Destiny...develop AND market is the kicker here. For a lot of games, the marketing costs way more than the actual production costs. You could assume some of that $170+ million from SC is going into \"marketing\" when you consider costs for the website and those flashing concept videos/brochures. But one would also hope a lot of that money is actually being used to create the game. If someone has facts otherwise to dispute that, I'm open to seeing any sort of breakdown estimate on what RSI has actually spent developing SC versus marketing. If they've said, \"Hey, it's only going to actually cost us $50 million to make SC, but to be a real blockbuster we'll need to spend $150 million to market it\", I'm down to read more about that.\nBut just like Hollywood has made thousands and thousands of movies, and it's easy to point to X movie being \"one of the most expensive\", I think my claim here is reasonable with SC, unless someone can provide data otherwise.\nEDIT: Here's another article a quick googling provided me: https://nowloading.co/p/top-10-most-expensive-video-games-ever-made/4217547\nAgain, if people disagree with the facts here, I'm open to seeing other data. I'm also open to discussion on whether or not we should proportion up the $170 million SC has raised into X% for Development and Y% for Marketing.\nironzerg on December 6\nProud member of Unrepentant Gaming !

Didn't mean to be snippy, so let me make up for it by explaining why I just lolled and said no.\nAs Campy said, I do indeed work in the industry myself (at a mid-sized studio owned by a large publisher), and while that gives me an idea of the amount of time and manpower required to create modern games, it doesn't give me magical insight into the cost and budgeting of studios, so let's just get that out of the way first. The allotted budgets and actual costs for games (we'll get to the difference in a bit) are generally kept well enough under wraps, because they are important trade secrets. You don't want your competitors to know how deep your pockets are, and how much you're spending on a game aimed to be a competitor to one of theirs, because it tells them how much you estimate the release will earn you, which lets them make educated guesses about what's going on behind your closed doors, and so on and so forth.\nWith that in mind, any and all budget information about released games we hear about are to be regarded as hearsay at best, PR at worst.\nThe 10k per month per developer rule gives you a much better ballpark for the actual cost of games. So let's apply that to something like CoD: WW2: 225 people at Sledgehammer games according to Wikipedia, times 36 months development cycle, gives us a ballpark development budget of $81mil. This does not yet factor in the budget required for performance capture sessions with actors, art outsourcing, or the marketing budget, which is going to be at least as high as the development budget for high profile titles like this. You're easily looking at a budget of $200+mil, and that's for a well-managed title in an established production pipeline (all of which brings costs down). Look instead at something like GTA V with its alleged 1000 developers (a doubtful number, and probably not all concurrent) and 5 year development cycle and that's quite a different ballpark ($600mil) - but then again it also made $1bil in the first few days of sales alone, so I'd say it was probably worth it.\nIt's also important to realize that all the crowdfunded money that is used on Star Citizen goes into both marketing and development. Anything we see on their website - every new ship concept or model, every single video (they produced a whole fricking reality tv casting show), is created in equal parts for the sake of the game and for the sake of raising more money. It's kind of ironic, really: we're paying a developer to market to us the thing that we're paying for. I mean really, their PR is highly laudable: it's without exception very well written, and doled out at a far higher frequency than other developers' paltry dev blogs. But it has to be:\nAccording to LinkedIn, there are 271 people listing Cloud Imperium Games as their employer. Some of those are probably ex-employees, and some other employees probably don't use LinkedIn, and there are probably a bunch of fakes in there as well. So if we assume:\n- a head count of 250 people for a nice round number, and\n- that they created the initial prototype that was shown in the Kickstarter campaign with a small but sweet team of 10 people, and\n- that their growth has been linear (in the absence of more precise data),\nthen that lets us use the midpoint average of 130 people over the time period as a ballpark figure to estimate development cost (not budget). The Kickstarter concluded in November 2012 (Jesus fuck, that long ago?), which puts the development cost from Kickstarter to present at $78mil. (Yay napkin math!) This, again, does not figure in marketing budget, but as I said earlier: in the type of development Star Citizen practices, you can't separate the two as neatly. Importantly, it also doesn't include external costs for all the studios they outsource to. So, with all that, I'd be very surprised if they have much of a financial buffer - they've got to be relying on the money that keeps coming in to keep development going. If interest were to wane significantly, and people would stop buying ships or refunding en masse, they could very quickly run out of cash. So they HAVE to keep pushing and marketing this to us, which in turn informs development priorities. This whole thing has got to be a project management and producing nightmare.\nIn a traditional developer-publisher relationship, a game is scoped out by the developer, and then pitched to the publisher with a set budget in mind. The publisher then checks whether they think the product will earn them a profit based on the projected costs and a ton of external factors and experience, and then greenlights the project. Often development is based around milestones, which the developer has to complete in order to unlock the next chunk of funding - this is done so that the publisher can be sure that the developer will manage to hit the target, and stop funding or adjust projections if it looks like the project is going off the rails. The publisher is footing much of the bill, so this is a necessary and important part of traditional development.\nStar Citizen doesn't have any of those built-in touchpoints or checks and balances, they only have us - who, as a collective group, know very little about the behind-the-scenes realities of production. I can only imagine what their budgeting method looks like, but I wouldn't be surprised if the most efficient way for them to go about it is not dissimilar from common F2P business and budgeting models. That means relying on KPIs and metrics to project and constantly adjust confidence in your projected budgets... but that side of the business doesn't have a lot of appeal to me. But the point is: it's a mistake to confuse the big bold number in the fundraising ticker with the actual scheduled budget, or with the money they've spent on development (or will have spent at the end).\nIn closing, so you don't the wrong idea, I'd like to stress: most of this is just educated guesswork and speculation. I have no insight into what goes on behind the scenes of Star Citizen's development, I only have some insights into established practices of traditional development, and can make slightly more educated guesses based on those. As a future player who bought in with a lot more money than I would have spent on this in retail, I'm bitter that my favorite ship seems to have landed on the lowest rung of the priority ladder; as a sci-fi fan, I love the steady stream of gorgeous spaceship porn they pump out, and can't wait for more, even knowing the final product will likely be far below my expectations; but as a developer, I am mostly fascinated and terrified by its production, and very much looking forward to the inevitable postmortem 5 years after its eventual release or cancellation.\nThat was extremely insightful and informative.

One fan asked Anderson how to lose weight quickly when there\u2019s a big event or party coming up.\nAnderson, who has worked with Jennifer Lopez and Madonna, said that losing 14 pounds in four weeks is possible as long as carbs and gluten are removed from the meal plan. Some readers noted that the advice was too drastic. Other claimed that a sudden change in diet could be harmful for anyone.\nGoop released a statement to E! News to clarify their stand on the issue. \u201cWe would never advocate for an unhealthy diet or extreme routine. As Tracy said in the interview, you should make choices based on what is best for your individual body,\u201d the statement read.\nMeanwhile, Anderson\u2019s claims were challenged by nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert, who told Independent that she was shocked by what she read online. More specifically, the Harley Street nutritionist debunked Anderson\u2019s claims that cutting out gluten and carbs from one\u2019s diet could speed up weight loss.\n\u201cIt is not sensible to eliminate whole food groups or make drastic dietary changes which are not sustainable,\u201d she said.\nOn Wednesday, a spokesperson for Anderson said that the fitness guru has ample experience in the field of weight loss, diet and exercise.\n\u201cOver the course of her 20-year career, Tracy has consistently practiced owning a 1-2 lb. weight loss per week when someone has unhealthy weight to lose. Owning a 1-2 lb. weight loss per week is different than simply dropping 1-2 lbs. per week, which causes people to hold onto unhealthy weight. Of the 14 lbs. that someone could effectively lose in a month \u2013 if they have excess weight on them \u2013 the goal is to own 8 lbs. of that, which is aligned with Tracy\u2019s practice of not living on extreme diets,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nAs of late, Paltrow, the owner of the lifestyle brand and retailer has not yet commented regarding the issue.\n\nWill Gwyneth Paltrow release a statement regarding the recent controversy that Goop is involved in?

He hopes to become the state\u2019s first openly gay member of Congress. \nGray announced he\u2019s running for the state\u2019s 6th Congressional District on Tuesday (5 December). \nHe\u2019ll face off against fellow Democrats Amy McGrath, Reggie Thomas, and Geoff Young. Whoever wins the May primary will then take on Rep. Andy Barr, a Lexington Republican in his third term. \nWhile Gray is the presumed favorite, there are plenty of chances for progress to win. \nGray would become the state\u2019s first gay member of Congress. However, if Thomas wins, he\u2019ll become the state\u2019s first black member of Congress, and if McGrath wins, she\u2019ll be the state\u2019s first woman elected to Congress as a Democrat. \n\u2018We need to bring people together; we need to reach across partisan lines,\u2019 Gray said in his announcement. \n\u2018This is why I\u2019m running for Congress. Lexington, fortunately, is on the right path. Our country is not. And this is the time for citizens, for leaders to step up.\u2019 \nHis decision to run for Congress also means he won\u2019t be running for a third term as Lexington\u2019s mayor. \nGray previously ran for Congress last year when he challenged Senator Rand Paul. While he didn\u2019t win, he did become the state\u2019s first openly gay Senate candidate. Got a news tip? Want to share your story?

Doug Collins, who personally had a concealed carry permit for what described as self-defense reasons. \u201cI don\u2019t think that right should be undermined simply because I travel to another state.\u201d \nThe bill of course will now head to the Senate, and we will keep you posted on its advance towards the President\u2019s desk. \nNew additions were made to the bill that address the NICS background check process, as well as an address to bump stocks after the massacre in Las Vegas. Advertisement \nCNN.com reports; \nMany Democrats were also incensed that the bill was merged with two other measures with bipartisan support. One would fill in holes in the National Criminal Instant Background Check system (NCIS) that were highlighted after a mass shooting at a Texas church last month, in which the gunman, a former Air Force member, was able to buy guns even though he had a criminal record that the military failed to report to the database. \nThe other would direct the Bureau of Justice Statistics to study all crimes involving firearms and report back to Congress in six months about how many involved weapons with \u201cbump fire stocks,\u201d accessories that can allow semi-automatic weapons guns to fire at a rate similar automatic ones. The shooter responsible for killing 58 people and injuring nearly 500 more attending a Las Vegas concert in October used bump stocks to direct large amounts of ammunition on the crowd, and members from both parties have called for ban on them. \nIt won\u2019t be long until we see how this will play out.

However, this premise is about to change, as Spreadtrum recently formed an alliance with the Chinese smartphone manufacturer Leagoo , this with the aim of introducing the first Spreadtrum processors based on Intel\u2019s Airmont architecture into the company\u2019s mobile phones. The first to do this is the Leagoo T5C, which is the undisputed protagonist of this article that we bring to you. \nThe T5C is the renewal of the Leagoo T5 , a basic range mobile that we reviewed months ago. However, it is not a re-edition where only a handful of features are improved and launched on the market as a new mobile, at all, since the Leagoo T5C has the honor of being the first mobile to incorporate a processor Spreadtrum SC9853i of eight cores at 1.8GHz, which features a lithograph of 14nanometros and is based on Airmont Intel architecture. \nREAD MORE: Leagoo T5C with 3GB RAM and dual rear cameras: Specs Review &amp; Price Design and display of the Leagoo T5C \nThe Leagoo T5C has a fairly normal style, which is not at the service of the design without bevels that is so fashionable nowadays among mobile manufacturers, but even, so it is a good design that combines a body of one piece (Unibody) with a metal construction . As you can see in the images, this device sports a rear cover with 3D curvature and a 2.5D crystal on the front. \nA highlight of the Leagoo T5C is its thickness, which is only 7.9 millimeters , which is very positive for a Phablet for tight budgets. You cannot miss mentioning the presence of a fingerprint reader on the start button. \nThe screen uses a 5.5-inch IPS panel that displays an FHD resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and offers wide viewing angles of up to 178 degrees . Its manufacturer assures that said screen provides an excellent visual experience with a reasonable level of brightness, saturation of colors and contrast. As mentioned above, the screen has a 2.5D glass cover that contributes significantly to the aesthetic and ergonomic factor of the device. The first mobile with Spreadtrum SC9853i processor \nAs mentioned at the beginning of this entry, the Leagoo T5C is the first to make use of a Spreadtrum SC9853i eight-core processor at 1.8GHz . This CPU is based on Intel\u2019s Airmont architecture and promises to be up to 39% more powerful than the typical Mediatek MTK6750 SOC that we are used to seeing in this price range. \nThis Chip was launched in August 2017, and this will be the first time we see it in action, it is also worth mentioning that it is aimed at the mid-range and that in theory, it consumes 30% less energy compared to the competition. \nA Mali-T820 GPU also backs the device for an unmatched graphical experience and 3GB of RAM (Samsung brand) for multitasking operations. At the same time, there is 32GB of ROM memory provided by Sandisk (expandable by Micro-SD up to 128GB) and a non-removable 3000mAh battery, which has a 5V2A fast charge and promises a battery life of up to 36 hours with use Normal and 8 hours of continuous video playback. Cameras \nThe photographic section consists of a dual camera with a Samsung sensor of 13.0MP + Omnivision sensor of 2.0MP. This lens has a diaphragm aperture f / 2.2 and an ultra-pixel size of 1.12um. \nThe front camera is 5.0MP and is equipped with a LED flash with soft light for high-quality selfies. The Leagoo T5C also has a Hi-Fi Chip for high definition audio \nOperating system and other features \nThe operating system of the Leagoo T5C is none other than Android 7.0 Nougat, and it is known that the mobile will support the CAT 6 protocol as well as 4G networks, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and Dual-VoLTE. The supported bands and frequencies are the following: 2G: GSM 850/900/1800 / 1900MHz 4G: FDD-LTE 800/850/900/1800/2100 / 2600MHz TDD-LTE B40 The Leagoo T5C also has a Hi-Fi Chip for high definition audio Leagoo T5C: Table of specifications Basic information ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "phablet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leagoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exynos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sandisk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airmont intel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gpu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "airmont", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:51.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5368c0f676f2861c411a73249dcbeee7f228a2c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DoCSMKlD.W1nmWAPxWK9yIsUA0LdIgmmXERgmvbpj__pocZBSa.1aOGzy.bqKGQw-", "site_full": "www.disco3.co.uk", "site": "disco3.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.disco3.co.uk/forum/webasto-fuel-burning-heater-vf96.html", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "DISCO3.CO.UK - View Forum - Webasto Fuel Burning Heater", "title": "Fbh helpppp", "title_full": "DISCO3.CO.UK - View topic - Fbh helpppp", "published": "2017-12-05T23:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85cd44f8f8fb0ff9029476f509635f59af02aa94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DoCSMKlD.W1nmWAPxWK9yIsUA0LdIgmmXERgmvbpj__pocZBSa.1aaoEg_PKfr2qXxEs1pBUYNg--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Braduurs", "published": "2017-12-06T00:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Edenbridge is fine for me also\nI'll speak to Geoff when I get a min to as I have a couple of other bits to sort also.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:51.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18c33f486f78ec6ac78f108d85206483d7143591", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_PiFE8RGgjV2OUwbmB6Curp3ILUNiFrnLyB_i6dkUNY11m7lvsetDKpMlTcVe.S0QDHGlPENsmNWwSfS0qlsdBJU3s3qufmgU-", "site_full": "www.ibtimes.com", "site": "ibtimes.com", "site_section": "http://ibtimes.com//rss/media-culture", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "International Business Times", "title": "\u2018Midnight, Texas\u2019 Canceled Or Renewed For Season 2?", "title_full": "\u2018Midnight, Texas\u2019 Canceled Or Renewed For Season 2?", "published": "2017-12-07T10:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/12/06/francois-arnaud-manfred.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1909, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 2, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "18c33f486f78ec6ac78f108d85206483d7143591", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_PiFE8RGgjV2OUwbmB6Curp3ILUNiFrnLyB_i6dkUNY11m7lvsetDKpMlTcVe.S0QDHGlPENsmNWwSfS0qlsdBJU3s3qufmgU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Christian Saclao", "published": "2017-12-07T10:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u2018Midnight, Texas\u2019 Canceled Or Renewed For Season 2?", "text": "It\u2019s already been two months since \u201cMidnight, Texas\u201d ended its freshman run, but NBC has yet to announce whether the supernatural drama will return for Season 2. While the network\u2019s silence about the fate of the series is worrisome, there\u2019s one hopeful sign that fans haven\u2019t seen the last of Manfred and his crew.\nAccording to TVLine , the Peacock Network is in discussions with key cast members about a potential second season.\nAlthough the series has yet to be renewed for another season, executive producer Monica Owusu-Breen already has plans in place for the potential sophomore run.\nIn an interview with TVLine last September, Owusu-Breen said that Season 2 will explore the effects of Manfred\u2019s (Fran\u00e7ois Arnaud) decision to ingest multiple evil spirits to defeat Colcannar. \u201cManfred took an enormous risk doing that,\u201d Owusu-Breen said. \u201cWhat does it mean to take on evil, even if you\u2019re doing that for good? I think that\u2019s a question that Manfred, knock on wood, will be exploring next season.\u201d\nOwusu-Breen also revealed that fans could expect Bobo (Dylan Bruce) and Fiji (Parisa Fitz-Henley) to be still together at the beginning of the potential new season. \u201cBobo and Fiji have suffered so much [in Season 1 that] they deserve to not immediately break up,\u201d the exec producer told TV Insider . \u201cBut Bobo has a neo-Nazi family out there, and there\u2019s violence in that man we haven\u2019t explored much. He can be pretty dark!\u201d\nAs for newlyweds Lem (Peter Mensah) and Olivia (Arielle Kebbel), Owusu-Breen said that the latter\u2019s complicated past may cause trouble in their marriage. \u201cOlivia has a past of abject horror and abuse,\u201d Owusu-Breen said of the freelance assassin. \u201cAnd though Lem can leech her pain away for a while, it doesn\u2019t stop it. If we\u2019re lucky enough to get a second season, there\u2019s lot to explore with [the theme of] what does it mean to be married when one character has so much pain and unresolved history?\u201d\nArnaud confirmed to SYFY WIRE that Olivia\u2019s father is paying Madonna (Kellee Stewart) to spy on Olivia and make sure that she doesn\u2019t suddenly vanish. Although Madonna seems to have a lot of affection for the Midnighters, Owusu-Breen said that the diner manager has her own \u201cdark backstory.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s an Olivia/ Madonna story that\u2019s begging to be told,\u201d said the exec producer.\nWould you like to see a second season of \u201cMidnight, Texas\u201d?

airwaves. It is evident that the industry has grown in leaps and bounds over the years. Here we look at some Kenyan hits that topped the charts in 2017. Bablas- The Kansoul \nReleased in March, \u201cBablas\u201d is one of the most played songs of 2017 on local stations and in clubs. The lyrics of the song have become common phrases for young Kenyans both online and offline. The Kansoul is a Genge group made up of award-winning artists: Mejja, Madtraxx, and KidKora. All the artists have had successful solo careers, and they have churned out hits such as \u201cLandlord\u201d by Mejja and \u201cBoda Boda\u201d by Madtraxx. On this hit, the Kenyan group has come with a different style of a Dancehall Afrobeat feel on the beat. \u201cBablas\u201d has had over 1.5 million views and counting on Youtube. I do- Willy Paul and Alaine \nWhen Jamaican-American reggae singer and songwriter Alaine teamed up with award-winning gospel artist Willy Paul to release a song, it definitely had to be a hit. \u201cI Do\u201d is a beautiful wedding song that is now played by many during the special occasion. The video also created a lot of buzz when it was released. Alaine is known for her hit songs like \u201cNo Ordinary Love\u201d and \u201cBye Bye Bye\u201d, while Willy Paul is known for hits like \u201cJigi Jigi\u201d and \u201cKitanzi\u201d. As for \u201cI Do\u201d, the song currently has 4.3 million YouTube views and continues to gain more. Attention- Vivian ft. Redsan \nVivian, a popular Kenyan musician, teamed up with award-winning dancehall artist Redsan to give us \u201cAttention\u201d. The song is a beautiful hit that amalgamates her singing style with his dancehall vibe. \u201cAttention\u201d is a captivating collabo that translates to double-trouble with a blend of sassy and bold. Vivian is renowned for her hits like \u201cChingi Changa\u201d, while Redsan is popularly known for hits such as \u201cJulie\u201d. Malaika- Nyashinski \nSince his return from the United States of America in 2016, Nyashinski has been giving his fans hit after hit. After a break of over ten years, he made a comeback to the Kenyan music scene with the major hit song \u201cNow You Know\u201d. Nyashinski also did a gospel song called \u201cMungu Pekee\u201d that became a hit song as well. \u201cMalaika\u201d is his third song, and it has had over 3.2 million views on YouTube. The popular song has also been played by several local FM stations. Nyashinski is a former member of the Kleptomaniax music group that consisted of three members: Roba, Collo, and Nyashinski. The group is well known for major hits such as \u201cTuendelee\u201d and \u201cManiax Anthem\u201d. Nyashinski is one of the very few unanimously respected Kenyan artists, and he never ceases to make a buzz with his hit songs. In addition, he was nominated for the 2017 MTV EMA Best African Act Award. Tergat Gang- Octopizzo, Barak Jacuzzi & Boutross Munene \nPossibly one of the best hip hop artistes in the country, Octopizzo has teamed up with a few other talents \u2013 with whom he has been working tirelessly to uplift. \u201cTergat Gang\u201d is a hip hop hit that he released with the Tergat Gang, a group that he formed two years ago. The group consists of three members: Octopizzo, South Carolina-based rapper Barak Jacuzzi, and Boutross Munene. The hip hop track is a street anthem whose video was shot in the sprawling slums of Kibera, the very place where Octopizzo was brought up. Inspire- Nameless \nFrom Nameless, one of the best Kenyan Musicians, \u201cInspire\u201d is an interesting blend of afro-pop and dancehall music that created a huge buzz when it was released in June. Nameless has been in the music industry for over 10 years, and his music is always well received because of the style and diversity that he brings out in each song. The chorus of this hot 2017 song was inspired by a previous visit to Oloitoktok, a town on the border of Kenya and Tanzania. The area has beautiful scenery of Mt. Kilimanjaro and always appears quite romantic. As a result of seeing that scenery, Nameless translated his awe into a love song for an African beauty. The song is about a passionate love that inspires the heart, mind, body, and soul. Jigi Jigi- Willy Paul \nIt seems as though 2017 was a winning year for Willy Paul. After doing a collaboration with Alaine in February, Willy Paul was back with another hit, \u201cJigi Jigi\u201d, that caused ripples in the music industry. \u201cJigi Jigi\u201d was released in September as a love ballad about marriage. The song has attracted some controversy; critics question whether it is a gospel song, or if the artiste has gone secular. In the song Willy Paul narrates how a certain woman in his life is giving him \u2018jigiriri\u2019, which loosely translates to \u2018some type of crazy love feeling\u2019. Party Nation- Kagwe Mungai, Fena Gitu, Mayonde, Muthoni Drummer Queen, and Blinky Bill \n\u201cParty Nation\u201d is the third song from an ongoing collaboration between successful, Nairobi-based musicians Muthoni Drummer Queen, Mayonde, Fena Gitu, Blinky Bill, and Kagwe Mungai. When you bring together five creative and remarkable musicians, you most definitely will end up with a hit; that is exactly what \u201cParty Nation\u201d is. The song has nice party beats to dance to, and it is a highly popular anthem in local clubs and hangout places. Nikumbushe- Bahati ft. Rayvanny \n\u201cNikumbushe\u201d is a hit song released by Bahati, one of the most celebrated young Kenyan gospel artistes. The track also features Rayvanny, who is a Tanzanian musician, songwriter, and dancer from WCB Wasafi Record Label. Bahati has a number of awards under his belt, as well as hit songs like \u201cMama\u201d, \u201cMachozi\u201d, and \u201cStory Yangu\u201d. His songs always receive positive reactions. The same can be said about \u201cNikumbushe\u201d, which has managed to gain over 2.4 Million views on Youtube so far.

The detail is available from the presentation NSF Capital Markets Day. In this note we explore in more detail the key themes of (i) loan growth ahead of expectations (ii) improving asset quality and (iii) further accelerated investment. The net effect is a reduction to 2017/18 estimates, driven by investment, although we expect consensus 2019 to rise. The accelerated investment shows management confidence in the macro-environment (low incomes growing ahead of inflation) and its business model. \nLoan growth: The pro forma group loan book growth of 34% end October y-o-y is well ahead of that reported in H117 (+17%) with the stars being branch-based lending up 20% to \u00a3144m (H117 +16%), and home collect up 40% (to \u00a338m). Guarantor loans grew 33% despite the disruption from a major integration. \nImproving asset quality across the group: Twelve month rolling impairments to end October as a percentage of revenue were 17.9% in branch-based lending (H117 19.6%), 32.9% in home collect (H117 37.5%) and 14.6% in guarantor loans (H117 15.3%). Critically, every cohort of lending is improving. \nAccelerated investment: In branch-based lending 12 new centres are now expected to be opened in 2018 mainly in Q1 (this is up from 7 in our previous forecasts). Home collect in 2017 will see \u00a33m in temporary agent commissions and \u00a32m in additional infrastructure costs supporting the significant growth in its agent franchise taking advantage of the restructuring at Provident Financial. \nValuation: We reviewed a range of valuation metrics (and sensitivity to assumptions) in our initiation \u201cCarpe Diem\u201d and more recent notes. With the forecast changes these now indicate a range of 91 \u2013 100p p/sh on absolute measures. Peer ratings are broadly similar to NSF. \nInvestment summary: Substantial value should be created as: (i) competitors have withdrawn; (ii) Non-Standard Finance is well-capitalised with access to significant debt funding; (iii) positive macro-economic drivers, and (iv) NSF has an experienced management team delivering technological efficiency without compromising the key F2F model. Targets of 20% loan book growth and 20% EBIT ROA appear credible and investors are paying 10.6x 2018 PE and getting a 4.7% yield.

Jerusalem as Trump\u2019s political theatre - Alaturka News", "text": "tweet \nBy Hussain Abdul-Hussain \n\u2013 The writer is a Washington-based political analyst. He has written for the New York Times, The Washington Post, and Kuwaiti daily Al Rai, among others \nWASHINGTON D.C. (AA) \u2013 \u201cJerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided,\u201d said presidential candidate Barack Obama in 2008. Had President Donald Trump, or any other sitting U.S. president, said what Obama told AIPAC during his electoral campaign, such statement would have made history. \nBut Trump\u2019s speech, in which he \u201crecognized\u201d Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, was more political theater than actual policy. Trump never uttered the word \u201cunited\u201d to describe Jerusalem the capital. He said: \u201cWe are not taking a position of any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem,\u201d meaning the borders of the Israeli Jerusalem were still up for negotiations with the Palestinians. \nIn other words, the Jerusalem that Trump recognized as the capital of Israel was not the one that many Israelis had in mind: undivided and under complete Israeli sovereignty. The Jerusalem that Trump recognized is more of a \u201cvirtual Jerusalem,\u201d one that all parties \u2014 including many Arabs and Palestinians \u2014 understand would remain under Israeli sovereignty in any final solution. Its name, even if not uttered, is West Jerusalem. \nThe \u201cpeace process\u201d that was started in the early 1990s, was premised on the understanding that any future deal would restore the 1948 UN borders, albeit with some negotiated changes. Between 1948 and 1967, West Jerusalem was under Israeli sovereignty. East Jerusalem was under Arab Jordanian sovereignty. It is implicitly understood that in a final peace deal, the Israeli capital would move from Tel Aviv to West Jerusalem, whereas the Palestinian capital would move from Ramallah to East Jerusalem. \nFor reasons of political theater, leaders on both sides rarely use the prefix East or West. Both Palestinian and Israeli leaders often promise their constituents that Jerusalem would be the capital of their respective states in any future peace deal. The prefixes, East and West, are often implied. \nTrump became the latest leader to announce a policy on Jerusalem without qualifying whether he meant West or East Jerusalem, and without specifying the city\u2019s borders. Such specifications would remain the prerogative of the two contending parties, the Palestinians, and the Israelis. This means that even after his hyped-up speech, the U.S. policy on Jerusalem and the peace process remained unchanged, a fact that the U.S. president made sure to emphasize. \nRelocating a U.S. embassy building should not be construed as a change in policy. Had Trump intended to change the U.S. position on Jerusalem, he could have simply replaced the placard on the U.S. Consulate in East Jerusalem to make it read the \u201cU.S. Embassy in Israel\". That would have made headlines, instead of the American president promising to hire \u201cengineers and architects\u201d to relocate the embassy and change history. \nSo, what motivated Trump\u2019s political theater? The answer could be found in the president\u2019s \u201cRecognizing Jerusalem\u201d proclamation, circulated by the White House, which read as follows: \u201cIn taking this action, President Trump fulfilled a major campaign promise of his and many previous presidential candidates.\u201d \nFulfillment of \u201ca major campaign promise\u201d was the theme that dominated the headlines of most of America\u2019s right-wing and Conservative news sites. Trump\u2019s campaign promise on Jerusalem was never as clear as Obama\u2019s. Trump never said he would recognize an \u201cundivided\u201d Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. He only said \u201cJerusalem\u201d. His proclamation came as vague as his promise, giving the impression that he was \u201cmaking history\u201d in favor of Israel, while in fact leaving the U.S. policy on the Arab-Israeli conflict virtually intact. \nPresident Trump\u2019s political theater aimed at winning favor with Israel, and therefore with Jewish American votes and monetary contributions for his reelection bid in 2020, started a few months back when he became the first sitting U.S. president to visit the Western Wall. \nBoth his \u201cproclamation\u201d and his visit aimed at showing that he was the American president who was willing to go where none of his predecessors dared to go. Trump even said that the process of relocating the U.S. embassy would take years. In other words, if Jewish Americans want to see the relocation process completed, they would have to bet on Trump and help him win reelection. \nTrump\u2019s policy on Israel has not been all theatre, however. The Trump administration has been conducting a Middle East policy that favors Israelis over Palestinians in more ways than the traditional U.S. bias toward Israel. Of the many policies that favor the Israelis, Trump\u2019s announcement of relocating the U.S. embassy would have the least adverse effect on Palestinians. \nSince his election, Trump has appointed three Orthodox Jews to official positions and entrusted them with brokering an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. These are U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, peace envoy and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and the long-time Trump organization\u2019s confidante Jason Greenblatt. So observant these officials are that when President Trump flew to Saudi Arabia on a Friday, Kushner and Greenblatt had to ask for a special permission from their rabbi in New Jersey to fly on a Sabbath. \nWhile there is nothing wrong with people practicing whatever faith they believe in, the view of the American trio might be informed by their religious education, rather than their experience in international affairs or conflict resolution. The Jewish Orthodox education of the three American officials, entrusted with brokering an Israeli peace deal with Palestinians, might be influenced by their dogmatic, rather than a realistic view of things. \nSince Trump\u2019s election, his policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has focused on reaching a speedy peace deal, whatever kind of deal, that would allow him to take historic photo ops showing him supervising an Israeli-Arab peace deal, like past presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. After all, Trump has always touted himself as the best dealmaker there is. He, therefore, thinks that brokering an Israeli-Arab deal \u2014 a deal that has proven elusive for all his predecessors \u2014 will show his unparalleled deal-making skills. \nBut the Israeli-Palestinian gap is too wide to bridge. Therefore, Greenblatt revived a peace deal that he was sure the Israelis would take: An Israeli peace deal with Arab countries, without the Palestinians. Greenblatt called his new approach the \u201coutside-in plan\u201d, as opposed to the \u201cinside-out approach\u201d that pinned Arab peace with Israel on an Israeli peace with Palestinians as a prerequisite. \nTrump\u2019s outside-in plan would hurt Palestinians more than relocation since it strips them of the Arab leverage that they have held for over half a century. By conditioning Arab peace on Palestinian peace with Israel first, the Israelis would have an interest in accommodating Palestinian demands in order to win a bigger prize, which is normal ties with the rest of the Arab world, including Saudi Arabia, a member of the group of the world\u2019s biggest 20 economies, the G20. \nBecause Jerusalem has a sentimental value for both Muslims and Jews, Trump\u2019s non-policy speech stirred much debate and headlines across the world. But the fact remains that Trump\u2019s speech on Jerusalem was a lot of talk and little change in policy. The actual change in U.S. policy, however, has been taking place behind closed doors, and in unannounced trips that Trump\u2019s \u201cpeace team\u201d makes to some Arab capitals. \n* Opinions expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Anadolu Agency.
