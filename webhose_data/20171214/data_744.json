That\u2019s a very bullish sign, and we have retraced about 50% of the massive hammer that formed on Friday of last week. Because of this, I think that if we can break above the top of the range for the trading session on Wednesday, we will probably go looking towards the 2650 handle above which is massive resistance. I believe that the market continues to see bullish pressure longer-term, and I believe that the 2600 level is essentially the \u201cfloor\u201d of the market. The market seems to have a significant amount of resistance at the 2650 handle, but algorithmic traders continue to jump into this market, and because of the momentum I feel it is only a matter of time before smashed through barrier. NASDAQ 100 \nThe NASDAQ 100 initially fell during the trading session on Wednesday, testing an uptrend line that has been intact for several months. By doing so and then more importantly, bouncing, it looks likely that we will continue the uptrend. The Stochastic Oscillator is starting to reach into the oversold condition, so I think that some type of cross over in this area is probably a buying opportunity. By bouncing from this area, I suspect that we are going to go looking towards the 6400 level above, and it is possible that perhaps the massive selling of technological related stocks around the world is over. In general, we are in an uptrend, so buying is the only thing that I would consider doing anyway. I would be the first to admit though, if we break down below the bottom of the range for the Tuesday session, we will probably go down to the 6100 level.

The US dollar strengthening of course has a negative effect on this market as well, and I believe at this point we are going to go looking towards the $55 level. That\u2019s an area that is massively supportive, but if we break down below there, we could reach down towards the $52.50 level underneath that has been resistance in the past. I believe that we continue to struggle, mainly because of high pricing in the crude oil market attracts plenty of American drillers as well, so I believe that no matter what happens, eventually we reach a top to this market. I don\u2019t necessarily think that we are going to break down significantly, and perhaps melt down, but I do think that rallies are to be sold. Natural Gas \nThe natural gas markets had a volatile session during the day on Wednesday, but rolled over to form a bit of a shooting star for the day. While this is a very negative candle, the reality is that there is a significant amount of support just below, especially starting near the $2.85 level, so I think it is only a matter of time before we get a supportive candle or a bounce that we can take advantage of. On short-term charts, it looks as if we are trying to form some type of double bottom on the hourly chart, but I think we will probably have another attempt to the downside today.

Erickson is working on a new type of transporter, and needs to test it in space. But as he proceeds with his experiments, it becomes clear that there is more going on than meets the eye. \nI have to admit that I quite like this episode. It isn\u2019t especially amazing, but it\u2019s one of those rare moments when Enterprise fully captures and embraces the spirit of classic Trek (by which I mean TOS and TNG). What could be more in keeping with those shows than having an esteemed yet cantankerous scientist come aboard the ship to perform some crazy experiment that is bound to fail? Throw in transporter weirdness and you\u2019ve got yourself a proper doseof Star Trek right there.\nNotes and Observations \nWouldn\u2019t it be great if Danica became a recurring or regular character? I feel like she would be a strong and determined personality. Even though this episode feels like it should be a franchise nod, we actually have never heard about the inventor of the transporter before. I\u2019m surprised that Hoshi didn\u2019t chat to Erickson about her experience in Vanishing Point. Or maybe she did, and it just happened off screen. This is the first time in Star Trek that it\u2019s acknowledged that one of the issues of transporting is that technically the original quantum state should be destroyed and a copy created. According to Erickson, he worked hard to make sure that this didn\u2019t happen \u2013 after all, if the warp drive can break physics, why can\u2019t the transporter? T\u2019Pol essentially breaks up with Trip in this episode \u2013 it\u2019s as if the writers realised they\u2019d done all they could with Vulcan massage sexy times, and didn\u2019t have any energy left to write a proper developing relationship for them.

Even in Belfast, the city with the lowest percentage increase over the next 10 years, deposits could rise by 41% by 2027, jumping up from the \u00a329,682 needed today to \u00a341,755 in a decade\u2019s time. \nOther locations likely to see a substantial increase in first time buyer deposits include Norwich with a rise of 55% from \u00a340,890 to \u00a351,626 in 2022 and \u00a363,364 in 2027. First time buyers in Edinburgh also face a 55% rise from \u00a337,661 currently to \u00a347,467 in five years and \u00a358,204 in 2027. \n\u2018With this research predicting that the size of deposits required could rise considerably across the country, first time buyers could be forgiven for giving up hope on owning their first home,\u2019 said David Hollingworth from L&C. \nHowever, he pointed out that there is some stark variation between cities but the fact that London deposits could be almost hitting a quarter of a million pounds by 2027 is alarming. \u2018It makes sense for first-time buyers to try and raise as big a deposit as possible but that is very much easier said than done in today\u2019s current climate,\u2019 he explained. \n\u2018Although there are mortgage deals available to as much as 95% of the property price, rates on these types of deals will be higher than for those who have saved a larger deposit. Given the level of commitment that first time buyers are having to make it\u2019s of little surprise that they are often electing to fix their mortgage rate, so they know where they stand with their mortgage payments,\u2019 Hollingworth added. \nThe research also looked at the attitudes of first time buyers in the UK, asking how they are planning to raise their deposit. On average, first time buyers expect 44% of their deposit to come from their own cash savings, with a further 15% coming from a Help to Buy ISA and 6% coming from a Lifetime ISA. A further 11% is expected to come from a sum from parents or other family members, and 6% will come from an inheritance. \nIt found that those first time buyers looking to buy in the next 10 years anticipated they would need \u00a335,402 on average for a deposit but the average \u00a351,821 deposit put down today is almost half as much again. \nOn average, first time buyers have currently saved up \u00a316,436 toward their deposit, and predict it will take three years and eight months in total to raise the full amount. The current savings level doesn\u2019t even amount to a third of today\u2019s average deposit and 24% of first time buyers haven\u2019t saved a penny towards a deposit. \n\u2018Pulling together a deposit continues to represent one of the single biggest challenges and these forecasts will make frightening reading for aspiring first time buyers. As a result the Bank of Mum and Dad will no doubt continue to play an important role for those attempting to get on the ladder. Parental and family assistance will often help to build a deposit but can also see them providing a guarantee or additional collateral, to secure the mortgage needed,\u2019 Hollingworth said. \n\u2018Although improvements to supply of the right type of housing will be required, it is clear that from a practical point of view first time buyers will need to try to make regular savings as early as possible. Schemes like the Help to Buy and Lifetime ISAs can be helpful options for boosting your deposit, especially when contending with high rents,\u2019 he explained. \n\u2018On top of this, the Budget announcement to scrap stamp duty for first time buyers on properties worth up to \u00a3300,000 will help those who are struggling with the challenge of saving a deposit. The other positive at the moment may be that mortgage rates are extremely low but it\u2019s important to get professional advice on the right options,\u2019 he concluded.

With TruePrice, consumers see what others in the area paid for the same car and Certified Dealers are able to set their prices competitively so that consumers get the best deal. \n\u201cThe enemy of the car buying process is not the dealer,\u201d says Lucas Donat, chief brand officer of TrueCar. \u201cIt\u2019s the morass of information available online that confuses consumers.\u201d\n \nIn addition to the TV spots, the campaign includes national radio spots across news, sports, podcasts and a home-page refresh. Creative was developed in-house and it was produced by the company\u2019s long-standing partner, Sandwich Video, Donat says.\nThe spot is being tested across cable and broadcast, including the brand\u2019s top-performing cable networks and NFL programming on CBS and Fox. \u201cWe\u2019ll examine test results to determine a longer-term media mix/plan,\u201d Donat says. \nThe ad aims to draw a distinction between other third-party automotive websites and TrueCar, Donat tells Marketing Daily . Additionally, this spot is designed to answer the age-old question, \u201cHow do I know if the price I see on this car is a good price?\u201d \n\u201cWith the introduction of TruePrice you can now see what others paid for the car you want and get an upfront price from TrueCar Certified Dealers that will include all fees, accessory costs, and incentives,\u201d Donat says.  \u201cTruePrice allows you to see exactly what you\u2019ll pay at the dealership.\u201d\nThe ad departs from TrueCar's previous marketing efforts by shooting in front of a white background, simplifying the messaging and creating a billboard hero effect where the graphics tell more of the story than the spokesperson, Donat says.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tanya gazdik", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucas donat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sandwich video", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "truecar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:43.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df93725ef96dd43c7b02203be2cff3efe61873e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4Q.Fta_y6lblVABSTlh3ublmazcAXFT.iZ32WHUS8Y1Zg7NNE46DVC8h5aFLejjAGSFHGqBa91_IbMX4iTs1V9icMYs.KNpsfNQ--", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/San-Diego-Hoteis.d178304.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Condado de San Diego: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Days Inn San Diego Hotel Circle Near SeaWorld:", "title_full": "Days Inn San Diego Hotel Circle Near SeaWorld: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-11-25T13:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61311b0cc525d6db902d9658350ea822eee925ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4Q.Fta_y6lblVABSTlh3ublmazcAXFT.iZ32WHUS8Y1Zg7NNE46DVC8h5aFLejjAGSFHGqBa91_IbMX4iTs1V9idEJO.1GYc21NulrDmlpOuDLUFaCulv5Ts9FJNmCp9eq1p8FpYkTtzW", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-04T08:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It was a nice room and good area..first night had a neighbor who was trying to open adjoining door at night and i had to say something...made me feel uncomfortable that night.tough to sleep...second night ppl loud and knocking on doors in middle of night.

There was a heated pool and hot tub on site. The room was nice and clean with a microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker and a safe. Everything was good except for the bed.

We are both medium size and if a heavier couple sleep on the saggy mattress, their back will probably be touching the floor. The motel is good for family but because of that, there were lots of kids at the pool and running around. Our room was next to a family with young kids and we kept hearing them knocking on the door and screaming so that was very annoying. Also this motel charged a $8 parking fee per night.

With house building such a key priority for Government, the industry is calling on ministers to recognise the needs of house builders. \nThe survey also shows the increasing risk the industry faces from an ageing workforce and how the potential reliance on EU workers will grow in the coming years. Whilst over 22% of UK passport holders working in the industry are over 50, only 10% of EU workers are in that age bracket. Around 70% from the EU are in the 20 to 39 age group compared to only around a half of those born in the UK. \nThe house building industry has increased output by 74% in the past four years and last year saw 217,000 additions to the housing stock. The industry has recruited and trained tens of thousands of UK based workers in recent years and is committed to totally reforming to its attraction and training regimes. \nBut with Government setting a challenging target of 300,000 additional homes a year by 2025 industry capacity remains a huge challenge. As the industry looks to increase output the HBF said it will be working with ministers and officials to ensure that existing capacity is not threatened while builders continue to work to attract the next generation of home builders into the industry. \nThe industry has provided the survey results to ministers and officials, as well as the Migration Advisory Committee and is asking the Government to secure the status for existing employees as quickly as possible and ensure house building roles are represented in future immigration arrangements. \n\u2018The results of this census clearly demonstrate the reliance the industry currently has on non UK workers. Output is up a massive 74% in recent years but achieving the very challenging targets set by Government will require further big increases in workforce capacity,\u2019 said Stewart Baseley, HBF executive chairman. \n\u2018Whilst the industry is investing heavily in recruiting and training young people leaving our schools, colleges and universities, continued access to overseas workers is absolutely essential,\u2019 he added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stewart baseley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "email  house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "migration advisory committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "home builders federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hbf", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:43.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "119c48fb09c7764a4457c9635a250a35e33e6b0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVtyQ.E4HW8puC3tqZfbwg.IeJL03BpM6VJG8ppwHOkholRsg0TZ6XAyqIey27Lhn8BLUnm3xtqUKMXH3_sa94QhIXj_jIRDbOkEAtgkzVE604PHqb2g2ZBxHKwXFPPmIjQ--", "site_full": "www.dailyforex.com", "site": "dailyforex.com", "site_section": "http://www.dailyforex.com/rss/TechnicalAnalysis.xml", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "DailyForex.com Forex Technical Analysis", "title": "Gold Slips as Dollar Firms", "title_full": "Gold Slips as Dollar Firms", "published": "2017-12-07T09:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 39174, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "119c48fb09c7764a4457c9635a250a35e33e6b0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVtyQ.E4HW8puC3tqZfbwg.IeJL03BpM6VJG8ppwHOkholRsg0TZ6XAyqIey27Lhn8BLUnm3xtqUKMXH3_sa94QhIXj_jIRDbOkEAtgkzVE604PHqb2g2ZBxHKwXFPPmIjQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "info@dailyforex.com", "published": "2017-12-07T09:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Gold Slips as Dollar Firms", "text": "Gold Slips as Dollar Firms Gold Slips as Dollar Firms 07 December 2017 7:50:14 AM Tweet 0 \nGold prices ended Wednesday\u2019s session down $2.89 an ounce as strength in the U.S. dollar and a recovery in stock markets weighed on the market. XAU/USD initially tested the resistance at $1269.10 as expected but was unable to break through. Consequently, prices fell back below $1265. In economic news, Automatic Data Processing Inc. reported that the private sector added 190K jobs in November, broadly in line with expectations. ADP\u2019s data is treated as a kind of preview for the monthly government report, though these figures aren\u2019t always accurate in predicting the outcome. \nPrices remain stuck roughly between 1265 and 1260 in Asian session. Market players may be hesitant to make aggressive bets ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s monthly non-farm payrolls report. The short-term charts are bearish, with the market residing below the Ichimoku clouds on the daily and the 4-hourly time frames. In addition to that, the Chikou span (closing price plotted 26 periods behind, brown line) is below prices. \nThe bears will have to overcome the strategic support at 1260 so that they can set sail for 1255. If the market dives below 1255, the 1250 level will be the next target. However, if the bulls can push and hold prices above 1265.65-1265, they may have a chance to test 1269.10-1267.50, the area occupied by the hourly cloud. A break above this barrier could trigger a push up to 1274/1. Currency Pairs \nAlp Kocak   since 2003. He writes technical analysis based on Japanese candlesticks and Ichimoku Kinko Hyo.

James V. Schall, S.J.", "published": "2017-12-07T12:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "When the \u201cReformers\u201d Abandoned the Eucharist", "text": "Rev. James V. Schall, S.J. \nThe first lines of Belloc\u2019s 1936 book, The Characters of the Reformation , are these: \u201cThe break-up of united western Christendom with the coming of the Reformation was by far the most important thing in history since the formation of the Catholic Church fifteen hundred years before.\u201d We live in a time when the Reformation is looked on with friendly eyes. The Reformation was said to be a very good thing, the beginning of modern \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cindividualism.\u201d \nYet, is there any validity in Belloc\u2019s observation about the significance of the Reformation? What exactly was his point? He called it precisely \u201cthe most important thing in history\u201d since the Incarnation. By implication, it was more related to the elimination of Christianity than to any return to its origins. \nMost of the mainline Protestant churches of the original Reformation, from the Anglicans and the Lutherans to the Congregationalists, are in serious decline. The break-up is on-going. The phrase\u2014 \u201cEcclesia semper reformanda\u201d \u2014sometimes was attributed to Luther, but it may have come from Karl Barth via something in St. Augustine. Its spirit had a much greater reach than anyone probably intended at the time. We see statistics telling us that some twenty thousand Protestant sects exist. Not a few think that the Catholic Church itself looks more and more \u201cProtestant\u201d every day in the way it \u201creforms\u201d itself. Luther is no longer reviled but praised. \nMany others do not think that the Reformation began with the 95 Theses and the other problems of Martin Luther. The origins go back to the German mystics of the Middle Ages, as to the voluntarism and nominalism of Duns Scotus and William of Occam. These pre-Reformation reformers held in common that man had some direct relation to God that in principle bypassed any need of a Church. One could reach God by mystical experience. \nThe Church provided nothing but an outside series of demands that kept the soul from directly communicating with God. Basically, there was just \u201cme and God.\u201d That relationship was the only one that mattered in the spiritual life, which, in essence, was simple and earnest. The invention of a complex set of laws and rites was an accretion, a deviation from Christ\u2019s intention. \nIn the Catholic tradition, why was the Church itself especially necessary? It seemed to set up a second level community that claimed allegiance of both a visible presence in this world and a membership in the City of God that transcended this world. Following Aristotle, man was a social and political being even in his redemption. His perfection fostered friendship with others, including God. The Church was founded by Christ in his lifetime. It was set up with authority and charged to go forth to the nations and to worship God following Christ\u2019s guidance during his time on Earth. \nThe Church was designed as the mediator between man and God. It was based on the metaphysical notion that secondary causes really existed. God did not do everything but empower rational creatures especially to participate in his creative and redemptive actions. The sacraments were to be administered through the Church\u2019s authority, itself assigned to it by Christ, the Son of God. \u201cAll nations\u201d were to be baptized. God\u2019s graces came through the sacraments. \nEcclesial authority was not the result of human agency. It was not modeled on political societies, on a social contract. The Church did recognize the state\u2019s competence, in the \u201cthings that are Caesar\u2019s.\u201d Man was required to do things, things that revealed his soul and character, lightsome things and serious things. \nOne thing incumbent on redeemed man was to worship God after the manner that Christ established at the Last Supper. The other was to live a life worthy of this relation to the Father through Christ. \u201cUnless you eat this bread and drink this cup, you shall not have everlasting life in you\u201d (John 6:53). \nIt is not that there was no personal relation to God in faith. This direct relation was often stressed by Paul. Sacraments in fact were part of this direct relation. But what counted was an obedient relationship that looked to what was revealed and not just to what man concocted by his own feelings or desires. The moral life and the liturgical life were seen to stem from the same source and required each other. They were to exist in harmony. The current controversy over Amoris Laetitia actually involves the question of whether one\u2019s subjective understanding can overrule the norms explicitly set forth by Christ. If one\u2019s subjective conscience alone is what matters, there would be no need of a Church or a priesthood within it. II. \nWhat Belloc saw in the Reformation was not a revitalization of the Church but the premises, if they continued in their own logic, of its eventual demise. It could be reformed out of existence. This view would not necessarily imply the disappearance of Christianity contrary to Christ\u2019s promise to be with it to the end. But it would indicate a picture of an end-time in which few believers remained (Luke 18:8). Joseph Pieper\u2019s 1980 book, The End of Time , spelled out this inner-terrestrial consequence. \nEric Voegelin once remarked, in his 1968 book, Science, Politics, and Gnosticism , that modernity was largely the result of Christian men losing their faith in the transcendent order. They shifted their allegiance almost exclusively to the enterprises of this world. The separation of faith and works left works with an autonomy of their own, instead of, as in the Catholic tradition, seeing the transcendent end directing the things of this world to their own natural order. \nCatholicism saw the natural world itself as indicating a relation of order to God. But with Luther\u2019s anti-Aristotelian views, the world was evaporated of any connection between mind and God. The examination of the world led not to transcendence but to atheism. It turns out that Aristotle and what he stood for, namely the integrity of reason\u2019s capacity to know reality, was necessary for the integrity of faith itself. Faith was not so blind that it could see nothing in reason when it encountered the order of things. III. \nSeparating faith from action in this world affected the sacramental function of the Church. Step by step it disappeared from theology and culture. We might say that faith was saved but what Christ told us to do was lost. The real problem was not God, but the literal fact of the Incarnation, of the presence of the Second Person, the Son, in this actual world. \nIn his insightful essay, \u201c Phenomenology and the Eucharist ,\u201d Msgr. Robert Sokolowski wrote: \u201cOne could say perhaps that the controversies about the Eucharist\u2014and hence about the Church \u2026 were the way in which the resistance to the Incarnation was carried out throughout the second millennium of the Church\u2019s history.\u201d The most difficult thing to believe, to repeat, is not the existence of God but his Incarnation in the Person of Christ. \nThus, the Jews never accepted the Christ or the Trinity from which it proceeds. In Muslim thought, Christ is not divine, but just a good man, a prophet. Belief in the Incarnation and Trinity are blasphemous. This trend of post Reformation thought was in the same direction to which Benedict XVI pointed in his \u201cdehellenization\u201d steps in \u201cThe Regensburg Lecture.\u201d Scripture became an object of purely scientific methodology. It a priori disallowed any evidence not open to this method that always presupposed quantity. Christ again became just a good man (#32 ff.). As a result, none of the divine claims associated with him had any objective standing. \nThe crux of the matter is the real presence and how it is maintained. The Mass presupposed the same Sacrifice that Christ endured. There is only one Mass in the history of the world. It is conceived on an altar. It requires priests authorized to make the Sacrifice present to the congregation. All, priests and people, face the same direction historically. The heart of the Church\u2019s presence in the world is the Eucharist and the other sacraments. \nIf Christ is not really present in the Eucharist, the Mass soon becomes a meal, not a sacrifice. The altar is changed into a table. The priest is not an alter Christus but a leader of the congregation. The bread and wine are memorials that remind us of the Last Supper. The leader is gradually not a bishop or a priest or a leader, the congregation itself rules and selects its officers and beliefs. \nWe soon reach the Unitarians who see no need for any Trinity or Incarnation even in faith. There is no need of any mediation between God and man. Indeed, there may not be any need of a God. All transcendent notions have become re-subsumed back into a project in this world. Issues of preparing for death and judgment, for resurrection are long forgotten. \n\u201cA loss of faith in the Eucharist\u2014a loss of faith in the real presence of Christ in the sacrament, and a loss of faith in the identity of the Eucharistic sacrifice and that of Calvary\u2014leads,\u201d Sokolowski observed, to a loss of faith in the Resurrection, which leads to a loss of faith in the Incarnation, which leads to a loss of belief in the Holy Trinity? If you deny the truth of the Eucharist, you begin the drift to Unitarianism. I wonder also if the trace to iconoclasm in the Church in recent decades\u2014the removal of statues and pictures, the movement towards abstraction in architecture and decoration \u2026 does not also raise difficulties in regards to faith in the Incarnation. The human mind seems persistently unwilling to accept the intense nearness of God incarnate, which affirms Creation and makes everything real. \nIf we return to Belloc\u2019s remarks after following this sequence, it becomes quite clear that the Reformation did not end with the Reformation. It is only ending in our time when we see the existential logic of denial carried out step by step over time. \nIf we read these reflections with care, it seems clear that our political controversies are, at bottom, really theological. Imbedded in our politics is not only an increasingly vigorous and even violent denial of its very existence, but an even more stubborn refusal to accept any natural order as if it contained some order of its own that cause us to be the sort of beings we are. Not only do we not recognize Christ in the Eucharist, but we do not recognize man in his own nature. The relation of reason to faith is meaningless if both faith and reason are empty of content. \nWe are left with a humanism that lacks any notion of what is there to believe in and a faith with nothing objectively to affirm. This result is what we mean by \u201cfreedom.\u201d The premises of the Creator-God from the beginning were to leave man free to accept both the Creation and the Incarnation that sought to redirect him to his true transcendent end. Every indication exists that this result was anticipated. Even the Church at times seems confused. To conform to the \u201cmodern world\u201d now ends by insisting that we conform to an empty world that began by losing its faith in the real presence at the Sacrifice of the Mass. \nEditor\u2019s note: Pictured above is the monument of Martin Luther in Wittenberg, Germany.

I think that the S&P 500 will probably drop from here, looking to find support. At this point, I suspect that the 2600 level is probably that support, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before the buyers will return. The level is an area that coincides with a reasonable uptrend line, so I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before value hunters would return. If we did breakdown below the 2600 level, I believe that the next major support barrier starts somewhere near the 2560 level. Longer-term, I think that the uptrend is very much intact, and algorithmic traders will continue to jump into the market on dips. Currently, a lot of the noise is going to be based upon tax reform. NASDAQ 100 \nThe NASDAQ 100 market initially tried to rally during the day as well, but turned around to form a shooting star. We are sitting on top of support at the 6230 level, but I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before we go below there as markets are looking a bit soft. In general, I believe the sellers may make some noise over the next several sessions, but I believe that the floor in the uptrend is somewhere closer to the 6000 level, meaning that patience will be needed to start buying again. The NASDAQ 100 has been less bullish than the other indices in America, and therefore I think it makes sense that it will lag any type of bounce in the other ones. I think if you are going to short either one of these indices, the NASDAQ 100 would make the most sense. Currency Pairs \nChristopher Lewis has been trading Forex for several years.

The Crude Oil Inventories announcement coming out today of course will have a lot of influence on what happens next, so keep that in mind. I believe that the $55 level underneath is going to offer support, just as the $59 level above is resistance extending to the $60 level. In general, this is a \u201cbuy on the dips\u201d scenario, but for short-term trading only as we have conflicting pressures in OPEC extending cuts through the rest of 2018, but Americans willing to throw more supply into the marketplace as pricing is relatively high. Because this, it\u2019s likely that we will continue to see volatility no matter what happens next. Natural Gas \nThe natural gas markets have been very choppy over the last several months, and the consolidation continues to be very prominent in this market. However, the consolidation area continues to expand, so it appears that we will see a significant volatility as we head into the cold months in America. Typically, we do see some type of demand increase for natural gas during this time a year, and I think that is part of what has been widening the range. As we are close to the bottom of the range, I think we are more than likely going to find a negative day followed by support. Once we get that support, I think short-term traders will push the market back towards the $3.10 level, where then we will find sellers again. This is a simple back and forth range bound type of trading situation, so ultimately, I believe you need to approach it as a market that is a simple back and forth set up.

Seed Treatment Market- Global Opportunity Analysis And Industry Forecast (2017-2022) \nThe global seed treatment market will grow at a CAGR of 8.7% during the forecast period to reach USD 4,566.1 million by 2022, according to this latest publication from Meticulous Research\u2122. The global seed treatment market is primarily driven by its low cost, growing need to increase crop yield and quality, wide range of benefits of seed treatment, reduction of arable land, and reduced risk of exceeding minimal residue level. However, stringent government regulations are restraining the growth of this market to some extent. \nThe global seed treatment market is mainly segmented on the basis of type, formulation, application technique, crop type, and geography. Based on type, the market is segmented into chemical seed treatment and biological seed treatment. Chemical seed treatment commanded the largest share in 2016, owing to its increasing usage in developing countries, easy availability, higher efficiency, and low cost compared to biologicals. \nBased on formulation, the market is segmented into liquid form and dry form. Liquid form seed treatment commanded the largest share in 2016, owing to its ease of use, storage, and better performance in comparison with the dry form. \nBrowse in-depth report on: www.meticulousresearch.com/product/seed-treatment-market-\u2026 \nOn the basis of application techniques, the market is segmented into coating, dressing, and pelleting. Seed coating application technique held the largest share of the global seed treatment market in 2016, owing to its broad-spectrum usage on all crop seeds. Based on crop type, the market is segmented into cereals & grains, oilseeds, and other crops. Cereals & grains commanded the largest share in the seed treatment market in 2016, owing to the increasing demand of cereals & grains across the globe to feed growing population and their increasing use for industrial application such as animal feed, biofuel, and starch & ethanol production. \nGeographically, North America accounted for the major share of the global seed treatment market in 2016, followed by Latin America and Europe region. The major share of the North American region is mainly attributed to its large arable land, increasing demand for crop yield & efficiency, and growing adoption of high price GM seeds. However, Asia Pacific region is slated to register the fastest growth during the forecast period, primarily due to its large area under agriculture cultivation and growing population in the region which increases the use of various crop protection chemicals for enhancing crop yield. \nThe leading companies have employed various strategies to expand their product and application offerings, global footprint, and augment their market shares. The key strategies followed by most companies in the global seed treatment market were agreements, partnerships & collaborations, mergers & acquisitions, new product launches, and expansions.

A timeframe for a judgement in the case will be determined at the end of the trial after closing arguments have been made. \nIf the judge rules in favour of extradition at the end of the trial, the UK home secretary must order Mallya\u2019s extradition within two months. \nHowever, the case can go through a series of appeals in higher UK courts before arriving at a conclusion.
