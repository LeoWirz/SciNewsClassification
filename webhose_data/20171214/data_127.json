But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence. \nEsther 3:5 (KJV) 5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath. \nThe death of Haman is considered to be one of the saddest and the cheapest deaths ever recorded in the entire Holy Bible. By every logical standard, it was needless.    King Ahasuerus had just promoted and exalted Haman above every other prince in his realm and whenever he would come to the office, all the gateman and servants of the king did reverence and bow before him. Haman was a man greatly honoured and revered by all, but not Mordecai. It came to pass that Haman noticed this and    became full of    wrath. He left the honour he received from the popular majority to witch-hunt just one fellow that didn't honour him. This singular illogical cost him his life.  \nIf there were 100 members of staffs in that palace, 99 of whom offered reverence and obeisance to him whenever he arrives to carry out his official duties, the disloyalty of only one man should not have mattered to him. He did not celebrate the ninety nine that did honour him and neglect that one that despised him, he left the honour he was receiving from the majority to deal with dishonour which he received from    a miniority. He should have ignored Mordecai's attitude, and simply consoled himself in the honour of majority and the good things the majority where saying to extol him, but he left all that to attend to one perceived enemy, he got distracted and eventually lost his life. Why? He didn't know how to ignore. \nYou must learn to ignore, if you want to live long! Learn to ignore! Learn to look away!  \nIn this life, not everyone will like us. Majority of those in our space may accord us repect, many may disrespect us. Some may treat us fairly others many treat us badly. It could be at our place of work, church, where we fellowship and family members or the community we live in. You will find out that although many salute and love you, there is always that staff, that church member, family member or neighbour that doesn't like you. Instead of starting a fight, because you feel your ego bruised by their disloyal attitude, learn to ignore .  \nLearn to ignore the minority that hates you and hold negative opinion about you, learn to celebrate the much you have on your side than the little that is against you, learn to ignore. Don't lose your sleep over the minority whose opinion doesn't hold water, stay on the positive side, learn to ignore  Don't go the way of Haman, don't die his death. \nI say again LEARN TO IGNORE ! \nSelah \n\nShalom . \n\u00a9RFB. \nIt is well!

Democratic Rep. Judy Chu. -Photo by Terry Miller \nChu was part of the demonstration was in support a DREAM Act vote \nWednesday afternoon, U.S. Capitol Police arrested 182 individuals outside of the U.S. Capitol, including Rep. Judy Chu (CA-27). The arrests came after a rally and march to the Capitol where thousands called for a vote on the DREAM Act. Rep. Chu, who was charged with \u201ccrowding, obstructing, or incommoding\u201d, was processed and released and has issued the following statement: \n\u201c\u2019Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.\u2019 Those are the words written by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. during his own, far more dire, arrest in Birmingham. And while my brush with the law today was planned and civil, those words from his famous letter continue to inspire our civil disobedience. Then it was on behalf of black citizens treated as less than human. Today it is on behalf of immigrants who are facing threats of deportation and separation from family and the only home they have ever known. Dreamers have lived here their whole lives and are American in every way. They do not deserve this cruel uncertainty created by President Trump\u2019s attack on DACA. Nor need they. There is a bipartisan bill ready to be voted on that I know could gain a majority vote if only Speaker Ryan would let us bring it to the floor. We have tried everything from large scale rallies to a small meeting with the Speaker to make our case. But each time, we have been ignored. Today, I know our words were heard, but will Republicans have the courage to act on them? Our ask is simple: let us vote on the DREAM Act so we can do the right thing for our families, our communities, and our economy.\u201d December 6, 2017 About Author \nMonrovia Weekly Our team focuses on delivering you the most informative and interesting articles from a variety of sections to keep you well-equipped with everyday knowledge!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ju", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judy chu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terry miller  chu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dy chu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin luther king jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "capitol police", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monrovia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:26.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a64ca3427faa249fa0d8725ece658e4223fb8bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9cUNaaxjw6KFKbjvwSL7hgJ_iaBSE9gbJEG9X7UgYl82k3.g_ClQCFspvmw7mFkLfr_tTTZdjRgQ--", "site_full": "www.monroviaweekly.com", "site": "monroviaweekly.com", "site_section": "http://www.monroviaweekly.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Monrovia Weekly", "title": "WHATA FACE!", "title_full": "WHATA FACE!", "published": "2017-12-07T01:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.monroviaweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Capture.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a64ca3427faa249fa0d8725ece658e4223fb8bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9cUNaaxjw6KFKbjvwSL7hgJ_iaBSE9gbJEG9X7UgYl82k3.g_ClQCFspvmw7mFkLfr_tTTZdjRgQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Monrovia Weekly", "published": "2017-12-07T01:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "WHATA FACE!", "text": "WHATA FACE! Montana is 3 years old. \u2013 Courtesy photo \nWill ya look at that cute face?? He\u2019s MIGHTY MONTANA, AGE 3, adorable tuxedo boy. He likes to play and will allow little pets on his head, but does not like to be touched on his back end. One theory is that he was once a house cat, or maybe abused and somehow ended up on the streets. Our wonderful team of socializers have worked with him, and he has gone from being isolated, to now being out, cage-free, in a room with other kitties. Montana is FIV+ but is healthy and needs no meds. This condition is easily managed as long as the kitty is kept indoors and is the only kitty in the home or is with another FIV+ cat. (We can advise.) Many special needs cats are often forgotten or overlooked. If they are given a chance to shine, they blossom with love. Adoption fee is $100, which includes neuter, microchip, exam & vaccines.

There\u2019s a company holiday party you\u2019d rather not attend \u2013 or maybe your next door neighbors are throwing an event that you just can\u2019t avoid. Whatever the occasion, these parties can be draining during the holidays. This is especially true for those of us who are introverts, or who have other commitments such as children or a demanding job. It can feel like there\u2019s just no room for another to do on the list. \nBut, if you\u2019re planning to be on the job market next year, holiday parties can truly be the perfect place to kick off your search. Where else will you find such a large group of warm, friendly people in one room together? They\u2019re typically friends you haven\u2019t seen in a while, who genuinely want to know how you\u2019re doing and what you\u2019re up to. And, they\u2019re often looking to reconnect again outside of the event. \nHoliday parties are also often very cost effective as they are typically free and at the most, may only require a small host gift or a bottle of wine. \nThe best part is, you don\u2019t have to wear a suit. And you don\u2019t usually need to deliver your elevator pitch from scratch. You\u2019ll know most people, or a friend will likely introduce you. Conversations will be easier, more interesting, and less forced than a typical networking event. \nTo truly make the most of your holiday parties this year, plan ahead. Try to get enough rest in advance and be ready to share the latest news in your life. Share personal updates, including changes in your family, your home, or your work. But, do your best to keep your news positive. Holiday parties are meant to be a festive occasion and should focus on the good things going on in your life. \nIf forced conversations feel difficult, think of a list of questions in advance. Ask how their family is doing. Ask if the friend has any plans to travel or take a vacation soon. Ask about common hobbies and interests. \nRemember to bring business cards \u2013 and to exchange them with other guests when (and if) it seems appropriate. This will help you to stay in touch with new friends and update your contact information for old ones. If you\u2019re not currently working, a simple card will do. Include your name, phone number, and email address. \nAfter the event, make a point to follow up with the folks you want to stay in touch with. Invite them to your next party. Ask them to have lunch or coffee. And, be sure to connect on LinkedIn. \nThese small interactions build your friendships and grow your network. When the New Year comes, you\u2019ll be more prepared to put your best foot forward. And, if you do ask a friend for help with a job application, it won\u2019t be the first time they\u2019ve seen you in a while. Build your network of friends when you\u2019re not asking for help with a job. \nAngela Copeland is a Career Coach and Founder of Copeland Coaching and can be reached at CopelandCoaching.com or on Twitter at @CopelandCoach.

It reinforced its refusal to join a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. \nHowever, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear that he doesn't want a new election, and Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz reversed course. \nAt a previously scheduled party congress Thursday, Schulz is seeking members' approval for a resolution approving talks on \"whether and in what form\" the Social Democrats can support a new government.

Koehler \nSaving for \u2013 and even thinking about \u2013 retirement can be overwhelming. While it\u2019s natural to worry about your financial future, be careful not to let preconceived notions prevent you from actively saving for tomorrow. If you find yourself having one of the following doubts, consider reframing your thinking. A shift in perspective may be what you need to get on the right track. \n\u201cRetirement is a long way off.\u201d It\u2019s easy to get wrapped up in your current financial obligations, telling yourself that you\u2019ll prioritize your retirement next year. However, like many worthy aspirations, a sound retirement plan takes time and discipline to achieve. If your golden years seem far away, remind yourself of the power of saving early. Time allows you to tackle your retirement goals in smaller increments with the potential for compounded growth. Retirement will likely come faster than you think, and your future self will thank you for planning ahead. \n\u201cI\u2019ll prioritize retirement after paying for my child\u2019s education.\u201d With the rising costs of college, it\u2019s understandable and even necessary for you to help your child obtain a quality education. However, your nest egg should be the top priority. Once you reach retirement, you have limited options if your savings come up short. Alternatively, your child can secure financial aid to pay for college, including scholarships, grants, work-study programs and loans. You simply don\u2019t have options like these to help fund your retirement. While retirement deserves the most attention, you can devise a strategy to simultaneously save for both important goals. \n\u201cMy retirement dreams are too expensive.\u201d If your dreams of traveling through Europe or starting a new hobby seem expensive, give yourself a reality check. Start by comparing your dreams to your current nest egg. Calculate the amount you need to maintain your lifestyle, cover potential unexpected expenses (such as healthcare) and achieve your retirement bucket list. If your savings come up short, create a plan to fill the gap. Lofty dreams will force yourself to ask the tough question, \u201cDo I want to adjust my current lifestyle to achieve this retirement dream?\u201d \n\u201cI won\u2019t be able to retire when I want.\u201d It\u2019s true that more Americans are working longer and delaying retirement. Some simply prefer to remain active contributors in the workforce, but many others are forced to postpone retirement until they accumulate sufficient resources to retire comfortably. If you dream of retiring early, carefully assess whether your nest egg is sustainable over several decades. You\u2019ll want to make sure the money you withdraw in the early years of retirement doesn\u2019t put you at risk of outliving your assets. \n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to save.\u201d If this phrase comes to mind, give your self-talk a flip. Instead, think \u201cI can\u2019t afford not to save\u201d. Setting aside even a small amount of money each month can make a big difference, as your assets can grow with the benefit of compounding. Consider increasing your monthly contribution to continue to build your nest egg. \n\u201cMy family will help me.\u201d Perhaps you\u2019re expecting a generous inheritance, or hoping that your adult kids will provide a financial cushion if you experience an unexpected expense. Regardless of who you believe may come to your aid, it\u2019s best to take your financial security into your own hands. Life is full of uncertainties that could impact the bank accounts for both you and your family members. Knowing your future is under financial control may give you, your children and your parents peace of mind. \nIt\u2019s not too late to correct misconceptions about the importance of saving for retirement. Consider working with a financial advisor to create a plan for your future. Together you can determine your savings targets and explore a wide range of strategies to meet your financial goals. It\u2019s time to talk yourself back in to retirement.

And there are a lot.\nHave fun enjoying the poetic sensual musings of E.L. James.\n. Fifty Shades Freed starts off with a flashback to Ana and Christian's first time as a married couple, which casually takes place on a plane. In other words, they join the Mile High Club, except it's a super fancy Mile High Club that has a bed. Also Christian licks Ana's feet so if foot fetishes aren't your thing please feel free to skip ahead.\n\"You are so beautiful\u2026wife.\" He runs his hands down my legs, then grasps my left foot. \"You have such lovely legs. I want to kiss every inch of them. Starting here.\" He presses his lips against my big toe and then grazes the pad with his teeth. Everything south of my waistline convulses. His tongue glides up my instep and his teeth skim my heel and up to my ankle. He trails kisses up the inside of my calf; soft wet kisses. I wriggle beneath him.\n\"Still, Mrs. Grey,\" he warns, and suddenly he flips me onto my stomach and continues his leisurely journey with his mouth up the backs of my legs, to my thighs, my behind, and then he stops. I groan.\n\"Please\u2026\"\n\"I want you naked,\" he murmurs and slowly unhooks my corset, one hook at a time. When it's flat on the bed beneath me, he runs his tongue up the length of my spine.\n\"Christian, please.\"\n\"What do you want, Mrs. Grey?\" His words are soft and close to my ear. He's almost lying on top of me \u2026 I can feel him hard against my behind.\n\"You.\"\n. According to Christian, your orgasm is more intense with a full bladder\u2014so he casually asks Ana not to pee, handcuffs her, and proceeds to make her climax. Also fun fact, Ana creates a safe word, AKA \"popsicle.\" Way to ruin fun childhood summer snacks for us!\nHe groans loudly and thrusts deep, again and again, over and over, and I am lost, trying to absorb the pleasure. It's mind-blowing\u2026body blowing\u2026I long to straighten my legs, to control my imminent orgasm, but I can't\u2026I'm helpless. I'm his, just his, to do with as he wills\u2026Tears spring to my eyes. This is too intense. I can't stop him. I don't want to stop him\u2026I want\u2026I want\u2026oh no, oh no\u2026this is too\u2026\n\"That's it,\" Christian growls. \"Feel it, baby!\"\nI detonate around him, again and again, round and round, screaming loudly as my orgasm rips me apart, scorching through me like a wildfire, consuming everything. I am wrung ragged, tears streaming down my face\u2014my body left pulsing and shaking.\n. In which Ana tries to please Christian by shaving her pubic hair, only she does it \"wrong,\" and he has to \"fix it.\" Like...maybe let Ana wear her pubic hair how she wants, Christian?!\nWith a gentleness that surprises me, he runs the razor over my sensitive flesh. \"Keep still,\" he says distractedly, and I know he's concentrating hard.\nIt's only a matter of minutes before he grabs the towel and wipes all the excess lather off me.\n\"There\u2014that's more like it,\" he muses, and I finally lift my arm to look at him as he sits back to admire his handiwork.\n\"Happy?\" I ask, my voice hoarse.\n\"Very.\" He grins wickedly and slowly eases a finger inside me.\n. Christian is feeling super emotional after accidentally hurting Ana with some handcuffs, so they have sex to work through the feels. The description \"he hisses\" is inexplicably used.\n He holds my head and with no preamble whatsoever he thrusts himself inside me, making me cry out\u2014more in surprise than anything else\u2014but I can still hear the hiss of his breath forced through his clenched teeth.\n\"Yessss,\" he hisses close to my ear. He stills, then swivels his hips once, pushing deeper, making me groan.\n\"I need you,\" he growls, his voice low and husky. He runs his teeth along my jaw, nipping and sucking, and then he's kissing me again, hard. I wrap my legs and arms around him, cradling and holding him hard against me, determined to wipe out whatever's worrying him, and he starts to move\u2026move like he's trying to climb inside me. Over and over, frantic, primal, desperate, and before I lose myself in the insane rhythm and pace he's setting, I briefly wonder once more what's driving him, worrying him. But my body takes over, obliterating the thought, climbing and building so I am awash with sensation, meeting him thrust for thrust. Listening to his harsh breathing, labored and fierce at my ear. Knowing that he's lost in me\u2026I groan loudly, panting. It's so erotic\u2014his need for me.\n. In case it wasn't clear from this header, Christian and Ana are involved in a high speed car chase (believable!) and have sex after the rush of excitement. Because nothing says \"romance\" like almost dying in a fiery car crash.\n\"Hands on my knees, baby. Lean forward. Lift that glorious ass in the air. Mind your head.\"\nShit! We really are going to do this, in a public parking lot. I quickly scan the area in front of us and see no one, but feel a thrill coursing through me. I'm in a public lot! This is so hot! Christian shifts beneath me, and I hear the telltale sound of his zipper. Putting one arm around my waist and with his other hand tugging my lacy panties sideways, he impales me in one swift move.\n\"Ah!\" I cry out, grinding down on him, and his breath hisses through his teeth. His arm snakes around me up to my neck and he grasps me under my chin. His hand spreads across my neck, pulling me back and tilting my head to one side so he can kiss my throat. His other hand grips my hip and together we start to move.\nI push up with my feet, and he tilts himself into me\u2014in and out. The sensation is\u2026I groan loudly. It's so deep this way. My left hand curls around the hand brake, my right hand braced against the door. His teeth graze my earlobe and he tugs\u2014it's almost painful. He bucks again and again into me. I rise and fall, and as we establish a rhythm, he moves his hand around beneath my skirt to the apex of my thighs, and his fingers gently tease my clitoris through the sheer finery of my panties.\n. Apparently post-car chase car sex just isn't enough to satiate Ana and Christian, so they go home to their playroom and hang out with a butt plug. Please prepare your eyeballs!\nHe smacks me hard once more so I cry out, then sticks two fingers inside me. He withdraws them immediately, spreading the moisture up, over, and around my anus.\n\"What are you going to do?\" I ask, breathless. Oh my\u2026is he going to fuck my ass?\n\"It's not what you think,\" he murmurs reassuringly. \"I told you, one step at time with this, baby.\" I hear the quiet spurt of some liquid, presumably from a tube, then his fingers are massaging me there again. Lubricating me\u2026there! I squirm as my fear collides with my excitement of the unknown. He smacks me once more, lower, so he hits my sex. I groan. It feels\u2026so good.\n\"Keep still,\" he says. \"And don't let go.\"\n\"Ah.\"\n\"This is lube.\" He spreads some more on me. I try not to wriggle beneath him, but my heart is pounding, my pulse haywire, as desire and anxiety pump through me.\n \"I have wanted to do this to you for some time now, Ana.\"\nI groan. And I feel something cool, metallically cool, run down my spine.\n\"I have a small present for you here,\" Christian whispers.\nAn image from our show-and-tell springs to mind. Holy crap. A butt plug. Christian runs it down the parting between my buttocks.\nOh my.\n. Basically, Ana wants to make out on the couch but Christian is like, \"nah let's do it.\"\n\"I want you,\" he murmurs, and it's a green light to my libido. My fingers move into his hair, pulling his head back so I can claim his mouth, fire licking hot and high in my belly. He groans and pushes me back onto the couch. He sits up and rips off my sweatpants, undoing his fly at the same time.\n \"Home run,\" he whispers, and swiftly he fills me.\n\"Ah \u2026\" I groan and he stills, grabbing my face between his hands.\n\"I love you, Mrs. Grey,\" he murmurs and very slowly, very gently, he makes love to me until I come apart at the seams, calling his name and wrapping myself around him, never wanting to let him go.\n. Sigh, poor sweet Ana is simply trying to wash Christian's hair, when he's like \"WAIT, NO, SUCK MY THUMB.\"\nHe leaves my damp blouse hanging open and, using both hands, he caresses my face with his fingers, his thumb skimming across my bottom lip. Suddenly, he thrusts his thumb into my mouth.\n\"Suck,\" he orders in a whisper, stressing the s. I close my mouth around him and do exactly that. Oh \u2026 I like this game. He tastes good. What else would I like to suck? The muscles in my belly clench at the thought. His lips part when I scrape my teeth and bite the soft pad of his thumb.\n He groans and slowly extracts his wet thumb from my mouth and trails it down my chin, down my throat, over my sternum. He hooks it into the cup of my bra and yanks the cup down, freeing my breast.\nChristian's gaze never leaves mine. He's watching each reaction that his touch elicits from me, and I'm watching him. It's hot. Consuming. Possessive. I love it. He mirrors his actions with his other hand so both my breasts are free and, cupping them gently, he skims each thumb over a nipple, circling slowly, teasing and taunting each one so that they harden and distend beneath his skillful touch. I try, I really try not to move, but my nipples are hotwired to my groin, so I moan and throw my head back, closing my eyes and surrendering to the sweet, sweet torture.\n. Following the thumb-sucking incident that we will never be able to remove from our brain, Christian starts masturbating in front of Ana. He's just full of fun surprises!\nHe smirks. \"You like?\" he whispers.\n\"Hmm,\" I murmur appreciatively. He wraps his hand around himself and moves it up and down \u2026 Oh my. I gaze up at him through my lashes. Fuck, he's so sexy.\n\"You're biting your lip, Mrs. Grey.\"\n\"That's because I'm hungry.\"\n\"Hungry?\" His mouth opens in surprise, and his eyes widen a fraction.\n\"Hmm\u2026\" I agree and lick my lips.\nHe gives me his enigmatic smile and bites his lower lip as he continues to stroke himself. Why is the sight of my husband pleasuring himself such a turn-on?\n\"I see. You should have eaten your dinner.\" His tone is mocking and censorious at once. \"But maybe I can oblige.\" He puts his hands on my waist. \"Stand,\" he says softly, and I know what he's going to do. I get to my feet, my legs no longer shaking.\n\"Kneel.\"\nI do as I'm told and kneel down on the cool tiled floor of the bathroom. He slides forward on the seat of the chair.\n\"Kiss me,\" he utters, holding his erection. I glance up at him, and he runs his tongue over his top teeth. It's arousing, very arousing, to see his desire, his naked desire for me and my mouth. Leaning forward, my eyes on his, I kiss the tip of his erection. I watch him inhale sharply and clench his teeth. Christian cups the side of my head, and I run my tongue over the tip, tasting the small bead of dew on the end. Hmm\u2026he tastes good. His mouth drops open farther as he gasps and I pounce, pulling him into my mouth and sucking hard.\n. The culmination of thumb-sucking and masturbation is the longest sex scene ever, which includes some, um, interesting descriptions of the noises Christian makes. (Please, no one ever use the words \"guttural\" or \"feral\" again.)\n\"Enough!\" he growls. Reaching behind me, he frees my hands with one tug on my panties. I flex my wrists and stare from under my lashes into scorching eyes that gaze back at me with love and longing and lust. And I realize it's me that wants to fuck him seven shades of Sunday. I want him badly. I want to watch him come apart beneath me. I grab his erection and scoot over him. Placing my other hand on his shoulder, very gently and slowly, I ease myself onto him. He makes a guttural, feral noise deep in his throat and, reaching up, pulls off my blouse, letting it fall to the floor. His hands move to my hips.\n. This particular sex scene ends somewhat awkwardly, when Ana can't handle being teased by Christian's vibrator and ends up using their safe word.\nHe holds it against my chest, and it feels like a large ball-like object vibrating against me. I shiver as it moves across my skin, down between my breasts, across to first one, then the other nipple, and I'm awash with sensation, tingling everywhere, synapses firing as dark, dark need pools at the base of my belly.\n\"Ah,\" I groan while Christian's fingers continue to move inside me. I'm close\u2026all this stimulation\u2026 Tilting my head back, I moan loudly and Christian stills his fingers. All sensation stops.\n\"No! Christian,\" I plead, trying to thrust my hips forward for some friction.\n\"Still, baby,\" he says while my impending orgasm melts away. He leans forward once more and kisses me.\n\"Frustrating, isn't it?\" he murmurs.\nOh no! Suddenly I understand his game.\n\"Christian, please.\"\n\"Hush,\" he says and kisses me. And he starts to move again\u2014wand, fingers, thumb\u2014a lethal combination of sensual torture. He shifts so his body brushes against mine. He's still dressed, and the soft denim of his jeans brushes against my leg, his erection at my hip. So tantalizingly close. He brings me to the brink again, my body singing with need, and stops.\n. TL;DR Christian has a nightmare and Ana has to make him feel better with sex. As ya do.\nOh my. I cry out as the world is concentrated at the apex of my thighs, and it's so erotic\u2014Fuck\u2014watching him. Watching his tongue against what feels like the most sensitive part of my body. And he shows no mercy, teasing and taunting, worshipping me. My body tenses and my arms start to tremble from the strain of staying upright.\n\"No\u2026ah,\" I murmur. Gently, he eases one long finger inside me, and I can bear it no more, collapsing back onto the bed, relishing his mouth and fingers on and in me. Slowly and gently, he massages that sweet, sweet spot deep inside me. And that's it\u2014I'm gone. I explode around him, crying out an incoherent rendition of his name as my intense orgasm arches my back off the bed. I think I see stars it's such a visceral primal feeling\u2026 Vaguely I'm aware that he's nuzzling my belly, giving me soft, sweet kisses. Reaching down, I caress his hair.\n\"I'm not finished with you yet,\" he murmurs. And before I've fully come back to Seattle, planet Earth, he's reaching for me, grasping my hips, and pulling me off the bed to where's he's kneeling, into his waiting lap and onto his waiting erection.\nI gasp as he fills me. Holy cow\u2026\n. A quick yet delightfully strange scene in which Christian fingers Ana and then has her kiss said fingers. Good times! \ud83d\ude36\nAbruptly he withdraws his finger, leaving me wanting more, and he moves around to face me. He places the tip of his invading finger on my lower lip. Instinctively, I pucker my lips and kiss it, and I'm rewarded with a wicked grin. He puts his finger in his mouth and his expression informs me that I taste good\u2026real good. I flush. Will it always shock me when he does that?\nHe grasps my hand.\n\"Come,\" he orders softly. I want to retort that I was about to, but in light of what happened in the playroom yesterday, I decide against it.\n. Christian has a very diverse palate, mmmkay?\nI seize the front of his pajamas and yank them down, freeing his erection. I grab and squeeze him. He's hard. The air whistles through his teeth as he inhales sharply, and I revel in his response.\n\"Fuck,\" he murmurs. He leans back, lifting my thighs, tipping me down onto the bed as I pull and squeeze him tightly, running my hand up and down him. Feeling a bead of moisture on his tip, I swirl it around with my thumb. As he lowers me to the mattress, I slip my thumb in my mouth to taste him while his hands travel up my body, caressing my hips, my stomach, my breasts.\n\"Taste good?\" he asks as he hovers over me, eyes blazing.\n\"Yes. Here.\" I push my thumb into his mouth, and he sucks and bites the pad. I groan, grasp his head, and pull him down to me so I can kiss him.\n. This scene is relatively basic. Other than Christian spanking Ana. Oh, and her being in leather cuffs. So like, relatively basic for Fifty Shades.\nI pull on my restraints and groan loudly in protest from his carnal assault. I'm trussed up in soft leather cuffs, each elbow bound to each knee, and Christian's head bobs and weaves between my legs, his masterful tongue teasing me, relentless. I open my eyes and gaze unseeing at our bedroom ceiling, which is bathed in the soft late afternoon light. His tongue moves round and round, swirling and curling over and around the center of my universe. I want to straighten my legs and struggle in a vain attempt to control the pleasure. But I can't. My fingers fist in his hair and I tug hard to fight his sublime torture.\n\"Don't come,\" he murmurs in warning against me, his soft breath on my warm, wet flesh as he resists my fingers. \"I will spank you if you come.\"\nI moan.\n\"Control, Ana. It's all about control.\" His tongue renews its erotic incursion.\nOh, he knows what he's doing. I am helpless to resist or stop my slavish reaction, and I try\u2014really try\u2014but my body detonates under his merciless ministrations, and his tongue doesn't stop as he wrings every last ounce of debilitating pleasure from me.\n\"Oh, Ana,\" he scolds. \"You came.\" His voice is soft with his triumphant reprimand. He flips me onto my front, and I shakily support myself on my forearms. He smacks me hard on my behind.\n\"Ah!\" I cry out.\n\"Control,\" he admonishes, and, grabbing my hips, he thrusts himself into me. I cry out again, my flesh still quivering from the aftershocks of my orgasm. He stills while deep inside me and, leaning over, unclips first one, then the second cuff. He wraps his arm around me and pulls me into his lap, his front to my back, and his hand curls beneath my chin around my throat. I revel in the feeling of fullness.\n \"Move,\" he orders.\nI moan and rise up and down on his lap.\n\"Faster,\" he whispers.\nAnd I move faster and faster. He groans and his hand tips my head back as he nibbles my neck. His other hand travels leisurely across my body, from my hip, down to my sex, down to my clitoris\u2026still sensitive from his earlier lavish attention. I whimper as his fingers close around me, teasing me once more.\n. Body oil! Restraints! Another casual evening at the Grey residence!\n\"I want to see you. See you enjoy your touch.\"\nOh fuck. I repeat the process. This is so\u2026erotic.\n\"Hands. Lower.\"\nI squirm.\n\"Keep still, Ana. Absorb the pleasure. Lower.\" His voice is low and husky, tempting and beguiling at once.\n\"You do it,\" I whisper.\n \"Oh, I will\u2014soon. You. Lower. Now.\" Christian, exuding sensuality, runs his tongue along his teeth. Holy fuck\u2026I writhe, pulling on the restraints.\nHe shakes his head, slowly. \"Still.\" He rests his hands on my knees, holding me in place. \"Come on, Ana\u2014lower.\"\n. File under: help.\n\"Your body's changing,\" he whispers. His thumb teases my nipple until it's erect and straining against my bra. \"I like,\" he adds. I watch his tongue taste and trace the line between my bra and my breast, tantalizing and teasing me. Taking my bra cup delicately between his teeth, he pulls it down, freeing my breast and nuzzling my nipple with his nose in the process. It puckers at his touch and from the chill of the gentle fall breeze. His lips close around me, and he sucks long and hard.\n. File under: no literally, help.\nThe strands of the flogger skim across my swollen belly at an aching, languorous pace.\"Have you had enough yet, Ana?\" Christian whispers in my ear.\n\"Oh, please.\" I beg, pulling on the restraints above my head as I stand blindfolded and tethered to the grid in the playroom.\nThe flogger's sweet sting bites into my behind.\n\"Please what?\"\nI gasp. \"Please, Sir.\"\nChristian places his hand over my ringing skin and rubs gently.\n\"There. There. There.\" His words are soft. His hand moves south and around, and his fingers slide inside me.\nI groan.\n\"Mrs. Grey,\" he breathes, and his teeth pull on my earlobe. \"You're so ready.\"\nHis fingers slide in and out of me, hitting that spot, that sweet, sweet spot again. The flogger clatters onto the floor and his hand moves over my belly and up to my breasts. I tense. They are sensitive.\nFrom: Marie Claire US\n Share Tweet Pin Email", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Chad Thompson \nBy Spencer Stueve \nThe Monrovia Wildcats began their 2017-2018 boys basketball season with an impressive win last Tuesday against Adelanto High School. The Adelanto Saints are coming off back to back Desert Sky League titles, but the Wildcats had no problem in the season opener. MHS won 62-53 to open the Sierra Vista Tournament on a positive note. \nThe rest of the tournament wouldn\u2019t be so easy, and the next three games would all come down to the wire. One day after beating Adelanto, the Wildcats fell to Gabrielino High School in overtime. The final score was 62-58. Things would not get easier in the final two games of the tournament. Monrovia snuck by Roosevelt 54-51, but then fell once again in overtime, losing 75-73 to Alhambra.

It is your obligation to restore the confidence and self esteem of women and men. In this judgmental society where face and status are important, it would be quite impossible for others not to judge and compare themselves with other people. Sometimes, instead of waiting for other people to discriminate them, they start thinking too little about themselves. They should have the appeal, the charm, and the charisma. You could give it to them, though. If you are competitive enough, you could grant women with their ultimate wish. You could also do the same thing to yourself. Now, think about of enrolling in the best esthetician schools in Vancouver WA . For those individuals who are planning to pursue this career, you better take your studies from a renown school. This is necessary. Truly, your lack of natural talent can be resolved by your hard work. Even so, regardless how much you worked for it, if your instructors are all unreliable, expect that your studies will stay obsolete and ineffective. Regardless how much effort you have given, if all of it is in the wrong direction expect that nothing would ever change in your life. You will always stay on the bottom. Of course, there are ways to overcome those walls. However, as for the ways, to find it, you still need to admit your mistakes. The future is filled with wonders. Do not try to hurry, though. Even with your poor luck, you can get used to the hard way. Truly, taking that route might be quite difficult. It is difficult to the point that you might give up on the end. Try to be more prepared. Strengthen your heart. Always focus your gaze on the goal. To succeed in this field, working with renown schools will give you an advantage. They have connections. Taking that aside, they also have highly experienced professionals and instructors too. They could teach you everything about cosmetics. When it goes to their facility, you can expect great things from them. That is a privilege only given to credible and wonderful people. Whether they worked for that or not, expect that someone out there worked that luck on their behalf. It might be their ancestors, their friends, or colleagues. It could be God. Do not contradict love. It always destroys all rules and defies all logic. Just imagine it. Every year, a lot of students will be enrolling for the class. Some of them will make it through the graduations. Others will not. From there, fresh graduates are bound to meet their seniors in the real world. Depending on your skills, you can be demoted or promoted. That is just the regular stage. Even so, if these matters cause you to put the quality of your education at risks, you better seek some alternatives. The future is much harder than this. If you cannot accomplish even this simple thing, you can be a great loser in the future. Life is not easy. This is for your career. You cannot just entrust your career on the internet. Certainly, this device might give you tons of advice, particularly, about your potential prospects. As for the credibility and the reliability of its data, though, try to confirm further. Do not be enticed or glued with their marketing strategy immediately. Always be competent.

Ruiz \nIt\u2019s almost winter but for lots of sunshine, blue skies, and no rain in the forecast. Yet, the calendar says it\u2019s December and all the stores are enticing us with every kind of sales promotion. And, of course, children are eagerly anticipating the Christmas season and winter break. \nAs we head towards the end of the year, some students are finishing up on the first semester and grateful that they are halfway through this school year. \nFRESHMAN \nWhat a relief it must be for your 9 th grader \u2013 he or she has survived the first semester of high school. While your children\u2019s thoughts may be all about Christmas holiday, this would be a good time to evaluate their progress. Remind them that while first semester grades don\u2019t show on the final transcript, these are barometers of their academic strengths and weaknesses. Encourage them to use the winter break to plan how to improve where needed and how to build on their successes going into the second semester. \nSOPHOMORE \nIf your children are taking AP courses they should also have taken the AP and SAT II exams. They should take the time to meet with their college counselors for guidance on how to improve their test scores, if necessary. Now is the time to look at their interests to determine what college course they might be suited for. Based on their aptitude and grades, they will have to start planning on their course options for 11 th grade. They can also start looking at which colleges offer the course they might want to pursue. \nJUNIOR \nThis is an all-important year for your 11 th grader and it is one of the busiest of their high school career. Your children should be able to successfully balance their academic and extra-curricular responsibilities. They should have already taken rigorous course loads, participated in campus activities, and moved into positions of leadership in whatever extra-curricular endeavor they chose. \nYour children should start preparing for the ACT or SAT exams either by taking practice tests online or by taking a prep course. By this time, college counselors have met with you and your children, and given you an overview of the college application process. They should already have been to at least one College Fair and have met with a few admissions officers. \nIt might also be an opportune time to visit some colleges, at least the ones in California, before the spring break when you might consider going to out-of-town universities. If you haven\u2019t thought about college visits, now is the time to put it on your calendar. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is for your children to see the campus for themselves. There is nothing more unfortunate than for them to matriculate to a college only to be miserable after the first few months. Adjusting to life away from one\u2019s parents and the reality of college life is bad enough; finding out they are in the wrong school is just an added disappointment. \nSENIOR \nWhile kids all around are excited about the Christmas holidays \u2013 thinking about what movies they want to watch, and where to spend their time during their winter break \u2013 your high school senior is sweating over his or her personal essay or feverishly writing all the supplemental essays colleges are requiring when they submit their college application. \nThis is a crucial time for every senior. He or she needs as much encouragement as elbow room to get their applications ready for sending. Your children should be in constant communication with the school counselor to ensure that all transcripts, teacher recommendations and supplemental material are sent to all the colleges to which they are applying. They should be on top of application deadlines for all the schools to which they plan to apply. \nIf your 12 th grader has received an acceptance letter from his or her first choice \u2013 whether through Early Action (EA) or Early Decision (ED), then he or she must be ecstatic. An ED means your child is legally bound to matriculate to that university, and his or her college search is over. Whew! If your child was accepted to a school through EA, he or she can either accept that offer or still go on to apply to other schools. \nAccepting an EA offer relieves your children of pressure so they can enjoy the Christmas holidays but it doesn\u2019t give them leverage if they are qualified for scholarships. The best scenario is to apply and get accepted to several colleges so your children can pick and choose where they get the best financial offer or scholarship. \nIf your children are fortunate enough to have heard from their school, and have been offered admission, it would be mindful of them not to brag about their acceptance. Some of his or her classmates may have applied to the same school and are hoping for admission. The university to which your child was accepted might be his or her classmate\u2019s first choice. It would be very hurtful to then boast that he or she has been accepted but is not planning on attending that college. \nOn the other hand, if your children have been deferred on the EA or ED round, there are some things they can do to enhance their chances during the regular round. They can write a strong letter of interest and intent \u2013 all colleges and universities are concerned about their yield. If they are assured that your child will matriculate if accepted, they will look at him or her in a more favorable light (that is, if your child fits the profile they are looking for). They can send any updates on any significant changes since they sent their application \u2013 a letter from a counselor about their first semester work or a letter from a senior teacher. They can also send in their first semester grades, especially if they have received some As in the meantime. \nProvide encouragement to your children if they have been deferred \u2013 the school isn\u2019t rejecting them, they have just been put in the pool for the regular round. Remember that these admission officers have thousands of applications to read. They wouldn\u2019t want to go through your children\u2019s application again if they weren\u2019t interested in the first place: they would have just outright rejected them. \nYour children should research all available scholarships, and start completing the FAFSA. \nSome useful websites are: CollegeXpress ( www.collegexpress.com ); Fastweb ( www.fastweb.com ); Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( www.fafsa.ed.gov ); National Merit Scholarship Corporation ( www.nationalmerit.org ); Scholarships.com ( www.scholarships.com ); Scholarships360 ( www.scholarships360.org ); Student Aid on the Web ( www.studentaid.ed.gov ).

Donald Trump during his presidency \u2014 and skier Lindsey Vonn has become the latest to have her say.\nTargeting Olympic gold at February\u2019s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Vonn is in St. Moritz, Switzerland, where she spoke passionately about what it means to compete for the US ski team.\n\u201cWell I hope to represent the people of the United States, not the president,\u201d Vonn told CNN\u2019s Alpine Edge.\nThe 33-year-old Vonn is getting ready for the final act of a long and illustrious career.\nAs well as competing for a second Olympic gold medal in South Korea, she is attempting to break the record of 86 World Cup victories held by Ingemar Stenmark since 1989.\nAway from the slopes, Vonn also appears willing to put her head above the parapet and speak out about US politics.\n\u201cI take the Olympics very seriously and what they mean and what they represent, what walking under our flag means in the opening ceremony,\u201d she added.\n\u201cI want to represent our country well. I don\u2019t think that there are a lot of people currently in our government that do that.\u201d\nThis year Trump has been embroiled in a controversy with the NFL and some of the NBA\u2019s top players \u2014 a spat with significant racial and cultural undertones \u2014 after he blasted prominent athletes for kneeling during the national anthem and refusing to come to the White House.\nAnd Vonn revealed she wouldn\u2019t accept an invitation to the White House if she were to win gold at Pyeongchang.\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d said Vonn. \u201cNo. But I have to win to be invited. No actually I think every US team member is invited so no I won\u2019t go.\nSerious injuries Pyeongchang will be Vonn\u2019s first Games since Vancouver 2010, where her downhill triumph turned her into a global star and one of the world\u2019s best-paid winter athletes with a net worth, according to Forbes, of about $3 million.\nVonn has battled with a number of serious injuries throughout her career, including a knee injury in 2013 that kept her out of the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\nLast year, she broke her arm and sustained nerve damage during a preseason training crash in the US, delaying the start of her season until January.\nVonn endured an underwhelming start to the new season, crashing out of last week\u2019s opening downhill event at Lake Louise.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "linds", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lindsey vonn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vonn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ingemar stenmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. moritz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyeongchang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sochi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake louise", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:29.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d07105f994280b0a0e10d246c190e5fe95f91697", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFemAxaNyDL0OmyzqSAeU7hFoc5.fua7sHKp7T4zornvkcSZt2kBT3XK5M7fcEuiBoJDOcl3dQv9Csx6zByx8CWJPifftjG1yn2rmnrFxd60.xHjpKw4Md.nuKL1ERIhEGOFqMWuVYwNgKS0v1flYmRTpl2s2U8og8f", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/interior-accessories", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Interior Accessories - Buy Interior Accessories at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "back seat Organizer Multifunctional Storage Back pocket Bag (Black)", "title_full": "Car back seat Organizer Multifunctional Storage Back pocket Bag (Black) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2000-12-31T18:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 30, "participants_count": 29, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.016, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3181e1505ef8610227889e016bb069dfa3c46ec5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFemAxaNyDL0OmyzqSAeU7hFoc5.fua7sHKp7T4zornvkcSZt2kBT3XK5M7fcEuiBoJDOcl3dQv9Csx6zByx8CWJPifftjG1yn2rmnrFxd60.xHjpKw4Md.nuKL1ERIhEGOFqMWuVYwNgKS0v1flYmRTnbqYAFqEUaR4rOq6jYSMS8-", "ord_in_thread": 28, "author": "Sharon C.", "published": "2017-12-02T10:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "The worst shopping experience with Lazada", "text": "Bad quality which not worth the price offered.

Bina Rai was born Krishna Sarin on July 13, 1... upperstall.com \nBina Rai   \nBorn Krishna Sarin \n13 July 1932 Lahore, [1] Pakistan Died 6 December 2009 (aged 78) Mumbai , India Other names Beena Roy Occupation Actress Years active 1950\u20131991 Spouse(s) Premnath Bina Rai ( Hindi : \u092c\u0940\u0928\u093e \u0930\u093e\u092f; 13 July 1932 \u2013 6 December 2009), aka \"Beena Roy\", was a leading actress, primarily of the black and white era of Hindi cinema . [2] She is most known for her roles in classics such as Anarkali (1953) and Taj Mahal (1963), and won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film Ghunghat (1960).\nContents 1 Early life 2 Career 3 Death 4 Awards 5 Filmography 6 References 7 External links Early life Bina Rai, born as Krishna Sarin, hailed from Lahore , Punjab, Pakistan. In 1947, her family was uprooted from Lahore, Pakistan during the communal frenzy and was resettled in Uttar Pradesh. She went to school in Lahore and then attended IT college in Lucknow , Uttar Pradesh, India. Bina Rai lived in Kanpur until she moved out for acting. She had to convince her parents to allow her to act in films, she claimed that she went on a hunger strike to convince her disapproving parents to let her join films, and they finally relented.\nCareer Bina Rai was a first year student of Arts in the Isabella Thoburn College of Lucknow in 1950 , when she came across an advertisement for a talent contest, she applied and received a call from the sponsors. Although she had been active in college dramatics, a film career was never within her field of vision. Nevertheless, she went to Bombay to participate in the contest, where she won along with the 25,000 rupees in prize money a leading role in Kishore Sahu's Kali Ghata (1951), which became her film debut, and also featured Kishore Sahu in the lead role.\nActually, Bina roy was born on 13 July 1932, and she signed the contract on her first film on 13 July 1950, namely Kali Ghatta . Her first film released on 13 July 1952, on the happy day she was engaged to Prem Nath. On 2 september 1952 she married actor Prem Nath , whose sister Krishna was married to the actor-director Raj Kapoor , and was part of the Kapoor family . They had acted together in some films, the first movie in which he was paired with Bina Rai was Aurat (1953), a Bollywood version of the tragic Biblical tale of Samson and Delilah (1949). The film was not a hit, but Bina Rai and Prem Nath fell in love with each other. They married and soon set up their own production unit, known as P.N. Films. Their first film from P.N. Films was Shagufa (1954) and they had pinned high hopes on it, but audiences rejected it. Neither Bina Rai's elfin charm nor Prem Nath's sensitive portrayal of the role of a doctor could save Shagufa from being a flop. And the films that followed Shagufa \u2013 Prisoner of Golconda , Samunder and Watan disappeared almost as soon as they hit the theatre screens. Thus the Prem Nath-Bina Rai pairing never clicked on the screen.\n  \nBina Rai with husbandPrem Nath \n\nHowever, her films with leading man Pradeep Kumar remain her best-remembered performances, where she played the title role in Anarkali (1953), Taj Mahal and Ghunghat , for which she won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress . [8] \nIn the 1970s, her son Prem Krishen became an actor and had one big hit; Dulhan Wohi Jo Piya Man Bhaye (1977), but couldn't sustain the momentum, so he turned producer, with the Cinevistaas banner, which went on produce TV series such as Kathasagar , Gul Gulshan Gulfam and Junoon . He launched his daughter Akanksha Malhotra as an actress in 2002 in his home productions, claiming that she reminds him so much of his mother Bina Rai.\nBina Rai stopped acting in films many years ago, claiming that women of a certain age don't get good roles. She also talks fondly of her husband Prem Nath who had died on 3 November 1992. In 2002, their son, Kailash (Monty) Nath released a tribute album, to his father on the occasion of his 10th death anniversary and 76th birth anniversary, titled Amar Premnath , released by Saregama . [9] [10] His grandson, Siddharth Malhotra, directed the successful TV series on doctors; Sanjivani (2004). [4] \nDeath Bina Rai died on 6 December 2009, following a cardiac arrest. She is survived by her two sons, Prem Kishen and Kailash (Monty), and grandchildren Sidharth and Akansha. Prem Kishen had a short term career as a film actor before shifting to film and television production; Cinevistaas Limited . His grandson, Siddharth Malhotra is a film director, who made his debut with Dharma Productions 's We Are Family (2010).
