Here's all the dope on what the bike gets, benefitting not just from TVS Motor's 35 years of experience in racing, but also from the brand's collaboration with BMW Motorrad. The Apache RR 310 is more than just an all-new product from TVS Motor The TVS's engine is inclined towards the rear to help extend the swingarm without making the motorcycle longer Engine The TVS Apache RR 310 uses the same 313cc, cylinder engine as the BMW G310R. Its power and torque outputs are the same, at 34PS and 27.5Nm, but TVS Motor is using its own custom ECU. The fuel injection system is a closed loop system sourced from Bosch. The engine is one of the biggest highlights on the motorcycle, apart from its handling. To know more, here is the link to our first ride review of the TVS Apache RR 310. Gearbox six-speed gearbox that is similar to the one on the BMW G310R and while ratios are identical, different. rear sprocket with 41 teeth as opposed to 40 teeth on the BMW's, to improve initial acceleration. The Apache RR 310's trellis frame is nearly identical to the BMW G310R's, with only a few minor diffences Chassis The trellis frame on the Apache RR 310 is also similar to the one on the BMW G310R \u0096 it isn't identical though and is slightly different. The changes have been made to enhance the bike's handling, given the fact that the Apache RR 310 is a fully-faired sportsbike unlike the BMW G310R that is a naked streetbike. The TVS Apache RR 310 uses 41mm upside down forks from KYB Suspension The TVS Apache RR 310 uses 41mm upside down forks upfront and a monoshock at the rear. TVS Motor has worked very closely with KYB, one of the biggest names globally when it comes to motorcycle suspensions. Apart from being tested extensively on public roads in India and abroad, the Apache RR 310 has been tested for over 3000 laps at the Madras Motor Race Track, to ensure the suspension setup is perfect. The TVS Apache RR 310 comes shod with Michelin Pilot Street tyres Tyres The TVS Apache RR 310 comes shod with Michelin Pilot Street tyres. The front end gets a 110/70 section tyre and the rear a 150/60 section. These are not specially developed tyres from Michelin and are available off the shelf. The TVS Apache RR 310's console uses a unique, vertical layout to offer all information in the line of the rider's vision Equipment The TVS Apache RR 310 boasts a unique, vertical layout for the instrument console. TVS Motor claims the vertical layout makes it easier for the rider to look at all the information on the display without having to look around as it is all in his line of vision. Aerodynamics TVS Motor has tested the Apache RR 310 extensively in a wind tunnel to bike has also been tested at an air strip for aerodynamics, and TVS Motor is claiming aero has a big role to play in the bike's claimed 0-60kmph time of 2.93 seconds and top speed of 160kmph. The riding position of the Apache RR 310 is not overly sporty and is meant to be comfortable for daily commutes and long rides as well Ergonomics The riding position on the TVS Apache RR 310 is not as committed as traditional supersport machines and is more upright and comfortable. TVS Motor states that most buyers in the category buy one motorcycle that is used in multiple environments \u0096 in city traffic for commuting, for riding long distances and for track days. The riding position has thus been engineered to offer the best ergonomics in various riding conditions. The TVS Apache RR 310 uses a 300mm petal disc at the front and a 240mm petal disc at the rear, ABS is standard and cannot be switched off Brakes The Apache RR 310 is equipped with a 300mm petal disc at the front and a 240mm petal disc at the rear, dual channel ABS is standard and cannot be switched like the Apache RTR 180. The Apache RR 310's fairing has been designed to also channel heat away from the rider, and according to TVS Motor it offers best in class heat management Heat management The fairing on the TVS Apache RR 310 has also been designed to channel heat away from the rider, thereby reduce the discomfort associated with faired sportsbikes in our traffic conditions. The fairing uses multiple vents for the effect and TVS Motor in fact claims the Apache RR 310 is best in class when it comes to dissipating heat away from the rider.

Tauseef Mustafa / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 2:27 am \nMonths after a tense standoff between China and India along their Himalayan border, Beijing on Thursday expressed anger at an Indian drone that crashed inside its territory. \n\"This action by India violated China's territorial sovereignty. We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Xinhua cited Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China's western battle zone command, as saying. \nChina said the drone crashed in \"recent days\" but didn't say where. Zhang said his country would defend its national sovereignty against such intrusions. \nHe said China's border defense forces conducted \"an inspection of the device,\" but didn't elaborate. \nIndia has not responded to the charge. \nAlthough the two countries have made moves toward warmer relations in recent years, they also have a long history of border tensions. In 1962, they fought a brief, but inconclusive border conflict. They have also had ongoing disputes over sovereignty in other border areas, notably Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region that straddles their territorial demarcation in the west. \nThe two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive because of his calls for Tibetan independence. \nStarting in June this year, tensions flared again over a disputed region called the Doklam Plateau that borders China, Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. \nAs NPR's Julie McCarthy reported from New Delhi in July , the problems stemmed from China's construction of a road in Doklam Plateau. \"Not far from the plateau lies the narrow passage that connects India's northeast states with the rest of the country \u2014 a strategic link called the Siliguri Corridor but more commonly known as the \"Chicken's Neck. \" Any possibility of China being able to sever that \"neck\" unnerves India. \nAs late as August, India had rushed troops to Doklam Plateau and although an immediate conflict was avoided, heated rhetoric on both sides has soured relations. \nIn September, India's army chief said that his country \"could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war,\" according to The Hindustan Times. \nAnd in November, China took umbrage at Indian President Ram Nath Kovind's visit to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, Reuters reports.

Fulton St. in Wilkes-Barre on Wednesday. Lightbox link Lightbox link \nWILKES-BARRE \u2014 A Heights neighborhood saw another intentionally set fire Wednesday, and Fire Chief Jay Delaney vowed that law enforcement would catch whoever is responsible for a recent string of arsons in the area. \n\u201cWe are going to do whatever we can to find out the person who continues to set these fires, and we will not stop until we get that person. Enough is enough in that neighborhood,\u201d he said. \nFirefighters went to 37 S. Fulton St. after a call came in at 4:36 p.m. Wednesday. They found flames at the rear of the house and extinguished them within 10 minutes, said Deputy Fire Chief Alan Klapat. \nThe address is one-third of a building that was the scene of an arson Sept. 2, when a fire burned a home 39 S. Fulton St. that neighbors said has been vacant for years. That fire damaged the connected and occupied homes on either side, including the home that burned Wednesday, and displaced the families living there. \nLess than a month earlier, another deliberately set fire burned an apartment building at 46-48 S. Sherman St., almost directly behind the site of those other fires, and displaced three people. \n\u201cWhen we send firefighters into these buildings, there\u2019s always a risk,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cI take these things personal. We ask our firefighters to risk a lot of things to put these fires out because there are a lot of good homes on that street, good families on that street. Whoever set this risked the lives of my staff, and we\u2019re going to do whatever we can to correct it and go get them.\u201d \nThe fire department contacted city police to investigate Wednesday\u2019s fire. \nAmanda Myzick lives across the street from the site of Wednesday\u2019s blaze. \nShe has helped extinguish fires in the shrubs in front of the abandoned home at 39 S. Fulton St. several times, grabbing a neighbor for help and filling buckets with water to throw on the flames. \nShe\u2019s noticed more police patrols in the neighborhood since it became the site of several intentional fires. \nNow, she\u2019s hoping the city will remove what has become a hazard just feet away from her front door. \n\u201cOur whole neighborhood is hoping that the houses actually come down, get demolished. Because how else are you going to stop it from happening again and again and again, for how many times it has happened already?\u201d she said. \nAhmad Azaizeh was helping fix a shower in Myzick\u2019s house when the fire started. He\u2019s worried that other houses on the block without residents might deteriorate over time, and he\u2019s worried that the already abandoned and burned houses across the street will continue to be a problem. \n\u201cOne house will throw off the whole block,\u201d he said, \u201cso imagine what three houses will do.\u201d \nContact the writer: \n570-821-2051, @CVBillW  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill wellock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay delaney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher dolan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan klapat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmad azaizeh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amanda myzick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s. fulton st.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delaney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher dolan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s. fulton st.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightbox", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "myzick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s. sherman st.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south fulton street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilkes-barre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilkes-barre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s. fulton st.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:13.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6867a3392e00a347b73f1c36f1b0301ccdf30d0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34kDxN3q322Sctwr.tRSrbp_tDASXT.kxOGEb.lodJZv_iH6ZLbskVG2nyej6D4IE8-", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/the-vestibule.5296/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "The Vestibule | IGN Boards", "title": "Creepiest Unsolved Mysteries?", "title_full": "Creepiest Unsolved Mysteries? | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T17:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "48a9d64846af20bd8a4782a5f30f5d0835013071", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34kDxN3q322Sctwr.tRSrbp_tDASXT.kxOGEb.lodJZv_iH6ZLbskVGoiNhJhCYkvtVRSaY.jVEZw--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "NY_Crusader93", "published": "2017-12-06T17:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Nice try Karl", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:13.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "837d16d96ff73c6ce1dcaf01aaa746a266fb4a51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyXACtGuGN9o7RVcUkKi146Q6sASjusfp9B2v_xK8snj.TteKX61t4ClqJANQQA7GQUMpE2uYs4bbPBWCuX90CP", "site_full": "pobsonline.com", "site": "pobsonline.com", "site_section": "https://pobsonline.wordpress.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "PobsOnline", "title": "My Celebrity Girlfriend Season 2 Episode 2", "title_full": "My Celebrity Girlfriend Season 2 Episode 2", "published": "2017-12-06T14:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/pobsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/picsay-1512481960.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "837d16d96ff73c6ce1dcaf01aaa746a266fb4a51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyXACtGuGN9o7RVcUkKi146Q6sASjusfp9B2v_xK8snj.TteKX61t4ClqJANQQA7GQUMpE2uYs4bbPBWCuX90CP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Prince Owusu Banahene Sarkodie", "published": "2017-12-06T14:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "My Celebrity Girlfriend Season 2 Episode 2", "text": "  2 By \nThe doctor came outside but he couldn\u2019t say a word.

I entered inside the taxi and i got to the church. \nI dipped my hand inside my pocket and brought out five thousand naira note and gave him. \nDriver; madam thank you, haa God bless you madam. \nHe was showering me with praises but i didn\u2019t care for one bit. \nI entered inside the church, went and saw the holy priest in his white garment as usuall. \nPriest: the blessing of the lord be upon you. Take a seat please. \nWe sat down on a bench inside the church. Truly speaking, i couldn\u2019t remember the last time i entered inside a church. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time i worshipped God but here am i, ready to make a covenant with him. \nPriest: so what brought you into the house of the lord. \nI took a deep breath, opened my mouth and told the priest everything, everything from the beginning to this present day\u2026 \nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD POBSONLINE ANDROID APP or visit www.pobsonline.com for more amazing stories \nMe: if only he could just wake up, i promise to serve the lord Jesus Christ all the day of my life. I promise to be nice and be respectful to everyone. \nPriest: hmm, what a touching story but are you ready to keep the covenant you are about to make? \nMe: yes i am. \nHe held my hands and prayed for me. I also surrounded my life to Jesus Christ and i could swear that i felt peace within me.. \nI stayed around with the priest for a while and stood up to go when my phone rang. I looked and it was Miracle calling me. .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "idris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "felix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus christ", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:13.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6867a3392e00a347b73f1c36f1b0301ccdf30d0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34kDxN3q322Sctwr.tRSrbp_tDASXT.kxOGEb.lodJZv_iH6ZLbskVG2nyej6D4IE8-", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/the-vestibule.5296/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "The Vestibule | IGN Boards", "title": "Creepiest Unsolved Mysteries?", "title_full": "Creepiest Unsolved Mysteries? | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T17:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa601d449b15953930c90849f0732ebce04967d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34kDxN3q322Sctwr.tRSrbp_tDASXT.kxOGEb.lodJZv_iH6ZLbskVGoiNhJhCYkvugHVtTLNEglQ--", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "bran1986", "published": "2017-12-06T18:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Dyaltov Pass is another really cool story\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyatlov_Pass_incident\nThe Voynich Manuscript\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyatlov_Pass_incident", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:13.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6867a3392e00a347b73f1c36f1b0301ccdf30d0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34kDxN3q322Sctwr.tRSrbp_tDASXT.kxOGEb.lodJZv_iH6ZLbskVG2nyej6D4IE8-", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/the-vestibule.5296/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "The Vestibule | IGN Boards", "title": "Creepiest Unsolved Mysteries?", "title_full": "Creepiest Unsolved Mysteries? | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T17:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6d7ab70a3046a0651a0078a47d9464be69e0d28b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34kDxN3q322Sctwr.tRSrbp_tDASXT.kxOGEb.lodJZv_iH6ZLbskVG258jQhOj__.kmmZRVLWEEg--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "-Cybersix-", "published": "2017-12-06T17:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I used to watch this show called Beyond, it had unsolved mysteries and paranormal shit.

Some people use cough medicine to get high. \nSide effects of an excessive amount of the drug can include blurred vision, confusion, difficulty urinating, drowsiness or dizziness, nausea or vomiting, shakiness and unsteady walking, slowed breathing and other side effects, according to the Mayo Clinic. \n\u201cThe House Judiciary Committee recently held an informational meeting at which committee members learned about the alarming variety of harmful substances that are being abused by young people in Pennsylvania,\u201d bill sponsor state Rep. Tarah Toohil, R-116, Butler Twp., said in a press release. \u201cOne example known as lean, sizzurp or purple drank, is a mixture of either codeine or DXM with soda or candy. My bill would help to limit the purchase of DXM to get a cheap high.\u201d \nThe bill would require anyone selling a product containing the drug to check the age of someone who appears to be younger than 25. Knowingly selling DXM to a minor or misrepresenting your age to buy a product with the ingredient would become a summary offense, and violators would be subject to a fine of between $250 and $500 for first offenses and $500 for subsequent offenses. \nThe law wouldn\u2019t apply if a patient had a valid prescription for the medicine. \nThe next step for the bill is consideration by the full House of Representatives. \nContact the writer: bwellock@citizensvoice.com \n570-821-2051, @CVBillW  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill wellock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tarah toohil", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "house judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "legislature", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mayo clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "harrisburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "butler twp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:13.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6867a3392e00a347b73f1c36f1b0301ccdf30d0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34kDxN3q322Sctwr.tRSrbp_tDASXT.kxOGEb.lodJZv_iH6ZLbskVG2nyej6D4IE8-", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/the-vestibule.5296/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "The Vestibule | IGN Boards", "title": "Creepiest Unsolved Mysteries?", "title_full": "Creepiest Unsolved Mysteries? | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T17:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "236e1a0f3d23efe72febf7aab20e1d0f62ed82e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34kDxN3q322Sctwr.tRSrbp_tDASXT.kxOGEb.lodJZv_iH6ZLbskVGoiNhJhCYkvuqEBjVSRcJeg--", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "Rircore", "published": "2017-12-06T18:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "tagged", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:13.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6867a3392e00a347b73f1c36f1b0301ccdf30d0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34kDxN3q322Sctwr.tRSrbp_tDASXT.kxOGEb.lodJZv_iH6ZLbskVG2nyej6D4IE8-", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/the-vestibule.5296/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "The Vestibule | IGN Boards", "title": "Creepiest Unsolved Mysteries?", "title_full": "Creepiest Unsolved Mysteries? | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T17:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54bd6cc50d156c18baf839d05f4bcf658bc3b78e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34kDxN3q322Sctwr.tRSrbp_tDASXT.kxOGEb.lodJZv_iH6ZLbskVGoiNhJhCYkvtkPEssFmz5cw--", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "TheFelchingBunyon", "published": "2017-12-06T19:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Holy fuck this one was disturbing.

Tom Wolf. The testing will also be moved to later in the school year, giving students a few more weeks of learning beforehand. \n\u201cThis change will ultimately increase instructional time for students and hopefully decrease the time our faculty and administration have to spend on assessment related logistics overall,\u201d Dallas School District Superintendent Thomas Duffy said. \u201cThe later testing window will also allow for increased instruction to occur prior to the assessments during a typical school year.\u201d \nDavid Volkman, the state Education Department\u2019s executive deputy secretary, said in a news release that the agency was responding to pressure to refocus on learning. \n\u201cThis improved schedule, along with the changes we made to the structure of the tests earlier this year, will address those concerns while maintaining the accuracy of the assessment,\u201d Volkman said. \nDolores McCracken, president of the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, praised the changes. \n\u201cGov. Wolf gets it on standardized testing,\u201d said McCracken, who heads the Pennsylvania State Education Association. \u201cHe\u2019s heard and understands what teachers, parents and students have been saying for a long time \u2014 that PSSA testing schedule should be pushed later into the academic year, to allow for more quality instructional time.\u201d \nThe tests this year will be two days shorter than they were in 2016, won\u2019t include math or English language arts sections and will have fewer science questions. \nThe Wolf administration also noted that the Keystone Exams, which test knowledge at the end of courses, are being delayed. \nThis year\u2019s PSSA tests, as they are widely known, will take place starting April 9. \nThe changes Wolf announced Wednesday will allow districts to begin the testing in the future as late as April 25.

But impoverishment, injustice and violence in communities around the world routinely serve to silence women, girls and trans people. This leaves them little choice but to fight to be heard and to have a say in the decisions that affect their lives. \nAnd they are doing just that. In villages, towns and city squares, in schools, health centres and courtrooms, through print, electronic and online media, feminist activists are raising their voices to claim their rights. They are speaking out and organising to make change in their communities. \nWhy is self-led activism so powerful? In self-led groups, people who have long been ignored or silenced are speaking for themselves and demanding to be heard. Self-led groups are founded, led and staffed not by well-intentioned allies or outsiders, but by people whose activism is rooted in personal experiences of stigma, violence and exclusion. \nMama Cash believes that social change resulting from self-led activism is more authentic and responsive to deep social injustices because it is organised by people who know what needs to change and have a real stake in securing social transformation. And because the change they advocate is structural, not cosmetic, it is more likely to last. The philanthropic sector has a crucial role to play in resourcing their groundbreaking activism. \nOur Voices Are Strong is a new report based on interviews with fifteen of Mama Cash\u2019s grantee-partners. \nThe research shows that the power of women, girls and trans people at the helm of self-led organisations lies in their use of direct, personal experience to push for greater inclusion and justice in their communities. \nWhether they are girl domestic workers in Tanzania, sex workers in Thailand, or lesbian, bisexual and trans people in Ukraine, their strategies for change are rooted in lived experience. \nComing from the communities they are trying to change gives these activists a keen understanding of the issues. \nAware Girls in Pakistan, for example, supports girls and young women to hone and practice political participation skills and then organises \u2018citizen committees\u2019 to facilitiate girls\u2019 participation and foster dialogue between girls and policy makers. \u2018Because our work is about changing the attitudes of the community [\u2026], it is very important for us to be seen as insiders\u2019, reflects one of the group\u2019s founders. \nThe research distilled four key lessons about how self-led groups secure change. \nFirst, they nurture and strengthen their organisations, building their collective capacities to mobilise constituencies for effective advocacy. \nSecond, they use shared values and culturally-specific messages to address their communities. This dialogue with the local community is key to changing oppressive norms and behaviours. \nThird, they target stakeholders, including policymakers and media, to shift and shape political agendas to take into account their visions and needs. \nFinally, they collaborate by networking and creating alliances with other civil society actors to amplify the voices of self-led constituencies. \nOur Voices Are Strong also makes recommendations to funders about how to support self-led activism. First and foremost, funders can provide the resources that self-led groups need most: flexible and longer-term funding. \nSustained, flexible resourcing allows groups to build their organisations and constituencies, engage with stakeholders and share their visions of success. Funders can also provide support that strengthens movements, not just individual organisations. \nFor instance, funders can support alliance building to amplify organisations\u2019 reach and voice, and introduce grantee-partners to other groups and movements. \nAt Mama Cash, the victories and advances secured by self-led feminist grantee-partners are a constant inspiration. Every day, these activists creatively and courageously envision a more just world, putting themselves on the line and insisting that every voice matters. \nSusan Jessop is Senior Officer for Content Development and Kellea Miller is Interim Senior Programme Officer for Influencing at Mama Cash .

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJim O'Brien reckons Rangers doing the double over Aberdeen was ideal for Ross County \u2013 as nobody will give them the slightest chance at Ibrox. \nDefeating the Dons twice in the space of five days lifted the Light Blues up to second and on the cusp of a hat-trick of victories for the first time since last December. \nO\u2019Brien helped County contain Celtic for 78 minutes in Dingwall last month then hold Hearts to a goalless draw at Tynecastle. \nAnd despite Dundee dishing out a 2-0 defeat on Saturday he believes the fact Gers have won just three of their eight Premiership games in Govan proves Ibrox isn\u2019t a fortress. Rangers are looking to make it three wins in a row following back-to-back victories over Aberdeen (Image: SNS) \nHe said: \u201cRangers had a good week last week and a couple of good results have shot them into second place so it is a good game to go into. \n\u201cAs players these are the games you want to play in with a big crowd and nobody expecting us to win or giving us any real chance. \n\u201cIn games like these you like to maybe surprise people. We have to turn things around from last week and the home defeat to Dundee. It was a bit out of character for us. \n\u201cWe watched little bits of it back and we will learn from it, move on and make sure it is put to bed. Owen Coyle's side suffered a 2-0 defeat to Dundee last weekend (Image: SNS Group) \n\u201cAt Ibrox you feel like an underdog when you see the crowd. Rangers are a big club \u2013 obviously bigger than us \u2013 but especially this season we\u2019ve seen teams go there and get results. We know we can do the same.\u201d \nCounty had looked more solid under Owen Coyle until last week, managing three clean sheets in eight league games after failing to notch one since the season started. \nDefeat at home to the Dark Blues was their worst display since his arrival but O\u2019Brien wants to tap into the spirit of County\u2019s last away day. \nHe said: \u201cDown at Hearts we didn\u2019t play particularly well but defended really well. We have talented players who can go and get something at Ibrox. \n\u201cWe will go there with our own game plan and put that into action. O'Brien was disappointed with the way his side performed in their recent clash with Hearts (Image: SNS) \n\u201cIf we are organised and show the sort of determination we did against Hearts \u2013 not let people get in and around the box and keep shots at distance \u2013 then why not go there and get something?\u201d \nO\u2019Brien had been in eye-catching form before missing the Dundee game through suspension while suffering a hamstring problem. \nBut he said: \u201cI will certainly be fresh while hopefully Rangers might have one or two wee niggles after two tough matches. \n\u201cHopefully we have our skipper Andrew Davies back as well after a couple of knocks.

Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2014 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they\u2019re not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they\u2019re often advertised as particularly useful for younger women\u2019s dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley American Cancer Society\u2019s chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women\u2019s breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2014 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2014 that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S. , and a few in Canada , will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They\u2019ll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don\u2019t have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman\u2019s results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\u201cMammography has been provocative over many decades.

Residents of Lincoln Plaza were displaced after a fire on the building\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sixth floor on Tuesday.Christopher Dolan / Staff Photographer Lightbox link Lightbox link \nWILKES-BARRE \u2014 Although three ladder trucks were present at the high-rise apartment building fire that killed two women Tuesday, the city fire chief says his decision not to deploy aerial ladder rescues for the building\u2019s 150-some elderly residents was the right one. \nChief Jay Delaney said the fact that the city\u2019s aerial ladder truck was out of service played no part in the decision to have many of the residents of Lincoln Plaza shelter in place. \nDelaney said claims on social media that the city\u2019s ladder truck had been out of service for several weeks were incorrect. He said the city\u2019s truck was out of service for 48 hours because it was having an alternator replaced at the Department of Public Works. \nThere were, however, ladder trucks from Kingston, Hanover Twp. and Plains Twp. on Wilkes-Barre Boulevard, in a cul-de-sac off East Northampton Street, and in a cul-de-sac off East Market Street and Lincoln Way, respectively, he said. \nDelaney said his decision not to order aerial rescues came down to risk management. \n\u201cIs it worth the risk to take an elderly person off a balcony and down a 90- or 100-foot ladder or trust the interior fire attack team and, if they have the fire knocked down, trust that it\u2019s safer for the residents to stay where they\u2019re at?\u201d Delaney said. \nThe chief said the interior attack team had the fire contained to one room. His options at that point were either to evacuate residents on foot through smoke-filled hallways, to take them down a ladder or to have them shelter in place, he said. \n\u201cI trusted our interior fire attack team\u201d that was under the command of Assistant Chief Ed Snarski, Delaney said. \n\u201cIt was the right call,\u201d Delaney added. \u201cNo one was injured and no one was taken to the hospital. We feel terrible about the unfortunate loss of life. And had the fire left the room, we had three aerial ladder trucks in position.\u201d \nSmoke, CO caused deaths \nLuzerne County Coroner William Lisman said forensic pathologist Dr. Gary Ross performed an autopsy on Luann Gilroy, 62, and determined she died of smoke inhalation as a result of the fire. \nGloria Nieves, 55, died of carbon monoxide intoxication as a result of the fire, Lisman said, adding that Nieves\u2019 cause of death was able to be determined without an autopsy. \nThe women lived in separate apartments on the fifth floor of the building, and Lisman said on Tuesday there were indications they were trying to exit the building when they died. \nThe Coroner\u2019s Office has not ruled on a manner of death pending the results of an investigation into the cause of the fire. \nDelaney said the Pennsylvania State Police Fire Marshal\u2019s Office has taken the lead in the investigation in conjunction with the city fire and police departments. \n\nRed Cross assisting \nDelaney said 43 of the 150 residents who were displaced are being sheltered in the gymnasium of GAR High School; the remainder are staying with family or friends. \nZara Khawaja, a disaster relief specialist with the American Red Cross, said numerous pets were rescued from the building, and firefighters coordinated with the Luzerne County Animal Response Team to bring them to the shelter. \nThe response team provided cages for the animals as well as food and other supplies. All of the animals had been matched with their owners, Khawaja said, adding that Nieves\u2019 family planned to pick up her cat later Wednesday. \nDelaney said he had stopped by the shelter Wednesday morning and had \u201cnothing but the highest praise for the American Red Cross. They\u2019re doing an amazing job providing food and cots and filling the needs of the residents there,\u201d Delaney said. \nThird-floor resident Paulette Haffenden agreed with the chief. \n\u201cThis really helps a lot. It\u2019s like my home away from home,\u201d Haffenden, 55, said mid-afternoon Tuesday at the shelter while waiting to return to her apartment. \n\u201cEverybody was courteous, professional. I feel welcome here. The Red Cross did a totally wonderful job. I can\u2019t stop praising them,\u201d Haffenden said. \nKhawaja said the Red Cross couldn\u2019t do what they do without donations and urged the public to contribute to the organization. \nHaffenden said she wasn\u2019t at home when the fire broke out around noon Tuesday. She heard about it and thought she had lost everything before arriving at the building around 9 p.m. Tuesday night. She was relieved to find out her possessions were not destroyed. \n\u201cThen I heard two people died. I am so sorry for them,\u201d Haffenden said. \n\nReturning home \nKhawaja said the Wilkes-Barre Housing Authority \u2013 the building owner \u2013 was providing a bus to take first- through fourth-floor residents back to Lincoln Plaza between 4:15 and 6 p.m. Wednesday. She didn\u2019t know when upper-floor residents could return. \nDelaney said the fifth floor sustained heavy fire, smoke and water damage, and there was a heavy odor of smoke remaining on the sixth through 10th floors late Wednesday morning. He said city code enforcement officials would inspect the building and give the OK before allowing residents to return. \nDelaney said housing authority officials would make the final call on which residents would be allowed to return and when. \nAuthority Executive Director Judy Kosloski did not immediately return a call seeking comment. \n\nNew truck needed \nCity officials are still waiting on word from Kosloski on whether the authority board will or won\u2019t contribute funding toward a new ladder truck for the city. \nWhile none of the aerial trucks at the fire \u2014 nor Wilkes-Barre\u2019s \u2014 had ladders that would extend to the top floor of the building, Delaney emphasized that the city needs a new ladder truck because the existing 2003 model is out of service for repairs too frequently. \nHe said the truck often remains out of service longer than a newer model would because the manufacturer went out of business in 2014, so replacement parts are hard to find as well as expensive. \nDelaney and Deputy Chief Alan Klapat made their case to the housing authority board in October why the city\u2019s ladder truck should be replaced, and why the authority should pay at least part of the $1.2 million cost for a new one. \nDelaney said the truck is \u201ccritical for high-rise fire fighting.\u201d \nIn addition to the authority\u2019s four high-rise buildings, there are 224 other buildings in the city higher than four stories. But the chief said the authority is \u201cone of the highest high-end users of the services of the fire department of any entity in the city,\u201d for fire and EMS calls. \nAuthority Deputy Executive Director Joe Pirillo has said Kosloski would seek guidance from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on the possibility of contributing toward the cost of the truck. \nContact the writer: \nsmocarsky@citizensvoice.com, 570-821-2110, @SteveMocarskyCV  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paulette haffenden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay delaney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zara khawaja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judy kosloski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary ross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nieves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delaney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william lisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightbox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe pirillo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kosloski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln way", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luann gilroy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan klapat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haffenden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed snarski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gloria nieves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khawaja", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coroner\u2019s office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of housing and urban development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gar high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red cross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilkes-barre housing authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luzerne county animal response team", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania state police fire marshal\u2019s office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of public works", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightbox", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delaney lincoln plaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln plaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilkes-barre boulevard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east market street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east northampton street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilkes-barre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilkes-barre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanover twp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luzerne county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "co", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:17.143+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "739800e44c0a35976e1dcd854c3e0ea2d6f3e0b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34DG7cV9ElC3ppnRAvQhwiVXm1wiIhH7raps1M4QE1KOkAGlZuNY324r8.jeBdAkdbQthH6OMGeN31jRtjddwQtG1oerLQrx33hI4dkjakEJ2WbO1vjd5NPxZmkKiKZe3juWgGa5DYzYQ--", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/nintendo-lobby.80041/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Nintendo Lobby | IGN Boards", "title": "Anyone feel that they cannot \"waste\" time on indie games on the Switch because of AAA games?", "title_full": "Anyone feel that they cannot \"waste\" time on indie games on the Switch because of AAA games? | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T15:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 20, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d49eac52d23ac81f04320f9324898df1d746c2fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34DG7cV9ElC3ppnRAvQhwiVXm1wiIhH7raps1M4QE1KOkAGlZuNY324r8.jeBdAkdbQthH6OMGeN31jRtjddwQtG1oerLQrx33hI4dkjakEJ2WbO1vjd5NPxZmkKiKZe3i.TWuz1zUmKD34XK2xBw9x", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "totecx1", "published": "2017-12-06T18:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I couldnt get into Shovel knight i like Shantea better than it.

Bob Mellow leaves the William J. Nealon Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse after pleading guilty to a felony conspiract charge in 2012. He has now won back his nearly quarter-million dollar pension. TIMES-SHAMROCK FILE Former Sen. Bob Mellow leaves the William J. Nealon Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse after pleading guilty to a felony conspiract charge in 2012. He has now won back his nearly quarter-million dollar pension. \nConvicted former state Senate Democratic Leader Robert J. Mellow has his $246,123 annual pension back for good. \nPending state House and Senate bills would close the legal loophole that allowed Mellow to get it back, but passing the bills won\u2019t strip his state pension again, state officials said Wednesday. \nState Rep. Scott Petri, R-178, Bucks, the House bill\u2019s chief sponsor, was not surprised by a state pension board\u2019s decision to restore Mellow\u2019s pension. \n\u201cI\u2019m just so sick of it,\u201d Petri said Wednesday in a telephone interview from Harrisburg. \u201cIt\u2019s not even the first time. The list goes on and on, and these are only the high-profile cases.\u201d \nThe State Employees\u2019 Retirement System board voted 6-5 to restore Mellow\u2019s pension. The system stripped away the pension shortly after his 2012 guilty plea to a federal felony conspiracy charge. \nAttempts to reach Mellow, 74, of Archbald, were unsuccessful. Under their divorce decree, Mellow will get $138,958 a year of the pension and his ex-wife, Diane, will get $107,165 a year, according to the pension board order. \nThe House passed Petri\u2019s bill amending the state public pension forfeiture law by a 190-1 vote on May 8, with all the legislators representing Luzerne, Lackawanna, Wayne, Susquehanna, Wyoming, Pike and Monroe counties voting in favor. The House sent the bill to the Senate where it remains pending in the finance committee. Sen. John Blake, the committee\u2019s Democratic chairman, succeeded Mellow, who supported his successful 2010 Senate bid. \nBlake, also a Senate Judiciary Committee member, voted for a similar Senate bill in that committee, which passed it April 26 by a 12-0 vote. \nJennifer Kocher, a spokeswoman for Republicans, who hold an overwhelming majority in the Senate, said the full Senate likely will vote on the bill next year. \nThe House also passed Petri\u2019s bill 188-2 in May 2016, but it died in the Senate Judiciary Committee when the 2015-2016 legislative session ended. \nBlake pointed out everything that led up to the case happened before he took office in December 2010, and said legislators cannot change the law retroactively. The pension amount reflects Mellow\u2019s 40 years of service and long time in leadership, he said. \nBlake said he knows the ruling will upset citizens. \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to distance myself\u201d from Mellow, a lifelong friend, he said, also pointing to his vote for reform. \u201cIt is what it is. I know people will react viscerally, but they should consider the context, consider his career and his contributions to the system.\u201d \nMellow pleaded guilty in May 2012, to felony conspiracy for using his Senate staff members for his political campaign work on state time and for filing a false tax return that saved him about $16,000 in federal taxes. \nA federal judge sentenced him to 16 months in prison, to pay a $40,000 fine and a $100 special assessment, and to repay the $79,806.17 that his use of Senate staffers for political work cost state taxpayers. \nMellow also had to pay the IRS $31,748 in unpaid taxes, penalties and interest for underreporting his income on the 2008 sale of the building that housed his Blakely Senate office. He served 14 months with two months off for good behavior and was released March 2014. \nLast year, he released a self-published book, \u201cUsed, Abused & Forgotten, Bob Mellow: A Targeted Senator.\u201d In it, he called the federal charges he pleaded guilty to \u201cbogus\u201d and \u201cfrivolous\u201d and portrays himself as a \u201cpure victim\u201d of prosecutors and media out to get him. \nPetri, R-178, Bucks, and Blake, D-22, Archbald, said the bills, if passed into law, could not retroactively strip a pension because that would violate Mellow\u2019s constitutional rights, but would mean anyone convicted of a felony \u2014 like Mellow \u2014 in any court would have to forfeit his or her state pension. \nScranton attorney Sal Cognetti, Mellow\u2019s lawyer, argued the federal conspiracy charge was not on the list of crimes that the state public pension forfeiture law says requires giving up a pension. \nThe pension board\u2019s majority opinion likened Mellow\u2019s conviction to the state crime of theft by deception, but that crime required Mellow to \u201cactually obtain money and property of the Senate.\u201d The federal conspiracy count did not charge the former senator with getting money or property, the board said. \nA dissenting minority opinion said the ruling undermines the law\u2019s deterrent effect. \nThe ruling, issued Nov. 6, came a few weeks shy of the fifth anniversary of Mellow\u2019s sentencing. \n\u201cThe decision is awful and it\u2019s going to set off a negative impact,\u201d said Eric Epstein, coordinator of Rock the Capital, a Harrisburg-based watchdog group. \u201cBob Mellow was not just another corrupt politician. Bob Mellow was the Babe Ruth of corrupt politicians. ... We had to pay him when he was in office, we had to pay (to lodge him) when he was in prison and we have to pay him now that he\u2019s retired.\u201d \nContact the writer: \nbkrawczeniuk@timesshamrock.com; 570-348-9147; @BorysBlogTT on Twitter  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "borys krawczeniuk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john blake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer kocher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mellow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william j. nealon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monroe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric epstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert j. mellow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott petri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sal cognetti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob mellow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pike", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blakely senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "luzerne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyoming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "archbald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lackawanna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scranton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harrisburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susquehanna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal building", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:18.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b36baaa0a25e7a290f1f09445eacc446af43d294", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jd7p9SLCvaHeQjJFaQoD_Vg1uFtm.fp_S2U_2fIuNgYWGq3VKVxCfbEu9hUgB97p.bIcvpyNGbG649Zcwu2r46JXgVHVpAMFfp.EpaGCLSIEnEgHoOyqM8H.LfDXpGfic6A3TU.SrVFRg--", "site_full": "citizensvoice.com", "site": "citizensvoice.com", "site_section": "http://citizensvoice.com/cmlink/top-stories-from-citizensvoice-com-1.46602", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Stories from citizensvoice.com", "title": "Family of veteran who survived Pearl Harbor attack recalls his service", "title_full": "Family of veteran who survived Pearl Harbor attack recalls his service", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.citizensvoice.com/polopoly_fs/1.2276323.1512620239!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_700/image.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b36baaa0a25e7a290f1f09445eacc446af43d294", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jd7p9SLCvaHeQjJFaQoD_Vg1uFtm.fp_S2U_2fIuNgYWGq3VKVxCfbEu9hUgB97p.bIcvpyNGbG649Zcwu2r46JXgVHVpAMFfp.EpaGCLSIEnEgHoOyqM8H.LfDXpGfic6A3TU.SrVFRg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bob Kalinowski", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Family of veteran who survived Pearl Harbor attack recalls his service", "text": "WILKES-BARRE \u2014 U.S. Army Sgt. John Ostrum survived the attack on Pearl Harbor and helped save countless lives fighting the fires that erupted from the relentless bombing. \nHe died in 1977 without getting proper recognition for the heroism he displayed 76 years ago today. \nEarlier this year, the Wilkes-Barre man\u2019s family finally received his war medals, including the Bronze Star. \n\u201cIt felt really good we got something for his heroism,\u201d his daughter, Jill Williams, 70, said Wednesday. \nIn the months after the attack at Wheeler Army Airfield in Pearl Harbor, Ostrum received the Purple Heart medal for injuries he sustained. His commander had also nominated for other medals, including the Silver Star, according to U.S. Army records maintained by Ostrum\u2019s family. \nBut it took 75-plus years to get them. \nOstrum was nominated for the medals for \u201cmeritorious acts of extraordinary fidelity and essential service during the attack on Wheeler Field by Japanese forces (aircraft) on 7 December, 1941,\u201d the nomination letter says. \nThe letter says Ostrum, a firefighter in the Army Air Corps who supervised 140 people, voluntarily commanded a truck and crew to an area under heavy attack. \n\u201cThe hangar was in flames, airplanes both inside and outside were burning and there was imminent danger from explosions of gasoline tanks and enemy bombs. Sergeant Ostrum, without heed for his personal safety, with the assistance of the members of his crew, moved a large oil tanker from the vicinity of the fire and then turned his attention to the fire in the hangar,\u201d says the letter, dated May 5, 1942. \nMany lives were saved, and lots of U.S. government property was spared, as a result, the commander noted. \nWilliams, of Wilkes-Barre, said her dad always recalled Dec. 7, 1941, as a regular day that turned into hell in seconds and thrust the United States into World War II. \n\u201cHe thought they were having a drill and he said before you realized it, people were running all over. The Japanese planes were so close you could see the insignia on it,\u201d she recalled. \nOstrum, who grew up on Barney Street and graduated from Meyers High School in 1936, was honorably discharged from the Army in October 1945. He later worked for decades at the Wilkes-Barre Fire Department, where his son, John, is now an assistant chief. \nWilliams said her father tried for years to get his medals, but was unsuccessful prior to dying unexpectedly during a hunting trip in 1977 at age 58. His widow, Mary, continued the effort, but she too didn\u2019t succeed prior to her death in 2006. \nWilliams and Ostrum\u2019s other children then kept trying. It took them four years, but U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-17, Moosic, finally was able to get Ostrum\u2019s medals earlier this year. They were awarded his medals during a ceremony in February. \n\u201cThe only disappointment to me is he didn\u2019t get the Silver Star,\u201d Williams said. \u201cTo this day, I don\u2019t know why.\u201d \nbkalinowski@citizensvoice.com, 570-821-2055 \n@cvbobkal \n\nListen to The Washington Post podcast that retells World War II though the eyes- and letters- of four brothers here.

the agency. But FBI directors traditionally have been low-key and stoic \u2014 with Wray\u2019s predecessor, James Comey , a notable exception. And Trump\u2019s firing of Comey while he led the Russia probe shows the risk of antagonizing the president. \nWray\u2019s defense, in an email to FBI employees this week, didn\u2019t directly mention Trump\u2019s comments, leaving some current and former officials wishing he had pushed back more forcefully. \nWray said he was \u201cinspired by example after example of professionalism and dedication to justice demonstrated around the bureau\u201d and urged agents to \u201ckeep focused on our critical mission\u201d while constantly under a microscope. \nFor some agents still reeling from Trump\u2019s firing of the popular Comey, the episode cut to the heart of their deepest concern: whether a Trump-appointed FBI director would be able to stand up to a president who routinely lashes out at law enforcement and has publicly lamented his inability to directly influence the agency\u2019s affairs. \nWray repeatedly promised during his confirmation hearing that he could be independent, but \u201cthe jury is still out\u201d on whether he has demonstrated that, said Frank Montoya Jr FBI official who keeps in contact with agents still on the job. \n\u201cThe absence of comment from the top, to us, has been really frustrating,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cOn the inside, it\u2019s like, why are we still a punching bag and nobody is counter-punching? A word of comfort or of calm or a sign of leadership would be appreciated at this time.\u201d \nWray has stayed mostly under the radar in his first months on the job and has subtly tried to distance himself from Comey, who was widely criticized for publicly announcing that Hillary Clinton shouldn\u2019t face criminal charges for her use of a private email server. Wray, for example, said he couldn\u2019t imagine holding a news conference about someone who had not been charged, noting Justice Department \nThose close to Wray, a former high-ranking Justice Department official in the Bush administration, describe him as a steady hand whose low-key demeanor makes him well-suited to lead the FBI during a tumultuous time. He has seemed relaxed but reserved in his few public appearances. His memo Monday to employees ended with his favorite work-ethic maxim: \u201cKeep calm and tackle hard.\u201d \n\u201cIn a society sometimes fixated to a fault on results, I am somebody who is a big believer in the importance of the integrity of process,\u201d Wray said at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in October. \u201cThat\u2019s part of how I am hoping to sort of steady the ship. By staying laser-focused on the mission and the work itself, day in and day out, left foot right foot, grinding away. Following the rules. Following the law. Trying to make sure we are doing the right thing, but in the right way.\u201d \nTom O\u2019Connor , president of the FBI Agents Association , said Wray has been supportive of agents\u2019 concerns so far, meeting with the organization shortly after his confirmation. \n\u201cHe has said that, in the four months since becoming director, he has learned more about, and is even more impressed with, agents\u2019 work ethic and commitment to the bureau\u2019s mission,\u201d said O\u2019Connor, who issued his own impassioned defense of the FBI \nOthers defended the agency as well, including Eric Holder", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montoya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric holder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom o\u2019connor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james comey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank montoya jr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o\u2019connor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi agents association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international association of chiefs of police", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:18.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81e87e81d3fffb81ba7e062ae20c49d57dc8b062", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzkl4reaHt1xXrYYBHxR2T5YxbKzUul1EvqaCe5FgmSNVoS7Pi2mI1PtXDk7I53mIo-", "site_full": "forum.blu-ray.com", "site": "blu-ray.com", "site_section": "http://forum.blu-ray.com/forumdisplay.php?f=134", "site_categories": ["home_video_dvd", "shopping", "tech"], "section_title": "3D Blu-ray Movies - Blu-ray Forum", "title": "Biggest 3D surprise of the year", "title_full": "Biggest 3D surprise of the year - Blu-ray Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T09:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2897, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b85494c454f4bf37c142c1d485229010526f5388", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzkl4reaHt1xXrYYBHxR2T5YxbKzUul1EvqaCe5FgmSNVoS7Pi2mI1PeUC4Gx2bzuWVidPOedd0iw--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Paul H", "published": "2017-12-07T04:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : Best conversion hands down for me is still DOCTOR STRANGE.

They said the search warrant was sealed by a judge for 60 days and no one was immediately arrested. \nSgt. James Dunleavy, station commander for the Shickshinny state police barracks, said troopers were acting upon a complaint received. \nTroopers performed the search \u201cto investigate allegations of misconduct within the church,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe were contacted and an allegation was made. We began an investigation into those allegations,\u201d he said. \nDunleavy is encouraging anyone with information about possible wrongdoing at the church to call the barracks at 570-542-4117. \nThe church\u2019s website describes the congregation and its leadership. \n\u201cWe present solutions, not scoldings. We grow people, not programs. The Bible presents the truth. We teach the truth. You choose to apply the truth. We emphasize God\u2019s principles, rather than human rules,\u201d the website says. \nParishioner Arden Delkanic, 72, stopped by the church Wednesday morning after hearing it was surrounded by state police vehicles. \nDelkanic said the church is run by a great man in Brubaker. \n\u201cHe\u2019s an excellent pastor,\u201d Delkanic said. \u201cThe man walks the walk and he talks the talk.\u201d \nContact the writer: \n570-821-2055, @cvbobkal  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paster dan brubaker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james dunleavy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dunleavy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan brubaker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delkanic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brubaker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arden delkanic", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "roaring brook baptist church", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hunlock creek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shickshinny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pritchards road", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:18.046+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15133430, "moreResultsAvailable": 15133330, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512638478046&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 785}
