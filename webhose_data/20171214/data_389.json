Price Marshall Jr., who recused on Oct. 12, saying, \"I served on the Arkansas Court of Appeals with Judge Griffen, Justice [Karen] Baker, Justice [Courtney Hudson] Goodson, and Justice [Josephine] Hart. My impartiality in handling this case between my former colleagues could reasonably be questioned.\" \nThe case was next assigned to Chief U.S. District Judge Brian Miller, who on Oct. 19 also recused, writing that he had also served on the Arkansas Court of Appeals with Griffen, Baker and Hart. \n\"I have great respect for all three judges and view them very kindly,\" Miller said in his recusal order. \"Therefore, it would be very difficult to rule on this case without taking into account my feelings for them.\" \nThat same day, the U.S. district clerk's office reassigned the case to U.S. District Judge James Moody Jr., who was a Pulaski County circuit judge before taking the federal bench. Moody has not filed a recusal notice. \nIn a motion and supporting brief filed Wednesday, Griffen cited the U.S. Code, which requires any federal judge to \"disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned\" or \"where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.\" \nNoting that the purpose of Title 28, Section 455 of the U.S. Code is \"to promote public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process,\" Griffen's attorney, Mike Laux, said that \"if this matter remains before Judge Moody, the legitimacy of its outcome will be questioned by an attentive public. \n\"Moreover, by virtue of previous relationships and prior professional experience -- alongside Judge Griffen and several expected material witnesses -- Judge Moody has personal knowledge of specific matters which will undoubtedly be contested during the litigation,\" Laux said. \nMetro on 12/07/2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "linda satter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "griffen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josephine] hart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james moody jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen] baker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike laux", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wendell griffen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "courtney hudson] goodson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshall jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laux", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moody", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "little rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pulaski county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:11.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb2d69b70e71126c136d8b62289bccb1164ce7f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTMaTZO3d.7ok7C5mTXA8WhhXj26gWHXz.msyRHLZt99s3L0jaNcu6kgrUCe6lMoAXnIoYmssyzYmHeZjhN290GZD_Jhy1wqOTYadGIm7OSEA--", "site_full": "www.cherokeeforum.com", "site": "cherokeeforum.com", "site_section": "https://www.cherokeeforum.com/f46/", "site_categories": ["vehicles", "auto_parts", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Jeep Builds - Jeep Cherokee Forum", "title": "Jeep Cherokee xj w/ one tons and 40's - Page 3", "title_full": "Jeep Cherokee xj w/ one tons and 40's - Page 3 - Jeep Cherokee Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T08:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a6ccde12b7fbdb12a9658a51a27ebde13faf11b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTMaTZO3d.7ok7C5mTXA8WhhXj26gWHXz.msyRHLZt99s3L0jaNcu6kgrUCe6lMoAXnIoYmssyzYmHeZjhN290GZD_Jhy1wqOSkIJj0Jf4aw81bs9JBbo_x", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "mannydantyla", "published": "2017-12-06T12:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : The longest build thread in the history of the internet, actually.

He was fatally shot in the back as Cummings, then 46 and not yet a certified officer, attempted to handcuff him. \nThe jury must decide whether Cummings intentionally used excessive force in violation of Wallace's rights, as alleged in a lawsuit filed by Wallace's mother, or if the shooting was an accident, as Cummings' attorneys maintain. \nThe lawsuit claims Cummings shot Wallace as he tried to run away. \nIf the 10 women and two men of the jury decide Cummings used excessive force, they can award damages to Jacquelyn Wallace, who filed the wrongful-death lawsuit against Cummings, former Alexander Police Chief Horace Walters and the city of Alexander in 2014. Wilson dismissed everyone but Cummings from the case in 2015. \nCummings said Wednesday that she first saw Wallace on that September day walking in the middle of Brookwood Road in Alexander. He appeared to have a gun in his waistband, she said. \nAs Cummings spoke to him from her police sport utility vehicle, his words were \"long and drawn out\" and he appeared \"high,\" she said. \nCummings said Wallace then pulled out the gun and pointed it at her. \nAt that point, Cummings said, she had exited her black Dodge Durango and had drawn her gun, a semi-automatic pistol. She yelled at Wallace to drop his weapon, and he tossed it aside. \nAttorney Jimmy Morris Jr., who, along with Reggie Koch, represents Wallace's mother, asked Cummings why she did not radio for additional support. \nCummings said police walkie-talkies did not work in that part of town. It would have been unwise to return to her patrol unit to use the car radio, she added. \nInstead, she tucked her pistol to her right side and walked Wallace to the front of the SUV. He placed his hands on the vehicle's hood. \nIt was then, according to Cummings' account, that Wallace \"jerked real hard,\" throwing her off balance. The gun fired, striking Wallace in the back. \n\"The gun just went off by itself?\" Morris asked. \n\"I'm not saying that,\" Cummings said. When asked whether she recalled pulling the trigger, Cummings said no. \nWhile holding an unloaded training weapon, Morris said the type of gun Cummings was issued can't fire unless the trigger is pulled. He asked whether Cummings was suggesting that her finger \"slipped\" enough to pull both the safety and the trigger. \n\"He jerked me so hard I was actually falling,\" Cummings said, adding that the struggle took place in a matter of seconds. \nLater Wednesday, jurors heard from Emmanuel Kapelsohn, a firearms expert from Virginia hired by Cummings' attorneys, who said the situation Cummings described is \"absolutely consistent with involuntary muscular contraction,\" in which a finger resting on a gun reacts instinctively when the holder is startled or suddenly loses balance. \nKapelsohn testified that the trajectory of the bullet and the stippling it left on Wallace's bare back are consistent with Cummings being spun around and involuntarily firing the gun. \nHe said the evidence shows that \"it cannot be\" that Cummings drew the gun out of a holster or grabbed it off the hood and fired it, because in the time it takes to do that, \"an average man would have covered 21 feet, and there would be no stippling.\" \nA forensic pathologist testified Monday that the gun was fired from about 5 inches away. Kapelsohn testified he believed it was more like 3 or 4 inches away. There was also testimony that blood drops on the ground placed Wallace only 3 feet 8 inches from the patrol vehicle. \nKapelsohn told jurors that because of the way sound travels -- slower than light -- two boys standing 52 yards away at the time of the shooting \"misperceived what was happening\" and thought Wallace began running before the gun fired, which could not have happened. \nAs Cummings answered questions, she took breaks to dry her eyes and steady her breath. \nCummings' attorneys, John Wilkerson and Keith Wren, asked to play three minutes of her interview with Arkansas State Police, which investigated the shooting. Koch objected. \n\"This doesn't serve any purpose in this trial other than let the jury see her cry,\" he told Wilson. \n\"We just wanted to establish that she was upset,\" Wilkerson said. \nWilson allowed the jurors to hear the audio snippet. They also heard from Jacqueline Wallace. \nShe told the jury her son was the youngest of five children, a landscaper who adored the outdoors. \nAside from funeral costs and medical bills, her family is now raising her deceased son's child, Jacqueline Wallace said. \nCummings' defense then asked a blood spatter and forensics expert from North Carolina to testify. \nTom Martin disputed the plaintiff's claim that Wallace was trying to run away when he was shot. Blood droplets indicate the man was moving \"very slowly,\" he said. \nHe also contested the testimony of the two boys who said they saw Cummings fire directly at Wallace. \nClosing arguments are set to begin at 9 a.m. today in Wilson's Little Rock courtroom. \nInformation for this article was contributed by Linda Satter of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. \nMetro on 12/07/2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emma pettit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "horace walters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel kapelsohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilkerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy cummings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda satter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reggie koch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy morris jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith wren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacqueline wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cummings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacquelyn wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kapelsohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john wilkerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy roy wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carleton wallace", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "arkansas state police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander police", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dodge durango", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookwood road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "little rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:11.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c55a7634d5d59d6aad32fee7635d5de66216e286", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSlQF.AY_S5wR4lqgh5KMyFBN20CRdV21CfV6tlFzkc37MJPhdvJg4GwczrGQ6mzQxGzW6OaXP7yw--", "site_full": "rayondevie.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://rayondevie.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Gifts & Gadgets \u2013 Rayons de vie\u2026", "title": "Gifts & Gadgets", "title_full": "Gifts & Gadgets", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c55a7634d5d59d6aad32fee7635d5de66216e286", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSlQF.AY_S5wR4lqgh5KMyFBN20CRdV21CfV6tlFzkc37MJPhdvJg4GwczrGQ6mzQxGzW6OaXP7yw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rayondevie", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "Gifts & Gadgets", "text": "\nBEARD BAUBLES \nFestive facial hair doesn\u2019t have to be white, long and bushy like Santa\u2019s famous fuzz.\nThese clip-on mini baubles bring a whole new meaning to the Christmas beard.

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

It is a matter of who that will be with, though. \nMcInnes has never worked under a Director of Football before and could be seen as more of a manager, in the traditional sense, than a Head Coach. \nSo the demarcation lines between he and Mark Allen must be made clearly. Allen has had a key role in the recruitment process in recent weeks and the working relationship that he forms with McInnes will be crucial going forward. \nRead more: Rangers must back Derek McInnes in the transfer market if he becomes new Ibrox boss, says Kris Boyd\u200b \nBoth are ultimately working towards the same goal and with the same targets in mind but they will need to share a philosophy when it comes to player identification, the youth department and the scouting structure. \nAllen will be the first point of contact for McInnes on all football matters, with the former Manchester City academy chief then reporting to Managing Director Stewart Robertson. \nUltimately, every major decision will be run by Dave King and the trust and backing of the chairman will be significant for McInnes. \nKing had differing relationships with Mark Warburton and Caixinha and he will hope to strike up a far more successful alliance with the next man in the dugout. \nSQUAD \nThe group of players that McInnes will inherit is of a greater strength and depth than the one that he leaves behind at Pittodrie. \nBut it is still some way off being capable of challenging at the top of the Premiership and it will need further surgery sooner rather than later. \nGraeme Murty has shown in recent weeks that it is possible to get more out of the players that underperformed and underachieved during Caixinha\u2019s reign and McInnes will hope he can improve the squad individually and collectively. \nRead more: Derek McInnes is the man to transform Rangers' fortunes, says St Johnstone stopper Joe Shaughnessy\u200b \nEveryone on the books will see the new era as a clean slate and a chance to impress but some have more ground to make up than others and even a change in the dugout won\u2019t be enough to prolong their Ibrox careers. \nWith the January transfer window just weeks away, time is of the essence for Rangers and McInnes will hope to quickly establish who he can work with and who will be allowed to leave. \nBUDGETS \nRangers have seen little return for their considerable outlays over the last two years and that must change if they are to close the gap to Celtic on and off the park. \nKing has already stated that funds will be made available to strengthen the squad but only time will tell how much cash McInnes feels is required next month and how much is saved for the summer transfer window. \nThe money at his disposal, both in terms of fees and wages, will increase several fold and McInnes will now be able to shop in a different market than the one he scoured at Aberdeen. \nMcInnes will be well aware of what is needed to get the Gers up to standard and will expect the Light Blues hierarchy to sign the big cheques as and when required. \nRead more: Rangers close in on Derek McInnes after Aberdeen boss holds talks over his Pittodrie future \nRECRUITMENT \nThe Ibrox board can\u2019t be faulted for backing both Warburton and Caixinha with significant funds but the strategy in the market can be questioned. \nIt would be no surprise to see McInnes operate a safety-first approach to the next stage of the rebuild. The likes of Kenny McLean and Louis Moult would certainly improve the Ibrox squad for relatively low outlays. \nThe new scouting structure implemented by Allen will be tasked with uncovering talent at both home and abroad but McInnes has already shown that he is a shrewd operator in the transfer market. \nHe will have the final say on all incomings but he will have to work with Allen to identify the characteristics of what he expects in a player. His knowledge of the club and Scottish football will certainly prove useful here. \nINFRASTRUCTURE \nMuch of this will come under Allen\u2019s remit and the appointment of Andy Scoulding as Head of Scouting was an important step for the Welshman. \nNine-in-a-row hero John Brown will scout the domestic market, while Dave Swanick will scour Europe for players and Billy McLaren will search for youngsters to bring into the Auchenhowie Academy. \nRead more: Rangers must back Derek McInnes in the transfer market if he becomes new Ibrox boss, says Kris Boyd\u200b \nRangers have invested in the youth system in recent years and Craig Mulholland is likely to be left to continue with his blueprint for the future. It remains to be seen if Under-20s boss Murty will have a role at first team level, though. \nMcInnes will inherit a significant backroom team and behind the scenes staff but will have the resources to bring his own people on board if required. \nRESULTS \nThe appointment of McInnes hasn\u2019t been universally popular with supporters but the former Light Blues midfielder will get the backing of the Ibrox crowd from the off. \nThe win for Murty\u2019s side at Pittodrie on Sunday was the first of seven fixtures the Gers will play this month and McInnes will have to hit the ground running if he is to pull away from the Dons. \nRangers won\u2019t be expected to challenge Celtic for the title but the Old Firm clash in a couple of weeks gives McInnes a chance to get a big game win under his belt early on. \nAMBITIONS \nThe goals for the remainder of the campaign are twofold for Rangers. The first objective is to finish best of the rest in the Premiership and the other is to mount a serious challenge for the Scottish Cup. \nNeither should be beyond the Gers in the coming months and ending the season with a bit of momentum will be crucial to allow McInnes to gear up for the Europa League qualifiers and his first full crack at the top flight.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st johnstone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graeme murty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy mclaren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derek mcinnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcinnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kris boyd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warburton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewart robertson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caixinha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis moult", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe shaughnessy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig mulholland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenny mclean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kris boyd\u200b  rangers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro caixinha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave swanick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy scoulding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewart milne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark warburton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "light blues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auchenhowie academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europa league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rangers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittodrie", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ibrox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittodrie", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:13.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a86f555f33d7d2484b6dfefaa1daade86f31c11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwwI2uIUSts.llJU7DBb8kITxhqmDjFA3qY13AYziBOtrxCGecC46VRO6ZM8TfhLYv3i79rjO2g0oyUGXcyqNTnUJAYlZtmXkDy39Bj6s0vzfpydZPjc_ZEKs27t7XuSJ8ZrmeDrpVowQ--", "site_full": "forums.leagueunlimited.com", "site": "leagueunlimited.com", "site_section": "http://forums.leagueunlimited.com/forums/nrl.71/", "site_categories": ["rugby", "sports"], "section_title": "NRL | The Front Row Forums", "title": "Which teams are likely to improve in the NRL in 2018? 4", "title_full": "Which teams are likely to improve in the NRL in 2018? | Page 4 | The Front Row Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T15:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.leagueunlimited.com/data/avatars/m/46/46065.jpg?1471476771", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a86f555f33d7d2484b6dfefaa1daade86f31c11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwwI2uIUSts.llJU7DBb8kITxhqmDjFA3qY13AYziBOtrxCGecC46VRO6ZM8TfhLYv3i79rjO2g0oyUGXcyqNTnUJAYlZtmXkDy39Bj6s0vzfpydZPjc_ZEKs27t7XuSJ8ZrmeDrpVowQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Spot On", "published": "2017-12-07T15:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Which teams are likely to improve in the NRL in 2018? 4", "text": "Spot On said: \u2191 Do I need too???\nTwo of the games top earners, steering the ship around as play makers for sides that have recruited very well and have pretty good depth.

His ability to drive that lesson down your heart in whatever way he can endear us to him. From punchlines to life and leadership lessons, this generation has definitely learnt some things from Bishop. \nIf you are familiar with Papa (as he is fondly called), you must have noticed his love for white suits. The bulk of his pictures feature him in a white suit, white shoe and red tie. Of course, we don\u2019t know why but we think it\u2019s just a representation of a lifestyle of Truth and Purity and nothing more. \nLast night, Bishop took it a step further. In case you missed it, yesternight was the opening session of the annual Shiloh at Cannanland Ota. Bishop Oyedepo graced the occasion with his white mini Mafia suit. One that spoke of strength, vigour and power. \nWhether Bishop Oyedepo just tried to pepper them or be extra like Jesus, we absolutely love it.

Now 28 years old and at a crossroads in his career, Walcott has been part of the furniture at Emirates Stadium for over a decade and is currently the club\u2019s longest-serving player. \nDespite his loyal service, Arsenal\u2019s longest serving manager Arsene Wenger has struggled to find a place for Walcott in his starting XI since the back end of last season \u2013 and with World Cup 2018 on the horizon, that doesn\u2019t look set to change anytime soon. \nWalcott has seen his appearances in the Arsenal first team restricted to just Europa League and Carabao Cup matches this season, with only 46 minutes of game time coming off the bench in the Premier League so far. The Gunners play Belarusian outfit BATE Borisov on Thursday night in a dead rubber match which presents itself as a rare opportunity for Walcott to shine in the starting XI alongside other fringe players like Jack Wilshere and Olivier Giroud. \nSenior players can almost go \u2018missing\u2019 if they\u2019re not involved in consecutive matchday squads and while some fans may believe that Arsenal are better off with Walcott, his impressive numbers and overall contribution to the cause show that they will find it difficult to get better value elsewhere right now. \n\u201cHe works hard to come back \u2013 he had a sickness a few weeks ago \u2013 and after I didn\u2019t change the squad,\u201d said Wenger in his pre-match press conference ahead of Thursday\u2019s match. \u201cIn training he looks sharp and he will show that.\u201d \nWhen asked if he would keep Walcott in the January transfer window, Wenger simply replied: \u201cYes\u201d. \nIt\u2019s worth noting that Walcott scored 19 goals last season and didn\u2019t play for the last 10 games of the campaign due to Wenger\u2019s formation switch. Indeed, the 3-4-2-1 system has somewhat rendered Walcott\u2019s position redundant in the starting line-up as Arsenal currently deploy tactics that don\u2019t play to his strengths. \nWith Alexis Sanchez seemingly on his way out of the club either in January or next summer, Walcott should be careful before making a rash decision on his future as he may yet find himself playing regularly in the team again. \nThe main word around Walcott\u2019s career over the years has been \u2018hype\u2019. From signing for Arsenal as a fresh-faced 16-year-old to being included in England\u2019s 2006 World Cup squad despite only playing sporadically for the senior side on two occasions previous to that, Walcott has had high expectations on his shoulders for over a decade. The barometer to measure him should surely be based on what he has delivered to this Arsenal team \u2013 goals, assists and match-winning contributions. \nWalcott could find himself complementing Alexandre Lacazette if Chile star Sanchez does eventually leave in January. The two would almost certainly combine well and play off each other\u2019s unique qualities where movement, positioning and runs are concerned. As it stands however, there is no room for Walcott in the starting line-up unless Wenger opts to change Arsenal\u2019s formation to four at the back again.

The MP and barrister had opened the newspaper just a year earlier. The young Crosbie made an instant impression as a gifted newspaper man and rapidly ascended to the editor\u2019s position. When Maguire died in 1872, Thomas Crosbie became proprietor. \nHe turned the newspaper from a three-evenings-per-week publication to a six-mornings-per-week title which it remains today. He also launched the company\u2019s other landmark title, the Evening Echo, in 1892. \nFour more generations not only consolidated the products under Thomas Crosbie Holdings but also oversaw what was, at one point, Ireland\u2019s fastest growing media organisation, acquiring a newspaper almost every year in a buying spree of media assets including radio stations. \nIn 2000, The Examiner cemented its national intentions by rebranding as the Irish Examiner before making one of TCH\u2019s most noteworthy acquisitions, another national newspaper, The Sunday Business Post , from Trinity Mirror for \u20ac10m in 2002. At one point, the group owned 18 newspapers. \nHowever, the acquisitions came at a cost. The portfolio growth was led by TCH managing director Anthony Dinan, who was given shareholdings in the new purchases. \nHe was asked in 2005 whether the group was for sale as there was increasing UK publisher interest in buying Irish newspapers. He reiterated TCH\u2019s expansionist plans saying: \u201cRather than be acquired. We are acquisitive. The healthy results across the group\u2019s portfolio of businesses means that TCH is well placed to continue the acquisitive path.\u201c \nBut there was concerns in some quarters that, for all the millions being spent on new titles, not enough was being invested in the cash generating titles, the Irish Examiner and the Evening Echo which were delivering significant profits right up to the most recent economic crash. \nHowever, from entering 2006 debt free not least due to the sale of the Irish Examiner\u2019s long-standing home in Academy Street, the company found itself with a total bank debt of \u20ac27m at the start of 2011. \nSo what changed? Without doubt, the economic crash hit the newspaper industry hard and the TCH titles were no different. \nWith Mr Dinan gone from the company in 2010, his replacement Tom Murphy, current Landmark Media Investments chief executive, set about making cutbacks, not least by selling off or closing loss-making titles. \nHe also set about streamlining, as well as strengthening operations within the titles and businesses which remained. \nHowever, by 2013, it became clear a complete financial restructuring was required. \nThomas Crosbie Holdings went into receivership on March 6, 2013, and was acquired by a new Crosbie-owned company, Landmark Media Investments. That restructuring was carried out with the support of the group\u2019s banker AIB, which provided working capital and resources for investment. It also marked a parting of the ways with The Sunday Business Post leaving the group. \nThe restructuring secured the jobs of 554 staff across the company and, as Mr Murphy pointed out, at the time: \u201cFollowing a prolonged period of uncertainty, today\u2019s developments represent an important opportunity for the Irish Examiner and associated titles and media to make a fresh start. In a challenging environment, this restructuring and consequent acquisition provides a stable platform from which to build a sustainable business.\u201d \nA move to offices at Blackpool on the northside of Cork City was accompanied by the introduction of a new cloud-based system specially tailored to a 21st-century media organisation determined to be relevant on every media platform. \nThe streamlining of operations has continued over the last four years. \nEarlier this year, Wexford Echo Limited which was a part of the Landmark Media Group and which included the Wexford Echo, Gorey Echo, New Ross Echo and the Enniscorthy Echo, was put into liquidation. \nStaff numbers have dropped from 554 at the time of the restructuring to a current total of 410 \u2014 260 in Cork and 150 in other locations across the country. \nThe changes the company has made to the way it presents its media product have paid dividends. \nLandmark Media Investments recorded a profit before taxation of \u20ac287,000 for the 12 months ending January 1, 2017. \nThe Irish Examiner has also been to the forefront of the news agenda, particularly in the last two years, not least in leading the coverage of the garda controversies thanks to Special Correspondent Michael Clifford and in recent months, Political Editor Daniel McConnell and Political Correspondent Fiachra \u00d3 Cionnaith won a Newsbrand Ireland Journalism Award for their dedicated coverage of the \u201cGrace\u201d scandal. \nAs chairman and principal shareholder Tom Crosbie says: \u201cThere has been a cold wind blowing for a long time in the traditional media industry. This move will make sure the Irish Examiner and its sister titles are blown in the right direction.\u201d Landmark Media statement \nI am delighted to announce that the Irish Times DAC has agreed to purchase the entire business of the Landmark Media Group. \nThe Irish Times DAC will own The Irish Examiner and Evening Echo and all other group newspapers, websites, Recruit Ireland and all of its radio interests once the contract conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals, is completed. \nThe transaction is subject to a number of conditions including receipt of regulatory approvals from The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment as well as The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (for the radio interests). It is expected that these approvals could take at least 4 months to procure. \nI would like to place on record my personal appreciation and the appreciation of the board of Landmark Media to all staff members for their support, understanding and particularly for their patience. We acknowledge that throughout this delicate and sometimes public process that it has been a difficult period for all staff members, reading and listening to commentary, much of it uninformed and speculative. For our part, we believe we have done everything possible to make and implement the right decisions in relation to the Landmark business and all of its stakeholders, particularly our very valued and loyal staff colleagues. \nI believe that a sale of the Landmark Media business to The Irish Times is in the best interest of all of our newspaper and other media companies and assets and that it is the correct outcome also for The Irish Times and the Newspaper and Media industry generally in Ireland. Consolidation within the industry is an inevitable outcome and both Irish-owned groups will be best positioned to survive and prosper as part of a larger, stronger and better resourced and unified entity. The Irish Times has been in existence since 1859 and its Management, Board and Trust are well aware of and suitably resourced to enable them to meet and navigate the challenges of the industry today. \nOur Bank, AIB have been with us on this journey for some time now and I must acknowledge and thank them for their support, resourcefulness and patience in enabling us to pursue and achieve the outcome being announced today. \nFrom an operational standpoint, it is business as usual for all of us. We must continue to be focused on putting out the best newspapers we can, selling the greatest numbers of newspapers possible and also, most importantly, selling the greatest possible amount of advertising, as we work our way to formal contract completion, hopefully, before the Summer. \u2018Irish Times\u2019 statement \nThe Irish Times DAC and the owners of Landmark Media Investments have signed a share purchase agreement whereby The Irish Times will acquire all of the publishing and media interests of the Landmark group. As part of the acquisition, the company\u2019s bankers, AIB, have supported a significant debt restructuring. The Share Purchase Agreement was signed on December 5, 2017. \nThe acquisition will require separate and consecutive filings to both the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (the CCPC) and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. This process is expected to take between four and six months to complete. \nThe publishing and media interests include the Irish Examiner along with the Evening Echo, regional titles, digital and radio assets. The opportunity to acquire Landmark Media is an important strategic decision for The Irish Times. It is the intention to retain the core identity and independence of the respective news publishing titles. Each will retain their editorial integrity. \nThe overall increase in audience allows the group to build a digital platform with a strong reach, countrywide and internationally. The consolidation also presents the opportunity to strengthen and grow existing print advertising revenues and helps to secure contract print revenues. \nIf the application to the CCPC and to the Minister are successful, The Irish Times is fully committed to working with the respective Union groups in each company on any restructuring proposals that will need to be made. The Irish Times has a proven track record of achieving cost savings, maintaining quality content while also working with staff and their representatives in a consultative partnership model. \nThe combination of the two groups brings together two organisations with a quality focus and strong ethos. The combined scale provides opportunities for consolidation, secures existing revenues and provides a platform to build and grow new digital readers and revenues. It is a positive step in the protection of two Irish-owned media organisations, and will help ensure their long-term futures. \n\u2014 Liam Kavanagh NUJ statement \nTHE National Union of Journalists notes the decision of The Irish Times to purchase the assets of Landmark Media Group, including The Irish Examiner, The Echo and seven regional newspapers. \nIn a reaction to the announcement S\u00e9amus Dooley, Irish Secretary said: \u201cWe are seeking a meeting with management to explore the implications for staff and will be seeking assurances regarding security of employment in the newspapers and radio stations involved in the proposed acquisition. \n\u201cWe welcome the assurance by Liam Kavanagh, Managing Director that the editorial integrity and independence of the titles will be maintained and I have already got an unambiguous assurance that trade union recognition will continue. Workers employed by Landmark Media Group have been operating under a cloud of uncertainty and today\u2019s development will help ease the fears of our members. \n\u201cObviously we will be examining every aspect of the proposed acquisition, including the implications for media diversity and plurality but these assurances provide a constructive starting point. \n\u201cIrish Times staff will be seeking specific assurances about the maintenance of the distinct editorial character of The Irish Times. This is a major departure for the company and the NUJ will be entering into discussions with management on the potential implications for employees of the parent organisation. \n\u201cPending the approval of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Minister for Communications, and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland Landmark staff will be employed by that company and we will continue to represent their interests. Members who may have concerns are being encouraged to contact the company.\u201d Regulatory steps to be completed \nStephen Rogers Before a media merger can be implemented, it must be approved by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and the minister for communications, climate action and the environment under the Competition Act 2002. In addition, separate approval of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will be required in relation to change of ownership in any media business that holds a broadcasting licence (i.e. a radio station) The approval must first be sought by the CCPC. It will carry out an initial investigation during Phase 1 of the process. It can decide to grant approval at that point but cannot decide on prohibition in this phase. CCPC must decide over a 30-working period of Phase 1 whether to grant approval or push into a phase 2 period of investigation. During that 30 working day period the CCPC may request information from the parties, which will have the effect of resetting the phase 1 investigation period to when the parties respond in full to that request. The period for conclusion of the Phase 1 investigation may be extended to 45 working days if the parties submit proposals to address potential concerns with a view to them becoming binding if the CCPC approves the merger at Phase 1. If the merger is pushed into Phase 2, the CCPC has 120 working days from the date of notification (or, if the CCPC made a request for information in Phase 1, the date of response to that request) to make its final decision. That 120 working day period may be paused where the CCPC makes a request for information and resumes when the parties respond to that request. After the 120 working day period it can decide to either grant approval unconditionally; grant it with conditions or prohibit the merger. Once the CCPC has concluded its investigation (whether at Phase 1 or Phase 2), the parties must then notify the merger to the Minister within 10 working days. While the role of the CCPC is to consider whether the merger will substantially lessen competition, the Minister is looking at the public interest implications (i.e plurality of the media and concentration of ownership) . Again, he has a 30 working day period to make an initial decision. He can approve the merger at that point or ask the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to carry out a full (or phase 2) investigation. There are also provisions for the setting up of an advisory panel by the Minster to assist the BAI.

Wickline Posted: December 7, 2017 at 4:30 a.m. \nRepublicans from Cabot and Marshall on Wednesday filed to run in Feb. 13 special primary elections for vacant legislative seats. \nRicky Hill of Cabot filed papers with the secretary of state's office to seek the Senate District 29 seat that became vacant with last month's resignation of Sen. Eddie Joe Williams, R-Cabot. Williams became President Donald Trump's representative to the Southern States Energy Board. Hill is executive vice president with the Bank of the Ozarks and a former Cabot School Board member. \nSenate District 29 includes parts of Faulkner, Lonoke, Pulaski and White counties. \nJ. Donald Ragland of Marshall filed papers to run for the House District 83 seat that became vacant with last month's resignation of Rep. David Branscum, R-Marshall. Branscum left to serve as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development director in Arkansas. Ragland is a Searcy County justice of the peace who was the Searcy County sheriff from June 2013 to December 2014. He also is a retired Arkansas Game and Fish Commission wildlife officer. \nHouse District 83 includes Newton County and parts of Carroll, Boone, Pope and Searcy counties. \nThere is a third special primary election on Feb. 13 for Senate District 16, which became vacant with last month's death of Sen. Greg Standridge, R-Russellville, after a battle with cancer. Senate District 16 includes Newton and Pope counties and parts of Boone, Carroll and Van Buren counties. \nThe filing period for all three vacant legislative seats started Wednesday and ends at noon Dec. 13. If special primary runoff elections are needed for any of the three seats, they will be held on March 13. The special general election for the three seats will be held May 22 -- the same day as next year's regular primary election. \nMetro on 12/07/2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cabot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael r. wickline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ragland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg standridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. donald ragland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "searcy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ricky hill of cabot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david branscum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pope", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carroll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "branscum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eddie joe williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faulkner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "van buren", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "marshall republicans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of the ozarks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabot school board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of agriculture's rural development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate district 16", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern states energy board", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "searcy county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newton county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carroll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lonoke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pulaski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boone", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:13.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5344ce228f3eabc5df02d46e6e6b537adbe5a179", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXennrs_LKo5.PS8emXFzChjim.7Icvk6lpHfe_7tGqPnxxn6BHSG7LtfCuDxinDg-", "site_full": "role-player.net", "site": "role-player.net", "site_section": "https://role-player.net/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=5", "site_categories": ["roleplaying_games", "hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Intros and Who's Who", "title": "Butter Slide Right Back In", "title_full": "Butter Slide Right Back In", "published": "2016-05-04T02:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9e6039ae8fe38f64f837698b47357f14f4a2c71c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXennrs_LKo5.PS8emXFzChjim.7Icvk6lpHfe_7tGqPnxxn6BHSG75e4kz_2CbSN_RZeH6tBXzYTmS4d3.lps", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Omac", "published": "2017-12-07T10:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hey, Rabbit you can't tell the other mods about this.

Graet admits that a comeback after more than two years out in the cold for the Real Madrid striker is tough to envisage (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 4:15 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 4:15 a.m. ET \nKarim Benzema should not expect to return to the international fold any time soon, French Football Federation (FFF) president Noel Le Graet has said. \nReal Madrid striker Benzema has been out of the France set-up since October 2015 having become embroiled in a scandal involving an alleged attempt to blackmail Mathieu Valbuena over a sex tape. \nHaving seen the Court of Cassation \u2013 the country's court of final appeals in civil and criminal proceedings \u2013 boost his defence by ruling in his favour in July , the 29-year-old last month spoke of his desire to return for Les Bleus. \nFrance coach Didier Deschamps said it was \"boring\" to be frequently asked about whether he would pick Benzema ahead of the 2018 World Cup, and Le Graet suggested the former Lyon forward should not get his hopes up. \n\"You would have to be blind or deaf to not understand that Benzema will be difficult to select right now. It seems to be incontestable to me,\" the FFF chief told RMC . \n\"We must also say that there are a number of talented players in attack, so the problem is perhaps less so than a few years ago. \n\"Deschamps picked him a lot during years when he was not brilliant in the French team.\" \nRegardless of whether Benzema is included in Deschamps' squad for the competition in Russia, Le Graet has already outlined to the coach and players what he expects.

The task is to count the number of different array that can be formed of size n such that each element is between 1 to k and two consecutive element are different. Also, the first and last elements of each array should be 1 and x respectively. \nExamples: Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution. \nThe idea is to use Dynamic Programming and combinatorics to solve the problem. First of all, notice that the answer is same for all x from 2 to k. It can easily be proved. This will be useful later on. Let the state f(i) denote the number of ways to fill the range [1, i] of array A such that A 1 = 1 and A i \u2260 1. Therefore, if x \u2260 1, the answer to the problem is f(n)/(k \u2013 1), because f(n) is the number of way where A n is filled with a number from 2 to k, and the answer are equal for all such values A n , so the answer for an individual value is f(n)/(k \u2013 1). Otherwise, if x = 1, the answer is f(n \u2013 1), because A n \u2013 1 \u2260 1, and the only number we can fill A n with is x = 1. Now, the main problem is how to calculate f(i). Consider all numbers that A i \u2013 1 can be. We know that it must lie in [1, k]. If A i \u2013 1 \u2260 1, then there are (k \u2013 2)f(i \u2013 1) ways to fill in the rest of the array, because A i cannot be 1 or A i \u2013 1 (so we multiply with (k \u2013 2)), and for the range [1, i \u2013 1], there are, recursively, f(i \u2013 1) ways. If A i \u2013 1 = 1, then there are (k \u2013 1)f(i \u2013 2) ways to fill in the rest of the array, because A i \u2013 1 = 1 means A i \u2013 2 \u2260 1 which means there are f(i \u2013 2)ways to fill in the range [1, i \u2013 2] and the only value that A i cannot be 1, so we have (k \u2013 1) choices for A i . \nBy combining the above, we get f(i) = (k - 1) * f(i - 2) + (k - 2) * f(i - 1) \nThis will help us to use dynamic programming using f(i). \nBelow is C++ implementation of this approach: // CPP Program to find count of arrays. #include <bits/stdc++.h> #define MAXN 109 using namespace std; // Return the number of arrays with given constartints. int countarray(int n, int k, int x) { int dp[MAXN] = { 0 }; // Initalising dp[0] and dp[1]. dp[0] = 0; dp[1] = 1; // Computing f(i) for each 2 <= i <= n. for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) dp[i] = (k - 2) * dp[i - 1] + (k - 1) * dp[i - 2]; return (x == 1 ? (k - 1) * dp[n - 2] : dp[n - 1]); } // Driven Program int main() { int n = 4, k = 3, x = 2; cout << countarray(n, k, x) << endl; return 0; } \nOutput: 3 \nThis article is contributed by anuj0503 .

I plan to double check it with the standard 308 go gauge as a no go before I shoot since it is already on the way here.\nI still need to pick up some 260 ammo to test fire it and to start forming some brass....\nEdited by bronco71 ( 12/06/17 10:45 PM )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:14.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a86f555f33d7d2484b6dfefaa1daade86f31c11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwwI2uIUSts.llJU7DBb8kITxhqmDjFA3qY13AYziBOtrxCGecC46VRO6ZM8TfhLYv3i79rjO2g0oyUGXcyqNTnUJAYlZtmXkDy39Bj6s0vzfpydZPjc_ZEKs27t7XuSJ8ZrmeDrpVowQ--", "site_full": "forums.leagueunlimited.com", "site": "leagueunlimited.com", "site_section": "http://forums.leagueunlimited.com/forums/nrl.71/", "site_categories": ["rugby", "sports"], "section_title": "NRL | The Front Row Forums", "title": "Which teams are likely to improve in the NRL in 2018? 4", "title_full": "Which teams are likely to improve in the NRL in 2018? | Page 4 | The Front Row Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T15:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.leagueunlimited.com/data/avatars/m/46/46065.jpg?1471476771", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2771c7b90886634a5ee41c6c5709f5d0dc61fff9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwwI2uIUSts.llJU7DBb8kITxhqmDjFA3qY13AYziBOtrxCGecC46VRO6ZM8TfhLYv3i79rjO2g0oyUGXcyqNTnUJAYlZtmXkDy39Bj6s0vzfpydZPjc_ZEKs27t7XuSJ.fvW5oKBeAsQn2c6SHIISL", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "RazorRam0n", "published": "2017-12-07T16:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Johns Magic said: \u2191 Bullshit all round.\nYou don't even seem to realise that Kasiano has gone there for a start.\nWelch made the emerging Queensland squad?

Lillyman is a better player and a much better metre eater which they will be looking to gain to replace McLean. No doubt Glasby has a place in the 17 but Lillyman would start over him in my honest opinion, although I can cop if you disagree on that. I don't cop that Lillyman wouldn't figure in the Storm 17 if he signed for them.\nGuerra would start over Ken Brom or Hoffman for sure. No other club would touch Hoffman, and Ken has been a bit-part player for years and will continue to be because that's his ceiling.\nIf you think Bellamy wouldn't pick Guerra who until a few months ago was a piece of furniture for Queensland Origin over them then there is no use even having this conversation because you will just rely on the fact that Bellamy is able to manufacture decent players from nothing. That means they don't NEED Guerra, but doesn't mean they wouldn't love to get him. Stimson, LOL. Click to expand...

say they are concerned about attacks on Ukrainian anticorruption institutions.\nIn a December 7 statement , IMF chief Christine Lagarde joined the United States and European Union to warn about threats to Ukraine's efforts to reduce corruption.\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned by recent events in Ukraine that could roll back progress that has been made in setting up independent institutions to tackle high-level corruption,\u201d Lagarde said.\nThe IMF chief said recent actions by prosecutors in Ukraine could threaten the independence of Ukraine's National Anticorruption Bureau (NABU), which was set up after the Euromaidan protests ousted Moscow-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014.\nNABU said on November 30 that the Prosecutor-General\u2019s Office and the Security Service of Ukraine illegally interfered with an undercover NABU operation aimed at identifying members of an organized criminal group in the State Migration Service.\nLagarde urged \"Ukrainian authorities and parliament to safeguard the independence of NABU and SAPO,\" Ukraine\u2019s Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\nIn a separate statement, the World Bank's office in Ukraine said attacks on NABU and on SAPO \"threaten their ability to fight corruption and recover stolen assets.\"\n\"It's critical they have the legislative framework & resources to fulfil their mandate,\" the World Bank statement said.\nUndermining Public Trust \nThe World Bank and the IMF are among the largest financial contributors to a $40 billion bailout package given to Ukraine to bolster and reform its economy after a pro-Western government came to power following Yanukovych's ouster and flight to Russia.\nBut billions of dollars in IMF loans have been delayed due to what is seen as backtracking on reform commitments, even as Kyiv attempts to become more closely integrated with the EU and increase foreign investment.\nThe U.S. State Department said on December 4 that concerns about Ukraine's commitment to fight corruption were raised by actions that \"appear to be part of an effort to undermine independent anticorruption institutions.\" \nWashington said the moves \"undermine public trust and risk eroding international support for Ukraine.\"\nThe EU said in a December 5 statement that \"the fight against corruption is a key element in the development of EU-Ukraine relations, upon which the success of other reforms rests.\" \n\"Ukrainian authorities have to reinforce their efforts to ensure the independence, operational capacity, and full effectiveness of the anticorruption institutions,\" the EU said.\nWith reporting by Reuters\nRelated U.S. Cites 'Concerns' Ukraine May Be Backtracking On Fight Against Corruption Most Popular <h3 class=\"handler\" title=\"open widget

However, the partially complete home Dupree built was described by state regulators as \"poor\" and uninhabitable. \nMadison eventually had the home demolished and bought a mobile home for the property. \nLast month, Fox ruled that Dupree, who failed to respond to one of the plaintiff's motions, could be required to pay any damages assessed against the Jacksonville construction company, which had its license revoked by state regulators during the fallout from Madison's home. \nFox awarded $64,194 in compensatory damages for the money Madison paid Dupree to build the home and $120,000 in punitive damages. \nHowever, Madison's attorney, Jordan Tinsley, said he is concerned his client may never collect the full amount from Dupree, who has twice declared bankruptcy. Still, Tinsley noted that because the damages are tied to a fraud claim, the debt can't be discharged. \n\"So unless he wants this judgment following him the rest of his natural life, he will have to do something,\" Tinsley said. \nFox said the plaintiff may also request payment for attorneys fees. \nMadison testified Wednesday that she had lived in the North Little Rock home for 49 years when a leak and mold were discovered. An insurance company paid her about $60,000 to replace the home, and Dupree, who had done business with Madison's daughter, well underbid other contractors for the job. \nDupree built the hull of the home, albeit poorly according to several expert witnesses, before running out of money and exceeding several deadline extensions. \nHe testified that he was simply waiting on money to come in from his company's other jobs, and he attributed the delay to inclement weather and several design changes Madison requested. Had Madison not barred him from her property, Dupree said, he would've finished building the home up to standards. \nDupree stumbled his way through Wednesday's proceedings, walking through the courtroom with untied shoelaces most of the trial. At several points, Fox had to explain elementary aspects of legal procedure to Dupree, who fired his attorney after a disagreement last year. \nFox spent much of the trial visibly and audibly perturbed with both Dupree and Tinsley's lines of questioning. \nDupree didn't react as the judgments against him were announced, only scribbling frantically on a legal pad. He left without commenting. \nPulaski County Prosecuting Attorney Larry Jegley previously charged Dupree with felony theft in the case, but a jury acquitted him in 2015. \nMadison also sued Dupree's mother, Joy Kinman, and his former Northstar partner, Robert Andrew Walker. They settled with Madison a year ago for $20,000, Tinsley said during Wednesday's proceedings. \nMetro on 12/07/2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim fox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan tinsley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gretchen madison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joy kinman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus andrew dupree", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tinsley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dupree", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry jegley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert andrew walker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "northstar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northstar consultants inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north little rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pulaski county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:15.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1be0f822b3a3c13ea17f58804e6e66bfb22924d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS1sweNw0kyGessK6k.L.PMFunFCo1dEaWhE.lf0KEX6L2oz9g8QLleGJfGS6eG6dGmLslglZxysEsHpR0AKkiBNayxx7saLDrfwXRdAo52oF.hHybdIjeEQ--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "For photos that are, you know, mildly interesting.", "title": "Managed to snap a pic of a pop-it mid-pop", "title_full": "Managed to snap a pic of a pop-it mid-pop : mildlyinteresting", "published": "2017-12-06T21:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 88, "participants_count": 78, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "536b6378a5a08d123bbb34f68f33f14dd87ae8e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS1sweNw0kyGessK6k.L.PMFunFCo1dEaWhE.lf0KEX6L2oz9g8QLleGJfGS6eG6dGmLslglZxysEsHpR0AKkiBNayxx7saLDrfwXRdAo52oF8ZBQUR5QF.KP4HJGSi2h.ROua7Uj0i8g-", "ord_in_thread": 81, "author": "HandsomedanNZ", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I would also like to know.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:15.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d5beb217445680f723bc21b7993d9d410bd2c0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg915p_xRKgQTgWACAA9mHwv7_RD4qYp_duI43a05WV6SHa4QZsCY23vAV0Rf5TbPrLbUNJmIwjT_hPGtHBQe17fCTRU9OzZ_9BNhYZuXpTdnzhk.fQGz2N1", "site_full": "wabe.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net", "site": "publicbroadcasting.net", "site_section": "http://wabe.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Australian Parliament Approves Same-Sex Marriage", "title_full": "Australian Parliament Approves Same-Sex Marriage", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201712/569035628.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71204, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6d5beb217445680f723bc21b7993d9d410bd2c0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg915p_xRKgQTgWACAA9mHwv7_RD4qYp_duI43a05WV6SHa4QZsCY23vAV0Rf5TbPrLbUNJmIwjT_hPGtHBQe17fCTRU9OzZ_9BNhYZuXpTdnzhk.fQGz2N1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Neuman", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "Australian Parliament Approves Same-Sex Marriage", "text": "Australian Parliament Approves Same-Sex Marriage By Scott Neuman \u2022 7 hours ago A group of women in Federation Square in Melbourne react on Thursday as it is announced that same-sex marriage will be legal in Australia. Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 7:50 am \nUpdated at 5:50 a.m. ET \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nMarriage in Australia is now defined as \"the union of two people\" instead of \"union of a man and a woman.\" \nLawmakers had tried and failed some two dozen times in the past to make the change. \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of the 80 percent of registered voters who cast ballots, ensuring that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott neuman", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "scott barbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament approves same-sex marriage australian parliament", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "getty images members of parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the sydney morning herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images  australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federation square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:15.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d72b7299c9ced1bb39c062bc5a9d20f20072bd92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUQAmlQWGERIEyPcXgcibfFR0TnJbiL8zp01DyX4RR.pEzgK4Oe1eGv_9eH0tGS2Jz.6LNY709DeVbW95O4mcbLaFxwq_8DHDS_dfmAaHwmjHdedjO7q22d852rt4o4x2w--", "site_full": "www.expedia.no", "site": "expedia.no", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.no/Bridgeport-Hoteller.d9635.Reise-Guide-Hoteller", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hotell Bridgeport, Carneys Point | Expedia.no", "title": "Renaissance Philadelphia Airport Hotel", "title_full": "Renaissance Philadelphia Airport Hotel (Philadelphia, United States) | Expedia.no", "published": "2017-11-07T22:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6cb5b3e8e6f94b97b34cf8c5b7475179195b5273", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUQAmlQWGERIEyPcXgcibfFR0TnJbiL8zp01DyX4RR.pEzgK4Oe1eGv_9eH0tGS2Jz.6LNY709DeVbW95O4mcbLaFxwq_8DHDS_dfmAaHwmjHdedjO7q22djmjwyLxWvAoEpjqx5XbNmIPOy8f3n1TCqwWDCPT3i9A--", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-06T09:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Stay does not include WiFi.
