December 7, 2017   Keurig Green Mountain\u00ae ; all opinions, images, and content are my own. The days have gotten shorter, the wreaths and lights are going up around the neighborhood, and this week I finally broke down and pulled out our basket of hats and mittens for the cold weather; it feels like winter! In the summer we have tons of friends and family visit us \u2014 living by the beach lures them in! When we have friends and family stay for the weekend this time of year though, I find that we spend a lot more time cozied up inside our house enjoying slow mornings full of brunch and pajamas and lounging on the couch. Given that we spend a bit more time at home during these chilly holiday weekends, I\u2019ve been brainstorming fun ways to make our mornings with houseguests a bit more special.Putting out a help-yourself style coffee bar is one of my favorite ways to make my family feel welcome when they stay over. To dress up my Keurig \u00ae coffee station for the holidays (and maybe even a few cozy snow days) I gave it a winter-inspired update. I started with some seasonally flavored brews like The Original Donut Shop \u00ae Peppermint Bark coffee and Holiday Buzz\u00ae coffee K-Cup\u00ae pods. I love the labels on these, so festive (you could pair them with the new Keurig \u00ae K-Select\u2122 coffee maker for a really nice holiday gift!). Guests can pick their favorite beverage varieties and then select their coffee strength using the Strong button to personalize their own drinks. I also pulled out a set of my vintage red and white coffee cups and saucers; I love getting to use these this time of year!Alongside the coffee station, I made some winter-inspired sweet treats to go along with our drinks. Coffee and donuts go together like peanut butter and jelly, so I picked up a box of store-bought powdered donut holes for the coffee station. I took three donut holes and threaded them on bamboo skewers, and added little snowman faces to the top donut with icing. Black icing for the coal eyes and mouth, and of course a bit of orange icing for the carrot nose! I used the same icing trick on a bag of jumbo marshmallows to serve on a plate with the warm drinks; I love this idea for serving with hot cocoa on a snow day, too. All that\u2019s left to do is to build a fire, brew our coffee, and snack on some sweet and snowy treats when our family arrives!

We aimed to assess the strength of association of death with features currently characterizing severe malaria through a systematic review and meta-analysis.; Electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge) were searched to identify publications including African children with severe malaria. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Selection was based on design (epidemiological, clinical and treatment studies), setting (Africa), participants (children\u2009<\u200915 years old with severe malaria), outcome (survival/death rate), and prognostic indicators (clinical and laboratory features). Quality assessment was performed following the criteria of the 2011 Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each study and prognostic indicator, and, when a test was assessed in at least two studies, pooled estimates of ORs were computed using fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis.; A total of 601 articles were identified and screened and 30 publications were retained. Features with the highest pooled ORs were renal failure (5.96, 95% CI 2.93-12.11), coma score (4.83, 95% CI 3.11-7.5), hypoglycemia (4.59, 95% CI 2.68-7.89), shock (4.31, 95% CI 2.15-8.64), and deep breathing (3.8, 95% CI 3.29-4.39). Only half of the criteria had an OR\u2009>\u20092. Features with the lowest pooled ORs were impaired consciousness (0.58, 95% CI 0.25-1.37), severe anemia (0.76, 95% CI 0.5- 1.13), and prostration (1.12, 95% CI 0.45-2.82).; The findings of this meta-analysis show that the strength of association between the criteria defining severe malaria and death is quite variable for each clinical and/or laboratory feature (OR ranging from 0.58 to 5.96). This ranking allowed the identification of features weakly associated with death, such as impaired consciousness and prostration, which could assist to improve case definition, and thus optimize antimalarial treatment.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2BMP1lz\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prisma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cochrane database of systematic reviews", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "embase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:36.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d0fe0c4d1e90568787c23a520609519e9795902f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbWkkNrkF.6SfvsDAC_ma2EaHbHhBE7aNZXqpIEPcSAsPBnmAQgRZZGa4U4tF.j__Xx4gvwj_5qoYF8f7F5IJK8HtQ9aixQezXQ--", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Philadelphia-Hotell.d178297.Reseguide-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotell Philadelphia - 296 billiga hotell i Philadelphia | Expedia.se", "title": "The Windsor", "title_full": "The Windsor Suites (Philadelphia, Amerikas F\u00f6renta Stater) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-11-14T22:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a3a5680b6c0c0aaac37ef786f6fd2c13fde708ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbWkkNrkF.6SfvsDAC_ma2EaHbHhBE7aNZXqpIEPcSAsPBnmAQgRZZGa4U4tF.j__Xx4gvwj_5qoYF8f7F5IJK8Eu1lCrwqP2UN3WT2Z6cBCTQzJM8TizLh4cZNyzuqQTMvbFE7yRMtBx", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-16T20:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Autumn was very helpful.

Life in The Hollow isn't great. But Lacy has one advantage -- she's been befriended by a semi-organic, semi-robot who works with her to cure her parents. He wants something in exchange, though. It's up to her to save the Universe.\n\nWill Lacy Dawn's predisposition, education, and magic be enough for her to save the Universe, Earth, and, most importantly, protect her own family?\n\nRarity from the Hollow is adult literary science fiction filled with tragedy, comedy and satire. It is a children's story for adults, not for the prudish, faint of heart, or easily offended. \n\n\nRobert Eggleton has served as a children's advocate in an impoverished state for over forty years. He is best known locally for his nonfiction: investigative reports about children\u2019s programs, most of which were published by the West Virginia Supreme Court where he worked from 1982 through 1997; nationally distributed models of serving disadvantaged and homeless children in the community instead of in large institutions; research into foster care drift involving children bouncing from one home to the next -- never finding a permanent loving family; and statistical reports on the occurrence and correlates of child abuse and delinquency in West Virginia. Dozens of his works have been archived by the West Virginia Division of Culture and History. \n\nToday, he is a recently retired children's psychotherapist from a mental health center in Charleston, West Virginia, where he specialized in helping victims cope with and overcome physical and sexual abuse, and other mental health concerns. Two of Eggleton's poems were published in the 1970s and another won first place in 2015 international poetry competition managed by the WSC Science Fiction & Fantasy Club/WillyCon. His debut novel, Rarity from the Hollow, was named one of five best reads in 2015 by a Codices, has been awarded Gold Medals by Awesome Indies and Readers' Favorite, and has been so well received by prominent book critics and reviewers that it is scheduled for republication by Dog Horn Publishing, a traditional small press, in 2016. Three of Eggleton's short stories have appeared in magazines: Wingspan Quarterly, Beyond Centauri, and Atomjack Science Fiction. \n\nAuthor proceeds from Eggleton's Lacy Dawn Adventures project have been donated to a child abuse prevention program operated by Children\u2019s Home Society of West Virginia. http://www.childhswv.org/ Robert continues to write adult literary science fiction with new adventures based on a protagonist that is a composite character of children that he met when delivering group therapy services.

I had to report by 9 AM to handle the blog for the 2017-18 Ranji Trophy quarter-finals. Thanks to Mumbai locals, I was stuck at Kurla Station (ask Mumbaikars on the plight of waiting at Kurla) for 15 to 20 minutes. As a result, I entered office at 9.26 AM. By then, three out of four quarter-finals hadn\u2019t even commenced. However, Karnataka skipper Vinay Kumar made me feel guilty. He was already trending on social media courtesy his heroics (a hat-trick) in the opening half hour of his side\u2019s clash against Mumbai. Thankfully, a few kind souls in the office had taken over my responsibility\u2026 \nCome on Vinay, have some mercy! \nVinay became the seventh Karnataka bowler to attain a hat-trick in Ranji Trophy. In addition, he became the fourth bowler to achieve this feat in Nagpur. Vinay also became the fourth bowler to claim a hat-trick twice in the tournament\u2019s history . Phew, all this in less than an hour! \nThe stage was set for Karnataka to rule the proceedings and they did just that.

I changed my mind (or, rather, discovered that I didn\u2019t have the required ingredients at home) at the last minute and decided to make a single malt/single hop (SMASH) beer, something I\u2019ve never done before.\nI took my stance in one the world\u2019s best known SMASH-beer, although I doubt that people know that it is brewed with only one malt and only one hop variety: the classic Liberty Ale from Anchor Brewing Co which can be considered as the benchmark American IPA. \nGiven \u201cthe last minute\u201d I didn\u2019t have the appropriate yeast (White Labs\u2019 California Ale V or Wyeast\u2019s American Ale II) at hand, so I substituted it with Danstar Nottingham which I believe is closer to the real deal than the cleaner US-05 (only dry yeast these days).\nStyle: 21 A Amerian IPA, , OG 1,059/ FG 1,011 (est.), 48 IBU, 11 EBC, 5,9 % ABV.\n100 % Pale ale malt\nMash with the brewing water of your choice (I\u2019m using my \u201cteaspoon IPA-water: Ca 118, Mg 4, Na 10, So4 260, Cl 12 which means i add a couple of grams of Gypsum to the mash given my local Stockholm water) at 67 degrees C for 60 minutes or full conversion. Drain, sparge and collect 27 liters of wort with a pre-boil gravity of 1,052.\nBoil for 90 minutes and add:\n25 g/22,3 IBUs of Cascade (6,6 % AA) @ 60 minutes before FO\n25 g/20 IBUs of Cascade (6,6 % AA) @ 45 minutes before FO\nProtofloc and yeast nutrient at 15 minutes before FO\nYeast nutrient @ 15 min\nProtofloc @ 15 min\n30 g/3,7 IBUs of Cascade (6,6 % AA) @ FO for a 10 minute WP/hopstandd\nChill to 18 degrees C, transfer to fermente and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 19 degrees for 4 days.\nRaise the temp to 22 degrees and add:\n28 g of Cascade for three days of dryhopping\nAfter seven days, at final gravity, package and carbonate.\nThis recipe is from the December 2014 issue (Vol 20:8) of Brew Your Own Magazine.\nI was surprised by the relatively short time in the fermenter (ony one week) but as a matter of fact, when I tried the beer after one additional week och force carbonation in hte keg, it was ready for drinking! So why can\u2019t I do this with every straight ale that I brew???\nThe Nottingham yeast is not perfect for a Liberty Ale clone. That particular beer requires it\u2019s yeast, and perhaps also open fermentation, but that\u2019s not something I\u2019m getting in to. Yet.\nLesson for the next SMASH (trying another hop): use a really clean yeast (Cal Ale).\n \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "anchor brewing co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ebc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white labs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cascade", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:37.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9313885e1b12f4f95657c981466ebbc698e56994", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nZOCJivZzescL.JpS5yLU1ZQBoeYJpx.Y55CGgdxpqRAHb_3mCRDGzR_IZ9kD2AQTgSYf51Z7qMIWvDr.FyzOWpedykZcok5pTmZHqQY6ZUwvRcOeHphqAw--", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/commentisfree", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Opinion | The Guardian", "title": "David Davis is bluffing on Brexit.

I followed the referendum debate from the exterior but a few things stand out on the topic:\nCameron said \\\"leaving the EU means leaving the Common Market\\\" because he thought this would scare off Leavers. That was at best his opinion.\nMany Leavers, including the most extreme, said this was not so as Britain would still have the Norway or Switzerland options or better. They said so because they thought Leavers would be scared off at the thought of having to leave the Single Market.\nI followed the HYS section in the BBC then and it was apparent many Leavers did not know anything about how the EU worked. They wanted out, full stop.\nDoes that mean they voted to stay out of everything except cakes to be had and eaten, too? The government gave this interpretation.\nWhatever the end result, it's going to cost Britain dearly in economic (and not just economic) terms. In one way or other, the British will be worse off.\nHowever co-operative the EU may choose to be, if it doesn't renounce its basic principles the deal will be worse for Britain than what it has as member.\nBut even if it plied to the Brexiters' all preposterous requests, Britain's (and the rEU countries', in that case) situation would deteriorate as the Union would cease to exist and it has been beneficial.

At the end of this article i might just have annoyed more people but am not so scared, Ill just say it! \nProgrammers please stop it. Please making seem so easy! Stop giving the idea that being a programmer gives you an automatic access to a MacBook-Pro Don\u2019t let we, who are up comers, feel like we are going to be so rich and happy being in this profession. I mean don\u2019t tell us that we can understand all that crazy language just because we want to! \nIt pissed me so bad that so many people don\u2019t have an idea of how hard it is for some people , especially in Africa, to get access to real time Data and subscriptions. I love the fact that so many of the successful programmers are trying their best to put out content to make learning programming easier to learn and access. But the truth is this- Not everyone with the passion of writing computer programs have full access to the internet . I feel programmers should start sharing more of how rough but cool the journey was rather than a picture of them owning the world best set up. This only entices the weak-at-heart and get a future Lawyer wanting to becoming a programmer. \nPlease let us talk about how many nights you lost sleep. How much you spent to buy a course you never needed. The times that you gave up on programming and wanted to go make a show about cats . Let\u2019s tell the world how crazy it is to look at a script you wrote yourself and the next day you just can\u2019t understand a thing. Let talk about how the girlfriend complained. Then maybe, Just maybe, only the true programmers who love the odds of being a programmer would come around this world most craziest profession!

Now the court dates will probably fall in the thick of the election campaign, and clearly will be used to attack my party.\u201d\nKovacs told Reuters that he would quit Jobbik as of December 6 to spare the party political smears, but said he would hold onto his MEP mandate until it expired in 2019.\nIn a separate report, Deutsche Welle (DW), Germany\u2019s international broadcaster, noted that Kovacs and his associates are also suspected of defrauding the EU parliament of \u20ac21,076 and fictitious employment of interns.\nIf convicted, Kovacs could face a prison sentence of between two and eight years.\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn +", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bela kovacs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kovacs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jobbik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viktor orban", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche welle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fidesz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hungary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jobbik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:40.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "29198a90bb487ffe75f34531583aad794ac4c95d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7bZ6fd1kSm2TXR0pyDXbbb5Bkvue5X9N2mMFVOcJ2O85Bq67YyoK4Ccn9baco8hWOkXuFv63OHGlif13lhgG17EV.l5XhMVXEdLhOpooydLX4HgXDg61eLQRzoQrx5xrwB0J1D7z5vCWCG63LTGeNRwMuU5lhSqE-", "site_full": "www.cricketcountry.com", "site": "cricketcountry.com", "site_section": "http://www.cricketcountry.com/feed", "site_categories": ["cricket", "sports"], "section_title": "Cricket Country", "title": "Ranji Trophy 2017-18: Kerala vs Vidarbha quarter-final delayed due to wet outfield", "title_full": "Ranji Trophy 2017-18: Kerala vs Vidarbha quarter-final delayed due to wet outfield", "published": "2017-12-07T09:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://st3.cricketcountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lalbhai-contractor-stadium-surat-14037036104kgn8-520x346.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5651, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 51, "comments": 0, "shares": 51}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "29198a90bb487ffe75f34531583aad794ac4c95d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7bZ6fd1kSm2TXR0pyDXbbb5Bkvue5X9N2mMFVOcJ2O85Bq67YyoK4Ccn9baco8hWOkXuFv63OHGlif13lhgG17EV.l5XhMVXEdLhOpooydLX4HgXDg61eLQRzoQrx5xrwB0J1D7z5vCWCG63LTGeNRwMuU5lhSqE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aditya Sahay | CricketCountry Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T09:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ranji Trophy 2017-18: Kerala vs Vidarbha quarter-final delayed due to wet outfield", "text": "Ranji Trophy 2017-18: Kerala vs Vidarbha quarter-final delayed due to wet outfield Kerala are facing Vidarbha in their maiden Ranji Trophy knockout match. By CricketCountry Staff | Updated : December 7, 2017 1:17 PM IST \nWhile Bengal and Mumbai are on the mat against Gujarat and Karnataka in their respective quarter-final clashes, Madhya Pradesh are 90 for 3 against Delhi at the time of publishing this news. On the other hand, Kerala \u2018s maiden quarter-final match, versus Vidarbha, has been delayed. The match is played at Surat, and rain has proven to be a damper. There have been a few inspections, but no improvement in outfield conditions has led to a considerable delay. \nKerala \nIt took Kerala 40 years to reach their first-ever knockouts ever since the tier system was scrapped. They owe a large part of their success to coach Dav Whatmore, Jalaj Saxena\u2019s all-round efforts and Sanju Samson\u2019s 175 versus Saurashtra. They were in a tough group (B) alongside Gujarat and Saurashtra and made their way eliminating Jharkhand and Haryana. \nVidarbha \nSkipper Faiz Fazal and Wasim Jaffer (yes, he is still around) have ensured regular flow of runs at the top. Ganesh Satish and Sanjay Ramaswamy have often stood up in crisis. Their spin trio \u2014 Akshay Wakhare, Aditya Sarwate and Akshay Karnewar \u2014 have shared 61 wickets between them. \nFazal thanked coach Chandrakant Pandit for their upward spiral ahead of the Kerala encounter: \u201cHe read the pitch right in just about every game. Pitch-reading is not easy and many people get it wrong, but he\u2019s very good and taught me a lot about how to read pitches. He\u2019s a very intelligent coach and is completely involved when it comes to planning.\u201d Editorial team of CricketCountry.
