Special Judge Kiran Bansal put the 11 former lawmakers and an individual on trial, which will commence from January 12. The former lawmakers accused in the case are Y G Mahajan (BJP), Chhatarpal Singh Lodha (BJP), Anna Saheb M K Patil (BJP), Manoj Kumar (RJD), Chandra Pratap Singh (BJP), Ram Sewak Singh (Congress), Narender Kumar Kushwaha (BSP), Pradeep Gandhi (BJP), Suresh Chandel (BJP), Lal Chandra Kol (BSP) and Raja Rampal (BSP). A sting operation against the then lawmakers was conducted by two journalists which was telecast on a private news channel on December 12, 2005. It came to be known as the cash-for-query scam. The prosecution had relied upon CDs/DVDs containing conversations among the accused and others. The court also framed charges against Mr Rampal's then PA, Ravinder Kumar, special public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava said. The proceedings against one of an accused, Vijay Phogat, have been abated as he has passed away. Mr Phogat was alleged to be a middleman.

Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

I think when we get close to that release, it will be like my own film is releasing.\"\nThe first look of the film was released recently and Saif said he is confident \"that she (Sara) will be very good.\"\nHe was speaking at the trailer launch of \"Kaalakaandi\" last evening.\nProduced by Cinestaan Film Company and Ashi Dua Sara of Flying Unicorn, the film stars Saif along with Deepak Dobriyal, Vijay Raaz, Kunaal Roy Kapoor, Sobhita Dhulipala, Akshay Oberoi, Isha Talwar, Shenaz Treasury, Shivam Patil, Amyra Dastur and Neil Bhoopalam.\n\"I wouldn't call 'Kaalakaandi' a niche film, I'd call it unpretentious. It was a lot of fun. They were all good actors and I think my acting has improved after working with some of these guys,\" he said.\nDirected by Akshat Verma, \"Kaalakaandi\" will hit the screens on January 12. The movie will be Saif's first release after this year's \"Chef\".\nThe 47-year-old actor said it is sad that the Raja Krishna Menon film could not perform well at the box office.\n\"I liked his (Raja's) attempt, it was a little European in flavour, and the drama could be a bit more, and I think he generally avoids drama.

The waiver and release specifically includes, without limitation, any and all rights and claims pertaining to the processing of personal data, including but not limited to any rights under any applicable data protection statute(s). If in any jurisdiction, any part of this disclaimer is held to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such part of this disclaimer shall be restricted or eliminated to the minimum extent and the remaining disclaimer shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. \nPlease note the information presented is deemed representative at the time of its original release. Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data.

The trial results were presented today at the International Diabetes Federation Congress 2017 (IDF 2017). 1 \u201cMillions of people with type 2 diabetes participate in Ramadan every year and we know that periods of prolonged fasting can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia,\u201d said lead investigator Dr Mohamed Hassanein of the Dubai Hospital, Dubai Health Authority, UAE and chair of the Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance (DAR). \u201cThis highlights the importance of people with type 2 diabetes preparing for Ramadan with their doctor and discussing treatment options for preventing episodes of hypoglycaemia.\u201d It is estimated that worldwide over 116 million Muslims with diabetes may choose to fast during Ramadan. 2 Muslims with type 2 diabetes who fast during Ramadan have up to a 7.5-fold increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia. 3 \u201cThis trial has shown that Ryzodeg \u00ae is not only a simple treatment option which can make daily life easier for people with diabetes. Ryzodeg \u00ae also reduces the risk of potentially dangerous episodes of hypoglycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes who choose to fast during Ramadan,\u201d said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. The trial was designed to investigate the effects of Ryzodeg \u00ae on blood sugar control and hypoglycaemia reduction versus BIAsp 30, both at the end of Ramadan and 4 weeks post-Ramadan.

Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

Then I got to thinking....might not be such a crazy post after all.\nI am referring to bmoremoney's post 11 in the ...can our mosconj team beat our b team. Sorry my phone cant post a link.\nHis post states that he could put together a group of regional players ....admittedly not quite the level of the mosconi players but are stone cold killers and feel no pressure and always get the money. They have heart and aint scared of nobody and are good enough to win a race to 5 again anyone in the world.\nYea I know... Crazy aint it ? Well his post got me to thinking .. I do a lot of that when I am bored cause there is no league this week lol.\nI got to thinking that what we have done the last several years have not worked so why not try something different ? Many people have claimed on here numerous times about high level players that remain relatively unknown because they prefer to gamble instead of play tournaments.\nSo how do you find these players ? Hold qualifiers. Not the kind of qualifiers we have year after year that is apparently not working.\nHold qualifiers on the same type table under the same format that mosconi cup runs. That means exactly the same conditions that players find themselves under at the cup.\nSame rules...alternating break..neutral racker. One other thing needs to happen also. The environment. If you can't get a bunch of rowdy drunks to emulate those British fans then play tapes of basketball games where the opposing player is attempting a free throw or a football game where the opposing team is attempting a field goal. I dont think those British fans have anything on fans of basketball or football games. Oh yea...play it loud.\nWould something like that work ? I dunno but what we have been doing definrely aint working .\nWell.i am going to also take this opportunity to give my opinion about Shane since most every one on here has given theirs.\nYes he is our best player...without a doubt. However ....he does not play up to our expectations under the mosconi format. Every one says he should be on the team simply because he is our best. That reasoning just does not make sense. Just like all the ....yea he dont play good at mosconi but aint none of them fvcktards gonna call him out in a race to a billion for a gazillion dollars . That will prove he is the best player. Whether that scenario is true or not is irrelevant to the mosconi cup...which is what all this hoopla is about today.\nLets use usain bolt as an example. The fastest man alive reportedly. Lets say they decided to a xxx cup for track. They use a modified format just like mosconi cup. They have teams from different countries and race in a relay and ...lets say the 40 yard dash.\nYear after year usain's country sends him because he is their best at the mile bit we are talking a relay and 40 yard dash. Not exactly usains forte. He keeps losing but the keep sending him because their mentality is like ours. He is their best so he must go. Hope you see the anology here.\nI Los count of how many times I read on here ...shane looks uncomfortable..shane is not playing like the Shane I know. And the sad thing is i read the previous statements year after year on here and yet you guys keep saying he must be in it because he is our best. Yes he is our best....but not in this format.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:23.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7861ecbb9fab4d4d6eb010e753e288eff80d6346", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqtNymsWgmutf0agSWIMgFoPTNoudP.Tx4VeRl9sx2aCsJhM7dOOSeFR4oN5Q18k4-", "site_full": "boardgamegeek.com", "site": "boardgamegeek.com", "site_section": "http://boardgamegeek.com/recentadditions/rss?domain=boardgame", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Recent additions | BoardGameGeek", "title": "GeekList Item: Item for Geeklist \"Google Android Board Games\"", "title_full": "GeekList Item: Item for Geeklist \"Google Android Board Games\"", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/geekfacebook.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2982, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7861ecbb9fab4d4d6eb010e753e288eff80d6346", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqtNymsWgmutf0agSWIMgFoPTNoudP.Tx4VeRl9sx2aCsJhM7dOOSeFR4oN5Q18k4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Getsu", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "GeekList Item: Item for Geeklist \"Google Android Board Games\"", "text": "Time Left for 2017 Support - I supported because\u2026 \"Great community, tons of information, highly addictive!\" - Karen Knoblaugh (Karenv731) Our End-of-Year Geek support drive ends in 25 days !

My wife has been ordering a few things from Amazon so I thought maybe she was logged into my account.Gotta say Secret One that I'm totally elated. I've had my eyes on this and almost backed the reprint Kickstarter. I'm glad I held off. Thank you so much. And thank you also for Scoundrels.

Yes you gain bleed tokens regardless of armor. Pg 71 of the 1.5 rulebook talks about Triggers and uses bleeding as an example. In the example armor is not mentioned at all and so is not relevant. Pg 70 also explains that damage comes from a monster hitting a survivor and reduces armor, then causes light and heavy injuries, and then causes severe injuries. This means that reducing armor still triggers Before/After Damage effects. Also Pg 230 says, \u201cA hit damages a survivor if it removes armor points or causes an injury.\u201d This again further confirms the Before/After damage effects trigger. Also see After Damage on pg 228, as well as Before Damage, Bleed X, and Bleeding Tokens on Pg 229. None of them indicate a survivor\u2019s armor must be depleted to gain bleeding tokens. Pretty sure the FAQ has covered this as well but I don\u2019t have time to look it up right now.

For condition please use the BGG guidelines. - Sweeteners must be added using the GAMEID formatting (e.g. [ G A M E I D = XXXX ] minus the spaces). To find the Game ID simply search for the game and at the right hand side of the games page is listed the GameID \u2013 e.g. Coloretto is 5782. If you don\u2019t use this format your sweeteners will not show up in the OLWLG.- Do not include links to any game\u2019s BGG page in your entry unless you are actually adding them as a sweetener. If you include a link to a game in your description, you are assumed to have entered that game in the trade.- Non game-related items, including money offers, are welcome, but must be added using an appropriate +altname+ Description -altname- tag. Please list these items as Outside the Scope of BGG (Game ID 23953).- Deletions and edits of items are allowed during the submission window. If you are editing an item in a way that would reduce its value to the receiver, please delete the original and add a new item instead.SHIPPING- It is assumed that the sender will cover the cost of shipping using a method of their choice (MyHermes, Collect+, Royal Mail etc) unless explicitly stated otherwise. If as a receiver you have a preference for a particular method of posting, it is up to you to check this is ok with the sender before adding such an item to your WantsList. You are expected to pay any extra costs this would incur to the sender.- Cash offers are welcome, but should be in pounds sterling. - In the case of Paypal payments etc, the sender should cover any fees.- If a participant without a UK postal address wishes to enter the trade, they must check with the senders of any items that they are willing to post outside the UK before adding items to their wants lists. In this case the recipient is expected to cover any postage costs.- Items should be packed for shipping so that they will arrive in the condition they are advertised.WANT LISTS AND AFTER SUBMISSION- Use of OLWLG (Online Want List Generator) is mandatory for submitting wants lists. - The deadline for submission of wantlists listed above will be enforced.- Please ensure that you use duplicate protection in the OLWLG \u2013 trade results will NOT be re-run for your lack of using duplicate protection.- Money and geekgold arbitrage are strictly prohibited (you are not allowed to try to trade your \u00a320 for someone else\u2019s \u00a330). Doing this will cause you to be banned from the next UK MathTrade.- The software used to run the MathTrade is TradeMaximiser v 1.3 with duplicate protection.- Any incident causing the MathTrade to be re-run may result in the person causing the re-run to be banned from the following UK MathTrade. - After the trade please ship your parcels in a timely manner, and if you are unable to do so for any reason, keep in regular correspondence with your game receivers.- Traders accepting cash value trades must pay the BGG commission fees for a sale, so this must go through the BGG marketplace. The easiest way to do this is for the person receiving the payment to create a Geek Market listing (Miscellaneous Game Accessory is a good default) and have someone (like the person sending the cash) buy it. - The word of the trade moderator is final.GEEKGOLDOne quarter of all geekgold contributed to this list (and the wantlist) will be given to JeffyJeff for developing the OLWLG that makes running MathTrades so much easier. One half of all geekgold contributions will be given to one person, chosen at random, from all those who contribute at least 1 geekgold to this list, or the want list. The final quarter will be kept by me!

(This might not be kosher per the rules: \"Once per visit, a party may complete a city event.\")- Should you make a rule within your play group that City Events can only be done AFTER a scenario, or only BEFORE one? You can play this however you want even when you want to go according to the rules, but then you can only do one city event inbetween scenarios in campaign mode. Otherwise, the frequency of drawing city events would be twice as much as is intended and you would risk running low on cards and after a while see the same events again and again (those generic ones that are put under your pile after playing).Our group always does one city event before each scenario. That the outcome is only applied to those characters participating at this very moment (those that are about to go to the next mission) is quite obvious in my eyes. Thematically it would not make sense otherwise as city events are no different to road events. Why should any inactive character get anything while the other characters are shopping in the city or even walking towards the next quest?

I get that you don't enjoy seeing if you could have won... but are you really unable to understand why other people might enjoy it? If they freely acknowledge \"Yup, we lost... \" and are just curious if they could have made it if they hadn't gotten unlucky? Why does the game have to be about winning and losing anyway? If the players enjoy playing \"What if?\" games and have fun doing it, what's the harm? Or heck, even if they straight out just want to cheat so that they can \"win\" isn't it more important for them to enjoy the experience than follow the rules? This is a weird example of cheating. The basic idea behind cheating is one player (with maybe a partner) connives to secretly break the rules to make sure they (with maybe their partner) win and the other players lose. In the coop cheating example, ALL the players are conniving with each other to openly break the rules to make sure they will win and nobody loses (except the game system, and I don't think it can feel bad, probably). So it's not cheating in the classical sense, where you have to hurt another player's chances of winning, but it still feels wrong to me. Dirty. Kinda like swingers' clubs.

Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

If you clink on the link provided by the tag, it indicates that the game should be fully cooperative, i.e. won or lost by all players together.I'm mostly just disappointed that it's not, because from all the indications, it looks like a fun and well made game. My group just won't play anything but cooperative games, unfortunately. Well, I haven't played yet so I could be wrong, but it might be fairly simple to house rule it in a way to make it fully co-op. I imagine if it's possible there will be some fan-made variants within a relatively short amount of time. Just keep following the game and see what happens. For a co-op variant, you could do it in a way that automates one of the factions, while you guys all hop on board of the opposite faction and try to ride them to victory.Or better yet, this could be a great idea for an expansion -- turn this whole game into a true co-op by allowing the players to all take the side of the same faction.(For example) WHEN THIS HAPPENS :If the players take the side of the Railroad, these new rules are now in play, and these new enemy tokens are now added to each stack of active enemies.If you take the side of the Institute, instead these new rules are now in play, and these enemies are added to the enemy stacks.Either way, now you players must unite and follow your current quest-line to completion... before your enemies complete theirs! Or something along those lines. I could see this being a pretty meaty expansion though -- or I guess a pretty beasty variant.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dancingfool", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:24.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1cacae8a0d8d67da599fde3ba0adb4e51c318e62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqtNymsWgmutf0agSWIMgFqVchOK8YsdydVqekpRC7cL_HL3_1mmt60kwRS8UmkheQdgRXwUC3eRVcNVdUVhvY", "site_full": "boardgamegeek.com", "site": "boardgamegeek.com", "site_section": "http://boardgamegeek.com/recentadditions/rss?domain=boardgame", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Recent additions | BoardGameGeek", "title": "New Image for Carcassonne: Winter Edition", "title_full": "New Image for Carcassonne: Winter Edition", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l-j-ynT68CyTNidKVq7Ay-ZqW8g=/fit-in/1200x630/pic3871821.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2982, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1cacae8a0d8d67da599fde3ba0adb4e51c318e62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqtNymsWgmutf0agSWIMgFqVchOK8YsdydVqekpRC7cL_HL3_1mmt60kwRS8UmkheQdgRXwUC3eRVcNVdUVhvY", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mmmbraaains", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "New Image for Carcassonne: Winter Edition", "text": "&dash; Time Left for 2017 Support - I supported because\u2026 \"At this point, I don't think I can function without BGG.

There is a small (!) chance that tuckboxes for characters are missing (others are doubled then) or f.e. one of the wheels of the healthtrackers is missing. Both happened to me and i contacted support (=Isaac then) a month ago. Replacements will be sent out after fulfilling, so i will have to wait another month or longer, as 2 months was the estimation then. As no starting character is affected and we mostly play with 3 players it is no big deal. So at least check the boxes for the symbols and for doubles if you want to make sure.

For condition please use the BGG guidelines. - Sweeteners must be added using the GAMEID formatting (e.g. [ G A M E I D = XXXX ] minus the spaces). To find the Game ID simply search for the game and at the right hand side of the games page is listed the GameID \u2013 e.g. Coloretto is 5782. If you don\u2019t use this format your sweeteners will not show up in the OLWLG.- Do not include links to any game\u2019s BGG page in your entry unless you are actually adding them as a sweetener. If you include a link to a game in your description, you are assumed to have entered that game in the trade.- Non game-related items, including money offers, are welcome, but must be added using an appropriate +altname+ Description -altname- tag. Please list these items as Outside the Scope of BGG (Game ID 23953).- Deletions and edits of items are allowed during the submission window. If you are editing an item in a way that would reduce its value to the receiver, please delete the original and add a new item instead.SHIPPING- It is assumed that the sender will cover the cost of shipping using a method of their choice (MyHermes, Collect+, Royal Mail etc) unless explicitly stated otherwise. If as a receiver you have a preference for a particular method of posting, it is up to you to check this is ok with the sender before adding such an item to your WantsList. You are expected to pay any extra costs this would incur to the sender.- Cash offers are welcome, but should be in pounds sterling. - In the case of Paypal payments etc, the sender should cover any fees.- If a participant without a UK postal address wishes to enter the trade, they must check with the senders of any items that they are willing to post outside the UK before adding items to their wants lists. In this case the recipient is expected to cover any postage costs.- Items should be packed for shipping so that they will arrive in the condition they are advertised.WANT LISTS AND AFTER SUBMISSION- Use of OLWLG (Online Want List Generator) is mandatory for submitting wants lists. - The deadline for submission of wantlists listed above will be enforced.- Please ensure that you use duplicate protection in the OLWLG \u2013 trade results will NOT be re-run for your lack of using duplicate protection.- Money and geekgold arbitrage are strictly prohibited (you are not allowed to try to trade your \u00a320 for someone else\u2019s \u00a330). Doing this will cause you to be banned from the next UK MathTrade.- The software used to run the MathTrade is TradeMaximiser v 1.3 with duplicate protection.- Any incident causing the MathTrade to be re-run may result in the person causing the re-run to be banned from the following UK MathTrade. - After the trade please ship your parcels in a timely manner, and if you are unable to do so for any reason, keep in regular correspondence with your game receivers.- Traders accepting cash value trades must pay the BGG commission fees for a sale, so this must go through the BGG marketplace. The easiest way to do this is for the person receiving the payment to create a Geek Market listing (Miscellaneous Game Accessory is a good default) and have someone (like the person sending the cash) buy it. - The word of the trade moderator is final.GEEKGOLDOne quarter of all geekgold contributed to this list (and the wantlist) will be given to JeffyJeff for developing the OLWLG that makes running MathTrades so much easier. One half of all geekgold contributions will be given to one person, chosen at random, from all those who contribute at least 1 geekgold to this list, or the want list.The final quarter will be kept by me!

It has been a lot of fun to vote and discover the list together. So we're back again. We apologize right up front for any damage to your wallets because of this list. (I was told it was mandatory to make this warning bigger).People submitted up to 20 games ranked from 1-20. #1 gets 20 points, #2=19 ... The only restriction we made was that the game had to be a physical game you enjoyed playing solo. It could be a true solo game, a co-op game, a multi-player game where you played multiple sides, print and play, official and unofficial variants ... You get the idea. Anything except strictly electronic variants like ios solo implementations that allow you to play the game in a way the physical game wouldn't honestly get played solo. (e.g. if they provide an AI).We had 85 people participate the first year and this year it has swelled to 477!, producing a list of 813 unique games. There were a total of 8030 votes up from 6028 last year(not everyone had 20 games). We treated most standalone games as a single entry. The only exception to this is that I put all entries for a game under the latest version. So for example, all votes for Runebound (2nd or 3rd Ed.) were just called Runebound regardless of the version.The bottom line to all of this is that we wanted to do it simply for the fun of it. So if you want to claim that the list is invalid for whatever reason, you're wrong! We're having fun. Please check back or subscribe while I update this over the next couple of weeks to count down from 100 down to 1. I'll also add some extras at the end, so expect a bit more after we get to #1.I highly encourage people to add comments to the games as they're revealed. I'm sure we'd all like to know what makes it one of your top games. It also serves as a great resource for people looking to get into solo play. Many of us refer people to the list all year.There were ties along the way. The tie breakers this year went to Lowest Average Vote, # of votes, Highest Rank, Most #1 Votes then I just broke the tie and noted it.One last point. I'd strongly encourage everyone interested in solo gaming to visit and join the 1-Player Guild . It's a fantastic group of friendly people, easily one of the most positive group of people I've ever had the pleasure of associating with on the internet.I'll release the entire list in a spreadsheet at the end. And if I made mistakes along the way, go back to the initial goal of all of this (to have fun) and forgive me. I type in every entry and it fills in the names. Sometimes I missed that it selected the wrong game. I apologize up front if I made a mistake. As I've mentioned many times already. This is just for fun!!Morten Monrad Pedersen does a fun, trash talking contest to go along with the reveal, feel free to join in. The People\u2019s Choice Top 100 Solo Games Meta-Contest Note: I always get asked. The s represent the number of #1 votes.Note2: I enter every game. Inevitably there could be typing errors. I caught one this morning which made a difference in a game's ranking, but I can't double check 8030 entries. I do make sure that what I typed actually matches a game. Last year Mage Knight was supposed to be dethroned, so is this the year The King falls? Let's find out!

Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

[POLL]", "text": "Good times. 15-45%; Prefer both equally.I always expected that I'd end up being a much more solo-focused gamer than I am, in large part due to an amazing circle of gaming friends that are way more receptive to the games than I would have imagined. For example:- Mage Knight Board Game : The Cadillac of solo play, and a game generally not recommended for multiplayer play - in part due to the nature of the turns and in part (per various GeekLists) because people are intimidated by teaching it. This is probably my favorite solo game, but I actually end up playing 2-player co-op with my wife much more often. Every time I set it up to play solo, she gets excited and ends up grabbing a character and joins in. And you know what? That's awesome. - Deep Space D-6 : This is literally a one-player game, and yet I somehow manage to log most of my plays as a co-op, again with my wife. She loves to sit over tea and discuss the best way to allocate our resources, and we usually alternate rolling the dice and have fun reverse-engineering \"personas\" based on the results. So one of my very few dedicated solitaire games ended up being a great lite-roleplay/co-op game Space Hulk: Death Angel \u2013 The Card Game : Another beloved solo favorite, and one I explicitly acquired to play solo. On three separate occasions, it was discovered in my collection by friends browsing for something to play, triggered a huge rush of \"OMG I used to be addicted to WH40K and we need to play this!\" sentiment, followed by said playing of it. One of them actually still insists on it as his preferred co-op choice, and on the rare occasions it is just the two of us, we'll do marathon plays of it.- Tiny Epic : I have the whole line, joining during the Tiny Epic Galaxies campaign once the solo rules stretch goal was hit. Since then, every game in the family has been designed or amended to include solo play, and most of the experiences are good. But it turned out that a very portable box with a rich devotion to theme made at least one of these games a mainstay in our travel kit, and most of these only really come out for 2-4 player sessions away from home. Hilariously (to me), I still haven't even found a chance to play a solo game of Tiny Epic Galaxies - which was the reason I started supporting the line in the first place!In total, my roughly 70-(ignoring expansions)-game collection contains 22 games that have official solo-play rules. Of these, at least half of them were acquired specifically because they could be played solo and I expected that would be a necessary outlet for them. And I DO play a fair amount of solo games. But due to an awesome group, many of my solo play outlets have evolved into great multiplayer vehicles.

They are developing own IoT platform, and devices which all have real-time connection to platform. Currently they sold over 5k devices. The number of devices is growing rapidly and all devices are producing a large amount of data. IoT platform has microservice architecture and has all basic building blocks: users, devices, ACL, alarms, events, reports, data storage and analysis. All services are written in NodeJS, we run our workloads in docker containers and orchestration is done with Kubernetes. Few of our services are already running in cloud functions and in future we are developing solutions more and more serverless. Backend data is stored in Firebase, MongoDB and google cloud storage. We develop our platform only when some product program needs new features. We are not in platform business, it\u2019s just enabler for us. This means that we are happy to throw away some existing code, if we find some new service which fits better to our needs. Job Description: \nCurrently our platform team is evaluating if Google\u2019s new Firestore could tackle some problems which we have with Firebase.

Hypoglycaemia can cause a range of symptoms including confusion, trembling, sweating, increased heart rate, difficulty with concentration and/or speech and in severe cases can lead to a seizure or coma. 4-6 Severe hypoglycaemia can cause extensive damage to the body and is significantly associated with cardiovascular death. 7 Every month, 46.5% of people with type 2 diabetes and 83.0% of people with type 1 diabetes experience a hypoglycaemic episode. 8 About the new analyses The analyses, based on the recent SWITCH trials, separated people into two groups depending on whether they had achieved target blood sugar levels (defined as HbA 1c of 7.0% or less) during the maintenance period of the trial. 1 Target blood sugar levels are those recommended by the joint guidelines of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. 9 About SWITCH 1 and 2 SWITCH 1 and SWITCH 2 were two phase 3b, 64-week, double-blind, randomised, treat-to-target, 2-period crossover trials that investigated the hypoglycaemia profile of Tresiba \u00ae compared with insulin glargine U100 in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The trial design included a titration period in which the doses of study treatments (Tresiba \u00ae or insulin degludec U100) were gradually increased over a 16 week period, followed by a 16 week maintenance period during which a constant dose of study treatment was maintained. 2 , 3 The primary endpoint was the number of severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes observed in participants during the maintenance period. 2 , 3 About Tresiba \u00ae Categories Uncategorized", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abu dhabi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mads krogsgaard thomsen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novo nordisk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american diabetes association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european association for the study of diabetes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international diabetes federation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tresiba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu dhabi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:24.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3a8d70b4927e3e26be463687bfe2950433eeea1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqtNymsWgmutf0agSWIMgFqVchOK8YsdwgMx8idA7pSdoW5euTLH9Bhr1kkkBCtZ0-", "site_full": "boardgamegeek.com", "site": "boardgamegeek.com", "site_section": "http://boardgamegeek.com/recentadditions/rss?domain=boardgame", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Recent additions | BoardGameGeek", "title": "New Image for Love Letter", "title_full": "New Image for Love Letter", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tYZ__0smCZpl9WdDrN7LowyJImI=/fit-in/1200x630/pic3871848.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2982, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3a8d70b4927e3e26be463687bfe2950433eeea1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqtNymsWgmutf0agSWIMgFqVchOK8YsdwgMx8idA7pSdoW5euTLH9Bhr1kkkBCtZ0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Astromags", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "New Image for Love Letter", "text": "Time Left for 2017 Support - I supported because\u2026 \"Cool\" - Navanan Yeamsiri (Rhoho) Our End-of-Year Geek support drive ends in 25 days !

Recommend First of all: Happy Holidays everyone! What you've all been waiting for: Dicember is back! The goal Play 12 (or more) different dice games during this month of December. To Participate * Create a new item in this GeekList (it can link to your own personal GeekList for the challenge, or just use the entry here to keep track).* Post a short entry about the challenge and anything else you would like to add.* Keep your list updated as you play dice games and come close to (or complete!) the challenge.* Have fun! What counts as a dice game? A good rule of thumb is any game that uses dice as a primary game component. Use your own judgement. Why 12 games? With the holiday season, asking for a game each day is unrealistic for many people. Last year the number got raised to 15, but since we're only starting this GeekList today, I lowered to 12 again. Rules/Clarifications 1. Only plays from December 1st - December 31st of this year count.1. Games do not have to be from your own collection.2. Solo plays are allowed.3. Digital/iOS versions (as long as they are the same as a physical game) count as well.4. Plays cannot overlap with plays in other challenges, but the games can (that is, you can play the same game you already counted in another challenge, but you will have to play it again). Microbadges If you want to participate, start an item on this GeekList and list your games - a microbadge is available for purchase: Those who complete the challenge might, in addition, get a special microbadge for this year's challenge. (Still looking for an admin who can help me with handing out these badges.)Lastly, whoever plays the most games for this challenge gets any tips to this GeekList.

And Opener, despite getting a head start in Gates and generally being a pretty strong faction, does not always win.When there was the great debate about Cthulhu being weak - and then still being weak after the first errata - that ran counter to my experiences, where Cthulhu won as often as anyone else.I think in general, people draw conclusions from too small a sample size. Two or three games is not enough to conclude a faction is \"broken\" or OP or weak. Probably half a dozen games isn't enough to conclude that. That's why even though my group has not had good experiences with Tcho-Tcho and I think they're probably going to wind up mostly sitting on the shelf, I still reserve final judgment until I've seen some other groups playing with them.I think what does vary a lot is the ease with which new players can pick up a faction. I think Cthulhu is difficult for new players to win with, and I think it is mostly weak players who don't know how to do aggression right who continued to lose with Cthulhu and demand he be buffed some more.IMO, Black Goat is the hardest of the core factions for new players to win with. I've never seen someone win with Black Goat in their first game (and more often, they come in last place), whereas I've seen newbies win with all three of the other core factions.But there isn't a single faction I think is too weak to win with, or so strong that I fear playing against them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "petersen games", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tcho-tcho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cthulhu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "maryland boardgame aesthete", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "black goat", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:24.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f043ae94e9364b1ddec8083a3c24675641a8642e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqtNymsWgmutf0agSWIMgFG9GYZKPR4TjdTVGuJnBhoXctfyE6BupNBj6CqC3dtoLez5hBR8v6b6oVaTMBqcYt", "site_full": "boardgamegeek.com", "site": "boardgamegeek.com", "site_section": "http://boardgamegeek.com/recentadditions/rss?domain=boardgame", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Recent additions | BoardGameGeek", "title": "Thread: Gaia Project:: General:: Game length estimates accurate?", "title_full": "Thread: Gaia Project:: General:: Game length estimates accurate?", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kv8MZglfPMb-OXZqYlYb2DuJxyQ=/fit-in/1200x630/pic3763556.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2982, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f043ae94e9364b1ddec8083a3c24675641a8642e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqtNymsWgmutf0agSWIMgFG9GYZKPR4TjdTVGuJnBhoXctfyE6BupNBj6CqC3dtoLez5hBR8v6b6oVaTMBqcYt", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Race Bannon", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "Thread: Gaia Project:: General:: Game length estimates accurate?", "text": "( Race Bannon ) I'm waiting to get a copy and I'm wondering if you guys can dial in the game length projections, for those of you that have played many times and gotten past the teaching games.
