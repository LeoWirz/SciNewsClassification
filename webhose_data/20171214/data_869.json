Napoli lost 2-1 at Feyenoord and failed to qualify.\nLiverpool was one of four English teams to top a group, along with Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. Chelsea completed the sweep, signalling a revival by English clubs after years of underachievement since the west London club was European champion in 2012.\nHere is a look at what happened on Wednesday:\nGroup E Needing only a draw to qualify, it was all too easy for Liverpool at Anfield, where Coutinho led Liverpool's dismantling of Spartak with two goals in the opening 15 minutes before completing his first hat trick for the Reds in the 50th.\nRoberto Firmino, Sadio Mane (2) and Mohamed Salah scored the other goals as Liverpool won 7-0 for the second time in Group E and topped it by three points from second-place Sevilla. Spartak finished in third place and dropped into the Europa League.\nLiverpool finished the group stage with 23 goals, just two goals shy of Paris Saint-Germain's record of 25 this season.\n\"Nobody could imagine that it would go like this tonight. It was an all or nothing game for both teams,\" said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. \"We opened the game perfectly and after we took the lead we didn't have to defend. It was a nice night at Anfield.\"\nSevilla qualified for the knockout phase with a 1-1 draw at Maribor. In freezing temperatures, the Spanish side started poorly but recovered after the interval and equalized through Ganso to clinch the runner-up spot.\nGroup F Shakhtar Donetsk advanced to the knockout stage with a 2-1 victory over Manchester City, ending the English club's unbeaten record in all competitions this season.\nAlready guaranteed first place, City was caught on the break and failed to become only the seventh club in Champions League history to win every game in the group stage.\n\"The game didn't go as we expected, in the first half they were better than us and it was a deserved win for them,\" City midfielder Bernardo Silva said. \"In the second half we tried to come back, had our chances, but we are not happy. Even though we had already qualified, we wanted the three points.\"\nShakhtar, which finished runner-up, took the lead in the 26th minute when Bernard cut in from the left side of the box and curled a shot inside the far post, beyond the reach of goalkeeper Ederson.\nEight minutes later, Ismaily sprinted to beat Ederson to the ball before rounding the keeper and stroking a shot into the unguarded net. City's consolation goal came in added time when Sergio Aguero converted a penalty.\nIt was City's first competitive loss since being beaten by Arsenal in an FA Cup semifinal in April.\nIn the group's other game, Feyenoord rallied from a goal down to beat Napoli, which failed to join Serie A rivals Juventus and Roma in the knockout stage. Napoli ended third and headed to the Europa League.\nGroup G Vincent Aboubakar scored twice to ensure Porto reached the knockout stage with a resounding 5-2 win against a poor Monaco side.\nBoth teams finished with 10 men after having a player sent off late in the first half.\nTurkish side Besitkas, which won 2-1 away to Leipzig, finished top of Group G with 14 points. Porto has 10 and Leipzig will play in the Europa League.\nMonaco reached the semifinals of the competition last season by playing some scintillating attacking football. But it has been a very different story this season for the French champion and coach Leonardo Jardim's side was already guaranteed to finish last.\n\"It's sad not to be continuing in the Champions League but that's football. Now we have to focus on the league and the two domestic cups,\" Monaco's top scorer Radamel Falcao said. \"Our team changed a lot in the summer and we need time to get stronger.\"\nGroup H Cristiano Ronaldo became the first player to score in all six group-stage matches of the Champions League as Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2.\nMadrid had already guaranteed second place behind Group H winner Tottenham, which defeated APOEL 3-0 at Wembley Stadium to reach 16 points and finish with more points than any other team in the group stage.\nMadrid ended with 13 points, and Dortmund and Cypriot club APOEL finished with two points each. The German club took third place because of a better goal difference and will now play in the Europa League.\nMadrid led 2-0 after Borja Mayoral opened the scoring and Ronaldo, the all-time leading scorer in the Champions League with 115 goals, netted his ninth in the competition this season.

Until the required minimum distributions (RMDs) rules apply, distributions are usually optional. The tax and penalty treatment of distributions is determined by the SIMPLE IRA owner's age at the time of distribution. Two-Year Rule \nDuring the first two years after an employee's SIMPLE IRA is established, assets held in the SIMPLE IRA must not be transferred or rolled over to another retirement plan. This two-year period begins the first day the employer deposits a contribution to the SIMPLE IRA. After the two-year period, assets in a SIMPLE IRA may be moved to another eligible retirement plan by means of a transfer, rollover or as a Roth conversion . \nThe two-year waiting period does not apply to transfers or rollovers between two SIMPLE IRAs. \nDistributions that occur during the two-year period are subject to an early-distribution penalty of 25% if the SIMPLE IRA owner is under age 59\u00bd when the distribution occurs. If an exception applies, however, the 25% penalty is waived. Distributions that occur when the SIMPLE IRA holder is age 59\u00bd or older are not subject to the early-distribution penalty, even if the distribution occurs within the two-year period. Distributions That Occur Before Age 59\u00bd \nDistributions that occur before the individual reaches the age of 59\u00bd are subject to a 10% early-distribution penalty. For SIMPLE IRAs, this 10% penalty is increased to 25% if the individual receives a distribution within two years of the first contribution made to his or her SIMPLE IRA account. The 10% penalty is in addition to any income tax owed on the amount. There are certain instances where the IRS will waive the regular early-distribution penalty and the 25% penalty for distributions that occur during the two-year period. The IRS waives the penalty when distributions are used for reasons that include the following: \nFor Unreimbursed Medical Expenses If the distribution is used to pay unreimbursed medical expenses, the amount that exceeds 10% of the individual's adjusted gross income (AGI) for the year of the distribution will not be subject to the early-distribution penalty. In other words, the amount paid for the unreimbursed medical expenses minus 10% of the individual's adjusted gross income for the year of the distribution can be distributed penalty free. \nTo Pay Medical Insurance Individuals can make a penalty-free distribution to pay medical insurance for themselves, their spouses and dependents, provided the distribution occurs under the following four conditions: The individual has lost his or her job. The individual has received unemployment compensation paid under any federal or state law for 12 consecutive weeks. The individual receives the distributions during either the year he or she receives the unemployment compensation or the following year. The individual receives the distributions no later than 60 days after he or she has been re-employed. \nWhile Disabled If an individual becomes disabled before age 59\u00bd and makes a distribution from his or her SIMPLE IRA while disabled, the distributions are not subject to the early-distribution penalty. Individuals are considered disabled if they furnish proof that a physical or mental condition inhibits them from engaging in substantial gainful activities. A physician must determine that this condition can be expected to result in death or to continue for an indefinite duration. \nAs Distributions to the IRA Beneficiary Amounts distributed from the IRA by the designated beneficiary, after the IRA owner's death, are not subject to penalty. \nAs Part of a SEPP Program For penalty-free distributions that are part of a series of substantially equal payments over the life of the IRA holder and or his or her beneficiary, the payments must last five years or until the IRA owner reaches age 59\u00bd \u2013 whichever is longer \u2013 and the payments must also follow certain IRS-approved methods. \nFor Qualified Higher Education Expenses Amounts are penalty free if they must go toward qualified higher-education expenses of the IRA owner and/or his or her dependents. These qualified education expenses include tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment required for the enrollment or attendance of a student at an eligible educational institution. An eligible educational institution is any college, university, vocational school or other post-secondary educational institution eligible to participate in the student aid programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education. These eligible educational institutions include virtually all accredited post-secondary institutions, whether public, nonprofit or proprietary (privately owned and profit making). The educational institution should be able to indicate whether it is an eligible educational institution. Or click here , to see if it's on the U.S. Department of Education list. \nTo Purchase a First Home The IRA owner can make penalty-free distributions to purchase, build or rebuild a first home for: the IRA owner a child of the IRA owner or of the IRA owner's spouse a grandchild of the IRA owner or of the IRA owner's spouse a parent or other ancestor of the IRA owner or of the IRA owner's spouse \nThe first-time homebuyer distribution must be used to pay qualified acquisition costs before the end of the 120th day after the IRA owner receives the distributed assets. \nThe total distribution the IRA owner uses for first-time home purchases cannot exceed $10,000 during the IRA owner's lifetime. For married individuals, the $10,000 applies separately to each spouse, which means that the total for both is $20,000. \nFor Payment of an IRS Levy The IRS may levy against an IRA, resulting in a distribution. The distributed amount is subject to income tax, but the early-distribution penalty is waived. \nAdditional Information The early-distribution penalty does not apply to amounts that are not subject to income tax. These include amounts distributions that occur after the two-year period and are later deposited to an eligible retirement plan as a rollover contribution within 60 days of receipt. Distributions That Occur on or After Age 59\u00bd \nDistributions that occur on or after the SIMPLE IRA owner reaches age 59\u00bd may be subject to income tax, but will not be subject to any early-distribution penalty. These distributions are also subject to the two-year rule and cannot be rolled over to an eligible plan during the first two years after the SIMPLE IRA is established. Required Minimum Distributions \nTraditional IRA distributions cannot be deferred indefinitely. An IRA owner must begin RMDs for the year he or she reaches age 70\u00bd, at which time the IRA owner may distribute the full balance of the IRA or distribute a minimum amount each year. (For background reading, check out 6 Important Retirement Plan RMD Rules .) \nThe first RMD must be distributed by April 1 of the year after the IRA owner reaches age 70\u00bd. For example, an IRA owner who reaches age 70\u00bd in June of 2018 must take his or her first RMD by April 1, 2019. RMDs for subsequent years must be distributed by December 31 of the year for which they are due. This means that if the IRA holder defers the first RMD until April 1 of the next year after he or she turns 70\u00bd, the IRA holder will be required to take a second RMD amount in this next year, which counts as the second year of the RMD. Example: RMD Distribution Rules \nJill turns 70\u00bd in June of 2017, and she decides to defer her first RMD until April 1, 2018. Jill is required to take a second RMD (for 2018) by Dec. 31, 2018. For subsequent years, Jill must withdraw her RMD distributions by Dec. 31 of each year. \nGenerally, the IRA custodian/trustee will calculate the RMD amount and send the notification to the IRA holder. Alternatively, the IRS custodian/trustee may send an RMD reminder to the IRA holder with an offer to calculate the RMD amount upon request. \nRMD amounts not distributed from the IRA by the due date are subject to a 50% excess-accumulation penalty . Example: IRA Excess Accumulation Penalty \nJohn is 75 years old and his RMD for 2018 is $5,000. By Dec. 31, 2018, John has only distributed $4,000 from his IRA. Because John's RMD was short by $1,000, he must pay the IRS a 50% excess-accumulation penalty ($1,000 x 50% = $500). \nThe excess-accumulation penalty must be paid when the individual files his or her federal tax return. If the individual feels that the failure was due to reasonable circumstances, he or she may write to the IRS and request that the penalty be waived. In such cases, the penalty should not be paid unless the IRS denies the request for the waiver.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "agi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irs levy the irs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of education", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:30.046+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0c265ee5299de67184d8ed94f110f926958566bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.jKREfozTM_hRB8gBzdL8gKWA.P92Y1N4K5_FMBpPD9_52Nnr5Y3F33mH.MTo4gJQe8oMFo7idgdS4LEQZvYEsdgfVJpsNfTo-", "site_full": "www.aruwaab9ja.com", "site": "aruwaab9ja.com", "site_section": "http://www.aruwaab9ja.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Aruwa_Ab 9ja", "title": "Dear Admin: My Sister Has Done Her Worst\u2026 Am I Wrong to Disown Her?", "title_full": "Dear Admin: My Sister Has Done Her Worst\u2026 Am I Wrong to Disown Her?", "published": "2017-12-07T12:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/mAuYv7ypQjGF4iR5TsnzhPICZrYidlVOKWRqtzxzIBNXiJtIbQ-p5V2cP7wvE5sCGACN7-4-d9kEp8c4ZgxuMGFBntAOc4MzDJq0tSqn9yasJRT4cc19vcVHHKDQiJZGphG6bid0WoBN3y7vyCBsQhbBQuV4ESiDznfgP4Tj=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0c265ee5299de67184d8ed94f110f926958566bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.jKREfozTM_hRB8gBzdL8gKWA.P92Y1N4K5_FMBpPD9_52Nnr5Y3F33mH.MTo4gJQe8oMFo7idgdS4LEQZvYEsdgfVJpsNfTo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (Aruwa Abubakar)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Dear Admin: My Sister Has Done Her Worst\u2026 Am I Wrong to Disown Her?", "text": "Dear Admin: My Sister Has Done Her Worst\u2026 Am I Wrong to Disown Her? Dear Admin: My Sister Has Done Her Worst\u2026 Am I Wrong to Disown Her? by 11:04:00 in RELATIONSHIP TIPS , STORIES   Dear Aruwaab9ja, I once came to this page to complain about my sister\u2019s behavior and some of you asked me to forgive and be the adult. Well, after what she did this time, I have finally made a decision to act like she doesn\u2019t exist. We are the only two girls in the family of six, she is 28 and I am 22. She is the first born. I used to stay with her and her family. I did all the house chores and never waited for anyone to tell me what to do, but during that time whenever we had small issues \u2013 like me forgetting to switch on the ring boiler for water to bath, or not bathing the kids before I go to work on Saturdays \u2013 she would give me an attitude till Monday. My work resumption time is 7am but once I get the kids ready for school, take them there, and wait till the assembly bell rings \u2013 because she warned that I shouldn\u2019t leave them on their own before the bell rings \u2013 I would be late for work. I thank God my boss was understanding. I traveled down to assist her during her first pregnancy but she thinks I am helpless. Whenever we have issues that is the only time she works in the house, restricting the kids from coming close to me, telling me she can take care of her children herself. I told my mum about it and she warned her. For a while it stopped and when it started again, I left her house. I started visiting once in a while because my mum and boyfriend were always insisting I do. I noticed that whenever I am around she would lock up her food, I never complained but what she did this week was the final straw. I was to celebrate my birthday on Sunday and I baked two cakes. She said she would ice one while I ice the other. We concluded on that and I then left for my mother\u2019s place to prepare for other things. I was so busy that I didn\u2019t have time to call her concerning the cake but I knew it was ready. Just for me to get to her house and she had locked herself inside her room. All the clothes I was to wear on the day were in her room. We had even planned for her kids to follow me but when it was obvious she didn\u2019t want them to, I bathe them and packed my things and left. This is not the first, second, nor third time this is happening and I am fed up of it. I want everyone to be on their own since she feels she has arrived because of her house and her kids. Imagine her saying that she keeps the kids away from me and her husband to hurt us when there is an issue because she knows we love them\u2026 as if I won\u2019t have my kids too. The other time I told her about my school fees and she said there was no money, this is someone who has never contributed to my life in any way. I just asked her for the sake of it. Only for me to visit her the next week and she was showing me the new phones and sound system she had just bought, I didn\u2019t say anything. My sister in law has said that I should give my sister space but my boyfriend won\u2019t let me be, but I give up. Please am I wrong for giving up on my relationship with my sister? Note: my mom wanted to go and meet her but I told her not to because she doesn\u2019t pick our calls except she feels like it. I told my mom that from now henceforth I don\u2019t have a sister.

The increasing number of millennial shoppers has added to the growth of online retail channels, most of which are price-sensitive. Moreover, consumers prefer shopping online at discounted rates and therefore increasingly adopt online shopping. Hair conditioners, hair styling gels,bath gels,and shower products are the commonly purchased beauty and personal care products online. Additionally, the wide range of products available on online platforms and the time-saving aspect of the medium are factors that have contributed to the rise of the online retail phenomenon. E-retailers offer better security features for online payments, customer-friendly services, easy-to-navigate shopping websites, and easy delivery, due to which the number of consumers using online shopping portals is anticipated to increase significantly in the next few years.  //www.transparencymarketresearch.com/online-beauty-personal-care-market.html The global online beauty and personal care market is divided in terms of product types into the following categories: skin care, oral hygiene, hair care, color cosmetics, fragrances, sun care, bath and shower, deodorants, baby and child care, male grooming, and depilatory products. Among all of these, skin care products are prominently purchased across different regions. This segment includes facial care products and body lotions which enhance skin quality, prevent wrinkles, rejuvenate the cells, and brighten the complexion. The availability of several brands and new features in the market is expected to boost the online sales of skin care products in the next few years. In addition, leading vendors focus on launching products comprising ingredients derived from organic and natural sources to amplify their revenue generation. The online beauty and personal care market is geographically distributed over North   Africa (MEA), and Latin America. Asia Pacific accounted for the maximum share in the market in 2015, which is primarily driven by the availability of new brands, consumer experimentation with new products, and an   fragrances and colored cosmetics. The growing adoption of specific products such as skin lightening products across different age groups as well as anti-aging cosmetics are projected to fuel the expansion of the market in this region. In addition to this, regional brands are also gaining popularity due to their unique properties. Latin America is a potentially attractive market for online beauty and personal care and its share is estimated to rise over the forecast period. The global market is highly competitive with the presence of a large number of large-scale and small-scale vendors who compete with each other in terms of product differentiation, quality, prices, innovation, distribution, and brand promotion.

They sell different brands including their home brands and private consumer products to end-users. The increasing scope of network marketing and espousal of m-commerce (mobile-commerce) is predicted to be beneficial for these market players during the forecast period. These players dominate the market with their vast geographic presence and production facilities in different countries. However, the global online beauty and personal care market is also characterized by the presence of several regional and small manufacturers who lead the market in countries such as the U.K. and China.

Unlike qualified plans [such as a 401(k)], a SIMPLE IRA plan is easy to administer. The start-up and maintenance costs for SIMPLE IRAs are very low compared to qualified plans. Any employer \u2013 which includes sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations and non-profit organizations \u2013 may establish a SIMPLE IRA Plan, as long as the employer meets the eligibility requirements. Contributions to SIMPLE IRAs are immediately 100% vested, and the SIMPLE IRA owner (employee) directs the investments. An employer is required to make either dollar-for-dollar matching contributions (not to exceed 3% of the employee's compensation), or 2% nonelective contribution to all eligible employees regardless of whether they make deferral contributions.

The increasing awareness among consumers regarding the maintenance of oral health and various preventable periodontal disorders have also added significantly to the market\u2019s growth. \nOver the years, the market will gain remarkably from the continual increase in the prevalence of periodontitis and dental caries across the world. The augmenting preference for dental radiography for the treatment of various oral diseases, extensive technological developments in imaging modalities, and several other pivotal demographic factors, such as the presence of a large base of geriatric as well as pediatric population, prone to acquiring dental impairments, are also projected to boost this market in the years to come. Report Overview and TOC @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/dental-digital-x-ray-market.html \nApart from this, the market is expected to benefit from the ongoing boom in the cosmetic dentistry market and the increasing requirement of oral disorders diagnostic processes and devices, globally, over the next few years. However, on the flipside, the high cost associated with digital radiography systems is anticipated to obstruct the growth trajectory of this market in the near future. \nX-rays are an important part of the dental care plan. They are mostly used for diagnostics as also for preventive measures to aid the diagnosis of oral issues. X-rays are a type of radiation which are absorbed by the denser tissue and pass through soft tissues. Since bones and teeth are dense tissues, they absorb these rays and form an image. Dental x-rays serve various purposes such as glancing at tooth roots, searching for cavities, and checking the status of a developing tooth. Request for Broucher @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=24464 \nThe global dental digital x-ray market is anticipated to register a high growth rate during the forecast period due to technological advancements in analogue x-rays. Furthermore, the surge in dental disorders as well as in the geriatric population, easy usage of the equipment, quicker results, rising demand for cosmetic dentistry, and the growing usage of dental implants, orthodontics, and prosthetics are the factors expected to drive the global dental digital x-ray market through 2025. On the other hand, the high cost of the equipment and lack of reimbursement could limit the development of the global dental digital x-ray market during the forecast period. \nThe global dental digital x-ray market can be segmented by type into the following divisions: intraoral x-rays, extra oral x-rays, and others. On the basis of application, the global market can be divided into the cosmetics, medical, and forensics segments. The medical segment is likely to dominate the global dental digital X-ray market over the forecast period due to its extensive usage in dental diagnostics and treatment. The cosmetics segment is anticipated to expand at a robust rate by 2025 due to the popularity of cosmetic dentistry. Based on modality, the global market is split into the following categories: portable x-ray systems and stationary x-ray systems. Portable x-ray systems are projected to occupy a major share in the global market during the forecast period due to factors such as easy usage of the equipment and high technological advancements. Based on end-user, the global dental digital x-ray market is classified into the following groups: dental clinics & hospitals, academic & research institutes, and forensic laboratories. For Specific and Customized Requirements @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=CR&rep_id=24464 \nGeographically, the global dental digital x-ray market is distributed over North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. North America holds a major share in the global market in terms of value and volume due to technological advancements, the shift from analogue to digital systems, and the rising incidence of dental disorders among children and young adults in the region. Asia Pacific is estimated to register rapid growth in the global market due to the increasing health care expenditure in developing economies such as India & China, the densely populated countries, rising geriatric population, and growing incidence of in dental disorders due to prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles in the region. \nDue to rising competition in the market, companies adopt various policies including strategic alliances, forward & backward integration, new product development, and mergers & acquisitions in order to sustain in the global dental digital x-ray market.

double the speed limit, an inquest heard. \nJasper Collins, 21, died from a head injury after his white Volkswagen Scirocco smashed into a tree on Crow Lane in Ringwood . \nWinchester Coroner's Court heard that Mr Collins was also likely to have been over the drink drive limit at the time of the crash at around 2am, having been socialising with friends after a shift at the pub where he worked. \nCCTV footage recovered from a residents' house nearby showed Mr Collins was driving at around 86 miles per hour on the 40mph limit road. \nMr Collins, of Ringwood Road, Bransgore , was partially revived at the scene but later died at Southampton General Hospital on August 8. \nPhilip Robertson, the manager of the Elm Tree pub, said Mr Collins left the pub to drive home after work at around 1.45am. \n\"I don't know how much alcohol he had had after work but there was only one receipt for a pint of Fosters,\" he said. \nBut PC Robert Giles said Mr Collins was, \"twice the speed limit with a significant level of alcohol in his system.\" \nToxicology results showed 48mg per 100ml of alcohol in Mr Collins' blood - below the drink drive limit - but this was recorded around two hours after the incident after some alcohol had been eliminated from his system. \nHe said analysis showed Mr Collins had drunk \"considerably more than one pint of Fosters\". \nPC Emma Clifford told the court Mr Collins used to travel on the stretch of road between his work and his home so he was familiar with the route, but that it was possible he was unfamiliar with the handling and the performance of his new Volkswagen, which he bought two weeks before his death. \nSince Mr Collins' death, a decision notice has been issued by Hampshire County Council to reduce the speed limit on Crow Lane to 30mph, which is likely to come into effect following the completion of a nearby housing development. \nCoroner Grahame Short said it was \"likely\" Mr Collins was over the drink drive limit, but that it was difficult to be precise due to the delay before blood alcohol was taken. \n\"I believe this was a combination of youthful exuberance and the effects of alcohol, combined with a new car.\" he said. \nHe recorded a conclusion of road traffic collision. \nFollowing his death his mum, Anne Collins, said: \u201cAs you can imagine, we are devastated, heartbroken. No words can sum it up. Just 21 years old, now forever young.\" \n\"Jasper was truly a good boy \u2013 I would say that wouldn\u2019t I, but it is so true.

Born 56 years ago, not many knew that Olu Jacobs \u2019s wife, Joke was adopted by the Silva family. Kemiashefonlovehaven exclusively reports that the Nollywood actress and influential businesswoman was living in a foster home of the Red Cross in Yaba, Lagos, and she recalled that her foster parent was Mrs. Desalu . She said; \u201cEverybody would be calling me whenever my adopted mum (Dr. Silva)came with cakes and a lot of things during her visit. I went to YWCA Nursery, which was not too far from the Silva\u2019s home in Yaba. I also have memories of moving in with them when they moved to Glover Road in Ikoyi. I remember reading newspapers to my Dad in our sitting room and pronouncing Brig-General Aguyi Ironsi, the then Nigeria Head Of State, Agolo Iresi! My father could not stop laughing at my hilarious interpretation of the newspaper. Also I remember making them proud, when performing at St. Saviour School. My parents would be standing and were congratulated by other parent too for my acting skills. My parents were so excited that this child was incredibly talented. At Holy Child Lagos I have memories of going to Holy Child College Lagos because my parents insisted on me going to Holy Child because that is where Julie Coker, Pearce Olusola and Ibidun Allison went and they believed with all my performing talent skills, that is the kind of school I should go to too. Revelation I remembered going out with my cousin and we met a big cousin, she introduced me as \u2018my cousin\u2019s daughter and this is Dr Silva\u2019s daughter.\u2019 Then, the older cousin was like, \u2018Dr. Silva ke? Se Doctor Silva bimo ni? (meaning does Dr. Silva have a child?) . Did Dr Silva ever have a child?\u2019 I was so confused and when I got home I told my mum, \u2018I met this lady that says you never had a child.\u2019 My mum froze and she said, \u2018don\u2019t mind them, they are used to rubbish talk.\u2019 But I got to know years later when I wanted to travel and was looking for my passport where my mum kept it. Since she was not around, I opened the box in her absence and I saw my adoption papers. I never discussed it with my mum because I felt it was something that would hurt her, that was why, it was kept secret from me. Joke\u2019s Mum, Dr Silva I had incredible memories of my amazing parents allowing me to do my A Level in England in one of the best schools in Bournemouth (a seaside resort on the southern coast of England) and coming back after my A level with two of them having an argument on what I was going to do because I had failed my A level, having done it for the third time then. I had done it thrice because I changed from science to Arts\u2014 I didn\u2019t do well at all. My father said, \u2018Joke, go back and do your A levels again and my Mom said, let this girl go and do the drama.\u2019 They came into middle ground, and as you can see I am still in drama today. Bringing Olu Jacobs home Several years later, I brought home the one I wanted to marry and my mum asked my husband, if he knew I was adopted and he answered in affirmation that I had already told him. Many years later, there was another memory of a very nasty member of our family. My mummy always very supportive of her relatives sat on our balcony and said my aunty would never be supportive of her because in the Yoruba language, \u2018won o kuku bimo\u2019 (she never supported her because she didn\u2019t have a child of her own.) When I heard about it I did what Pastor Rapu called the unchristian thing. (May God forgive me. I dealt with her, till today, she never believed what I did that day to her, but I dealt with her by being so cold towards her. She would never forget it. Letting my kids know I then realized that I needed to tell my children about my adoption. I don\u2019t want anybody to tell them in a way it wouldn\u2019t be supportive. I called my children and I told them the ABC of my adoption story. They now told me that grandma had already told them. It was then I learn that somebody in my son\u2019s school had told him about his mum being adopted. Joke Silva and Son He told grandma and grandma told him everything. Little wonder, my mum and Soji, my son were very close. Till she died, my mum and my son remained inseparable. Olu and I Lost Our Daughter I have memories of my firstborn Dayo who died at the age of 10 and a half years. She was in coma and my husband would not allow them removed her from life support until my mom came. He needed my mom\u2019s approval then because grandma was so close to Dayo, they were inseparable. She gave the go-ahead for her to be removed by saying she was better up there than making her suffer on life support. My mum was the one that saw us through because my dad already had a stroke and couldn\u2019t be of help at all then. I remember when my mother saw the health of my husband, who was deteriorating over the death of our daughter. She gave my husband a cheque of a hefty sum to go and complete the house we were building then. But because of how arrogant our husbands could be on matters like that, he rejected the offer of his mother-in-law, and quickly gathered himself together to go and complete the house. Celebrating Late Parents My mother is the first person who taught me how to pray and she told me, whatever the problem, her own father, Bishop Phillips , taught her to kneel down and pray on any issues bothering her life. Whenever I go to her, she said, \u201cJoke have you been on your kneels, oya take it to Baba God in prayer. Take it to daddy in prayer.\u201d In the Silva\u2019s Will Even in their wills, I was well protected. My Daddy being a lawyer said in his will that all his children, both adopted and biological, should be treated equally. I was not stressed in anyway. We were all well taken care of till my mum died at the age of 89 . At 56, I still miss her but I know she has definitely gone back to her father. On her sick bed I always sang her favorite tunes, she would be imputing the melodious tunes and she died singing to her Lord. She had prepared her family before my coming into her life because I had an incredible big Silva family. I have a very big family I am the first daughter, I carried the responsibility of a first daughter. Everybody in my family cannot take any decision until sister Joke has come. I can\u2019t call my parents adopted parents. They are my parents.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joke silva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearce olusola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brig-general aguyi ironsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs dolapo osinbajo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibidun allison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phillips", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baba god", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie coker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rapu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dayo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "desalu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olu jacobs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kemiashefonlovehaven", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soji", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red cross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria head of state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heritage adoption support and advocacy group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joke silva -jacobs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. saviour school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holy child college lagos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "glover road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bournemouth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ikoyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yaba", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:33.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac814f48d8908788a53af24f7e0f1a0c65d0b665", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rDNjs.ZgPA8Gw4azdliepEmBHcTSOQ_S4q3iUE1JrPCdSwohoWyKpHchvMmUI8rGDbCPHfLTjoCVTBuM2Bicpw--", "site_full": "quiltswissy.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://quiltswissy.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Quilts and Dogs", "title": "Long Tall Sally", "title_full": "Long Tall Sally", "published": "2017-12-03T06:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c531bf25b8f4358c65906168eaf130f3dd69d407", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rDNjs.ZgPA8Gw4azdliepEmBHcTSOQ_S4q3iUE1JrPCdSwohoWyKpHchvMmUI8rGDbCPHfLTjoA4rslEGQTwrvhk0tRwlSOn", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Cheryl", "published": "2017-12-07T05:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Very cute birdy block, I love it!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:33.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4cd2946646d442c255d0b3f982542a62f93e1caa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoqdOopeWdTkXqmVYV0S4RT5HQ6jwsvqKPB3QkS9lXltQStwIRGtGwU", "site_full": "getyoualoan.com", "site": "getyoualoan.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["credit_debt_and_loans", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "us pawn \u2013 When you need a loan we got you!", "title_full": "us pawn \u2013 When you need a loan we got you!", "published": "2017-12-07T12:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.198, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4cd2946646d442c255d0b3f982542a62f93e1caa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoqdOopeWdTkXqmVYV0S4RT5HQ6jwsvqKPB3QkS9lXltQStwIRGtGwU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "us pawn \u2013 When you need a loan we got you!", "text": "us pawn \nus pawn \nFirst Choice Auto Loan Matches bad credit applicants with the best possible auto loans on the Internet.

There's also information on how you can shape your budget to take advantage of positive developments like a raise or promotion; rethink it when you lose a big expense (you pay off your student loan or your last child graduates from college); and handle the financial blowback of life's inevitable down periods. \nThink of this stage of the process as a kind of budget boot camp because it's about facing up to the tough questions and crunching a whole lot of numbers.

Statue of Aristarchus at Aristotle University in Thessalonica, Greece \n   Aristarchus or Aristarch (Greek: \u1f08\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2,  Ar\u00edstarchos ; 310 BC \u2013 ca. 230 BC) was a Greek astronomer and mathematician, born on the island of Samos, in Greece. He was the first person to present an explicit argument for a heliocentric model of the solar system, placing the Sun, not the Earth, at the center of the known universe. He was influenced by the Pythagorean Philolaus of Kroton, but, in contrast to Philolaus, he had both identified the central fire with the Sun, as well as putting other planets in correct order from the Sun. His astronomical ideas were rejected in favor of the geocentric theories of Aristotle and Ptolemy until they were successfully revived nearly 1800 years later by Copernicus and extensively developed and built upon by Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton. The crater Aristarchus on the Moon is named in his honor. Contents \nHeliocentrism Distance to the Sun (Lunar Dichotomy) The Great Year and an Estimate of the Length of the Month Precession Notes References Further reading External links \nHeliocentrism The only work usually attributed to Aristarchus which has survived to the present time,  On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon , is based on a geocentric world view. It is peculiar and possibly informative that this work reckons the sun's diameter as 2 degrees, rather than the correct value, 1/2 degree. The latter diameter is known from Archimedes to have been Aristarchus's actual value. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book  The Sand Reckoner  ( Archimedis Syracusani Arenarius & Dimensio Circuli ) describes another work by Aristarchus in which he advanced an alternative hypothesis of the heliocentric model. Archimedes wrote: You ['you' being King Gelon] are aware the 'universe' is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the 'universe' just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of the fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface. \u2014 The Sand Reckoner Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and saw this as the reason why there was no visible parallax, that is, an observed movement of the stars relative to each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes. The geocentric model, consistent with planetary parallax, was assumed to be an explanation for the unobservability of the parallel phenomenon, stellar parallax. The rejection of the heliocentric view was common, as the following passage from Plutarch suggests ( On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon ): Cleanthes (a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the Stoics) thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the hearth of the universe \u2026 supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis. \u2014 Tassoul, Concise History of Solar and Stellar Physics The only other astronomer from antiquity who is known by name and who is known to have supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was  Seleucus of Seleucia , a  Mesopotamian astronomer  who lived a century after Aristarchus. \nDistance to the Sun (Lunar Dichotomy) \n.. Aristarchus's 3rd century BC calculations on the relative sizes of from left the Sun, Earth and Moon, from a 10th century CE Greek copy Aristarchus claimed that at half moon (first or last quarter moon), the angle between sun and moon was 87\u00b0. Possibly he proposed 87\u00b0 as a lower bound since gauging the lunar terminator's deviation from linearity to 1\u00b0 accuracy is beyond the unaided human ocular limit (that limit being about 3\u00b0 accuracy). Aristarchus is known to have also studied light and vision. Using correct geometry, but the insufficiently accurate 87\u00b0 datum, Aristarchus concluded that the Sun was 18 times farther away than the Moon. (The true value of this angle is close to 89\u00b0 50', and the Sun's distance is actually about 400 times the Moon's.) The implicit false solar parallax of slightly under 3\u00b0 was used by astronomers up to and including Tycho Brahe, ca. 1600 A. D. Aristarchus pointed out that the Moon and Sun have nearly equal apparent angular sizes and therefore their diameters must be in proportion to their distances from Earth. He thus concluded that the diameter of the Sun was about 20 times larger than the diameter of the Moon; which, although wrong, follows logically from his data. It also leads to the conclusion that the Sun's diameter is almost seven times greater than the Earth's; the volume of Aristarchus's Sun would be almost 300 times greater than the Earth. This difference in sizes may have inspired the heliocentric model. \nThe Great Year and an Estimate of the Length of the Month Mentioned by Archimedes and by modern scientists for being the first to propose a heliocentric \"universe\", Aristarchus also proposed an ancient Greek time period, his \"Great Year\" of 4868 solar years, equalling exactly 270 saroi, each of 18 Callippic years plus 10 and 2/3 degrees. ( Syntaxis , book 4 chapter 2.) Its empirical foundation was the 4267 month eclipse cycle, cited by Ptolemy as source of the \"Babylonian\" month, which was good to a fraction of a second (1 part in several million). It is found on cuneiform tablets from shortly before 200 B. C., though Ptolemy did not attribute its origin to Babylon. (Due to near integral returns in lunar and solar anomaly, eclipses 4267 months apart exceptionally never deviated by more than an hour from a mean of 126007 days plus 1 hour, the value given by Ptolemy at  op. cit . Thus, estimation of the length of the month was ensured to have relative accuracy of 1 part in millions.) Embedded in the Great Year was a length of the month agreeing with the Babylonian value to 1 part in tens of millions, decades before Babylon is known to have used it. There are indications that Babylon's month was exactly that of Aristarchus, which if true renders it effectively certain that one party obtained it from the other or from a common source. Aristarchus's lunar conception represents an advance of science in several respects. Previous estimates of the length of the month were in error by 114 seconds ( Meton , 432 B. C.) and 22 seconds ( Callippus , 330 B. C.). The attribution of a mean motion to such a motion as the moon's was possibly new. \nPrecession \nThe Vatican has preserved two ancient manuscripts with estimates of the length of the year. The only ancient scientist listed for two different values is Aristarchus. It is now widely suspected that these are among the earliest surviving examples of continued fraction expressions. The most obvious interpretations are precisely computable from the manuscript numbers. The results are Aristarchus years of 365 days plus 1/152, and 365 days minus 15/4868, representing the sidereal year and the civil, supposedly tropical year. Both denominators are relatable to Aristarchus, whose summer solstice was 152 years after Meton's and whose Great Year was 4868 years. The difference between the sidereal and tropical years is identical to precession. The former value is accurate within a few seconds. The latter is erroneous by several minutes. Both are close to the values later used by Hipparchus and Ptolemy, and the precession indicated is almost precisely 1 degree per century, a much-too-low value. Unfortunately, 1 degree per century precession was used by all later astronomers until the Arabs. The correct value in Aristarchus's time was about 1.38 degrees per century. \nNotes \nHeath (1913, p.302) Concise History of Solar and Stellar Physics  - Princeton University, 2004 - J. and M.

Bei der Entwicklung der Map Miramar im Fokus lag vor allem etwas v\u00f6llig Unterschiedliches zur Map Erangel zu erstellen. Im Hinterkopf wollen die Entwickler dabei auch gehabt haben, dass bisherige Taktiken nicht mehr funktionieren und sich die Spieler umstellen m\u00fcssen. An dieser Stelle soll aber noch nicht so viel verraten werden, denn der Spieler soll die Karte selbst\u00e4ndig erkunden und sich selbst neue Strategien zurechtlegen. \nEinige Besonderheiten wollen die Entwickler aber dennoch beschreiben: \nLos Leones \nThe largest city in the region, Los Leones features ample shopping, a skyline filled with new construction, and a glorious, golden-hued City Center. Players should secure high vantage points by exploring the numerous construction sites, and loot for gear in the cavernous, abandoned commercial buildings. \nEl Pozo \nEl Pozo is a city known for its large industrial and entertainment districts. Players can test themselves against all comers in the Luchador Arena, put their motorcycle skills to the test In the death bowl, or hunt in the ruins of the long dead textile factories. \nMonte Nuevo \nMonte Nuevo is the picture of a town besieged. Ramshackle walls built to protect its residents now allow players ample cover to explore the well-stocked compound. \nValle del Mar \nValle del Mar is a colorful oceanside town bisected by the De Toro bridge. To the West of the bridge is a quaint school, and to the East, a beautiful church. The key to holding this town is bridge control, as it\u2019s the only direct route between mainland and the island. \nLa Cobreria \nThe shipping and transport capitol of Miramar, La Cobrer\u00eda\u2019s most prominent feature is it\u2019s enormous Rail Yard. Here, players will hunt and be hunted among the half-buried cargo of a long dead industry. Careful players should loot the schools and campuses that dot this town before attempting to hold the Yard. \nSan Martin \nSan Mart\u00edn is located just west of Hacienda Del Patr\u00f3n. Checkpoints and barriers have transformed this once-quiet small town into a war zone. Both sides of the town have overlooks, so careful players should scout first, before charging into town. \nPecado \nOnce a tourist destination featuring the largest casino in the region, Pecado continues to thrill players to this day with its mix of high-value loot and dangerous sightlines. Aggressive players will immediately loot the Arena and Casino, but savvy players should check out the 4 story hotels between them. \nChumacera \nChumacera is the husk of Miramar\u2019s once thriving textile industry. Long abandoned factories overlook a main road lined with residential and commercial buildings.

President Trump announced that the U.S. will view Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and he ordered the State Department to \"begin preparation to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv.\" The controversial move threatens to unsettle the region's volatile politics. Ahmad Gharabli / AFP/Getty Images \nPresident Trump's declaration that Jerusalem is Israel's capital and his order to move the U.S. Embassy brought quick and sharply differing reactions from Jewish, Christian and Muslim leaders. \nThe government of Israel considers Jerusalem its capital, and most Jewish-American organizations have long argued that the United States should acknowledge it as such. The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which called for the U.S. Embassy to be moved to Jerusalem, passed by a large bipartisan margin and was strongly supported by Jewish-American groups. \n\"It's been the consensus mainline view for decades,\" said Nathan Diament, executive director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, \"because Jerusalem is the capital city for Israel and the Jewish people. ... The United States puts its embassies in capital cities, and it's unjust and discriminatory to say we're going to single out Israel as the one country where we don't put our embassy [in the capital].\" \nWhen President Trump on Wednesday ordered the State Department to begin preparations to move the embassy to Jerusalem, several Jewish-American groups welcomed the move. \n\"By stating the truth of Jerusalem's status as the capital of the State of Israel, President Trump has asserted U.S. global leadership towards ending a longstanding, senseless anomaly,\" said David Harris, chief executive officer of the American Jewish Committee. \nThe Anti-Defamation League called the move a \"significant step,\" coming at a time \"when international organizations and other detractors delegitimize the Jewish state and deny any Jewish connection to the holy city.\" \nBut there were also misgivings from some Jewish-American groups. The Reform Jewish Movement, representing nearly 900 congregations, noted that it has long supported the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital but also believed that moving the U.S. Embassy there should happen only \"at the right time.\" Without a comprehensive peace plan, the movement said it cannot support the president's decision to move the embassy now. \nConservative evangelical Christian leaders had fewer qualms. \n\"This decision will be met by political praise and theological conviction,\" said Johnnie Moore, an informal spokesman for Trump's evangelical advisory group. \"Evangelicals in every corner of the United States will be ecstatic,\" he said. \nEvangelicals feel a special kinship with Jerusalem as the city where they believe Jesus Christ was crucified and rose again. Some sects even take an eschatological view, arguing that Jesus will return to earth in Jerusalem, once all Jews are reunited there. \nFor Trump's evangelical advisory group, said Moore, the only issue more important than the status of Jerusalem is the question of who will be appointed as federal judges. \n\"In our various meetings with the White House, this issue has always come up,\" Moore said, \"and it has always been an extended discussion around the table. I mean, at the heart of the relationship between the United States and Israel has been the friendship between evangelical Christians and the Jewish people.\" \nSome evangelical leaders who generally support the president's Jerusalem decision, however, fear the repercussions for their own Palestinian Christian followers. Muslim leaders in the Palestinian territories have warned there will be a reaction there to the president's announcement. The governments of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey all expressed alarm at Trump's decision, as did Muslim leaders in the U.S. \n\"The reality is that Palestinians have existed for generations on the land of Palestine [and] in Jerusalem,\" said Osama Abuirshaid, a board member of the American Muslims for Palestine, at a press conference near the White House. \"[Trump] cannot deny this reality,\" Abuirshaid said. \"He spoke about the Jewish connection to Jerusalem while negating the Christian and Muslim connection to the land and to the holy city.\" \nPope Francis advised against \"adding new elements of tension in a world already shaken and scarred by many cruel conflicts.\" The heads of several Christian churches in Jerusalem, in a joint letter to Trump, said a unilateral change in the status of Jerusalem by the U.S. government \"will yield increased hatred, conflict, violence, and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land ... [and] cause irreparable harm.\" \nA similar warning came from Elizabeth Eaton, the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran group in the U.S. \n\"This announcement,\" Eaton said, \"has a high probability of leading to violence and bloodshed and not ... getting any closer to having the two parties come to the table again.\" \nEaton spoke following a meeting in Geneva with fellow Lutheran chuch leaders from around the world, including those in Jordan and other Arab countries.

The court also restrained the Osun State Independent Electoral Commission or any of its agents from conducting election for any of the 32 Local Councils Development Areas (LCDA) purportedly created by the Osun state government, pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice. The court, in the ruling sighted by the Nigerian Tribune also restrained the Osun state government from diverting any money released by the Federal Government as allocation to the 30 constitutionally recognised Local Government Areas in the state, whether for the purpose of running the Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs), pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice. Tsoho also restrained the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) or any of its agents from releasing voters\u2019 registers to the Osun State Electoral Commission, whether for the conduct of election into the LCDAs or any other related process.

According to the timetable released by OSIEC, a total of 37 LCDAs were to participate in the election slated for January. Meanwhile, the Osun State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Dr. Ajibola Bashir said he was not in any way aware of such order stopping all processes regarding the state\u2019s Local Government Election scheduled to hold on 27th January, 2018 . He said, \u201cThe Office of the Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice is not aware of any pending court action regarding the Local Government Election at the Federal High Court in Abuja and no court process has been served to our office\u201d, he said and that OSIEC is not aware of any action at the Federal High Court Abuja and has not been served with any court process. \u201cConsequently, we have no basis to believe or give credence to the news which has not been credited to any credible information source\u201d, he said.
