I liked the first issue, and this one builds a bit more. The Swamp Thing is looking for Abigail Arcane, and he still believes in John. Meanwhile John seems to only be looking out for himself (which is per usual). He weasels Chas for a ride and for Chas to place a bet for him. He then begins to look into a new underworld kingpin, but ends up picking up a tail with a couple strange human looking creatures he refers to as muppets. At this point, I don't know how the Swamp Thing story and the John Constantine story connect, but they are certainly a study in contrasts. The Swamp Thing is quiet and powerful, and John is chaotic and frenzied. I like the art by Moritat. It has a cartoonish look to it, so John's expressions tend to squash and stretch. The color is good and panels have nice background details. I like this book so far.   issue from DC Entertainment   me to review this issue.  //ift.tt/2zWzAWK Posted by", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "simon oliver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moritat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john constantine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constantine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abigail arcane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:15.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d47ad53a485067da9ff57f128b5ad37ee32fa9f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodedUrN1qxBoEWP9HJqL3FyGWY0ZAtjF3KyYTdEZFB2APT7PBSLAcdDYLl4comXubkFJl_RFbVV30m9BKGZN_WkxZspN1k45KYlOGrhQegMkTD5LGZTE4JoQ-", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/politics/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Political Talk | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Oh Pelosi you enabler you....

For most people this is not due to a lack of initial motivation. The farther we get from our first resolution to lose weight, the less motivated we often feel. There are ways to prevent this. This article will describe how to be one of those fortunate people who takes off the weight and stays at goal weight.\n\nDefining your goal up front is a pivotal first step in a successful weight loss program. Having a target weight goal will help you keep focused on reaching that goal.\n\nConsider keeping a weight loss journal. You can easily write down what you eat daily. When you have written everything down for a few days, it will be easy to discern eating patterns and see the areas in which you can make the smallest changes for the greatest benefit.\n\nYou know what your food needs are, so it\u2019s important to plan ahead for the coming day. You should not wait until you are starving to choose what you are going to eat. Make your food choices in advance. Pack some snack or a nutritious lunch to take with you anywhere you go. By not eating out continually, you will save a lot of money. Making an eating plan for all of your meals and sticking to it will assure successful weight loss.\n\nExercise is as important as diet when you are trying to seriously lose some weight. Create an exercise plan that incorporates different activities that you enjoy so that it is easier for you to maintain your work ethic. When you are trying to find something fun to do to keep exercising fun think about a dance class or a sport that you like. You can always even work out with friends. Using creativity is a great way to help you achieve fitness goals.\n\nIf your home is full of bad food options, it can be difficult to cease consuming them. By simply replacing unhealthy foods with healthy snacks in your fridge and cupboard, you can change your eating habits. Stock your pantry with lots of healthy alternatives to junk food, such as veggies, fruits, and healthy, low-fat snack foods. Stop buying junk food! This is the simplest way to make sure you won\u2019t eat it, which is especially helpful when you can\u2019t resist it. If you eliminate junk food from your home and replace it with healthy food, you will cease making bad choices.\n\nHave your friends give you support any way they can. They might not be able to lose the weight for you, but their unconditional support is the next best thing. Having someone to report to makes it more likely you stay committed to your goals when they seem too hard to reach. When you feel like you are not motivated, call a buddy for support. No one can provide you with the support that you need like a friend can.\n\nClick Discover The Full Story ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:16.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "903506961114f6cdcbb01201871d27ef1b84c304", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodVjdQCRpgjSxrKM_mLoiodHSbIxX1Gy5D.3_0ZGIfJY_3V2hO8_boUqHL5S7HbJn.dBUthx2CTmvbJa9VU5e0GYIoJ5uYXRCWnvP_9N80mKxFV5k1DnuxJM-", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/politics/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Political Talk | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Chelsea Handler blames Trump for Cali fires.

After she ran into the doughnut shop, those two suspects fled off in the Malibu, tossing the reporter\u2019s laptop computer out the window, Antonietti said. The third suspect, 16, followed in the Nissan, Antonietti said. \nThe Malibu was a Tribune company car, and the reporter, who told police neither of the teens showed a weapon during the robbery, was unhurt, a Tribune breaking news editor told the Chicago Sun-Times. \nTuesday, police spotted the Evans and the two 16-year-olds inside the Malibu as it drove the wrong way down the 4600 block of North Ravenswood Avenue, authorities said. \nWhen the officers took a a U-turn to head back toward the Malibu, the teens drove off. The teens abandoned the car a block away the parking lot of a grocery store in the 1800 block of West Lawrence Avenue, but a bystander pointed pursuing officers to the direction the trio had run, authorities said. \nPolice found all three teens hiding under a staircase at the rear of a house in the 1800 block of West Argyle Street. Evans\u2019 cell phone was found inside the Malibu, Antonietti said. Evans initially gave police a false name, but admitted the carjacking and gave a \u201creverse identification\u201d of the Tribune reporter, Antonietti said. \nEvans is a senior at Phillips Academy High School in Bronzeville, and has no prior criminal record as an adult or a juvenile. \nThe two teens with him were arrested for misdemeanor counts of criminal trespass to a vehicle. They were charged as juveniles.

It\u2019s a role reversal for both Kanye and me. Before, I was the administrative guy and he was the creative. Now, I am enjoying being the creative and being showcased from my point of view. Hopefully, Kanye and everyone that trusts Kanye\u2019s opinion will trust his cosign because if he\u2019s cosigning me as a director then the rest of the world should follow.

The one category that has shown the most dramatic improvement in recent decades is Spain\u2019s white wines, of which this brisk, dry, white Rioja is a textbook example. Historically, white wines were the nation\u2019s Achilles heel because they spoil faster than reds. The balmy climate of most regions of Spain exposed white wines to excess heat, resulting in an oxidized amber-gold color and flavors closer to those of roasted nuts than to orchard-fresh fruits. However, starting in the 1970s, technological advances in winemaking, like temperature control and inert stainless tanks, led to a transformation in Spain\u2019s white wines. Instead of clunky, oxidized styles, Spain is now known for vibrantly fresh whites from its own native grapes. This particular wine, from one of the most respected wineries of the Rioja region, is made with 100 percent viura. It tastes as fresh as a Granny Smith apple, with a mouth-watering undercurrent of lemony tartness, and makes for a great change of pace from dry, unoaked whites, like sauvignon blanc and pinot grigio. \n\u201cMonopole\u201d Rioja Blanco, La Rioja, Spain, $11.99 (sale price through Dec. 31, regularly $13.99) PLCB Item #1600; A lso available at Canal\u2019s in Mount Ephraim, $10.99; and Traino\u2019s Wine & Spirits in Marlton, $11.99.

A person who wanders from place to place to find fresh pasture for their livestock. Postdocsare probably the academic equivalent of nomads, wandering from place to place, always looking for a newchallenge or a fresh start. But when that green grass shrivels after a few seasons (grants unfortunately haveend dates), he/she is on the move again.First, you studied for five years at your university. You struggled through a PhD for four to five additional years. You are officially not a student anymore. Hello adult life!After that point, I personally wanted to pursue an academic career. Onto the next step: a postdoc. Luckily, I had already planned a bit in advance. I started inquiring about positions in my favorite labs early on, and eventually arrived at two options: Tennessee or California. Given the then small chance of a Trump presidency, I thought that maybe it was better to pick a blue over a red state, just to be on the safe side. Alright then, the end of my PhD was in sight, my future position was secured, what\u2019s next?It may come as no surprise, but even as well as I had planned the transition from my PhD training to my new postdoc position, actually getting there was way more frustrating and nerve-wracking than I had anticipated. The peer review of our paper took longer than expected. Finding jury members and a defense date was more difficult than predicted. In the meantime, organizing a conference was extremely time-consuming (who would have guessed?), and the list goes on. My February defense was pushed off until May. But could I startapplying for my visa to work in the US? To start the application process, I needed my PhD diploma or an official document stating that my jury members have approved the manuscript. Given some delay in the feedback from the jury members, I received that \u2018surrogate diploma\u2019 the week of my defense and was able to start the application in the last few days of my life as a PhD student. Ok, from now on things will go smoothly, right?First came the IT problems at my new alma mater: \u201cOur apologies, but we have to start the application process over because your form was lost in the system.\u201d Can you believe it? Since I had already defended my PhD, the surrogate diploma was no good anymore, which meant waiting on my official diploma. More waiting. Another setback. I was pretty desperate at that time, but luckily, things progressed more smoothly from then on. I received my visa a few weeks later. The moment it dropped into my mailbox, I booked my tickets to the US. Finally, after months of struggling, I could head out to my fresh green pasture.When I arrived here in the US and talked to other new postdocs, one thing immediately became clear: it\u2019s always a messy process. The international office confirmed this. The start dates of postdoc contracts mostly get postponed once or twice. Visa issues are the most common problem. When I found a room to rent a few weeks ago, I had to help the owner empty the room and load all the stuff into the car of my predecessor. She is a postdoc just like me, but couldn\u2019t move herself since she is still stuck in China due to problems with renewing her visa.I planned on starting experiments immediately once in the lab, but I was then confronted with all the paperwork involved with moving abroad. It seemed to never end. What had I started?I talked to my colleagues about it, and they reassured me. All of them had experienced the same problems and had to deal with the same frustrations as me. It just seems inherent to the process of starting a new life in another place. My fellow nomads dealt with the same obstacles and fought the same storm of paperwork, but eventually, all of them arrived at that fresh green pasture.It is then that I realized that it was just a phase I had to go through. I could not force things to go smoothly. Worrying about things would only get me more frustrated. For five years, you dedicate all your efforts to finishing a PhD in order to be able to move on to the next step. I was so eager to start my postdoc, so focused on the destination. Too focused. Even worse, I forgot to enjoy the journey. When I travel, I love being on the road. Whether I\u2019m backpacking, road tripping or hiking, I love to experience the journey. The destination is only half the fun. Why was I not doing this in my academic life? I had never thought of it before, but it became clear to me. I just finished my PhD. I am moving to a new country to start a new life. I am going to work in new, exciting environments. I should be proud of what I achieved. I should enjoy the new challenges, enjoy learning and experiencing all these new things!It is something that we as young postdocs don\u2019t always think about. We are often too focused on the annoying things associated with moving abroad, the uncertainties involved in life as science nomads. Sure, we need to think about these things from time to time, reexamine our approach, and reevaluate our options. But if there is one piece of advice I\u2019d like to give to all PhD students out there who are close to achieving their goals, about to pursue new goals or embarking on new career paths: don\u2019t forget to enjoy the moment, and although the road ahead might be bumpy, the journey is always half the fun.

I don\u2019t know, but this book is both! \ud83d\ude42 \nThe perspective of the story is told in a dual narrative, with Sofia and Kyle each narrating alternating chapters. The book opens with Sofia\u2019s narration and ends with Kyle\u2019s narration. I loved both of their inner voices. Sofia\u2019s was at times strong and confident, like in the beginning, and wavered and was doubting during times of turmoil. Kyle was very laid back and quite characteristic of a typical bachelor. A few hundred years earlier he would be called a rake. \nSofia is working hard toward her dream of working with sports teams by beefing up her resum\u00e9 while also running from her own haunting memories, so she takes up the ad offer for an overseas work-swap program from her university in Minnesota. She just didn\u2019t think she would wind up scrubbing toilets in Finland. \nMost of the book is set in Hilinski, Finland. Sofia\u2019s maternal grandmother resides there, and Sofia hasn\u2019t visited in a few years, so it winds up being a great opportunity for them to spend some time together again. Many times Sofia makes it clear she cannot speak the language and is Finnish illiterate. I didn\u2019t quite understand how that could be the case if she had visited every year as a child until she was in her late teens. She should at least know some basic phrases. That struck me as odd, but it was a plot-driven movement. While summering in Finland, Sofia\u2019s grandmother hatches a plan with the woman upstairs in her building. They plan to set up Sofia with her grandmother\u2019s friend\u2019s grandson, Joni. \nJoni looks exactly like a Finnish actor and is handsome. He buys into the grandmothers\u2019 scheming while Sofia does not. She has sworn off any relationships after her first and only. One heartbreak and she claims she is cursed. Puh-lease. *insert eyeroll* \nHowever, the guy from the sauna she nearly sprays in the junk keeps coming back to her mind. His body and his geekiness. Kyle is quite the physics nerd and a former NHL player. One of his former teammates is coaching a hockey program in Finland, so Kyle takes up an open position. Coaching is as close as he is ever going to get to his former hockey life after his injury that took his career and his wife. Since he has found a fleeting solace in alcohol and puck bunnies, although he suddenly skeptical of puck bunnies. \nKyle was clearly searching for his next everything from personal growth to job security to personal relationships. When his and Sofia\u2019s worlds collide \u2013 again, unbeknownst to either of them \u2013 Sofia convinces Kyle to play her fake boyfriend so she doesn\u2019t have to \u201cdate\u201d Joni. Although she still goes places with Joni alone that he believes are dates, as do both their grandmothers\u2026 \nEventually, Sofia and Kyle elevate their relationship, but not entirely. Kyle purposefully keeps his identity a secret from unsuspecting Sofia, which I thought was deceitful and was made into a big deal that when it does come to light, Sofia just glosses over it. \nJoni isn\u2019t ready to be thrown out of the ring for the boyfriend crown, so he plays his own masterfully manipulated role and wreaks havoc with Sofia. Even as friends, I thought this was so underhanded and I did not understand why Sofia continued to hang out with him and allow him into her life. She let him be all sweet and then sour on her. But on the flip side, he was nice to Sofia. The slippery slope of sneaky snakes. \nI feel like the only reason Joni was kept around was to act as a translator. The plot could have continued almost entirely without him\u2026except for the ill-fated wedding that is masterminded. Joni doesn\u2019t stop after the first incident. He artfully crafts this wedding guest trip that ends with more than Kyle freaking out in the sauna. \nRemember how I said their worlds had collided before? The entire end of the book revolves around this revelation that was mind-blowing. It sets Sofia\u2019s world spinning on its axis and leaves Kyle wondering why her non-part in the past matters. I could not wrap my head around why the revelation and Sofia\u2019s non-part in it \u2013 she was just connected to the person who did it \u2013 had her literally running across Finland to get away from Kyle and ignoring him. \nOverall, both characters need some therapy. They are still not done dealing with their ex\u2019s. For Kyle, I totally understand. For Sofia, though\u2026I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t get her motivations. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m at a more mature stage in my life? \nThe best part of the book was each character\u2019s inner dialogue and their growth. Kyle came to Finland looking to work a hockey camp when in reality he was looking for a way to heal. Sofia finds the footing she needs to move forward with her dream and her shuttered heart is given a stutter. \nStina Lindenblatt lives in Western Canada, where she loves to dream up New Adult and Young Adult stories, especially those with romance.

Britain is aiming to agree with the EU on Dec. 14 to move the Brexit talks on to the second phase. This would focus on trade and a two-year transition deal to smooth the departure after March 2019. But the timetable has been thrown into doubt after discussions broke down in Brussels on Monday. Senior executives in the financial services sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, told Reuters May's efforts to secure a transition deal had come too late and they had no choice but to start restructuring. Big supermarkets such as Tesco and Sainsbury's have been working with suppliers to identify potential delays, shortages or price rises. They have lined up alternative providers, according to suppliers and sources in the industry. The uncertainty is particularly painful for the manufacturing sector as low margins make it risky for them to restructure unless it is essential. They have been holding off on investment but are preparing for new certification that would allow them to sell in Europe if there is no deal. \"The delay is so great and the uncertainty is so great that companies have no choice but to start triggering their plans,\" the head of one of Britain's largest companies said. Paul Drechsler, the president of the blue-chip business lobby group the CBI, said businesses were now having to plan for the worst while hoping for the best. \"No company wants to move jobs or shift production \u2013 but business will if it has to,\" he said. \"There's no time to waste. In the immediate term, business needs to know the details of any transition deal \u2013 Rome is burning on that issue.\" Britain and the EU are working to get talks back on track this week but the chairman of one large international bank said its executives had decided to plan for the worst at a conference call on Tuesday. \"The question is no longer whether we are moving (operations to the EU), it is a question of how big those moves are?,\" he said. Like other executives, he had been asked by his board and the government not to divulge their thinking. FRUIT AND BEEF The chairman said the bank has started discussions with customers about rerouting client activity to European hubs, including rewriting thousands of contracts. Senior employees were told last month if they had to relocate to Europe, he said. Another senior executive at a large U.S. bank said that he was increasingly concerned that May's government could collapse after the Brussels talks broke down over a dispute about the Irish border, adding to the uncertainty. \"We are at the maximum point of danger,\" he said. The financial sector needs extra time to make sure its clients are prepared. For instance, a British bank opening a subsidiary in Europe may need its clients to adopt a new sort code throughout their own supply chains. In other sectors, companies are making smaller changes that would enable them to operate in Europe after Brexit, from preparing compliance changes to drawing up shadow supply chains and looking for additional warehouse space. Food retailers are lining up alternative suppliers in Britain or outside the EU in case delays at borders or new tariffs disrupt deliveries. Around 30 percent of Britain's food and drink comes from the EU. Some changes would need to be made early next year in time for the 2019 departure. Changing a fresh fruit supplier could require a lead time of a year, depending on the growing cycle. Ali Capper, a partner in Stocks Farm in Worcestershire, central England, and a chair of the Horticulture and Potatoes Board at the National Farmers Union, said there were signs retail customers were requesting more British produce. Ireland provides almost 70 percent of UK beef imports, or 270,000 tonnes a year. Were tariffs or border delays to make Irish beef less competitive, supermarkets could look further afield, for instance to Argentina. MANUFACTURING PRESSURE Many manufacturers are unwilling to sign off on new plans until they know how Britain will trade in the future. The drugs sector has been among the first to move to comply with EU regulations. GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca are preparing to set up new facilities in mainland Europe to test batches of drugs made in Britain and many firms are transferring UK product licences to continental offices. Autos and aerospace firms are focusing on certification. According to the aerospace and defence trade body, ADS, some companies are considering applying to the European Aviation Safety Agency for a status that would enable them to sell in the EU if Britain was no longer a member state. Japanese carmaker Honda, which builds around 8 percent of British cars at its plant in Swindon, is considering increasing its warehouse capacity in Britain and stock levels to counter any new border delays. Manufacturers reluctance to sign off on big plans has had a knock on effect on companies in the supply chain. \"The biggest impact we see is a general unwillingness to make investment and capacity decisions as result of the continued uncertainty,\" said Stephen Cheetham, owner of PK Engineering Ltd of Hereford, a supplier of components to the aerospace and scientific industries. \"We would expect continued paralysis and short-termism until a trade deal is finalized,\" he told Reuters. Having a transition deal will allow businesses to survive the two years after Brexit by allowing them to defer any big decisions until the final parameters of Brexit are worked out, said Andrew Bonfield, finance director of National Grid and chairman of the 100 Group of finance chiefs. \"It's about the avoidance of a cliff edge,\" he said.

now because policymakers want to make sure that the U.S. retains a position of authority and respect on the international stage. This move demeans those interests and undoes whatever progress has been made toward a two-state solution. We have not been respected for a long time. We've been the joke of the world for several decades at least and I think the last President did more damage to our image than any others did before him.\nWith that said, Trump said in his speech on the subject that after Congress passed the resolution recommending Jerusalem being recognized as Israel's capital, there has been two decades of waivers and delays to do anything substantive about it in the name of peace, yet no real progress has been made during that time. We've been in a holding pattern for years and the same conflict still rages. That said, Trump said he and the U.S. are not taking sides on borders or disputed territories and that he's going to continue to work with them on a lasting peace agreement. Recognizing what we've already done two years ago doesn't change that.\nQuote: :\nSo, the argument is, because it doesn't seem like it will get better, it should be made worse? Of course not. Trump doesn't think he's making things worse. He claims to be doing the obvious in recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel when all of it's important government agencies live there. Trump is pragmatic and doesn't like to do things on ceremony. It's why a lot of people voted for him.\nQuote: :\nThe argument I'm making is simple. Aside from political or religious dogma, there is no substantive reason to contravene standing U.S. policy, as well as the advice and policies of all of our international allies (except Israel) by recognizing Jerusalem OR moving the embassy from Tel Aviv. Like I said, I think this move is pragmatic. I also think it's a negotiating chip showing that we aren't going to turn our back on Israel when we ask them to cough up something for the sake of peace. Israel doesn't trust us and there's no reason for them to give anything away when the perception is that it won't be good enough. Israel gets something big and in return they do something big for Palestine.

View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171207005125/en/ \nRendering of CLT Logistics Center - Building 1 (Photo: Business Wire). \nThe project is the first phase of a larger plan to develop three modern distribution buildings on the site, which can accommodate nearly 220,000 sq. ft. of new industrial product. Phase I will be completed on a speculative basis and is anticipated for delivery by Spring 2018. The remaining buildings will be considered during the construction process. \n\u201cWhen we purchased the CLT Logistics Center in 2016, we always planned on developing the adjacent land site,\u201d says Matt Wagner, director of acquisitions at Meritex. \u201cWe have a long-term interest in expanding our presence in Charlotte, so we immediately began to assess the feasibility of developing three modern distribution buildings.\u201d \nMeritex first entered the Charlotte market in mid-2016 with the $46.3 million acquisition of the 11 building, 583,021 square foot, Class A property known as CLT Logistics Center. The complex contains more than 40 local, national and international tenants with a wide range of suite sizes from 1,500 sq. ft. to 40,000 sq. ft. The initial purchase also included the 14 acres of available land which is now being developed. \nOver the long-term, Meritex anticipates the area near the development will continue to see strong tenant and user demand due to its attractive location near Charlotte Douglas International Airport, intermodal, I-485, I-77 and I-85. \n\u201cWith favorable property fundamentals and increasing demand from small- to mid-sized users, we feel the development will be well-received in the market,\u201d says Wagner. \u201cWe also believe the modern design and features of the new buildings are highly sought after by the growing companies in the area.\u201d \nMeritex has selected Foundry Commercial as the listing agent and property manager for the project. \nEric Ridlehoover, managing director and principal at Foundry Commercial, says, \u201cWith overall market vacancy rates around 4 percent, and with the steady leasing velocity in both the overall market and airport submarket, the new building delivery couldn\u2019t come at a better time.\u201d \nAbout The Meritex Company \nThe Meritex Company is a 101-year-old, family owned real estate investment company focused on leasing light industrial space to tenants in eight markets -- Atlanta, Charlotte, Columbus, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Phoenix. The company strategically acquires, develops, and manages approximately 10 million square feet of institutional grade, multi-tenant space made up of more than 90 properties, ensuring that each space is capable of meeting the demands of a dynamic tenant base. The Meritex Company is headquartered in Minneapolis. \n\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171207005125/en/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wagner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt wagner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meritex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric ridlehoover", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "meritex", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "acre land parcel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "foundry commercial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clt logistics center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meritex company  the meritex company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meritex company", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "charlotte douglas international airport phase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minneapolis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte douglas international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indianapolis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:18.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6f16b7944b14a256f3a893e0619d4cb11e72cbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRaEnIPSK0WU.5lWTZO2_cFGPdDEBjmsjmONwLaIMi4Rn2LxjQO0FDAS2hUUAVYGXQh_Mfo1Ejl_sZxZXB9xbIuJYSLX_c4UmyGIjZFkx6wynOfeIFwAJZAdti1BmL4mUo-", "site_full": "mylittlecraftblog.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://mylittlecraftblog.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "25 Days of Christmas Crafting \u2013 Day 7 \u2013 Gingerbread \u2013 My Little Craft Blog", "title": "25 Days of Christmas Crafting \u2013 Day 7 \u2013 Gingerbread", "title_full": "25 Days of Christmas Crafting \u2013 Day 7 \u2013 Gingerbread", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e6f16b7944b14a256f3a893e0619d4cb11e72cbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRaEnIPSK0WU.5lWTZO2_cFGPdDEBjmsjmONwLaIMi4Rn2LxjQO0FDAS2hUUAVYGXQh_Mfo1Ejl_sZxZXB9xbIuJYSLX_c4UmyGIjZFkx6wynOfeIFwAJZAdti1BmL4mUo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Evelyn", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "25 Days of Christmas Crafting \u2013 Day 7 \u2013 Gingerbread", "text": "Yum, yum, yum!

Indicate in the relevant section whether the issuer is a non UK issuer. \nOther reason for the notification could be voluntary notifications, changes of attribution of the nature of the holding (e.g. expiring of financial instruments) or acting in concert. \nThis should be the full name of (a) the shareholder; (b) the natural person or legal entity acquiring, disposing of or exercising voting rights in the cases provided for in DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h)/ Article 10 (b) to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC; (c) all parties to the agreement referred to in Article 10 (a) of Directive 2004/109/EC (DTR5.2.1 (a)) or (d) the holder of financial instruments referred to in Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC (DTR5.3.1). \nAs the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert. \nIn relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC (DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h)), the following list is provided as indication of the persons who should be mentioned: \n- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (b)), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring temporarily for consideration the voting rights; \n- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (c)), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions; \n- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (d) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (d)), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that person or entity is entitled to exercise the voting rights attached to the shares and the natural person or legal entity who is disposing of the voting rights when the life interest is created; \n- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (e)), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification duty at an individual level under Article 9 (DTR 5.1), under letters (a) to (d) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (a) to (d)) or under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking; \n- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (f)), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion; \n- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (g)), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights; \n- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (h)), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights at his discretion (e.g. management companies). \nApplicable in the cases provided for in Article 10 (b) to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC (DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with national practices (e.g. identification of funds managed by management companies). \nThe date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the date when the corporate event took effect. \nThe total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is suspended. \nIf the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with national law, please note that it might not be necessary in accordance with national law to disclose the extent of the holding, only that the new holding is below that threshold. \nIn case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached 'direct holding' and voting rights 'indirect holding', please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank. \nDate of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares ends. \nIf the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once every 3 months starting from [date]. \nIn case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Article 13(1a) of Directive 2004/109/EC) (DTR 5.3.3.A). \nIf the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control another undertaking then the second option applies. \nThe full chain of controlled undertakings starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or legal entity has to be presented also in the cases, in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification as only thus the markets get always the full picture of the group holdings. In case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.). \nThe names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held have to be presented irrespectively whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves. \nExample: Correction of a previous notification. \nCustodian REIT plc published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:56:10 UTC . \nOriginal document http://irpages2.equitystory.com/websites/rns_news/English/1100/news-tool---rns---eqs-group.html?article=26796575&company=custodianreit \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/267EB2C41A851BB37E588B915555FF62AC08D1B2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mattioli woods", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "custodian reit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "societe generale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leicester", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:18.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f5e80d2b73554cad57417b4761233c700ce1c04", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodeiFJ9yacUqrPnVlst38w3RDCe.JlHLajSret8RbYIr_PWRJwWThMt3rvn9a98qFfiD1Fz1krOdgm_8Xm1SdoaY-", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/politics/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Political Talk | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Heretic Pope opposes Jerusalem move | Page 4", "title_full": "Heretic Pope opposes Jerusalem move | Page 4 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T05:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "00f6bfe0d77002d73fdf98020b21398fc1e86a87", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodeiFJ9yacUqrPnVlst38w3RDCe.JlHLajSret8RbYIr_PWRJwWThMt3rvn9a98qFfiD1Fz1krOdgkBH5byOf5BI-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "RobbBobb", "published": "2017-12-07T06:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: :\nAlso, it's interesting that so many poli-board posters are pro-Jerusalem recognition.

Further, regardless of ideology, elected representatives are duty bound to represent the interests of ALL of their constituents. I'm of the opinion that our representatives--as all public figures--should be pictures of the best of us. I believe that they should be Christians and give God glory in all things and do all that they do ultimately for the glory of God, in subjugation to Christ as King, for the benefit and well-being of all of humanity.\n...but I'm obviously a little different than most in this regard.\nUnfortunately our society has devolved into every manner of debauchery and licentiousness, seeking pleasure, comfort, and recreation above all else and consequently has become atheistic, either in belief or in practice, and therefore deserves representatives who are like them in this regard. We push pornography and treating other humans made in the image of God as objects to be used for our own gratification and then get upset when public figures do the same? Why do we hold our representatives to higher standards than we hold ourselves? What's good for the goose is good for the gander, after all.\nNot to mention we've had representatives like Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton for as long as this Republic has stood. One party has tolerated if not extolled their behavior (at least in recent history) while the other has shunned it, only to be caught doing those very things and having that higher standard used as a gallows for hanging.\nThe truth is that we should hold our representatives to a higher standard but we should also understand that they are just as human as you and me. We should expect more but we should also be forgiving as we would like to be forgiven. They are politicians, not priests, after all. Those who do act morally (Pence, for example) are ridiculed for it, and they are targeted to make sure all of their faults are put under a microscope to show the world that they are actually hypocrites (as if any of us aren't).\nQuote: :\nTell me, do you honestly believe that a man who is uninterested in the sexual autonomy of women and young girls be fit to represent their interests? Of course not, but we have to examine a person based on who they are and what they do , not on who they were and what they've done in the past (to a point, at least). It always strikes me as odd during elections that both sides point out what the other person has said and done 20, 30, or 40 years ago as if that is representative of who they are today. Show me what they said last year, not 20 years ago. Show me what their positions are today, not what they were in college. We all grow and change and (hopefully) mature over time.\nWe also have to make sure that accusations are grounded in fact. We live in a political atmosphere that cares nothing for the truth. Whatever wins the day is the motto that both parties are living and dying by. In that atmosphere, we have to be especially careful of accusations without facts because both sides have no qualms about lying to gain points and these men and women who aspire to be our representatives are still human beings with reputations; we should not murder those reputations any more than we should murder their bodies, yet politics is about character assassination and getting more dirt on the other guy than they get on you. Yet for some reason no one cares about that.\nQuote: :\nPut more simply, they want to trigger Armageddon. I suppose that's one way to look at it. Another way is to desire for Christ to return and take His people to Heaven as soon as possible. In a world full of suffering and sin, it can be desirable to want it all to go away as quickly as possible and be with God in paradise.\nOthers aren't focusing so much on that aspect as they are wanting others to be saved. In this case, those who hold to this eschatological view believe that the Jews are apart from God at this time but will be brought near to Him again at the end of days, ensuring their salvation. Not a bad motive at all, even if I think it's theologically incorrect.\nQuote: :\nDo Palestinians not also deserve the same respect? All people deserve respect for being made in the image of God, but I'm not talking about that. I think it's a noble aspiration to be willing to defend your people against the hatred and attacks of others. Israel as a nation has been dealing with that since the people were re-located after WWII. The Arab nations that surrounded Israel hated the idea of the Jews taking up residency there and thus Israel was attacked time and time again. Being surrounded and yet continually beating back attackers is inspiring.\nThe Palestinian people are also deserving of respect, but those among them who would be willing to kill innocents, including women and children, deserve no respect, and the same goes to those in Israel who would do the same.\nQuote: :\nAre \"tolerance,\" peace and nonviolence not central tenets of Christianity? They are, but there's a reason why I phrased it that way. Tolerance, peace, and nonviolence seem to be chanted by the world against Israel when they retaliate against strikes against their peoples, yet no such chants are aimed at the people of Palestine when they attack innocents in Jerusalem; it's always assumed that the Jews are evil and deserve it when they are attacked and are perpetrators of evil when they retaliate against violence committed against them. Neither side is righteous in this thing, but there's been a slant against Israel for a long, long time.\nQuote: :", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:18.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f62ea9f56a2d26cb35775d382756b42652b6d13e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jclO0PAYH6Vc3E1_8P0w2wC69zzzVih2bvNoPHq_rmywGRi1D9Vu2bn6g4dvTZjWuJNVbU.8tRS5vScNLcMxqHPVEODG6QPbJ6Qi4SOY7xvfw--", "site_full": "chineduayoka.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://chineduayoka.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Chinedu Ayoka's Blog", "title": "Police shoots Delta student, one other over N1000", "title_full": "Police shoots Delta student, one other over N1000", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f62ea9f56a2d26cb35775d382756b42652b6d13e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jclO0PAYH6Vc3E1_8P0w2wC69zzzVih2bvNoPHq_rmywGRi1D9Vu2bn6g4dvTZjWuJNVbU.8tRS5vScNLcMxqHPVEODG6QPbJ6Qi4SOY7xvfw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Chinedu Ayoka (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Police shoots Delta student, one other over N1000", "text": "A police officer in Delta state Sergeant Abua, is currently on the run after he allegedly shoot a student at the Delta State Polytechnic, Sofia Ogogo, and a civil servant, Victor Emeagwai, at a checkpoint. \n.\nPunch reports that the incident which happened on Sunday November 17, 2017 saw the victims in a Toyota Corolla, driven by an estate agent, Jerry Akinlabi. Ogogo and Emeagwai are Akinlabi's girlfriend and friend respectively. .\n.\nTheir car was stopped by 5 policemen including Abua, at a checkpoint along Igbuzo Market. One of the policemen, identified as Nwokolo, was said to have demanded money from Akinlabi and the driver told him that he did not have N200 to give him. .\n.\nNwokolo then reportedly demanded one of the N1,000 notes Jerry had on him. As Akinlabi drove off from the checkpoint, Abua reportedly shot at the car and bullets pierced the back of the vehicle, hitting Ogogo, who sat at the back seat. .\n.\nThe bullet also grazed the back of Emeagwai, who was at the passenger's seat. Akinlabi revealed that four cops, including the team leader, one ASP Akhabue, were detained by the police, while Abua evaded arrest. .\n.\nAkinlabi said he took the victims to a general hospital in Igbuzo, from where Ogogo was referred to the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba. He said he called a senior police officer at Asaba who notified the state Commissioner of Police of the incident. .\n.\nHe said, \"The CP and the DPO of the Igbozo Police Station came to the FMC and deposited N100,000, but I have spent much more than that. Meanwhile, the policeman who shot at us had gone to drop the gun at the station and fled. .\n.\nEmeagwai urged the police authorities not to sweep the case under the carpet, saying the policemen must be punished. The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Andrew Aniamaka, said the policemen would be brought to book if found culpable after investigation. http://ift.tt/2nZ7XFJ December 07, 2017 at 10:43AM Shared Via Chinedu Ayoka's Blog: Thank you for reading!
