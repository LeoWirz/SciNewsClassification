Jackson Lee has now been joined by her congressional colleague Al Green.. On several occasions since last spring, Green has called on the House to impeach President Trump, calling him \u201cunfit\u201d for office. Recently he cited that the president\u2019s decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey constituted an obstruction of justice. But on Wednesday he forced the House to vote on two articles of impeachment against the president. Green did not accuse Trump of obstruction of justice or of collusion with the Russians. Instead he accused Trump of high misdemeanors for associating with \u201cWhite Nationalism, Neo-Nazism and Hate\u201d and for \u201cInciting Hatred and Hostility.\u201d\u201cFriends, whether we like it or not,\u201d wrote Green, \u201cwe now have a bigot in the White House who incites hatred and hostility.\u201d The House immediately and overwhelmingly rejected Green\u2019s resolution with 364 votes to table it and 58 Democrats supporting it. When Green calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment, he is not speaking for a majority of Houstonians. He may not even be speaking for a majority of his congressional district constituents who keep reelecting him to office. But he\u2019s getting the attention he\u2019s been lacking while in the shadow of Jackson lee. It\u2019s too bad we cannot impeach Green! I wonder how people in other parts of the country are judging us when we repeatedly elect two such clowns \u2013 Jackson Lee and Green \u2013 to represent us in the U.S. Congress.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sheila jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheila jackson lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howie katz  big jolly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james comey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "houston green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:02.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77c959f6fd6afe5bee6d04809ddb10ff13252352", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8gtrG_INPyGttYsP.yCSf1XHVXhYXefTokEoI9Fo92Mo74gtRfwbPG4pxR3PBHJR.oSX64lmGY1g--", "site_full": "www.detailingworld.co.uk", "site": "detailingworld.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.detailingworld.co.uk/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=184", "site_categories": ["tennis", "sports"], "section_title": "The Motoring Zone - Detailing World", "title": "My classic car of the week, Ford Probe (1992-1997)", "title_full": "My classic car of the week, Ford Probe (1992-1997) - Detailing World", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 77279, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "942b93aa2a1d2e8d81a8130fb92fae0c155bb6ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8gtrG_INPyGttYsP.yCSf1XHVXhYXefTokEoI9Fo92Mo74gtRfwbPG4pxR3PBHJR9OHW.jD.Re.PwaNuYxiCr7", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "insanejim69", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Oh dear lord No !!!

We have a responsibility to take care of the men and women who served in uniform. This helps make good on the promise we made to our veterans,\u201d Boozman said. \nThe legislation incorporates provisions Boozman pushed for including: \nImproving the VA\u2019s third-party fee collection. This will help the VA recover its costs for providing non-service connected care at VA facilities and will help ensure that funding for VA healthcare remains available for veterans. Ensuring that community care providers who have already gone through extensive processes to care for veterans can continue to do so without undergoing duplicative procedures to participate in the new program. Allowing industry partners to perform certain VA functions, like the processing of claims for community healthcare, so that the VA can better focus it\u2019s time and resources on providing healthcare to veterans. Allowing veterans who seek care in the community and are prescribed medications to fill initial, short-term prescriptions without requiring the veteran to go to a VA facility. \nThe Caring for Our Veterans Act of 2017 as amended was passed 14-1 by the committee. The legislation now goes to the full Senate for a vote. \nThe legislation is supported by The American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Military Officers Association of America, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars and Wounded Warrior Project.

Kenya's Attorney General Githu Muigai speaks during a press conference in Nairobi, Kenya September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Baz Ratner Such an inauguration would worsen the rifts opened by an acrimonious election season, when more than 70 people died in political violence. The extended campaigns eventually led to President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s re-election. Attorney General Githu Muigai did not name anyone, but opposition leader Raila Odinga said last month that he would be inaugurated by a people\u2019s assembly on Dec. 12 - Kenya\u2019s Independence Day. Unless a candidate was declared the victor in an election by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and the swearing-in was conducted by the Kenyan chief justice, Muigai told a news conference, such a inauguration is \u201ca process wholly unanticipated by the constitution and is null and void\u201d. \u201cThe criminal law of the Republic of Kenya stipulates that sort of process is high treason,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is high treason of the persons involved, and any other person facilitating that process.\u201d Under Kenyan law, treason is punishable by death. Muigai said people\u2019s assemblies proposed by the National Super Alliance, Odinga\u2019s opposition coalition, were illegal as well. \u201cThese institutions are unconstitutional they are illegal, they are null and void. The persons involved in their creation are involved in extra-constitutional activity and may be visited by the full force of the law,\u201d he said. So far, 12 Kenyan counties have passed motions supporting the formation of a people\u2019s assembly, most of them counties that had backed the opposition in Kenya\u2019s protracted voting. Odinga and Kenyatta faced off in an election in August that Kenyatta won. But the Supreme Court nullified the result, and a repeat election was held on Oct. 26. Odinga boycotted that vote, saying reforms needed to avoid \u201cillegalities and irregularities\u201d had not been made. Kenyatta won again, with 98 percent of the vote. The United States had urged opposition leaders to work within the law and avoid actions like the proposed \u201cinauguration ceremony\u201d, a statement from the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi said on Wednesday, following a visit to Kenya by Donald Yamamoto, the acting assistant secretary of state for African affairs. Without directly mentioning the ceremony or the United States, Odinga said on Thursday that Kenyans should be left to solve their own problems. \u201cOur friends can give us advice ... in privacy.

In addition, it must build, test and deploy solutions constantly. To streamline this process, Tricentis APAC has partnered with Spectar Group to deliver an SAP S/4HANA accelerator package to help customers to fast track their test automation efforts and remove expensive technology barriers that have prevented them from using extensive test automation in the past. With little customization effort, customers can add their own business data and adjust individually automated test sequences. Tricentis APAC Co-MDs Dominik Weisboeck and Thomas Hadorn said, \"We are very proud of this new product. This pioneering, value added offering is a first in the SAP S/4HANA testing space. Currently Tricentis Tosca provides test automation capabilities from a business perspective, there is no need for programming experience.

These applications have been fully automated and serve as automation templates for any S/4HANA project. \"With the SAP S/4HANA Accelerator Packages, large SAP customers can now automate test cases that are able to deliver 80% and more business risk coverage for their business scenarios within a short period of time,\" said Vikas Jha, Managing Partner, Spectar. \"Tricentis has been a leader in the continuous testing sphere for a number of years.

southern California A wildfire threatens homes as it burns in Ventura (Jae C Hong/AP) 0 comments \nA dramatic new wildfire has erupted in Los Angeles as firefighters battle three other destructive blazes across southern California. \nFlames exploded before dawn on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, which carries the busy Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains, where ridge tops are covered with expensive homes. \nFirefighters were providing structure protection as helicopters flying in darkness made water drops on the flames on the east side of the pass. \nHundreds of homes burned in the area during the famous Bel Air Fire of 1961. \nThe Getty Centre art complex, on the west side of the pass, employs extensive fire protection methods. \nElsewhere, use of firefighting aircraft has been constrained by the same winds that have spread the fires. \nThe water-dropping planes and helicopters essential to taming and containing wildfires have been mostly grounded because it is too dangerous to fly them in the strong wind. \nTuesday saw gusts of more than 50mph. A truck drives along the 101 Freeway in Ventura through flames (AP) \nCommanders hoped to have them back in the air on Wednesday, but all indications were that the winds will be whipping then too, fanning the flames that spurred evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people, destroyed nearly 200 homes and remained mostly out of control. \n\u201cThe prospects for containment are not good,\u201d Ventura County fire chief Mark Lorenzen said. \u201cReally, Mother Nature\u2019s going to decide when we have the ability to put it out.\u201d \nSouthern California\u2019s Santa Ana winds have long contributed to some of the region\u2019s most disastrous wildfires. \nThey blow from the inland towards the Pacific Ocean, speeding up as they squeeze through mountain passes and canyons. \n\u2014 Ventura County Fire (@VCFD) December 6, 2017 \nThe largest and most destructive of the fires, an 85-square mile wildfire in Ventura County north-west of Los Angeles, had nearly reached the Pacific on Tuesday night after starting 30 miles inland a day earlier. \nThe wildfire jumped the major artery US Highway 101 to a rocky beach north-west of Ventura, bringing new evacuations, though officials said the sparse population and lack of vegetation in the area meant it was not overly dangerous. \nThe fire had destroyed at least 150 structures, but incident commander Todd Derum said he suspects hundreds more homes have already been lost, though firefighters have been unable to assess them. \nWhile the blazes brought echoes of the firestorm in northern California that killed 44 people two months ago, no deaths and only a handful of injuries had been reported. In the foothills of northern Los Angeles, 30 structures burned. \nMayor Eric Garcetti said the gusty winds expected to last most of the week had created a dangerous situation and he urged 150,000 people under mandatory evacuation orders to leave their homes before it is too late. \n\u201cWe have lost structures, we have not lost lives,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not wait. Leave your homes.\u201d \nFires are not typical in southern California this time of year but can break out when dry vegetation and too little rain combine with the Santa Ana winds.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric garcetti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark lorenzen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd derum", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "101 freeway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us highway 101", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sepulveda pass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa monica mountains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:04.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07ac5ba450babb042af53231e9f27e16e6eb43f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS8i1SiyS5eu6ptADoBkOrUZ2RX0vKqewTqAqx_7w7xn.wBLW4OroJ6dII0KML_yANyWv8jiT1GWJ6PGtPzjeW8ANXBtcXni1XYwARmUZVYl5sOKx4sUlGCfSzNTZTqaGVUDm3wNtp13ieX9_3Dr08mWF9uAfj0Hqc-", "site_full": "www.corvetteforum.com", "site": "corvetteforum.com", "site_section": "https://www.corvetteforum.com/forums/c7-parts-for-sale-wanted-162/", "site_categories": ["auto_racing", "sports"], "section_title": "C7 Parts for Sale/Wanted - CorvetteForum - Chevrolet Corvette Forum Discussion", "title": "FS (For Sale) Michelin PSS for Z51- like new under 100 miles", "title_full": "FS (For Sale) Michelin PSS for Z51- like new under 100 miles - CorvetteForum - Chevrolet Corvette Forum Discussion", "published": "2017-12-06T11:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.041, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 24374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07ac5ba450babb042af53231e9f27e16e6eb43f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS8i1SiyS5eu6ptADoBkOrUZ2RX0vKqewTqAqx_7w7xn.wBLW4OroJ6dII0KML_yANyWv8jiT1GWJ6PGtPzjeW8ANXBtcXni1XYwARmUZVYl5sOKx4sUlGCfSzNTZTqaGVUDm3wNtp13ieX9_3Dr08mWF9uAfj0Hqc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jmcdude", "published": "2017-12-06T11:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "FS (For Sale) Michelin PSS for Z51- like new under 100 miles", "text": "How about $500 and I will pay for the shipping.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:04.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7d75a7de5a7870d8b7f0a1311dcb6b8eaa7a2550", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_UXDMvUJZM5T_MBKJ2KpCzXV0iKVXyRvN9uIM0TWLebrXbUfVrkS6IlRpu0zbff6ThFTWN15c9MkGTH0aIeGRRRpY60EK3zl0qmWFbAv6i38dryskYlZVB0nSB0i6nazfbW4W2mATnPbkJ5Jf78Y3G", "site_full": "www.jobmail.co.za", "site": "jobmail.co.za", "site_section": "http://m.jobmail.co.za/rss?_REGION=", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Job Mail RSS feed", "title": "Waiters And Waitresses", "title_full": "Waiters And Waitresses", "published": "2017-12-07T11:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.jobmail.co.za/baracuda/images/logo_small200x200.jpg?date=20171207112401", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18088, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d75a7de5a7870d8b7f0a1311dcb6b8eaa7a2550", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_UXDMvUJZM5T_MBKJ2KpCzXV0iKVXyRvN9uIM0TWLebrXbUfVrkS6IlRpu0zbff6ThFTWN15c9MkGTH0aIeGRRRpY60EK3zl0qmWFbAv6i38dryskYlZVB0nSB0i6nazfbW4W2mATnPbkJ5Jf78Y3G", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "Waiters And Waitresses", "text": "Region : Gauteng / Pretoria / Pretoria City Company : Italo \nWe are currently hiring Waiters & Waitresses, with or without experience, to be involved in our NEW Italian restaurant group.

Durations set to achieve the plans should be given maximum consideration given other components of competition and other existing firms.\n\nRaise adequate capital.

Waterborne coatings generally include around 80% of water with least amount of other solvents such as glycol ethers. Water borne coatings are presently available for various different applications such as wood coatings, furniture coatings, wood coatings, printing inks and plastic coatings. Waterborne coatings provide products with an individual and steady performance advantage. These coatings deliver a corrosion resistance with excellent fade resistance, strong color retention, and superior adhesion. They are fully compliant with all EPA regulations. They are non-hazardous, non-toxic, and non-flammable.\nBrowse detail report with in-depth TOC @ \nhttps://www.zionmarketresearch.com/report/waterborne-coatings-market \nThe global market for waterborne coatings is expected to grow at a significant rate due to growing demand from architectural applications. Strict government rules and regulations in order to decrease volatile organic compounds (VOC) releases coupled with solvent based coatings are likely to impel the market growth. Rising automobile industry in emerging countries such as India, China, Thailand, Indonesia, and Mexico is expected to prompt the demand for waterborne coatings within the forecast period. Furthermore, increasing demand from end-use industries such as wood, coil, marine, metal packaging, and electronics is expected to significantly increase demand in the forecast period. However, extreme foam formation during production, handling and transportation may hamper the market growth in near future. Increasing research and development investment to develop new production technology and proper use of anti-foaming agents is expected to open lucrative opportunities for the manufacturers operating in this market.\nGlobal waterborne coatings market has been segmented based on the basis of resin, application, and region. On the basis of resin, waterborne coatings market is classified into acrylic, polyester, alkyd, epoxy, polyurethane, PTFE, PVDF, PVDC and others. The acrylic segment accounted for largest share of the market in 2015 due to their low production cost. These types of resins are extensively used in automotive and architectural applications. Polyurethane resins segment is expected to exhibit considerable growth rate in the coming years due to its wide use in high-quality finishes in outdoor and indoor applications.\nRequest Free Sample copy of Research Report @ \nhttps://www.zionmarketresearch.com/sample/waterborne-coatings-market \n(Purchase Single User License at $4199) \nOn the basis of applications, waterborne coatings market is segmented into architectural, automotive, general industrial, protective, wood, marine, packaging, coil, and other applications. Architectural was the largest application segment in 2015 and is expected to maintain its dominance within the forecast period. The architectural application segment includes all lacquers and vanishes used to decorate & protect window frames, external & internal frames, and doors.\nThe market has been geographically segmented into Asia-Pacific, North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Middle-East and Africa. In 2015, Asia-Pacific region was the leading market for waterborne coatings. The countries such as India, China, and Japan are expected to lead the waterborne coatings market in the Asia Pacific owing to high demand from end-use industries. The demand for waterborne coatings is comparatively low in the Latin America and MEA region. The stringent regulations regarding VOC emission in the developing country in this region have considerably hindered the growth of this market.\nMake an Inquiry before Purchase @ \nhttps://www.zionmarketresearch.com/inuqiry/waterborne-coatings-market \nThe waterborne coatings market is highly competitive with the presence of many small and big key market players, such as BASF SE, AkzoNobel N.V., Axalata Coating System LLC, PPG Industries, The Valspar Corporation, Sherwin-Williams Company, and Nippon Paints Co.

The simultaneous battle resolution compared to the previous turn based one makes following a battle somewhat more chaotic, but also more realistic, frenetic, and fun.

All nice to have.\n3. The random map generator is genuinely good, able to make pretty and functional maps, compared to Dom4. There are only a couple ready custom maps included, so focus is very much on generated maps.\n4. A couple of new nations and tweaks to old ones. All good to have. Also, Morvarc'h Knights of Ys absolutely ruin enemies. Sacred amphibious heavy cavalry with fire breath? With a good bless, they'll be great.\n5. The bless system has been completely overhauled. Now you get points from 4+ points in your pretender's magic paths, that you use to buy bless effects. You can tailor your blesses to do exactly what you want/need.

The legislation passed with a majority that wasn't challenged, although five lawmakers registered their opposition to the bill. \nThe Senate passed the same legislation last week 43 votes to 12. After royal assent and other formalities, the law will likely take effect in about a month, with the first weddings expected about a month later. \nAmendments meant to safeguard freedoms of speech and religion for gay-marriage opponents were all rejected, though those issues may be considered later. The government has appointed a panel to examine how to safeguard religious freedoms once gay marriage is a reality in Australia. \nLawmakers advocating marriage equality had argued that the national postal survey in November mandated a change of the marriage definition alone, so changing the law should not be delayed by other considerations. \n\"It is now our job as members of Parliament to pass a fair bill that does not extend or create any new discriminations,\" an emotional government lawmaker Warren Entsch, who helped draft the bill, told Parliament. \"It is a strong bill that already strikes the right balance between equality and freedom of religion.\" \n\"It's an historic day for Australia today and I think the celebrations around the country when we finally ... achieve marriage equality are going to be immense,\" Janet Rice said before the vote. Rice is a minor Greens party senator who was only able to remain married to her transgender wife of 31 years, Penny, because Penny remained listed as male on her birth certificate. \nPenny Wong, an opposition Labor Party senator who has two children with her lesbian partner, said: \"I am feeling happy.\" \nGay marriage was endorsed by 62 percent of Australian voters who responded to the government-commissioned postal ballot. \nMost gay rights advocates believed the government should have allowed marriages years ago and saw various ideas for a public survey as a delaying tactic. The U.N. Human Rights Committee had called the ballot survey \"an unnecessary and divisive public opinion poll.\" \nThe current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws. \nOne of the rejected amendments would have ensured Australians could speak freely about their traditional views of marriage without fear of legal action. It was proposed by Attorney-General George Brandis and supported by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, both gay marriage supporters. \nFormer Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a high-profile advocate for traditional marriage, told Parliament that Turnbull and opposition leader Bill Shorten had failed to deliver detailed protections for freedoms of speech, conscience and religion in the bill. \n\"A promise was made by the leaders of this Parliament and the promise has not adequately been delivered on,\" Abbott said. \nAbbott pointed to an Australian teenager who lost her job for advocating against gay marriage on social media and an Australian Catholic bishop who was taken before a state anti-discrimination tribunal over a pamphlet he published extolling traditional marriage. The complaint against the bishop was dropped. \n\"The last thing we should want to do is to subject Australians to new forms of discrimination in place of old ones that are rightly gone,\" he said. \nGovernment lawmaker Trevor Evans ruled out an Australian equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court case in which a baker who refused to provide a wedding cake for a gay couple argued he was exercising artistic freedom and was exempt from Colorado anti-discrimination laws. \n\"Let's be honest here, for a case like that to arise in Australia, it would require a gay couple who care more about activism than about the success of their own wedding, to find a business operator who cares more about religious doctrine than the commercial success of their own small business, and for both of them to commit to having a fight,\" Evans told Parliament. \n\"Typical Australians would genuinely question the bona fides of the players in a case like that and the slim prospects of that occurring doesn't warrant the pages and pages of commentary and debate that have been dedicated to it,\" he added. \nSeveral gay marriage opponents in Turnbull's conservative coalition have regarded marriage equality as inevitable and have welcomed an end to an issue that has long divided the government ranks. \nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann, a same-sex marriage opponent who oversaw the postal ballot, said he felt \"great satisfaction\" that the issue was resolved. \n\"It was a polarizing issue on which good Australians had strongly and sincerely held views on both sides of the argument,\" Cormann said. \n\"I and my colleagues on the coalition side always took the view that the best way to resolve a disagreement in the community like this is by giving the Australian people which we did, we kept faith with it, the Australian people embraced the process and the result was emphatic,\" he said. \nThe result is a political win for Turnbull, who became prime minister after deposing Abbott in 2015 in an internal government leadership ballot. \nAbbott was head-butted by a gay rights advocate during the postal survey campaign in September. Kevin Rudd, a center-left Labor Party prime minister whom Abbott defeated in elections in 2013, blamed the postal ballot for an assault on his godson Sean Foster, 19, as he campaigned for marriage equality a week earlier. \nVeteran gay rights campaigner Rodney Croome said he expected the first same-sex weddings in Australia would not take place until February. \nThe law will likely take effect after a month. State laws then require couples to give 28 days' notice of their intention to marry, Croome said. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I've taken so many gorgeous photos since, but they sadly never leave my memory card half the time. However we've started the process of revamping our house, ready to put it up for sale in 2019, so this is pushing me into updating the finer details!\n\nCheerz do a huge range of products to display your photos, from the standard photo frames ,  canvas'  to heart magnets , calendars , and even  cute little boxes full of Polaroid style photos, which would be a great addition to your coffee table for your guests to browse, instead of heaving chunky photo albums out of the cupboard!\n\nI opted for the 20x20cm photo frame , which frame could be selected in either black or white, and popped one of my favourite photos of Mike and I in from our holiday in Florida last Christmas. We did a 3 week stint in America, starting in New York, then flying to Florida for some Disney fun, then ended the trip with 4 days in Clearwater, staying in a luxurious hotel on the beach. This photo was taken on our last night there and I love it! So much so that I also have this photo on my desk at work!\n\n\nThe thickness of the frame means that it can stand alone on a surface, but it does have the hooks to hang on a wall too. Because of the size of it, I think it will look best on some tall white chest of drawers that we will be purchasing in the new year. Because of the size they're pretty versatile, and I think it would look just as good being added to a wall collage too.\n\n\nCheerz having currently got a  Christmas themed selection of products which are great for the more personalised gifts. I'm loving t heir Christmas Album, which holds up to 250 photos! This would be perfect to showcase a Christmas wedding I think!  \n\n\n\nIf your still trying to make your way through your christmas shopping list then why not browse Cheerz for some inspiration?

(AP Photo/Danny Moloshok) \nBy Rishi Iyengar \nNEW DELHI (CNNMoney) -- Google is going on a hiring spree to try to stamp out offensive videos and comments on YouTube. \nThe company is recruiting thousands of reviewers to reduce the amount of \"problematic content\" on its video platform. It's also introducing tougher restrictions on advertising and making greater use of smart technology. \nBy 2018, Google aims to have more than 10,000 people \"working to address content that might violate our policies,\" YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in a blog post. She did not say how many people currently monitor YouTube for offensive videos. \n\"Some bad actors are exploiting our openness to mislead, manipulate, harass or even harm,\" Wojcicki said, adding that YouTube's trust and safety teams have reviewed nearly 2 million videos for violent extremist content over the past six months. \n\"We are also taking aggressive action on comments, launching new comment moderation tools and in some cases shutting down comments altogether,\" she said. \nYouTube has grappled with a series of controversies this year concerning videos available on its platform. It was forced to adopt additional screening measures last month on its kid-friendly platform, YouTube Kids, after reports showed many of the videos there contained profanity and violence. \nCompanies such as Etihad Airways, Marriott and Deliveroo pulled their advertisements in June -- as did the U.K.'s Labour Party -- after finding they were appearing alongside videos made by a hate preacher. \nWojcicki said YouTube was taking a \"new approach to advertising,\" with more manual curation, stricter criteria for videos eligible to show ads, and a greater number of ad reviewers. \n\"We want advertisers to have peace of mind that their ads are running alongside content that reflects their brand's values,\" she said. \"Equally, we want to give creators confidence that their revenue won't be hurt by the actions of bad actors.\" \nThe company isn't just banking on more human intervention, however. Its machine learning algorithms have helped remove more than 150,000 videos from YouTube since June that depict violent extremism. \nWojcicki said 180,000 people would have had to work 40 weeks to assess the same amount of content. \n\"Because we have seen these positive results, we have begun training machine-learning technology across other challenging content areas, including child safety and hate speech,\" she added. \nWhile most of the new hires are content reviewers, Google is also recruiting for related jobs, including engineers and policy specialists to work on refining its machine learning technology. \nTM &\u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
