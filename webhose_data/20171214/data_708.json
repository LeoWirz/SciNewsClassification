At this interim analysis after a median of 17 weeks of treatment, Hemlibra prophylaxis showed a clinically meaningful control of bleeding. These results are consistent with previous studies of Hemlibra dosed once weekly or every two weeks, including the pivotal studies in haemophilia A with inhibitors, HAVEN 1 in adults and adolescents and HAVEN 2 in children, as well as the phase III HAVEN 3 study in adults and adolescents with haemophilia A without inhibitors. The most common adverse events with Hemlibra were injection site reactions, with no new safety signals observed. No thrombotic microangiopathy or thrombotic events occurred in this study. \n\u201c Current treatment regimens for haemophilia A can require frequent intravenous infusions. We are encouraged that Hemlibra prophylaxis administered by injection under the skin once every four weeks showed clinically meaningful bleed control in people with haemophilia A, \u201d said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche\u2019s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. \u201cTogether with the findings from other phase III studies, these interim results support the potential for Hemlibra to be dosed at different schedules, allowing patients to choose the option that\u2019s right for them.\u201d \nData from the HAVEN 4 study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to health authorities around the world for approval consideration. These results add to the growing body of evidence supporting that Hemlibra may benefit all people with haemophilia A regardless of inhibitor status, while providing flexible and less burdensome administration options. About HAVEN 4 (NCT03020160) \nHAVEN 4 is a single-arm, multicentre, open-label, phase III study evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of subcutaneous administration of Hemlibra dosed every four weeks. The study included 48 patients (12 years of age or older) with haemophilia A with or without inhibitors to factor VIII who were previously treated with either factor VIII or bypassing agents, on-demand or as prophylaxis. The study was conducted in two parts: a PK run-in; and an expansion cohort. All patients in the PK run-in (n=7) were previously treated on-demand, and received subcutaneous Hemlibra at 6 mg/kg to fully characterize the PK profile after a single dose during four weeks, followed by 6 mg/kg every four weeks for at least 24 weeks. Patients in the expansion cohort (n= 41) received subcutaneous Hemlibra prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg/wk for four weeks, followed by 6 mg/kg every four weeks for at least 24 weeks. Episodic treatment of breakthrough bleeds with factor VIII therapy or bypassing agents, depending on a patient\u2019s inhibitor status, was allowed per study protocol. About Hemlibra (emicizumab) \nHemlibra is a bispecific factor IXa- and factor X-directed antibody. It is designed to bring together factor IXa and factor X, proteins required to activate the natural coagulation cascade and restore the blood clotting process for haemophilia A patients. Hemlibra is a prophylactic (preventative) treatment that can be administered by an injection of a ready-to-use solution under the skin (subcutaneously). The clinical development programme is assessing the safety and efficacy of Hemlibra and its potential to help overcome current clinical challenges: the short-lasting effects of existing treatments, the development of factor VIII inhibitors and the need for frequent venous access. Hemlibra was created by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and is being co-developed by Chugai, Roche and Genentech. It is marketed in the United States as Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh) for patients with factor VIII inhibitors, with kxwh as the suffix designated in compliance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the US Food and Drug Administration. About haemophilia A \nHaemophilia A is an inherited, serious disorder in which a person\u2019s blood does not clot properly, leading to uncontrolled and often spontaneous bleeding. Haemophilia A affects around 320,000 people worldwide, 1,2 \napproximately 50-60% of whom have a severe form of the disorder. 3 People with haemophilia A either lack or do not have enough of a clotting protein called factor VIII. In a healthy person, when a bleed occurs, factor VIII brings together the clotting factors IXa and X, which is a critical step in the formation of a blood clot to help stop bleeding. \nDepending on the severity of their disorder, people with haemophilia A can bleed frequently, especially into their joints or muscles. 1 These bleeds can present a significant health concern as they often cause pain and can lead to chronic swelling, deformity, reduced mobility, and long-term joint damage. 4 In addition to impacting a person\u2019s quality of life, 5 these bleeds can be life threatening if they go into vital organs, such as the brain. 6,7 About Roche in haematology \nFor more than 20 years, Roche has been developing medicines that redefine treatment in haematology.

So I started solving this manually by hand on paper. Tried to find the solution for 35, then 39 and so on. While doing this I observed myself of how I am solving the problem. After doing it for 3-4 numbers I was able to find a pattern. So now, I had an idea to write a program for it.\nEvery odd composite number can be represented in the form :\nOdd_Composite_Number = Prime_Number + (2 X (Some_Number)^2)\nSo basically, the logic is we start our numbers from 35, since till 33 we already know that it is not the answer as given in the question. We first need to check if a number is a composite number. How do we check that? We already have a function which checks if a number is prime. If the number is prime then we just increase the count by 2 and move on to the next number. Now if a number is odd composite then we get all the primes under that number as the prime number component can be any number lesser than the current number. Now Some_Number component can be any number from 1. We just check that the complete sum doesn\u2019t cross the current number we are checking. If it does, then we stop execution and move on to the next iteration.\nget_answer_for_problem46_v2 <- function() { start_num <- 33 flag = TRUE while(flag) { start_num = start_num + 2 if(is_prime(start_num)) next else { flag = FALSE primes <- get_primes_under_n(start_num - 2) square_number = 1 for (i in primes) { for (square_number in seq(start_num)) { current_sum = i + (2 * (square_number^2)) if (current_sum > start_num) break else if (current_sum == start_num) { cat(start_num, \"=\", i, \"+ 2 X\", square_number, \"^2\\n\") flag = TRUE break } } if(flag) break } if(!flag) cat(\"The answer is : \", start_num, \"\\n\") } } } \nThe outer while loop runs until you find an odd composite number which cannot be represented in the format given in the question i.e till the time you find an answer. If the number is a prime number, then we skip that iteration from there itself. If it is not prime, then we get all the primes under that number and run two for loops from there. First loop iterates over each prime number and the other loop for each number from 1 till the sum doesn\u2019t exceed the current number. Certain numbers can be represented in multiple ways. For example, number 69\u2026\n69 = 19 + 2 X 5 ^2 69 = 37 + 2 X 4 ^2 69 = 61 + 2 X 2 ^2 69 = 67 + 2 X 1 ^2 \nWe do not need to know all the possible ways, it can represent a number. Even if it can represent in one way then that is enough for us to move ahead with next statement. Added some break statements so that we can stop the loop as soon as it encounters even one representation. I received a huge performance improvement when I did that.\nsystem.time(get_answer_for_problem46_v1()) # user system elapsed # 193.71 1.00 197.95 system.time(get_answer_for_problem46_v2()) #user system elapsed #75.73 0.27 77.06 \nAlso the code which I have written is a bit complicated and mind you it wasn\u2019t written in one go.

But are these reasons valid? I've heard that this rivalry between the two nations seems to have been caused by some personal disagreements between the ambassadors.\"\n\"Quite right. And the reasons are completely falsified. The real story, from what I saw, was the newbie ambassador from PR2017 made many drafts that he appeared to abandon and left. When other ambassadors arrived, they left their own comments, which caused a mess in the Hall. Eventually, Fris had to lock it, but not without stating the truth, which was the fact that, in the words of Fris, was \"a hit-and-run poster who doesn't return to these 'drafting' threads.\" Of course, they've been blowing the horn of \"lies and libel\" and are now foolishly declaring war on a powerful nation that I suspect to have some powers of a deity.\"\nThe President sat next to the Emperor for several seconds, seemingly frozen in thought. Eventually, he replies, starting with:\n\"Well, tell the Imperia Congressum that we won't support this idiotic nonsense. That nation may be a democracy, but it's a foolish one I'm not going to be wasting my time with.\"\n\"I quite agree. Orange?\"\nOOC: Listen, I know you may be mad at what you see is an injustice.

The kids are asleep in their own beds. It seems the stars have finally aligned and my husband and I are getting that rare window of opportunity that can only mean one thing: It\u2019s time to get down to business . And by \u201cget down to business,\u201d I mean \u201chave the sex we usually don\u2019t get to have because kids are pro-level cockblockers.\u201d \nHe\u2019s all for it, of course, because I swear the man can get a boner if a stiff wind blows (no pun intended). He doesn\u2019t care if I\u2019m wearing sweatpants that could fit a 300-pound man, or if I\u2019m on day two without a shower. And though I know I need to be ready too \u2013 that this is our chance and we need to jump on it (literally) \u2013 it doesn\u2019t come that easily to me. Because after spending the vast majority of my time in \u201cMommy Mode,\u201d there\u2019s just no quick way to transition into the lustful creature that I, too, could once summon at a moment\u2019s notice. \nKeyword, once . Like, before I was draped with maternal worries about the necessary (pediatrician appointments, orthodontist bills, packing lunches) and the unnecessary (is my kid developing at the same rate as the rest of his peers or is he going to be unemployed living in our basement when he\u2019s thirty OMG THE PRESSURE!). \nI wasn\u2019t always this way, but when I\u2019m constantly operating under the oppressive mental load of keeping a family and household in smooth working order, it can make for a less-than-eager beaver. \nI admit it \u2013 deep down, I\u2019m jealous of the way my husband can just be automatically into it, he and his perennial instaboner. Like the captain of the high school cheer team, it\u2019s ready to pop up and spring enthusiastically into action at a moment\u2019s notice. But as much as I admire his perpetual readiness, it\u2019s a skill I just don\u2019t possess. Because while his equipment is an instantaneous go-getter, my vagina\u2019s over here dry as a load of laundry fresh from the tumble cycle \u2026 which reminds me \u2026 did I wash my third-grader\u2019s basketball jersey? He\u2019s got a game tomorrow evening. Oh shit, there\u2019s also a Scout meeting. Can I make it to both? Maybe if I put dinner in the slow cooker tomorrow morning. What can I make without having to go to the grocery store again? Didn\u2019t I pin a new recipe a few days ago? Ugh, I totally need an Instant Pot. \nThink sexy thoughts , I tell myself firmly (ironically, the voice in my head sounds a lot like the one I use to say \u201cdo your homework\u201d or \u201cput on your shoes\u201d). And I try. But my brain, falling back to its default momming capacity, starts clamoring to decidedly un-sexy things like, \u201cYEAH THAT\u2019S HOT BUT LET\u2019S THINK ABOUT THAWING SOME CHICKEN.\u201d Like it\u2019s afraid that if let my thoughts wander to other things, I\u2019m going to revert permanently back to my carefree pre-child self and neglect my motherly duties. \nI\u2019ve consulted Google, and I\u2019ve tried the expert advice. Carve out plenty of extra time for hugging, kissing, and touching , they say. And while increasing foreplay is a great idea in theory, it\u2019s hard to squeeze in more when you never know how much uninterrupted time you\u2019re going to get in the first place. Plus, that\u2019s just more time I have to spend redirecting my mind \u2013 like mentally herding sheep \u2013 and it\u2019s exhausting. \nMake a plan for sex , they suggest. Again, a fine idea in theory, but in reality it makes it feel like just one more thing I have to finagle into my already-packed schedule. Plus, as anybody with kids knows, \u201cplans\u201d are basically bullshit. \nPractice mindfulness and focus on your body , they advise, but even that gets diverted into something mom-related: I wish I didn\u2019t have these stretch marks, they weren\u2019t here before I had kids, and \u2014 boom! \u2014 suddenly I\u2019m remembering that a birthday is coming up and I need to make cupcakes to drop off at school and oh, damn, the PTA bake sale is next week. Sigh\u2026 \nLeave the dishes in the sink and take a bubble bath , they recommend, but as good as that sounds, I know it will lead to one thing: intrusive thoughts of the dishes in the sink at the worst possible moment. I swear, sometimes it feels like I can\u2019t win. \nI\u2019m going to keep trying, of course, because I miss the old me (and so does my husband, I\u2019m sure) \u2013 the pre-parental version who didn\u2019t wonder during sex if we\u2019re running low on milk. The version of me who was able to focus on the electricity of my partner\u2019s touch instead of the electric bill. Someday I\u2019m bound to hit on something that works for me, even if it means first eliminating all the things that don\u2019t. \nBut until I find it, I\u2019m going to change one important thing: the pressure I put on myself to be hot and ready at the poke of a boner. Because it\u2019s just not realistic any more, not at this point, and I know it\u2019s not helping anything. Sure, I could do it at one time, but my life was a lot different then \u2013 and it\u2019s only natural that I\u2019m responding differently now. There are plenty of ways that I can show my husband how much I adore him, and they don\u2019t all involve sex . \nIn the meantime, I make sure to explain that I\u2019m just having trouble switching \u201cmodes,\u201d and that it\u2019s definitely not something he should take personally. I figure that someday, the kids will be out of the house and I\u2019ll have plenty of chances to, say, greet my man at the door wearing nothing but a smile. \nHopefully he won\u2019t mind if my nipples are down to my navel by then.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pta", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:55.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9b5debe33963a4daa05ace5330e61b0b875f5a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0_OebtBtudscpuSdCuXWX61DPuWv2EODxdcjsgKs94CIB_g3ipr7YaGnqNMUTr8RqEzw5vkrl_O4YQiktXfbV7KH.SfWRNikZapQy_3YJ3JaUg9tkT91XXAdY.OdAfaO1NEMDAGqtrHM", "site_full": "www.lazada.sg", "site": "lazada.sg", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.sg/shop-fragrances/express-delivery/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Express Delivery Store | Get Daily Needs Fast | Lazada.sg", "title": "Mont Blanc Legend |", "title_full": "Mont Blanc Legend 100ml | Lazada Singapore", "published": "2015-09-21T12:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 92, "participants_count": 57, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.39, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8973, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ff19bb13d7509bc9a1557b2589918bf9768fc07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0_OebtBtudscpuSdCuXWX61DPuWv2EODxdcjsgKs94CIB_g3ipr7YaGnqNMUTr8RqEzw5vkrl_O4YQiktXfbV7KH.SfWRNikZapQy_3YJ3JaUg9tkT91XXAdY.OdAfaO1JfVywhnNvUz8Kt7rAPh6eM-", "ord_in_thread": 89, "author": "Weitong Q.", "published": "2017-11-30T02:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mont blanc", "text": "The delivery was fast!

He faces up to 142 years in prison if convicted.\nDemirtas - who is being held in prison in the northwestern region of Edirne, well away from his Kurdish heartland - is not expected to appear in the first hearing of his trial in Ankara.\nThe HDP has denounced a letter it claimed the justice ministry sent to all courts prosecuting Demirtas, telling them not to allow the charismatic leader to appear in court.\n'Political reasons' A dozen HDP MPs were detained at the same time as Demirtas, including former co-chairwoman Figen Yuksekdag. She was stripped of her MP status in February and stepped down as co-party leader in May.\nNine HDP MPs are still in prison, including Demirtas and Yuksekdag, who is an ethnic Turk.\nSpeaking at a hearing on Wednesday, Yuksekdag warned that she did not feel the Turkish judiciary could deliver fair verdicts.\n\u201cThe quality of Turkish justice had declined precipitously,\" she said in a statement. \"The judiciary in Turkey has never been totally independent, but it has never before been this dependent and repressed.\n\u201cI have no belief that this court will make a decision without being put under pressure. If the judges and prosecutors defied this pressure, they would either be forced out of the profession or go to jail themselves.\u201d\nUnder Demirtas's leadership, the HDP took seats in the Turkish parliament as the second biggest opposition party, winning support from liberal and left-wing Turks beyond its Kurdish base.\nBut the government accuses the party of being a political front for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group blacklisted by Turkey and its Western allies.\nAnalysts say Demirtas never succeeded in fully distancing his party from the PKK, though the HDP denies the claims.\nIt has rubbished Ankara's accusations against its co-leader, saying Demirtas's 501-page indictment was mostly made up of press releases, speeches, panels and similar legal and political activities.\nDemirtas is ensnared in nearly 100 legal cases, but this is the most serious and the one for which he has been held in prison for almost 400 days.\nThe party claimed the accusations were \"prepared for political reasons, not legal ones\" because they date back to events between 2011 and 2013 yet the HDP said the preparation was done in the first four months of 2016.\nFurther infuriating the HDP, the computer which contained Demirtas's defence for the hearing was stolen in the southeastern province of Diyarbakir.\nRenowned US intellectual and linguist Noam Chomsky was among authors and politicians who signed a petition this week calling for Demirtas and Yuksekdag to be released.\nWhile in prison, former human rights lawyer Demirtas has written poetry, produced artwork, tweeted through a third party and even written a selection of short stories entitled Seher ( Dawn in English).\nThe book's publisher Dipnot told AFP it had printed 155,000 copies of the book which was now in its 15th print run.\n11,500 HDP officials detained After June 2015 legislative elections which the HDP hailed as a triumph, the two-year ceasefire between the PKK and the Turkish state fell apart and intense fighting resumed.\nMore than 40,000 people have been killed since the PKK launched its insurgency against Turkey in 1984.\nLess than a year after the 2015 poll, parliament voted to lift MPs' immunity from prosecution, paving the way for the arrest of HDP lawmakers.\nSince the government imposed a state of emergency after the July 2016 failed coup, tens of thousands of people have been arrested over alleged links to the putsch. Government critics and Kurdish activists have also been targeted.\nThe HDP has been hit hard with 11,500 officials, members and party sympathisers detained since the end of the ceasefire, while 4,537 have been formally arrested.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "selahattin demirtas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "demirtas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noam chomsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "figen yuksekdag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yuksekdag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dipnot", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pkk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdistan workers' party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hdp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peoples democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peoples' democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diyarbakir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yuksekdag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edirne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:55.059+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f9c6ee4495663e9c6c7677c79c7b7d41014f5845", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poyqykI6bYWx0s.WDpcG03mN91wwRv5hJvG.w7Mrgrxjo6g9SNDSFfolmq2EF5tYcqKNexfmNaLRmxjfBMe5_GPpmSMooq6VKR2g6UMu8SjXyAue3gdBfaWzXaURe_hFGxiJFLdmat0QuOeewXV5NFH67kUfVOZ7wQZ1UvOeSLBgdUIBI8cMmYHmEsPBmi4SDBJ7y7mcpXA_wg--", "site_full": "iee.kr", "site": "iee.kr", "site_section": "http://iee.kr/feed", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "\ub2e4\uc2dc\ubcf4\uae30 \ubaa8\uc544\ubaa8\uc544", "title": "[\uc601\ud654 \ub2e4\uc2dc\ubcf4\uae30] [ \uc18c\ubb38\uc758 \uc2dc\uc791 ] \uad70\ud568\ub3c4", "title_full": "[\uc601\ud654 \ub2e4\uc2dc\ubcf4\uae30] [ \uc18c\ubb38\uc758 \uc2dc\uc791 ] \uad70\ud568\ub3c4", "published": "2017-12-07T10:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://iee.kr/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1512633995_maxresdefault.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f9c6ee4495663e9c6c7677c79c7b7d41014f5845", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poyqykI6bYWx0s.WDpcG03mN91wwRv5hJvG.w7Mrgrxjo6g9SNDSFfolmq2EF5tYcqKNexfmNaLRmxjfBMe5_GPpmSMooq6VKR2g6UMu8SjXyAue3gdBfaWzXaURe_hFGxiJFLdmat0QuOeewXV5NFH67kUfVOZ7wQZ1UvOeSLBgdUIBI8cMmYHmEsPBmi4SDBJ7y7mcpXA_wg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ieekr", "published": "2017-12-07T10:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "[\uc601\ud654 \ub2e4\uc2dc\ubcf4\uae30] [ \uc18c\ubb38\uc758 \uc2dc\uc791 ] \uad70\ud568\ub3c4", "text": "No featured entries match the criteria.

Standing nearly 7 feet tall he made the terrible drunken decision to ride in a regular jet instead of his custom made variant. As Havok grunts in discomfort one of his slave wives giving him a massage turned to him and said \"Don't worry hun, just a little while longer.\" then the other slave wife he brought along said, \"Yeah, then you'll be able to stand up again!\". Havok brought his two most beautiful slave wives for show but also because travel makes him uneasy. \"Yeah, let's just hope it's as soon as I hope.\" Havok said.\n\"What do you suppose Ralkovia is like, my lord?\" Havok's squire, Shadeen, asked. \"No need for the formalities, Shad. We grew up together.\" Havok said as if this wasn't the first time he's told his squire to call him by his actual name. \"Yes, uh... Havok.\" The squire uncomfortably stated. \"To answer your question, I picked up some cheap travel pamphlet before we left and was skimming over the pages. Looks like a decent enough place. Might get a summer home even.\" Havok said. whilst scratching his ear. \"Not to interrupt, but I hope there's flowers. Say, master, if there's flowers could we stop by and look at them?\" one of Havok's slave wives, Alenna, asked with a cheerful and innocent tone. \"Perhaps, if my schedule isn't too busy. There's a lot to be done in Ralkovia, Alenna.\" Havok said.\nOut of nowhere the pilot stated over the intercom \"We are now landing in Ralkovia, hang tight.\" Havok brought 100 men with him to protect him but also as a small show of force. Dressed in traditional Potthani clothing, once landed they all departed the vehicle one by one making two lines facing each other at the end of the plane's exit stairs. 50 soldiers on one said, 50 on another.

You have known me and my depression for 16 long years \u2014 and \u201cthese days\u201d are par for the course, and you knew that, but that doesn\u2019t make going through it any easier. That doesn\u2019t make loving me (or living with me) any easier, and for that I am sorry. \nSo, so sorry. \nMake no mistake: I am not sorry I have depression. I cannot be. It is an illness like any other, and it is beyond my control. But I am sorry for how it hurts you. I am sorry for how I have hurt you. I am sorry for how it has affected not just me, but our marriage. \nHow it has affected us. \nI\u2019m sorry for the trips I\u2019ve ruined and the dinner dates I\u2019ve cut short. For the parties I\u2019ve avoided and the family outings from which I\u2019ve withdrawn, and for the nights I\u2019ve crawled into bed hours before you to sit. To sulk. To be alone. \nI\u2019m for sorry for the uncooked meals and unwashed dishes. For the mess that is our family, our home, and our life, and I\u2019m sorry for our sexless marriage . \nI know you are trying: you just want to hold me and touch me and turn me on but when you do, I shake. I shudder. I recoil in shame, sadness, and fear. And while I can blame some of our struggles on medication \u2014 on the antidepressants which have zapped my sex drive \u2014 the truth is I do not feel worthy of pleasure. \nIn the depths of my depression, I do not believe I deserve pleasure. \nI am sorry for my short temper and shorter fuse \u2014 and even more sorry that you are often the recipient of my blind and unforgiving rage. \nI am sorry for all the times in which I\u2019ve tried to leave because you would be \u201cbetter off without me.\u201d You\u2019d be \u201chappier without me,\u201d and I am sorry for pushing you away. You want to be there for me, and comfort me through it, and I just pull away. \nPlease know I love you. My reaction has nothing to do with you; it is simply that depression is a fickle beast. She hurts me and mocks me and convinces me I am stupid, worthless and unloveable. \nBut I promise you I am trying. \nIn spite of it all, I am trying. I\u2019m going to therapy, I\u2019m taking the meds, I\u2019m doing the work to pull myself out of this hell hole. \nSo while I know loving me isn\u2019t easy \u2014 especially as of late \u2014 I am asking you to be patient with me and kind toward me. I ask that you listen to me, even when I make no sense. I ask that you keep holding me and hugging me, even when it feels like I\u2019m pulling away. And I ask that you forgive me for it all: for the sadness and apathy, for the anger and lethargy, and for my absence. \nFor the mental and physical disconnect I experience in the grips of an attack. In the cold dark of a depressive storm. \nBecause I am doing my damnedest to fight my disease. And to overcome my disease, and I do so because of you: you are my love, my motivation, and my reason. \nMy calm in the chaos. \nAfter 10 years, you are still my eye in this brutal and unforgiving storm. And, I would renew those vows today.

It's also their best way to make sure they don't get ripped off by unscrupulous contractors. \n\"Ask for help,\" he said Wednesday. \"You need help.\" \nThe now-defunct JJ Mottes concrete company used stone from a Willington quarry containing the mineral pyrrhotite from 1983 until 2017, according to reports prepared by the state of Connecticut. Over time the iron-laden mineral reacts with water and air, causing concrete to crack and bubble. Eventually, it loses structural strength and collapses. \nIn the last few years, more than 590 Connecticut homeowners -- including Heim, whose home is just a few miles from the quarry -- have reported failing foundations. Experts believe pyrrhotite may be present in the foundations of as many as 34,000 Connecticut homes. \nNow it is showing up in Massachusetts. \nA Longmeadow couple -- Russell and Tatiana Dupere -- say their home has lost half its value after they discovered concrete crumbling from their basement walls. In East Longmeadow, a couple sold their home for about half what it had been worth after pyrrhotite damage showed up in a home inspection. \nThe Dupere's homeowner's insurance has denied their claim. \nPyrrhotite-contaminated concrete could force homeowners into foreclosure if they can't get money for repairs and can't live in the home. Many can't borrow money to fund repairs because there is no value in their home to use as collateral. \nThe pyrrhotite might impact municipal budgets, too, as homeowners seek tax abatements to reflect homes that have lost value. A report released earlier this year by the Hartford-based Capitol Region Council of Governments put the estimated waived taxes over 15 years in just eight Connecticut towns with affected homes at over $70 million. \nFixing the problem can cost $150,000 to $350,000. \nThe Longmeadow and East Longmeadow cases are not the only ones Heim, featured in a 2016 New York Times story on the subject, said he knows of in Massachusetts. He's planning to host an informational meeting for Massachusetts homeowners in a few months. \n\"Connecticut will help Massachusetts,\" he said. \"Massachusetts is where Connecticut was two-and-a-half years ago.\" 'A slow-motion disaster': Failing foundations discussed at Longmeadow Select Board meeting \nAbove, excerpts from the Dec. 4, 2017 Longmeadow Select Board Meeting. Video footage courtesy of Longmeadow Community Television . \nThe Dupere family worries neighbors living in their development of homes, all built at about the same time by the same contractor, will try and downplay the problem, fearful that speaking up will hurt their property values. \nHeim says that's the wrong approach. \n\"It's OK to have this problem,\" he said. \"If you have this problem, you did nothing wrong.\" \nHe's aware he sounds a little more like the leader of a self-help group than someone advocating on behalf of homeowners with a very concrete problem, in every sense of the word. He said the impacted homeowners need emotional support, too. \n\"This is like AA for concrete,\" he said. \"One day at a time. It's kind of weird.\" \nThere is a practical aspect to the meetings Heim hosts for homeowners. He talks about finding a good contractor. Homeowners fear that unscrupulous people are trolling the towns where failing foundations are common, selling cheap fixes that don't work and preying on homeowner desire to get things done quickly. \nInsurance issues \nWilliam Trudeau, president of Insurance Center of New England in Agawam, said he is still learning about the problem. But his advice would be for anyone with concerns to first have a well-regarded contractor look at their foundation. \nInsurance claims in this area are tricky. Policies don't often pay for faulty materials used in construction. But they will pay sometimes for damage caused when those material fail. \nThat means the claim needs to be centered not around replacing the foundation, but on all the other damaged caused by a sagging foundation, said insurance consultant Frank Lombard of Chicopee. That would be the doors that won't shut, cracked tile work and tilting floors. \nLombard has represented homeowners in Connecticut in pyrrhotite-related claims. \n\"Companies are going to fight it, no question about it,\" he said. \"But the insurance company has to show them how it's not covered.\" \nThe Duperes were denied by their carrier, Liberty Mutual. Company spokesman Glenn Greenberg answered questions Wednesday in an email that said: \"We empathize with everyone impacted by crumbling foundations due to defective concrete. While each claim is adjusted on its own merits, there are coverage issues arising out of these circumstances.\" \nTrudeau, meanwhile, said he hasn't had one of his customers at Insurance Center of New England file a claim for tainted concrete. But he wouldn't be surprised if they start coming in. \n\"It's a big mess,\" he said. \"It's something we need to talk about and understand.\" View Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ea", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "longmeadow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:56.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95f053eb49935a685ceaa2ef962640975aa9264f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm353IwmsDVmzrwyc4fyxTt_", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=trek", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "trek News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Watch Morrissey's Cheeky Take on 'American Bandstand' - Rolling Stone", "title_full": "Watch Morrissey's Cheeky Take on 'American Bandstand' - Rolling Stone : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-11-30T15:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.224, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "95f053eb49935a685ceaa2ef962640975aa9264f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm353IwmsDVmzrwyc4fyxTt_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rolling Stone", "published": "2017-11-30T15:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Watch Morrissey's Cheeky Take on 'American Bandstand' - Rolling Stone", "text": "Morrissey delivers a cheeky send up of classic music-performance shows like American Bandstand and Soul Train in the new video for \"Jacky's Only Happy When She's Up On the Stage.\" The track appears on Morrissey's latest solo album, Low in High School.

passed the time before their arrival in Ralkovia. The plane cabin was as luxurious as it could be for their tastes as they were afforded to top tier service by the plane's staff and enjoyed a comfortable flight to the far western mainland of the Ralkovian Empire, a ally with a sometimes complicated relationship. It had been two weeks since he was informed of a letter from the Ralkovian foreign affairs minister of a meeting that they were cordially invited to attend. Having only been Reichminister of Foreign affairs for just under a year now unlike his predecessor who had the position for over a decade, Ernst Grasemann who before his coming to a Reichsminister was only a SS-Scharfuhrer in the Waffen-SS and a veteran of the 1st Krasnovan War. Fate had led him to being reassigned from Krasnova back to the main land which subsequently with the aftermath of the 2nd Krasnovan war, his 108th SS Panzer Division had been utterly decimated in the Battle of Gorodiska against Marshite forces who had overran their position and sent the division into a disorganized rapid retreat that costed them nearly half of their manpower. For much of the year so far he had been doing mostly paperwork, their was plenty to do and catch up on which had been left over after his predecessor Valentin Voelker had been removed from the position. He however was adapting just as he was expected to and was now on a plane on the way to a rather important sit down with several western Dienstad powers who have invited the Reich to represent its self here.\nGeneraloberst Ruprecht Heckmann sat across from his foreign affairs ministry counter part as his Iron Cross and other military accolades from his career were neatly displayed on his chest. The nearly below freezing weather that will be expected when they land and disembark, had his heavy coat near by. He had participated in the 1st Krasnovan War when he was a Major in the 822nd Grenaider Division. Since then he quickly rose to his current position and rank of Generaloberst as he was 2nd in command of the entirety of the 45th Panzer Army which was expecting to see a transition to Krasnova as soon as possible for the post-war affairs of the new General Governorate and the survival of the Reich as propaganda explains. Ruprecht was of course knowledgable on the on-going historical rivalry between the Army and the Waffen SS and current events involving SS in government positions that had been sacked in what was rumored to have been a coup de tat by the Ordenite SS and supported by the new Reichsfuhrer. In his lap was a pack of files that were almost full to the brim with now declassified documents that had been kept away in a vault like facility under the Reich Chancellery building. These documents pertained to the existence of a covert intelligence agency that was active in multiple nations across Greater Dienstad, with the intelligence that was gathered from deep cover agents that were able to gather rather important information. Much of it however was military reports and other documents that pertained to deep reconnasaince mission reports and on operations conducted from spy planes and other aircraft on foreign military movements and facilities. Their were even geographic images of the area of interest in the Sea of Crowns that have been watched for days on end by a submarine. The report on major commercial shipping lanes used by potential hostile nations such as Stevid, Morrdh, Imbrimium and even The Golden Throne and their activities in these shipping lanes and else where were contained in some of these documents.\n\"Herr Heckmann, I assume you are a drinker right?\" Ernst questioned as he himself could be quite the heavy drinker as he typically ventured to a popular bar in downtown Berlina which was known for it's rather vibrant night life for a society that has been programmed to revere and obey their totalitarian government. Heckermann waited a few seconds before responding to his fellow comrade.\n\"I like a drink every now and then, Reichsminister.\" He stated plainly as Ernst chuckled softly and kept his eyes on him. Heckmann kept eye contact despite that he would rather be filing out paperwork at his office then be talking to his SS counterpart. The man next to Heckmann didn't seem that much interested in the small talk as Johannes Hanusch kept his eyes on his book that he was in the middle of reading. Johannes was part of the Party Office of Foreign Affairs and was in this case representing the interests of the Party here in this meeting of somewhat like-minded nations. Soon enough the plane was making it's descend to the airfield below as one of the pilot's announced their soon to be arrival at their destination. The three men prepared for the conditions as they put on their heavy coats and gathered the materials and such that they'd need for the occasion as the plane made landing at the airfield. On the tail wing of the plane was the Ordenite swastika of course which was a sign to anyone of who the plane and it's passengers belonged to. The stair ramp was deployed as the three men descended the stairs and walked to whoever was there to greet them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:56.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bda3958c1579d479ad84e65052a4e934b26d7b7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ3_uGWbVyJwFhWbVifNtsPYUqlPj9eq9hdUSbhphGqISU84JuYUFLdI9VkHYkwLAhMw--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/o-t-lounge/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "O-T Lounge | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "August Ames has died 9", "title_full": "August Ames has died | Page 9 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T05:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "80396e9f83833594623627663d2a376e46a4ccd1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ3_uGWbVyJwFhWbVifNtsPYUqlPj9eq9hdUSbhphGqISU84JuYUFLdI_g_REDRmVcjha.c1IYGBln", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "saintsfan22", "published": "2017-12-07T06:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It was discussed on Stern", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:56.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bda3958c1579d479ad84e65052a4e934b26d7b7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ3_uGWbVyJwFhWbVifNtsPYUqlPj9eq9hdUSbhphGqISU84JuYUFLdI9VkHYkwLAhMw--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/o-t-lounge/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "O-T Lounge | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "August Ames has died 9", "title_full": "August Ames has died | Page 9 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T05:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "abb18f4741941907adf36acacae1d7335b285ca6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ3_uGWbVyJwFhWbVifNtsPYUqlPj9eq9hdUSbhphGqISU84JuYUFLdI_g_REDRmVcjgZO_.rUsQ3b", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "KirkLazarus", "published": "2017-12-07T11:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "watching that link you provided, its never made clear that she dates black men in her personal life.

They are responsible for the occurrence of influenza amongst both humans and animals. Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Isavirus, Thogotovirus and Quaranjavirus are the six different types of orthomyxoviridae. Each of these genera also include several serotypes or sub-types, Influenza A includes major sub-types such as H1N1, H1N2, H2N2, H3N1, H3N2, H3N8, H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N8, H5N9, H7N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N7, H7N9, H9N2 and H10N7.Report Overview and TOC: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/orthomyxoviridae-infec... Thogotovirus includes Batken, Dhori and Jos sub-types. Influenza B includes the Victoria and Yamagata sero-types. Orthomyxoviridae diseases are communicable and spread through infected food, feces and bird droppings, water and mucus in aerosol form. Influenza viruses are destroyed when exposed to bleach, 70% ethanol, aldehydes, oxidizing agents, and quaternary ammonium compounds. The viruses are also inactivated by raising temperatures above 56 \u00b0C for minimum of 60 minutes, and in acidic conditions. Avian flu has the highest risk and mortality with more than 800 cases per 100,000 across the world according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The viruses replicate by beginning from endocytosis, where haemagglutinin protein fuses the viral envelope with the vacuole\u2019s membrane, releasing the viral RNA (vRNA) molecules, accessory proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase into the cytoplasm. Due to the absence of RNA proofreading enzymes, the replication process makes a genetic error every 10,000 nucleotides thus mutating the virus on a very large scale.Request brochure: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... The genome of orthomyxovirus comprises six to eight segments of single stranded, linear and negative sense RNA. The complete genome is about 10,000 to 14,600 nucleotide long. Though the epidemic and mortality associated with orthomyxoviridae has been prevalent for almost 100 years yet the worst of them was 1918 pandemic which almost caused 20 million deaths across the globe of which 500,000 were in the United States. Sore throat, nonproductive cough and nasal discharge are some symptoms of the infection.Ease in transmission of virus through inhalation, coughing and living in close proximity of infected person is major divers for the growth of orthomyxoviridae Infections treatment market. Moreover, inclination of tier 1 pharmaceutical companies for developing novel therapeutics as a cure to the infection will further compliment for the growth of the market. Geographically market for Orthomyxoviridae infections treatment market is dominated by the developed economic countries owing to government funding, implementation of stringent regulations to develop cost effective drugs/vaccines and intense research activities by scholars at universities and private research centers.

I\u2019m actually a personal assistant and social secretary. For my four kids. And I want out. I don\u2019t know when I applied for and accepted this position because I\u2019m not even particularly well-suited to it, but somehow I\u2019ve ended up managing eight color-coded iCal calendars that sync on five devices. Seriously. I know I look like I\u2019m trying to solve the world\u2019s energy crisis in the photo above, but really I\u2019m just doing an online invitation to my son\u2019s birthday party. I\u2019m probably not the only one who is bewildered to find themselves in their current situation. Like so many moms (and not as many dads), I book all my kids\u2019 social engagements, organize their schedules, make sure they have what they need for said activities and remind them of their plans. Lucky devils. Why don\u2019t I get an assistant like me? It was one thing when the kids were little. But now my older kids have passed the single-digits, age-wise. Although I\u2019m still content arranging playdates for my two little ones, I\u2019m having a hard time continuing this for the big(ger) kids. But in the current parent culture, perhaps especially in New York, it feels hard to stop. The other day, I started texting one of my friends to ask if her son could \u201ccome over for a playdate\u201d with my son. Then my finger paused over the tiny iPhone keyboard for a minute. Is it even called a \u201cplaydate\u201d anymore? Isn\u2019t that a little bit creepy? These boys are almost as big as I am. Instead I rewrote it to ask if her son could \u201ccome hang out\u201d with my son instead. That sounded better. Unfortunately, the prospective friend only had a few minutes at home between soccer and a family event, so he couldn\u2019t do it. Of course. I would kill to live in the suburbs (or at least, the suburbs of my imagination) so I could open my back door and have all the kids in the neighborhood just meet up together and hang. My husband says in his community growing up, he never had an arranged playdate. He just rode bikes and palled around with the other kids who lived nearby. He looks at our current Manhattan over-scheduled life and shakes his head. When are the kids just supposed to chill with their friends? Zibby Owens I mean, if this were my backyard, I\u2019d keep my door open and permanently expel my kids. Since he brought to my attention that \u201cmy way\u201d wasn\u2019t necessarily the norm, I\u2019ve started making more of an effort to let my kids just hang out. Last weekend, I gave my son the cell phone numbers of four of his friends\u2019 moms. (My kids and their friends don\u2019t have phones yet. More on that another time.) I read off all their numbers. \u201cYou call them and see if your friends are free. Let me know if you confirm any plans.\u201d He rose to the challenge. I could feel him getting excited the way he does as he dives into a new Lego box. \u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d he said. He dutifully called all these mom friends of mine and asked to hang with their kids. But of course, in our pre-planned world, all the kids were busy. See, it doesn\u2019t totally work if only one kid in the peer group is open to frequent unstructured play when everyone else is busy racing to various sports games, tutoring, birthday parties and more. Not to mention that by the time the kids have gotten together after a cab ride, bus, subway or walk, it\u2019s usually almost time to turn around again. For me, with four kids, the logistics involved in various playdates are sometimes so time-consuming and involved that spontaneous events \u2013 the ones I want for my kids \u2014 can throw the whole delicately balanced schedule off kilter. This Friday, for instance, a friend of my daughter\u2019s decided to have some girls to her house after school and she wanted to go. There was no reason not to let her, except that I\u2019d planned the day otherwise. I rearranged everything so she could enjoy and just go with it. But it required about 57 texts and two phone calls for me to take her. Which ate up half the time I was actually with her. Zibby Owens Speaking of eating, this is my go-to playdate snack, a Nene\u2019s Treats birthday crumb cake (www.nenestreats.com). So, here\u2019s my proposal. Let\u2019s make life more normal for kids and find the equivalent of opening the back door. (Ideas welcome.) Let\u2019s have kids arrange their own playdates by calling, not texting. Remember the home phone with the long twisted cord that used to hang in everyone\u2019s kitchen when we were growing up? It served a purpose. We used to have to say hello to whoever answered, introduce ourselves, ask for our friend, and have an actual conversation. Not just send a text with a poop emoji. (Why does this even exist?) Let\u2019s try to do more carpooling so kids have more time to chat with each other. Let\u2019s watch each other\u2019s kids more. Let\u2019s collectively leave mutual days open for groups of friends to play. #fridayfriendday? Let\u2019s have the kids manage their own calendars. At the least, let\u2019s agree as parents not to text each other a million times just to have a single playdate. I swear: I spend more time texting to arrange plans than the plans actually end up taking. Let\u2019s call each other, make a date and stick to it. No confirmations. No thank you\u2019s after. No \u201coks\u201d or \u201cthanks\u201d or \u201csee you soon\u2019s.\u201d I think if we all walk out of our personal assistant \u201cjobs,\u201d the real beneficiaries will be our kids. They\u2019ll learn essential social skills, time management, organization and prioritization. Best of all, we might even be able spend more time with our own friends, a great thing to model for kids. I couldn\u2019t survive a day without my amazing girlfriends. I want to make sure my kids grow up feeling the same way. And of course, I could use the time.

It seems the further away you are from Pyongyang, the more attention Kim garners. This is not quite how Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants it to work. Abe, of course, hopes the North Korean missile demonstrations remain a high priority for the nation - his agenda for reforming Japan\u2019s post-war, pacifist constitution depends on it. During the recent election campaign, constitutional reform was framed in terms of the threat from North Korea. \nOne month on from the LDP\u2019s victory in the snap election, political focus has shifted to the floor of parliament where Abe has the numbers to revise the constitution and push Japan into a new security domain. But does he have the public\u2019s confidence? Much was made of Abe\u2019s electoral victory, yet in fact the government just maintained the status quo, the same number of seats from the previous election, albeit with the required two-thirds to bring on constitutional revision. Abe's coalition partner, the Komeito, lost a number of seats, some analysts attributing this to its constituents resisting the move towards Abe\u2019s revisionist plans. \nFor many observers, the election victory looks like Abe\u2019s constitutional ambitions are inevitable. But this overlooks some very nuanced domestic political manoeuvring. Abe\u2019s speech at the opening of the 195th Parliament was noted for being one of the shortest such speeches on record, and addressed the threat from North Korea upfront. This was consistent with the message LDP candidates ran during the election, code for constitutional change. \nMeanwhile the opposition parties, each with their new configuration, and each trying to establish opposition leadership, pressed on with questions about the Moritomo Gakuen and Kake Gakuen school funding scandals in a clear effort to continue to undermine public trust and confidence in Abe. The Asahi Shimbun last week analysed the questions asked by the different parties and it was no surprise that the opposition focussed on these scandals, with some 60% of question time taken by the Constitutional Democrats, (CDPJ) and 30% allocated by Kibo no To (Party of Hope). \nWhy does this matter? Prior to the election, voter confidence in Abe as a consequence of these school scandals hit very low figures, low enough for analysts to suggest his tenure will be severely hampered. Exit polls, even as Abe\u2019s LDP maintained its seats, declared little confidence in Abe himself. The opposition parties want to continue the polling trends. Television footage of Abe and others trying to explain or defend his position diminishes his authority. \nLike the Australian Constitution, Japan\u2019s Constitution includes an article outlining the requirements for constitutional amendment. It is not simply a matter of a parliamentary two-thirds majority. Article 96 requires that a referendum be \u2018submitted to the people for ratification, which shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes cast thereon\u2019. Polling consistently reflects ongoing support for the peace clause, Article 9. \nSince its promulgation in 1947, the Japanese Constitution has not been subjected to amendments by referendum. It will perhaps be more crucial to watch the political mood on the way to a referendum than Abe\u2019s two-thirds parliamentary majority. Not only do the opposition parties need to establish their respective pitches (along the spectrum from pro-amendment to no amendments), but internal LDP politics will also have a major bearing on the outcome. Comparatively dormant factions are re-emerging as Abe\u2019s aims for a record extended term as Prime Minister. And into this mix, the Emperor\u2019s reign will end on 30 April 2019, around about the time the referendum has been timetabled for consideration. \nThe intrinsic \u2018Japaneseness\u2019 of Sumo is something Japanese people revere, so too is their Article 9. At the end of the week, morning shows were continuing to parse every sentence in Haruma Fuji\u2019s resignation speech. One anticipates they will apply the same level of forensic analysis to Abe\u2019s constitutional reforms as they did to a sumo Grand Champion. Meanwhile, looking south \nAustralia\u2019s Foreign Policy White Paper released in November received some press coverage in Japan through major outlets such as the national broadcaster, NHK, major newspapers the Asahi and Yomiuri Shimbun, and other smaller outlets.

  Radionz | 6:00 AM \nThe United Liberation Movement for West Papua has condemned an Indonesian government call for its members to be arrested. \nThe pro-independence Movement has just concluded a summit in Vanuatu, where the UK-based activist Benny Wenda was elected its new chair. \nHowever Indonesia\u2019s minister of Defence Ryamisard Ryacudu called for members of the Liberation Movement who are based in Indonesian-ruled Papua to be arrested upon their return. \nThe Movement\u2019s Pacific regional diplomat Akouboo Douw has described the minister\u2019s call as abusive. \nHe says the Movement has every right to hold its meeting in Vanuatu, where it has official business as part of its role in the Melanesian Spearhead Group. \nDouw says the West Papuans\u2019 meeting was not against the Indonesian constitution or its Pancasila state philosophy. \n\u201cIt is not going to be big disaster for your nation but also Indonesia has to respect the ULMWP as an entity of the MSG,\u201d said Douw. \nHe has urged Australia and New Zealand to monitor the Papua-based Liberation Movement\u2019s members when they return home lest they be arrested by Indonesia. \nWhile the Movement has observer status in the Melanesian Spearhead Group, Indonesia\u2019s government is opposed to it representing Papuans internationally, as well as its pro-independence activities. \nAccording to Douw, Jakarta should realise that the independent Melanesian member countries in the MSG, including Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Fiji and Vanuatu, support the right to self-determination for all Melanesians. \nMeanwhile, he thanked Vanuatu\u2019s government for donating a building in Port Vila to the Liberation Movement for use as its international headquarters. \nDouw said that West Papuans have rights to come and go, and that Vanuatu is a free Melanesian country which Papuans consider like a home. \nMeanwhile, the independent Papua newspaper Tabloid Jubi reported that dozens of Papuans were arrested for publicly marking the anniversary of the first Papuan declaration of independence. \nLast Friday was 56 years since the Papua nationalist flag was first officially flown in the former Dutch New Guinea, shortly before Indonesia took control of the territory. \nThe Morning Star flag was subsequently banned. \nEach year on 1 December there are demonstrations in cities around the wider Pacific region, including Australia and New Zealand, where Morning Star flags are flown to mark the anniversary. \nThe demonstrations in the towns and cities of West Ppapua and Papua provinces tend not to feature the flag raising, and typically result in arrests by Indonesian police.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",
