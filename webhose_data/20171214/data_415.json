She made like she wanted to hire me as protection then she sold me for the kid and kept the ransom for herself. I managed to escape. And I tracked her here.\"\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you were hurting her when we first met.\u201d He says, still pacing.\n\u201cExactly. As for the kid, he\u2019s the son of Shalock.\u201d\n\u201cSay that again.\u201d He says. \u201cWho\u2019s son?\u201d\n\u201cShalock. Your brother\u2019s competitor.\u201d\n\u201cIs that true?\u201d He looks to the child. \u201cWho is your father? What\u2019s his name? What\u2019s your last name?\u201d\n\u201cMerki.\u201d\nThe noble collapses onto the chair and grabs his face. \u201cNo. No. No.\u201d He moans.\n\u201cYour brother is the one that ordered the kidnapping. Shalock hired Abby to get his son back. He gave her the seeds as the ransom money. Once she had me though, she decided to change her plan and just keep the ransom for herself.\u201d\n\u201cHow could I be so stupid\u2026\u201d He mumbles.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what her plan was for you. Knowing her, probably something nasty. She was going to use you, just like she used me, like I\u2019m guessing she uses everyone.\u201d\n\u201cI thought I...loved her.\u201d His eyes harden. \u201cWhere is she now?\u201d\n\u201cNo idea. I came to here to break ties with her. Then she tried to kill me. She has bandits looking for her and a sister, another bloodpure Gizrathin, and she didn\u2019t want me blabbing. The kid got hurt in the scuffle, I healed him. And then\u2026\u201d You nod, you\u2019ve come this far. You\u2019ve convinced him. \u201cI killed her. Or I tried to. My sword hit one of her voidholes and got sucked in. Then...I don\u2019t know what happened after that. I saw her corpse bleeding out and then she\u2019s gone. If what the kid says is right, with the hole and everything, it might have something to do with her being voidtouched.\u201d\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t know where she is?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t. In the Great Void maybe. Your guess is as good as mine. And that\u2019s all I know.\u201d\nHe wipes his face again, covering his eyes with his hands. \u201cWhat happened to your arm?\u201d He says, flicking a finger toward your paralyzed limb.\n\u201cShe cut me with her fire. Right through here. I can\u2019t move it anymore.\u201d\nHe sighs. \u201cHow do I know you\u2019re telling the truth? You could be making this all up.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not. And you know it too. Look at the papers, look at the seeds, look at the kid. It\u2019s all true. She played you. As far as I\u2019m concerned you got out before it got ugly\u201d\nHe looks up and scoffs. \u201cYou broke my arm.\u201d He says.\n\u201cBut yours is still working.\u201d\nHe nods. He grasps his knees and gets to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re right. So...what do we do now?\u201d\n>There is no we. You\u2019re getting the hell off this pod while you still can.\n>There\u2019s still the matter of the bandits and the sister, you might be able to trap them here\n>You\u2019ll get the kid to his father and then you\u2019ll search for some way to heal your arm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:33.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8f57d6d33dbd8bb6057c64b975f64e5eb6c13788", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pmBxgtSNW93h0SI4mun6wEpAxCKlIlmM3", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/toy/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/toy/ - Toys - 4chan", "title": "figma general 264: \"Kept you Waiting Huh?\" edition", "title_full": "/toy/ - figma general 264: \"Kept you Waiting Huh?\" edition - Toys - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T11:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 58, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.118, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21e6a866f86038f251a67f63756d7889ddd2e502", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pmBxgtSNW93h0SI4mun6wEh.oiZysVeV9YgvQbDQ1820-", "ord_in_thread": 58, "author": "Cyan", "published": "2017-12-07T13:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>6662558\nHAMMER TIME?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:33.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe80797e76f7ee58f9f398eeb247297f8f6bfb54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pmBxgtSNW93jRQNZ7Sgx58oxu3Gwn6H2p", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/toy/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/toy/ - Toys - 4chan", "title": "Megaman general", "title_full": "/toy/ - Megaman general - Toys - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T00:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f9b3d005f32882aefeb914cd97bd6f4e583e826", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pmBxgtSNW93jRQNZ7Sgx58rp7edoq9RShh.KnwF1tjPo-", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>6662610\nyeah man shit always happends and oddly always my favorite in there line", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:33.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33832bfb4ab3c930967c9a738fb4274160de06b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.atIXNnaXxGciShFBUBfPw7yHysig.py0cBgpjkrjA7QnG9cdRIofLm1BrdcOUeFrTC4dBddHHZcwbjm_eOm.5", "site_full": "www.ramforum.com", "site": "ramforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.ramforum.com/f38/", "site_categories": ["entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "General Discussions - DODGE RAM FORUM - Dodge Truck Forums", "title": "Are new 1500 orders on hold now? - Page 2", "title_full": "Are new 1500 orders on hold now? - Page 2 - DODGE RAM FORUM - Dodge Truck Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T12:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7767d4ee7cfa9eecffbbb9ac41a0c8b847d71587", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.atIXNnaXxGciShFBUBfPw7yHysig.py0cBgpjkrjA7QnG9cdRIofLm1BrdcOUeFrTC4dBddHHZQtCtw7l847uwBzwlXwb7q2ujdodxXUyeA--", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "corneileous", "published": "2017-12-07T08:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Originally Posted by jasonw When did they make this change?

She was right, she did tell you leave her. She told you from the very beginning but her good looks and your curiosity swerved you away from the right course. You look at the noble. You can see the top and bottom whites of his eyes, his nostrils flared out like a bull\u2019s. How do you get out of this? What can you tell him? The truth, you decide. You don\u2019t know how to lie anyway.\n\u201cLook. This isn\u2019t what it looks like. You\u2019ve been tricked.

He says he only kissed and fondled her, with her consent. \nNkosilathi Sibanda (27) is alleged to have tiptoed into his neighbour\u2019s bedroom while naked in the wee hours and got into the woman\u2019s blankets. It is the State\u2019s case that the accused started caressing and kissing the woman before raping her. \nSibanda, who is denying the rape allegations, appeared in court last week before Mr Hosiah Mujaya for commencement of the defence case following the dismissal of his application for discharge at the close of the State\u2019s case. \nSibanda, through his lawyer Mr Tapiwa Makanza, successfully made an application to recall State witnesses, saying they had audio recordings they intended to play in court and recross-examine the witnesses. \nHe and the woman\u2019s house mate, identified as Miriam, recorded a conversations between the victim and her relatives as she was informing them of what had transpired. In the recordings, the woman is heard crying while making a phone call to her cousin, asking her to rush to her house, saying Sibanda had fondled her in the dark. \nShe is also heard informing her relatives that she felt that the person fondling her was heavier and his skin\u2019s scent was different from that of her husband. Mr Makanza questioned why the woman did not tell her relatives that Sibanda had raped her, but instead told them that he fondled her. \n\u201cIn your evidence, you told the court that you became aware that it was not your husband when Sibanda penetrated you, adding that his manhood was different from that of your husband,\u201d he said. \n\u201cBut in the audio clip, you are telling a different story. You told your cousin that you felt that the person fondling you was heavier and his skin\u2019s scent was different from that of your husband before switching on the light. So, at what point did he rape you? \n\u201cWhy did you not give your relatives all the details of what had transpired if indeed he had raped you?\u201d \nIn another recording, one of the woman\u2019s relatives was heard shouting at Sibanda, asking him why he attempted to rape the woman. \n\u201cWhy did you do this?,\u201d said Mr Makanza. \n\u201cDo you know that at law it is an offence? So, after fondling her what did you want to do next? You wanted to rape her, right?\u201d \nMr Makanza then said: \u201cThis is a clear indication that you were not raped, but only fondled and kissed by my client with your consent. \n\u201cYou fabricated the rape allegations and lied in your evidence to suit the court proceedings.\u201d \nIn response, the woman said when her relatives came to the house, she was still in a state of shock, hence she could not give them all the details. She said she later confided in one of her cousins, whom she took to another room and told her she had been raped. The woman insisted that Sibanda raped her, but the accused insists the two had an affair.

Image: Reuters \nFurthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) devices will be hijacked and used in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, warned Tarun Kaura, Director, Product Management, APJ, Symantec. \n\"2018 is the first year where we will see AI versus AI in a cybersecurity context. Cybercriminals will use AI to attack and explore victims' networks, which is typically the most labour-intensive part of compromise after an incursion,\" Kaura said in a statement. \nIn 2017, we saw massive DDoS attacks using hundreds of thousands of compromised IoT devices in people's homes and workplaces to generate traffic. \"This is not expected to change with cyber-criminals looking to exploit the poor security settings and management of home IoT devices,\" Kaura added. \nThe inputs and sensors of these IoT devices will also be hijacked, with attackers feeding audio, visual or other faked inputs to make these devices do what they want rather than what users expect them to do. \nBeyond DDoS attacks and ransomware , home IoT devices will be compromised by cyber criminals to provide persistent access to a victim's network. \"Home users generally do not consider the cybersecurity implications of their home IoT devices, leaving default settings and not vigilantly updating them like they do with their computers,\" Kaura said. \nPersistent access means that no matter how many times a victim cleans their machine or protects their computer, the attacker will always have a backdoor into victims' network and the systems that they connect to. \nWhen it comes to Blockchain technology, instead of attacking Blockchain technology itself, cybercriminals will focus on compromising coin-exchanges and users' coin-wallets since these are the easiest targets, and provide high returns. \nSupply chain attacks have been a mainstay of the classical espionage and signals-intelligence operators, compromising upstream contractors/systems/companies and suppliers. \"They are proven to have a high-level of effectiveness, with nation-state actors using a mix of human intelligence to compromise the weakest link in the chain,\" Symantec said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kaura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tarun kaura", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "symantec news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "symantec", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "product management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ians", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:33.075+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ef4c502b6cd85749286be4e599975105c2815d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p.OPtisgNi8guAHTXiGtu1yVS58GQ88Vh", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/qst/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/qst/ -

GVC climbed 7%. \nThe final value of the deal is dependent on the outcome of a Government review of controversial fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) \u2013 which could see the maximum stake on the gaming machines reduced to as little as \u00a32. \nGVC, whose brands include Sportingbet and Foxy Bingo, would pay cash and shares under the takeover which would see Ladbrokes Coral investors own 46.5% of the combined group. \nIt is the latest move in a wave of mergers and takeovers in the gaming and betting industry and comes just a year after Ladbrokes and Gala Coral completed a tie-up to form Ladbrokes Coral. \nGVC has also bulked up with a takeover of bwin.party, owner of sites such as Party Poker. \nA statement on the latest potential deal said the companies were in detailed discussions regarding the possible combination of the two businesses. \nIt said they believed there was a compelling strategic rationale for the deal that would create an online-led globally positioned betting and gaming business. \nThe tie-up would put the newly-formed group in a strong position in major markets such as the UK, Italy and Australia, it added. \nKeith Alexander, chief executive of GVC, would be expected to lead the combined group. \nGVC expects the deal to boost earnings from its first full year after completion, even if the Government decides on the biggest possible curbs on gaming machines. \nIt announced last month that the maximum stake would be cut from \u00a3100 to between \u00a32 and \u00a350. \nThe takeover terms value Ladbrokes Coral at \u00a33.1bn, rising to a maximum \u00a33.9bn depending on the outcome of the review by the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "keith alexander", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gvc 7th december 2017  bookmaker ladbrokes coral", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ladbrokes coral", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gvc ladbrokes coral", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gvc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of digital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gala coral", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ladbrokes", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sportingbet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:34.049+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "497b4c6897a09c26376976a6fe4509d4f00ebef0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTc.7SKN1VLlHGbZyMLjgeVL4e75CBsEaSHb6x4wvGbAMX5ZLiAy2Gwlcs4V78yMvUSmUEGIQujwQ--", "site_full": "mforum.cari.com.my", "site": "cari.com.my", "site_section": "https://mforum.cari.com.my/forum.php?mod=forumdisplay&fid=285", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "JualBeli - Shop Online/Classifieds - Forum - CARI Infonet ", "title": "Designed For DIY Multiple Builders Matrix RDA Only $27.29,free shipping", "title_full": "Designed For DIY Multiple Builders Matrix RDA Only $27.29,free shipping - JualBeli - Shop Online/Classifieds - Forum - CARI Infonet", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.746, "main_image": "http://www.3fvape.com/174121-home_default/authentic-matrix-rda-rebuildable-dripping-atomizer-w-bf-pin-silver-316-stainless-steel-24mm-diameter.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8413, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "497b4c6897a09c26376976a6fe4509d4f00ebef0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTc.7SKN1VLlHGbZyMLjgeVL4e75CBsEaSHb6x4wvGbAMX5ZLiAy2Gwlcs4V78yMvUSmUEGIQujwQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "3fvape", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "Designed For DIY Multiple Builders Matrix RDA Only $27.29,free shipping", "text": "Hello everyone.\nThis time we present to you the [B]Matrix RDA[/B] unboxing video.\n[B][U] Original Matrix RDA Rebuildable Dripping Atomizer with BF Pin [/U][/B] $27.29\nThe original Matrix RDA is a 24mm atty designed for multiple builds for DIY builders.

(AP) \u2014 For three days, attorneys representing the federal government and a former South Carolina officer charged in an unarmed black motorist's shooting death have presented technical testimony to a judge considering how much time Michael Slager should spend in federal prison. \nThat includes use of Slager's stun gun, which the former officer says Walter Scott grabbed and turned on him, causing Slager to fear for his life and shoot in self-defense. Slager, who is white, fired five times into Scott's back as he ran away. \nOn Thursday, attorneys are expected to call friends and relatives of both men who'll tell the judge how Scott's death and the officer's arrest have affected their lives.

Smith is now on 938 points while Kohli is on 893 points. \n\nFormer Australia captain Ricky Ponting is the only batsman to have been at the top in all three formats at the same time - in December-January 2005-06, while his compatriot Matthew Hayden is the other batsman to have topped all three formats. \n\nThough Smith enjoys a substantial lead over Kohli, the competition for second to fifth positions remains intense. Before this Test, only 11 points separated second-ranked Pujara from fifth-ranked Kohli. \n\nFollowing the latest performances, the gap has increased slightly with 28 points now separating second-ranked Kohli from fifth-ranked Williamson. \n\nAmong other Indians, opener Murali Vijay (up three places to 25th) and middle-order batsman Rohit Sharma (up six places to 40th) are the other batsmen to move up. \n\nPujara slipped two places to the fourth spot, while Ravindra jadeja slumped to the third position after losing a place in the bolwers ranking. R Ashwin was steady at the fourth spot. \n\nIn the allrounder list, Jadeja was at the second spot, while Ashwin lost a place to be at the fourth position. \n\nFor Sri Lanka, captain Dinesh Chandimal has gained eight places to take ninth position after finishing the series with 366 runs, the first time he has moved into the top 10. \n\nAll-rounder Angelo Mathews has moved up seven places to 23rd position after scoring 111 in the first innings while Dhananjaya de Silva's match-saving 119 in the second innings has lifted him nine places to 47th position. \n\nIn the ICC Test Team Rankings, India has lost one point but remains well ahead of South Africa at the top of the rankings, while Sri Lanka remains on its pre-series tally of 94 points in sixth place. \n\nRead this story in Marathi", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kohli", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ricky ponting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jadeja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kane williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe root", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pujara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murali vijay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angelo mathews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virat kohli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ravindra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohit sharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dinesh chandimal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhananjaya de silva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew hayden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david warner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cheteshwar pujara", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sri lanka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolkata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:35.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66a7227cc31a9e6462283bb4b714760b91ca0f6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.j7fAN7k2DYv8zO.IURH28-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66a7227cc31a9e6462283bb4b714760b91ca0f6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.j7fAN7k2DYv8zO.IURH28-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "chubytuby", "published": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Great video \r\nVery funny \r\nHahahahah I love ur mom \ud83d\udc95\r\nOmg this is great \r\n\ud83d\ude0dJust amazing\r\nLove love\r\nThis is great  \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\r\nhahahah \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\r\nAwww \r\nSuper cute \ud83d\ude0d\r\nOmg \r\nToo cute omg \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\r\nI've seen your videos before!

I spent the majority of the journey below decks and I was still cold. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to write anything if it was just the temperature, but there was the rocking too. There was a fire, which helped keep us warm, but I thought it was folly. I was assured it wasn\u2019t. The journey was long \u2013 a lot longer than many of us thought. There was small talk, some excitement about reaching Novia proper. Nothing really happened until the Tailor spoke.\u201cThis is going to be a long pilgrimage if we cannot find something to do with times like these,\u201d he said. There was agreement through the room.\u201cWe need to do something to pass the time. As we are a diverse group, we need to come up with something that we can all partake in equally and fairly.\u201d There was then a long debate about what we would do \u2013 games, knitting, cooking \u2013 utterly ridiculous things too that I doubt the one who suggested them could do. Finally, the Tailor said: \u201cWhat about stories? We can all tell stories when we have a long leg of our pilgrimage. I think we will be on this ship for quite some time so why not start now?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of story?\u201d the Scholar asked.\u201cWell, we are on a pilgrimage of Virtue, why not stories of Virtue? We have all heard them, and probably have even experienced something that falls in line with the Virtues.\u201d\u201cLike a fable or something?\u201d the Farmer asked.\u201cYes. Anything really. To pass the time and remain true to our pilgrimage.\u201d the Tailor responded. We were all agreed. There was another long pause. We all began thinking of stories that would pass the time and fit with the theme of our pilgrimage. The Soldier came down to check on us. He sat and listened to our discussion as we searched for someone and something to talk about.\u201cYou want to hear about Courage?\u201d he said, his voice rougher than it usually was. The hold went silent.\u201cEveryone knows about war. They hear about it, read about it \u2013 some even dream about it. People travel to see great battlefields of past wars imagining the strategies and skill the generals had. Others imagine the individuals that stood on the ground, weapon in hand. They hope to imagine the thrill of battle, the desire to know you are defending something bigger than just you \u2013 a village or a way of life. Everyone always goes to battlefields after the battles are done. They should go before.\u201cI heard a story about a scout. He had been chosen to head out to locate the rumoured forces of his nation\u2019s enemies. There was rumour of an attack, but no evidence. His nations armies would not be allowed to march unless there was evidence of a threat. This scout\u2019s general was prudent and sent the scout out to find evidence instead of waiting to see if evidence showed up.\u201cYou have to understand me, we are talking about rumour. Everyone was on edge. If they waited, they might be overrun. If they acted without threat, they may create a threat in neighbouring nations, or end the career of the general.\u201cWhen the scout asked where to go the general didn\u2019t have a location. The enemies were in the east, so that was where the general suggested to go first. But the north had mountain passes they may try to go through. Or, if they had allies and money, they may come from the south via fleet.\u201d\u2018I am only one scout, how can I go in three directions? If there is a threat to the north and I go south, I will fail,\u2019 the scout said. He wanted allies.\u201d\u2018If I send more scouts, our government will call me a warmonger looking for battle. They\u2019d say I\u2019m looking for trouble and stirring the pot. Our allies are trustworthy, I am told. But I cannot let the rumours breaking this trust go unheeded. I must act. You are the best scout in the nation. I am trusting you to make the right choice.\u2019\u201cThis was a great responsibility for the scout. He had the entire nation depending on him.\u201cHe chose to head west. It was the most obvious entrance to his nation. He felt that if an attack came, it would come from there. He walked to the border, spoke to farmers, traders and travellers. There was no news of a muster or movements of a large force.\u201cThe scout grew anxious. Either there was an attack coming from the north or south, or there was no need to worry. But he had to know for certain.\u201cHe chose to go north next. He went to the mountain passes and watched, listened and waited. He grew more anxious. He feared he had chosen incorrectly and that the opposing force was already in his lands.\u201cHe had a choice now, head back and suggest the attack could come from the south. It was the fastest, safest and easiest decision. The general would mobilize the army, head south and either be considered a hero, or declared a warmonger.\u201cIt was an easy way, and he would defend his people, but he had a duty. He started to head south, to see with his own eyes if there was an invasion. If there was no invasion, his people were anxious for no reason. But he would have done his duty in either case.\u201cAs he drew near to the coast he heard news of sightings of a large fleet. They had appeared this morning and were drawing near. They would arrive this evening. he had failed. The invaders were here and he had no idea of their numbers, composition or any weaknesses. He was still a day\u2019s travel from the coast.\u201cThe Scout came to the last town before the coast and showed his Royal Writ in the town square. He asked for the fastest horse and the strongest traveller. He promised them a wealthy payment from his own cache, then wrote it, signed it and sealed it with his personal seal, then sent them on their way.\u201d\u2018Early warning at the least,\u2019 he thought. But he needed to count the soldiers who landed, assess their numbers, equipment and supplies. He took another volunteer and went to the coast.\u201cThe army he saw was large. He couldn\u2019t see clearly as he was trying to hide himself and his companion behind a small hill. It was not an insurmountable problem, especially now that his first message would arrive.\u201cHe needed to see clearly their number and composition, but he also knew he would be seen clearly if he tried. He turned to his companion, a middle aged woman. He told her his plan, to see the invading army and to have her report back at the capital.\u201cThe scout stood tall atop the treeless hill, wearing the tabard of his order. He saw the numbers of his foes, he saw their composition and he saw their provisions. As he watched he told his companion everything even after he was spotted and shot by the sharpshooters. He fell saying what his companion must remember and write. She did, and fled as fast as she could.\u201cThe invaders must have been placated in their kill as they did not go further. Or they did not see his companion.\u201cHis companion made it to the general as the army was being mustered. She told the general what she heard the scout say and it changed the general\u2019s battle plans. Needless to say, the land was protected by the valorous actions of this scout.\u201d The Soldier fell silent. The hold creaked and shifted. No one spoke. The Cook looked more puzzled than anyone, but didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cYou should all get rest,\u201d the Soldier said, standing up and walking towards the stairs that led to the deck. \u201cWe will be docking in the morning, and who knows when we will stop next.\u201d Posted by Asclepius - Please note: This is a SotA community run project, and any and all content may deviate from the fictional canon of the game.

For us, there is no room for saying that I don't want to play this game. \n\n\"I don't know if too much cricket is being played, or (it's) repetition of the same series...

Adam Schiff said that Trump Jr. said he couldn't speak about the conversations with his father this summer because of attorney-client privilege, telling the committee a lawyer was present when he spoke to his father about the June 2016 meeting and the emails that led up to it.\nSchiff said that wasn't a valid excuse not to talk, saying \"the presence of counsel does not mean communications between father and son are privileged.\"\nThe Trump Tower meeting is a matter of keen interest to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is also investigating the meddling and whether there was any obstruction of justice. Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, attended the meeting with several Russian operatives under the impression that they might receive damaging information about the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton.\nMueller is also interested in the White House response to the meeting once it became public. The White House has said the president was involved in drafting an early statement saying the meeting primarily concerned a Russian adoption program, but emails later released by Trump Jr. showed he enthusiastically agreed to the sit-down with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others after he was promised dirt on his father's rival. Trump Jr. later said the promised material never materialized.\nTrump Jr. said during Wednesday's eight-hour interview that he spoke with President Donald Trump's communications aide Hope Hicks as early reports of the meeting emerged, according to one person familiar with the interview. The New York Times was first to report the existence of the meeting last July, and Trump Jr. released the emails detailing the planning for it several days later.\nHicks was with the president on Air Force One while they were writing the initial statement that said the meeting primarily concerned the adoption program.\nTrump Jr. also told the intelligence panel that he didn't tell his father about the 2016 meeting at the time that it happened, according to the person familiar with his interview. The person was not authorized to speak about the testimony and asked not to be identified.\nBoth the House and the Senate intelligence committees have been interested in the Trump Tower meeting and have interviewed several participants. The Senate Judiciary Committee is also investigating the meeting, and interviewed Trump Jr. behind closed doors in September.\nIn that interview, Trump Jr. cast the 2016 meeting as simply an opportunity to learn about Clinton's \"fitness, character or qualifications,\" insisting to investigators that he did not collude with Russia to hurt Clinton's campaign.\nThe Senate intelligence committee also hopes to interview Trump Jr. before the end of the year.\nKushner has spoken to both intelligence committees. The panels have also interviewed Ike Kaveladze, who was at the meeting as a representative of a Russian developer who once partnered with Trump to bring the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow, and Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist. A translator who was in attendance has also spoken to congressional investigators.\nLawmakers were also expected to ask Trump Jr. about his communications with WikiLeaks during and after the campaign. Trump Jr. released messages last month that showed him responding to the WikiLeaks' Twitter account three times, at one point agreeing to \"ask around\" about a political action committee WikiLeaks had mentioned. He also asked the site about a rumour about an upcoming leak, and tweeted a link that the account sent him.\nAlso Wednesday, the House intelligence panel released a transcript of an interview last week with Erik Prince, the founder of the security firm Blackwater and a prominent Trump supporter.\nAccording to the transcript, which was partially redacted, Prince told the panel he met a Russian with ties to President Vladimir Putin in the Seychelles islands earlier this year, but he denies he was representing Trump in the exchange.\nPrince said he and Kirill Dmitriev of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund had a 30-minute conversation in a hotel bar Jan. 11 and discussed oil and commodity prices and how Dmitriev wished the two countries' trade relationship would improve. The meeting has captured the interest of investigators since an April report in The Washington Post that it was an attempt to establish a back-channel line of communication between Trump and Putin.\nPrince denied that assertion in the interview.

Seeing things? Do elaborate.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"It's hard to say.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"At first, Danbur thought it was his water spirit.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"But water spirits can't talk? At all.\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"Hmm...\"\r\nThe Sirenian's upper teeth would become visable, being placed over his lip and bitting down a little. Making sure not to break his skin or worse, his teeth.\r\n\r\n\"...It said to do something bad. To the person Danbur was sparring. It was.. Trying to make Danbur kill him?\" he'd affirm, offering an even more lost glance towards the Neries. The merman clearly had zero idea what was happening right now, and was just attempting to get some clarity.\r\n\r\n\"The worst thing is... Danbur thinks he was close to doing it. It was like.. Danbur didn't have a choice? But managed to stop himself just in time...\"\r\n(Danbur)\r\n\r\nSipping his tea, Tarquin hummed contemplatively.\r\n\r\n\"I... Confess I am not the most knowledgable on Sirenian physiology or culture. Are you a wielder of occult magics at all? If so, it could be the madness manifesting, or if not perhaps it was simply the heat of the moment driving your bloodlust.\" He sighed, a bit at a loss. It could be a number of things!\r\n\r\n\"Aside from that, I can't think of much else it might be. It was controllable, you said? In that you felt a compulsion but staved it off?\"\r\n(Tarquin Brubeck)\r\n\r\nThe merman would raise the tea to his lips, sipping at it. Shaking somewhat.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Danbur is a weilder of occultic magic. He is a master of Mournegale, the best around in fact! Hmmm... What why would the madness start manifesting now though?\" he'd question away. Clearly he was lost in whatever this thing could be and was looking for any answers which he could find at all. He refused to believe that it was himeself. That he was striving for blood so much, that he'd have even considered harming another Valmasian.\r\n\r\n\"Um.. Yes. It felt like... Danbur wasn't in control of Danbur. But-- Danbur could stop Danbur?\" he'd state, only going on to confuse himself even more.\r\n(Danbur)\r\n\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"Chinese food is great\"\r\nTarquin, for his part, resisted the urge to shrug. This was obviously a serious issue for Danbur, and he didn't want to seem nonchalant.\r\n\r\n\"It's not unsurprising for it to manifest late. In fact, as time goes on and an occultist grows in power, it's more likely to come through, despite how in-control the magi might have been until then.\" Setting his teacup down, he smiled!\r\n\r\n\"There is a way to treat this, however! My wife, Rilla, is the wielder of a technique known as the Melody. It cannot... Cure such an affliction outright, as the root cause is the use of occultism, but it can mitigate the effects and suppress the madness it brings about. It's also known to be able to cure sin magi of their afflictions, if exposed to the Melody enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bishop Istvan is also learning it, though I don't know if he's gotten to mastering it just yet. It's worth a try though, the worst case scenario being that we eliminate that as a potential source.\"\r\n(Tarquin Brubeck)\r\n\r\nIt would seem that Danbur had indeed found his answer, perhaps going to Tarquin bore all the fruits he needed. It offered him an explination at the very least; and that was better than anything which he had before. So for that, he was greatful. Not to mention, the means to an end which was described by the Neries. Something which the Merman certainly took note of.\r\n\r\n\"Ooo. So, the voice... Was the madness? Danbur sees. Still, controlling Danbur was far more than he had ever expected. We should get this seen to as soon as possible! Yes!\" he'd exclaim, slowly regaining his upbeat voice, before momentarily finishing his cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\"So... Miss Rilla an fix Danbur's madness? With a song? Are you sure... That sounds far-fetched. Even to a Merman! If it helps Danbur, he'll need it for sure! Last thing he wants to do is kill any of his friends! Or wose, Kvaja.\" he'd state, rather honestly; \"Yes! At the worse case-- It is not the madnesss!\"\r\n(Danbur)\r\n\r\n\"Well again, it does not cure it outright. It merely treats it, as long as you are an occultist it will still affect you. Still,\" he conceded with a nod and a gesture of open palms towards Danbur, \"It speaks to your willpower that you've gotten this far without experiencing any signs of it. If the worst you're experiencing are voices, your willpower is considerable indeed.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded cheerfully! \"And yes, her technique is a rare one indeed. Incredibly powerful under the right circumstances, but it requires a specific sort of temperament and a very tight control on your emotions. That, and a considerable mastery of sound magic, which should go without saying.\" He smiled a bit of a goofy smile thinking about his wife. She truly was something else.\r\n\r\n\"I believe she is stationed down at Fort Coming Dawn, at the moment, setting up a hospital proper to treat allies that are injured at Galeford at a place nearby but still safely away from the front. We put in a therapy room, that much I know, so it should be helpful!\" As if suddenly remembering he also had something to say, he started a bit!\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Is there aught else? If not, the thing I wished to speak to you about! It's simple enough, I assure you, and a good thing!\"\r\n(Tarquin Brubeck)\r\n\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"Hmh. Danbur has been very focused... On doing his job! No time for madness! hmm.. Voices were, so weird. Danbur hadn't expereienced anything like it before.\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"Well, treatment is but one avenue to explore. She is likely busy at the moment, but if you swing by later she will likely be available.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur exclaims, \"Miss Rilla is impressive! Danbur never knew she knew such advanced sound magic, something he would have never thought a human could have mastered!\"\r\n\r\nDanbur exclaims, \"Yes, Danbur understands-- She is very busy!\"\r\n\r\nDanbur asks, \"What is it, you wish to talk to me about?\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"Ah! Well...\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"Rilla and I, as you may or may not know, are awfully fond of Kvaja. She watches our children from time to time.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur exclaims, \"Hmh. Kvaja mentioned she did that, yes!\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck exclaims, \"And well... She mentioned there not being very many opportunities for more... Traditional dating scenarios, here. Which is very true!\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"So we offered to treat you two to a nice, rather private dinner.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur exclaims, \"Oooo!\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"Something romantic.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"Danbur loves dinner, dinner is the best.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"Beats spending date-night in the forest.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"Doing thi-- Eating picnics.\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"Well she said you two liked looking at one another, eating, and doing... Yes, things.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur exclaims, \"Hmh! Yes!\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck exclaims, \"Well, a romantic dinner for two covers two of those things, and the third often comes after!\"\r\n\r\nDanbur exclaims, \"Yes!\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"Although-- It is a little odd at the moment.\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"Yes, we'll probably do it after the conflict is resolved.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"No. Not that.\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck asks, \"Oh?\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"Kvaja told Danbur today, that she loved someone else too? A girl.\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"Mmh. She's got... A lot of feelings, it seems.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"Yes. At first Danbur was against the idea.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"But then she mentioned her joining us-- And now Danbur doesn't know what to think.\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"Ahh. I see.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur asks, \"Do we invite the girl to the meal?\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"No, this one is for just the two of you.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"Ooo.\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"As for the girl, well...\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"Hrm. How do I put this...\"\r\n\r\nDanbur asks, \"Hm?\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"Sometimes, and I count myself among these people, people for... Varying reasons would prefer to not remain with just one individual.\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"It isn't that they aren't capable of loyalty or devotion, or love or any of that.\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck asks, \"It's that... It's hard to explain, really, but feelings often are, no?\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"Hmh! Yes! Feelings are all, difficult.\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck says, \"She cares about you, she certainly does. She is just capable of caring for more than one person in that way. It's no failing of hers, or yours. It's simply different.\"\r\n\r\nDanbur says, \"It is different..\"\r\n\r\nTarquin Brubeck asks, \"But no, this dinner date is all about celebrating the two of you. I haven't met this girl, but apparently things are even more complicated there so, who knows what will happen?\"\r\n\r\nDanbur exclaims, \"Hmh!

(AP Photo/Ivan Sekretarev) Ivan Sekretarev Save \nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Wrapping up one of Russia's most high-profile trials of the year, a former economic development minister charged with bribery on Thursday accused an oil executive of setting him up and apologized for \"turning back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nAlexei Ulyukayev, the highest-ranking Russian official to be arrested since 1993, was detained last year at the headquarters of Russia's largest oil producer, the state-owned Rosneft, after a sting operation by Russia's main intelligence agency. Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared \u2014 what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" \nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you're doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nUlyukayev asked for \"people's\" forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \"defending people's interests.\" \nThe court is expected to deliver the verdict next week. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The 13-track album includes 10 songs that have never been released. \nHendrix died in 1970 at age 27. The new album is the third volume in a trilogy from the guitar hero\u2019s archive. Valleys of Neptune was released in 2010, followed by People, Hell and Angels , released in 2013. \nEddie Kramer, who worked as recording engineer on every Hendrix album made during the artist\u2019s life, said in an interview that 1969 was \u201ca very experimental year\u201d for Hendrix, and that he was blown away as he worked on the new album. \n\u201cThe first thing is you put the tape on and you listen to it and the hairs just stand up right on the back of your neck and you go, \u2018Oh my God. This is too (expletive) incredible,\u201d said Kramer. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible thing. Forty, 50 years later here we are and I\u2019m listening to these tapes going, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s an amazing performance.'\u201d \nMany of the album\u2019s tracks were recorded by Band of Gypsys, Hendrix\u2019s trio with Buddy Miles and Billy Cox . Stephen Stills appears on two songs: \u201c$20 Fine\u201d and \u201cWoodstock.\u201d \n\u201cIt sounds like Crosby, Stills & Nash except it\u2019s on acid, you know,\u201d Kramer, laughing, said of \u201c$20 Fine.\u201d \n\u201cJimi is just rocking it,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing.\u201d \nJohnny Winter appears on \u201cThings I Used to Do\u201d; original Jimi Hendrix Experience members Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding are featured on \u201cHear My Train A Comin\u2034; and Lonnie Youngblood is on \u201cGeorgia Blues.\u201d \nKramer produced the album alongside John McDermott and Janie Hendrix, the legend\u2019s sister and president of Experience Hendrix. Kramer said though \u201cBoth Sides of the Sky\u201d is the last of the trilogy, someone could find new Hendrix music in an attic or a basement, which could be re-worked. \nHe also said they have live footage of Hendrix, some just audio and some in video, which they plan to release. \n\u201cIt was amazing just to watch him in the studio or live. The brain kicks off the thought process \u2014 it goes through his brain through his heart and through his hands and onto the guitar, and it\u2019s a seamless process,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a lead guitar and a rhythm guitar at the same time, and it\u2019s scary.

Cats! Post pictures of your cats, talk about cats, ask questions, get advice. \n2. We prefer that if you post photos, it be of your own cat(s) or one(s) you personally know. If clearly stated, photos of cat(s) you don't know is allowed, within reason. Lying and claiming/posting someone else's cat is your own will result in an immediate ban, with no warnings given. \n3. No NSFW content and no animal abuse/cruelty. \n4. No titles asking for upvotes (e.g. \"This cat didn't get any love in /r/aww \", \"it's my cake day\", \"my first post here\", \"any love for ...\"). \n5. Links asking for funding, competition votes or advertisement will be removed (see the list of subreddits below for a possible alternative). \n6. Be civil. We have a strong, bright-line policy against insults, namecalling or harassment, and will ban you without notice for such conduct. If a photo has a person in it along with a cat, don't even think of being creepy or rude to that person. This includes any comments on people's appearance, either positive or negative! \n7. Do not post personal information (this includes Facebook links as it can be easily traced back). \n8. Original content is preferred. No image macros, memes, or similar low-effort content. \n9. Mourning (RIP) posts are allowed. If you do not wish to see them, there are several filters in the sidebar to prevent them from appearing to you. \n10. Reposts are allowed (and crossposts are too, don't confuse them!), within reason. \n11. Your reddit account must be older than 10 days AND have at least 25 comment karma (NOT post karma, they're different!) to post a new thread in /r/cats . \nRedditors with accounts younger than 10 days who have a good reason for bypassing the age limitation may message the moderators for manual approval of your post, which will not be unreasonably withheld (however, it may take some time, so be patient!). \nThe moderators of this subreddit are not responsible for any medical advice given and we suggest that you don't post it. Go see a vet! \nSome of these rules are based upon Reddit's site-wide rules , Reddit's TOS and Reddiquette . \nFor donations and adoptions visit /r/care , /r/assistance , /r/rescuecats or your local subreddits, i.e. r/ city or state . \nCat Subreddit Lists ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "reddiquette", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:39.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67463c07ad427cc12c26a9ae72c06cab0dbc6263", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSilI2LpiMIFiWUyUe0CBGpaKz5MXb1f3rVUqUpjZHnTNa43hMHXgmvCUVVbXLmkglx80M9OmQCR1o_SWRE_IV178dN5MaB5MuUIMxVnDiZCA--", "site_full": "www.byronnews.com.au", "site": "byronnews.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.byronnews.com.au/feeds/rss/homepage/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "byronnews.com.au: Byron Shire News", "title": "Celebrate libraries at Heritage House", "title_full": "Celebrate libraries at Heritage House", "published": "2017-12-06T15:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2017/12/06/b881115752z1_20171206122045_000g8et49c22-0-93dnmm4q414kghjrdp2_ct300x300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "67463c07ad427cc12c26a9ae72c06cab0dbc6263", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSilI2LpiMIFiWUyUe0CBGpaKz5MXb1f3rVUqUpjZHnTNa43hMHXgmvCUVVbXLmkglx80M9OmQCR1o_SWRE_IV178dN5MaB5MuUIMxVnDiZCA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T15:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Celebrate libraries at Heritage House", "text": "Celebrate libraries at Heritage House 7th Dec 2017 8:00 AM READ ON: Celebrating libraries this Saturday is Jesse Blackadder.

Apparently we didn't mean what we said! \nWe said, \"push the envelope and get things done, but wait, not that fast!\u201d \nHe had no choice but to resign. \nTo top it all off in the Council Chambers, we saw a decision by councillors not to contract or engage in services under any existing or future contract with Downer EDI or any subsidiaries, including the RPQ Group and NSW Spray Seal, until they publicly withdraw from their agreement with Adani to construct and operate the Carmichael mine and publicly renounce any further involvement with Adani and the Carmichael mine. \nThe motion passed last week went on further to prevent Byron Council awarding any future contracts to any company involved with Adani or the construction of the Carmichael mine until they renounce any involvement with Adani or the \nmine. \nWhat does this mean? \nCouncil staff, under the guidance of the GM, have been looking for innovative ways to lower costs and one such decision has been to join three other councils in the region, namely Kyogle, Lismore and Richmond Valley to leverage our purchasing power by calling for joint tenders for products and services in our road projects. The benefits of the combined tenders were the buying power of the four councils working collaboratively rather than individually. \nThis decision isolates us so that we will be at least $50,000 worse off in our $40 million road spend this financial year. These contracts are mostly offered and accepted on a 10 year basis, so the $50,000 annual difference could well blow out to $500,000 especially if we have to break a contract or we can't secure the next cheapest quote. \nThis was a very dumb decision. We can only conclude this Council has a distinct dislike for any prudent financial management and instead is prepared to use our money to further a political cause. \nIt is difficult to see how the decision to boycott the companies supplying products and services to Adani will make one bit of difference, particularly if those companies are employing local people. \nWe might want to think more about our vote in council elections next time because voting Green now means voting for more pot holes and raises serious questions about supporting paid parking for raising revenue, just to be wasted with political decisions like this.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "byron shire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lismore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmichael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan hunter francis cloake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken gainger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan hunter", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "byron council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "byron shire council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nsw treasury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rpq group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council chambers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "downer edi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "byron bay town master plan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richmond valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyogle", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:39.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb5aafa729110812a9c85a9d2d42b7afd242f561", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg81JIx.ntQUW0REhzmj_u1Zp602yEE0efBdIlZMD8Wf6ItSSGTqIqg3L36OdyBUdgIMQdZi7vsLT3Vo5otZ3IaAGQPbnFPq0rYVIhS.9uyo_h8EZFnHODSyrd.ULpr84OU-", "site_full": "www.sawmillcreek.org", "site": "sawmillcreek.org", "site_section": "http://sawmillcreek.org/external.php?s=250d354d6efc0db9f14b0d68db5e2b0a&type=RSS2&forumids=10", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting"], "section_title": "Sawmill Creek Woodworking Community - SawMill Creek Classifieds", "title": "Hickory 2\" slabs...I have three that are 10' long....", "title_full": "Hickory 2\" slabs...I have three that are 10' long....", "published": "2017-12-07T09:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 32215, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb5aafa729110812a9c85a9d2d42b7afd242f561", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg81JIx.ntQUW0REhzmj_u1Zp602yEE0efBdIlZMD8Wf6ItSSGTqIqg3L36OdyBUdgIMQdZi7vsLT3Vo5otZ3IaAGQPbnFPq0rYVIhS.9uyo_h8EZFnHODSyrd.ULpr84OU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kelly Hanna", "published": "2017-12-07T09:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hickory 2\" slabs...I have three that are 10' long....", "text": "19 Hickory 2\" slabs...I have three that are 10' long....

It can be melted down to make things like electrical appliances, children\u2019s toys or even computers. \nHowever, China has announced that it will stop taking the UK\u2019s scrap from January and those in the industry are warning that the Government has no plan or infrastructure to deal with the situation. \nSimon Ellin, chief executive of the Recycling Association, told Sky News: We have been warning the Government for quite a long time that China will at some point say \u2018enough is enough. We don\u2019t want the world\u2019s garbage. We want to stimulate our own internal collection\u2019. We have seen it coming. \nIn 2016 the UK exported 790,000 tonnes of scrap plastic. Of that, 55% went to China or Hong Kong. \nThat meant that household plastics going to those countries accounted for a quarter of all the UK\u2019s recycling exports. \nElena Polisano, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: Instead of confronting our growing problem with throwaway plastic at home, we have been shipping it off to places like China where it\u2019s easier for us to ignore. \nNow that China has decided they\u2019ve had enough of our waste, it\u2019s obvious that the UK\u2019s recycling system simply can\u2019t cope with the mountain of plastic waste we generate. It\u2019s time to stop kicking the plastic bottle down the road and finally getting to grips with the problem at source. \nThe concern for many is where much of the UK\u2019s plastic recycling will end up if it is not being exported abroad. Some could be burned, but many fear scrap could make its way into our oceans, harming marine and bird life. \nPlastic pollution in the ocean has been the target of Sky\u2019s Ocean Rescue campaign. \nReducing single use plastic and making products easier to recycle could help combat the problem, but with China\u2019s announcement and no clear plan from the Government, there are growing concerns. \nWhen questioned about the issue last month, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said he hadn\u2019t given the subject much thought, which angered many industry experts. \nIn response, a Defra spokesperson said: We are continuing to work with the waste industry and the Environment Agency to understand the impact across the sector of the Chinese government\u2019s proposed restrictions on waste imports. \nWe are also looking at ways to process more of our recycling as part of our resources and waste strategy. \n:: Find out more about Sky\u2019s campaign to help save our seas, and get involved by visiting the Sky Ocean Rescue website where you can watch our documentary, A Plastic Tide.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon ellin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael gove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elena polisano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ocean rescue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recycling association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenpeace uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environment agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sky ocean rescue", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:40.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b0c8d4ebf4b0f2abedd1eafeddd490e0ba6f24a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrq..gqyQUPoGCpwfHbZ03BjtQOOoQyuY_SSnXFN3dn4W9OH4IpkN41RdaBvTen8Nue0aRlaTXVi4r..I4yHIWhjIAAr0D.WqY-", "site_full": "bimmersport.co.nz", "site": "bimmersport.co.nz", "site_section": "http://bimmersport.co.nz/forum/47-trademe-discussions/", "site_categories": ["vehicles", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "TradeMe discussions - bimmersport.co.nz", "title": "E9 uploaded on a Chvvy ad by accident - -", "title_full": "E9 uploaded on a Chvvy ad by accident - - TradeMe discussions - bimmersport.co.nz", "published": "2017-11-23T15:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f040ce32f536e414c5adb992153ed31b2281e7e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrq..gqyQUPoGCpwfHbZ03BjtQOOoQyuY_SSnXFN3dn4W9OH4IpkN41RdaBvTen8Nue0aRlaTXVi4r..I4yHIWhuGx.E1b6w4FHLbMf_.5gZg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "eliongater", "published": "2017-11-25T11:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "That looks mint.

An alternative to the itinerary above would be to miss out Islamabad/ cut Karachi by a day and do 4-5 days in Hunza instead but everything I\u2019ve read suggests its too cold/not worth visiting in winter? Can anyone give me actual temperatures in degrees C and whether you think a visit in January is worth it? ANS: Temperature in Hunza will be -10 C it will be extreme Cold if you like the winter then you can go and enjoy the snow capped mountains. if not they explore the culrural places in Punjab , KPK regions 3.
