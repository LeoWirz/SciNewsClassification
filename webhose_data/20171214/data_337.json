The ventilator system was withdrawn and an ambu bag was also not provided. This eventually led to the girl's death,\" Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij said.The Haryana Government will now file an FIR against the Fortis Memorial Research Institute (FMRI) under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for death due to negligence and will also ask the Medical Council of India (MCI) to take an action against the hospital which may include cancelling of its licence.The committee also found the Fortis Hospital guilty of overcharging for medicines and platelets and has sent a notice for cancellation of its blood bank's licence.It was also found by the committee that the hospital did not provide 20 per cent RBD to the patient's family, violating a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA).Parents of the seven-year old girl, who died on November 21 of Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS), had alleged the Fortis Hospital for charging Rs 16 lakh for the 15-day treatment.The hospital, however, had denied the allegations.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jayant singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anil vij", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fortis hospital", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fortis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haryana government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortis memorial research institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medical council of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haryana urban development authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fmri", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gurugram", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:45.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "291bf330fea9f2f4d88df9beab6d6cccdfa81725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7UijQ.Mfm6_lNccIo_wjbUkdrk_B5gc0ombbx53kDP76x9C.ruJX5T0iB5IgCwU1jra3.l.uFTIrVpuRAS.Ik4wmEWjU4oPNW__GSN8goCHaebkr_BfuK", "site_full": "www.golfwrx.com", "site": "golfwrx.com", "site_section": "http://www.golfwrx.com/forums/forum/22-tour-and-pre-release-equipment/", "site_categories": ["golf", "sports"], "section_title": "Tour and Pre-Release Equipment - GolfWRX", "title": "Can you still pay to go to the Kingdom in Carlsbad? - WRX Club Techs", "title_full": "Can you still pay to go to the Kingdom in Carlsbad? - WRX Club Techs - GolfWRX", "published": "2017-12-06T12:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://www.golfwrx.com/forums/public/style_images/golfwrx/meta_image.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18741, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21876b249d0bda4b5177748d4ca66900de53d5dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7UijQ.Mfm6_lNccIo_wjbUkdrk_B5gc0ombbx53kDP76x9C.ruJX5T0iB5IgCwU1jra3.l.uFTIrVpuRAS.Ik4wmEWjU4oPNW__GSN8goCJhr0zglA0ZpYjovpeuNS0w-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "13 Feedback Score", "published": "2017-12-06T14:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Posted 06 December 2017 - 06:27 PM\nBrizam, on 06 December 2017 - 06:24 PM, said:\nThat\u0092s not too bad really.

Israeli soldiers turned water cannons on Palestinians in Bethlehem, and fired tear gas. Around 15 demonstrators were reportedly wounded, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.\nWatch video 00:25 Merkel 'not in agreement' with Trump's embassy move The Palestinian Authority has called a general strike in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and schools and shops in these areas remain closed. Hundreds took to the streets on Wednesday, burning American and Israeli flags and 10 Palestinians were arrested in East Jerusalem overnight after Molotov cocktails were thrown. \nHamas' declaration has heightened fears that violence and unrest on the streets of the Israeli-occupied territories could escalate in the coming days. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated that the Israeli military would be deploying more troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday's planned protests.\nRead more: Donald Trump's Jerusalem decision sparks global outcry \nThere is a general strike in Gaza and shops and schools remain closed\nWorldwide condemnation \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is the latest head of state to publicly criticize Trump's decision. He described Trump's actions as throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire.\"\nSaudi Arabia's royal court made a rare public rebuke of the US on Thursday, saying Trump's announcement was \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" The US' move puts the Sunni nation in a difficult position, because the kingdom has had close ties to Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\nIraq's senior Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, said Trump's announcement had \"hurt the feelings of hundreds of millions of Arabs and Muslims.'' He called on the \"Umma,\" or Islamic nation, to combine forces to restore Palestinian sovereignty over Jerusalem \u2014 no matter how long it takes.\nThe West Bank has erupted in violence\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo, leader of the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, said on Thursday, \"Such unilateral recognition violates various resolutions of the UN Security Council, of which the United States is a permanent member. It could also shake global stability.\" \nEight members of the UN Security Council, including Britain, France, Egypt, Italy and Sweden have called for an emergency meeting to discuss the US' move, which will be held on Friday.\nThis comes after many countries sought to distance themselves from US policy on Wednesday. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on Twitter that the German government \"does not support this position because the status of Jerusalem can only be negotiated within the framework of a two-state solution.\" \nTrump bound to Israel forever \nSpeaking at Israel's foreign ministry on Thursday, Israel's Netanyahu was full of praise for Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \"President Trump bound himself forever with the history of our capital,\" he said. \"His name will now be proudly displayed alongside other names in the city's glorious history.\"\nIsraeli and American flags were hung on Jerusalem's city hall\nNetanyahu also claimed that Israel is in contact with other countries that plan to follow the US' move. \"We are already in contact with other countries that will make a similar recognition, and I have no doubt that as soon as the American embassy moves to Jerusalem, and before that, many embassies will move to Jerusalem.\"\nHowever, he did not name any of these countries.\nRead more: Opinion Trump wantonly fans the flames of Middle East conflict \nTwo-state solution further out of reach \nTrump's recognition of the contested capital has been interpreted by Palestinians as putting an end to the possibility of a two-state solution. In his speech, Trump claimed, \"The US remains deeply committed to helping facilitate a peace agreement that is acceptable to both sides,\" he said. \"I intend to do everything in my power to help forge such an agreement.\"\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has called for a new Palestinian intifada\nHowever, the secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Saeb Erekat, said that Trump had destroyed all hopes of such a peace deal. \"He destroyed the two-state solution.\" Meanwhile, Hamas has said that Trump's decision will \"open the gates of hell\" on US interests in the region.\nPalestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas has described Trump's announcement as \"reprehensible.\" He said that it will undermine peace efforts and embolden Israel \"to pursue the policy of occupation, settlement, apartheid and ethnic cleansing.\"\nAbbas is traveling to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II, who is seen as the Palestinians' closest Arab ally. There is speculation that the two leaders may try to coordinate a response to Trump's announcement.\nThe competing claims to Jerusalem, particularly the Old City, with its significant Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites, lies at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump's decision has profound symbolic meaning for both sides.\nA spokesman for Lebanon's Shiite movement Hezbollah, which is part of the government in Beirut, described Trump's declaration as a \"treacherous and malicious aggression\" against the rights of Palestinians,\" adding that the only way for them to restore their lost rights was through armed \"resistance.\"\nLebanon is technically still at war with Israel, although there have been no recorded instances of fighting since 2006. Repeated Hezbollah attacks forced Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon in 2000, and the group went to war with Israel once again in 2006.\nCity of strife: Jerusalem's complex history Jerusalem, the city of David According to the Old Testament, David, king of the two partial kingdoms of Judah and Israel, conquered Jerusalem from the Jebusites around 1000 BC. He moved his seat of government to Jerusalem, making it the capital and religious center of his kingdom. The Bible says David's son Solomon built the first temple for Yahweh, the God of Israel. Jerusalem became the center of Judaism.\nCity of strife: Jerusalem's complex history Under Persian rule The Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (3rd from the left) conquered Jerusalem in 597 and again in 586 BC, as the Bible says. He took King Jehoiakim (5th from the right) and the Jewish upper class into captivity, sent them to Babylon and destroyed the temple. After Persian king Cyrus the Great seized Babylon, he allowed the exiled Jews to return home to Jerusalem and to rebuild their temple. \nCity of strife: Jerusalem's complex history Under Roman and Byzantine rule Since the year 63 CE, Jerusalem was under Roman rule. Resistance movements rapidly formed amongst the population, so that in 66 CE, the First Jewish\u2013Roman War broke out. The war ended 4 years later, with a Roman victory and a renewed destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. The Romans and Byzantines ruled Palestine for approximately six hundred years.\nCity of strife: Jerusalem's complex history Conquest by the Arabs Over the course of the Islamic conquest of Greater Syria, Muslim armies also reached Palestine. By order of the Caliph Umar (in the picture), Jerusalem was besieged and captured in the year 637 CE. In the following era of Muslim rule, various, mutually hostile and religiously divided rulers presided over the city. Jerusalem was often besieged and changed hands several times.\nCity of strife: Jerusalem's complex history The Crusades From 1070 CE onward, the Muslim Seljuk rulers increasingly threatened the Christian world. Pope Urban II finally called for the crusade. A total of five Crusades set out to conquer Jerusalem within 200 years. In 1244, however, the crusaders finally lost control of the city and it once again fell under Muslim rule. \nCity of strife: Jerusalem's complex history The Ottomans and the British After the conquest of Egypt and Arabia by the Ottomans, Jerusalem became the administrative seat of an Ottoman administrative district in 1535. In its first decades of Ottoman rule, the city saw a clear revival. With a British victory over Ottoman troops in 1917, Palestine fell under British rule. Jerusalem went to the British without a fight. \nCity of strife: Jerusalem's complex history The divided city After World War II, the British gave up their Palestinian Mandate. The UN voted for a division of the country in order to create a home for the survivors of the Holocaust. Some Arab states then went to war against Israel and conquered part of Jerusalem. Until 1967, the city was divided into an Israeli west and a Jordanian east.\nCity of strife: Jerusalem's complex history East Jerusalem goes back to Israel In 1967, Israel waged the Six-Day War against Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Israel took control of the Sinai, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. Israeli paratroopers gained access to the Old City and stood at the Wailing Wall for the first time since 1949. East Jerusalem is not officially annexed, but rather integrated into the administration.\nCity of strife: Jerusalem's complex history Muslim pilgrimage to Israel Israel has not denied Muslims access to its holy places. The Temple Mount is under an autonomous Muslim administration; Muslims can enter, visit the Dome of the Rock and the adjacent Al-Aqsa mosque and pray there.\nCity of strife: Jerusalem's complex history Unresolved status Jerusalem remains to this day an obstacle to peace between Israel and Palestine. In 1980, Israel declared the whole city its \"eternal and indivisible capital.\" After Jordan gave up its claim to the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1988, the state of Palestine was proclaimed.

Can it be done, seriously? Of course it can. \nThousands of people are doing just that. You can find lots of tutorials out there (free and paid) that give you the nuts and bolts about earning an income online. \nI\u2019m going to go a somewhat different direction in this article. \nWhat many people try to do is set up their business like a traditional business. Perhaps they want to have consulting service. If they are graphics designers, they set up a graphics shop. If they are gardeners, they set up a gardening service online. \nBut there are a few problem with the traditional approach. \n* No momentum. You stop putting in effort. Business dries up. No one really cares if you\u2019re gone. There\u2019s always someone else ready and eager to take your place in the niche. \n* You have to do it all \u2013 all the time. Each new client needs to be given your full-time and devotion. \nYou should consider enhancing your business with methods and tools that will let you overcome these two problems. \nYou may have heard that you should start building a list of people who desire to receive your emails. \nThe reason you want to do this is so they can buy your products or service you have for sale. Additionally, if you do it correctly, you\u2019ll build relationships with people on your list. \nThis in turn will let you not only sell to them, but open opportunities, perhaps, joint ventures, or help you solve a problem, etc. \nHere are a few recommendations for doing this the right way: \n#1 \u2013 Use a good sequential autoresponder to automate and manage your list. There are a few good autoresponder services available. Two of the more popular are: \nGetResponse \n\n#2 \u2013 Create or get rights to an autoresponder series that combines both information and a sales pitch for a single product. Don\u2019t mix up a lot of different products or you\u2019ll dilute the power of repetition. \nIf you\u2019re no good at it or if you are nervous about writing, you may have to farm out the task. You can go to a website like Freelance Writing to find someone willing to work with you at very reasonable rates. \nFreelance Writing \nThe autoresponse series automates the building of a relationship between you and the people on your list. Once it concludes, you can either start it all over again, or you can simply send them periodic emails that relate to the same topic. \nAdvanced hint: you can combine several series sequentially. For example, emails 1 \u2013 5 could be about product #1. Email 6 could tell what you just covered and set up Emails 7 through 15 that could sell product #2. Email 16 could set up selling product #3 and so forth. \n#3 \u2013 Sign up with various affiliate programs that YOU have reason to like. It is a must that you respect these programs or it will come back to bite you in the long run. Your credibility is at stake so do your homework here. Now as you sign up for these, you can incorporate them into your AR series. \n#4 \u2013 Similar to #3, sign up for various multi-level programs. Again, make sure you like and respect them or your credibility is sure to suffer. The beauty of these programs is that you begin to leverage the work of those who sign up under you (your downline). If you attract go-getters, this can pave your way to a very impressive passive income. \nOnce you have at least the first two items in place, you can now start promoting your site. You\u2019ll need to come up with reasons for people to sign up for your ezine, but that subject (copywriting) is beyond the scope of this article, and we\u2019ll cover it soon in another email. \nAs people sign up for your list, they\u2019ll start receiving your series. You won\u2019t have to mail them individually. They\u2019ll just plug themselves in and the system does the rest. \nThe power of this system is that while you do a good deal of work to get it set up, once it is set up, you should have very little to do, other than to tweak it here and there to make it perform better. \nWith the time you will eventually get, you be more able to promote your site. And as people get into your funnel, you start making money. \nThen you can begin tweaking your sales copy, increasing the effectiveness of your ads, and more. \nDo this and you\u2019ll enhance your business far beyond the traditional ways. You\u2019ll generate momentum that persists even if you take some time off, you\u2019ll automate the building of relationships with members of your list, and you\u2019ll be able to build on what you\u2019ve got.

What is more surprising is that this will be one of Intuit\u2019s largest acquisitions although with estimated revenue of around $40m (according to Forbes) TSheets will not have a material effect on Intuit\u2019s 2018 revenue. The deal is not expected to close until H2 2018. \nIn our view, the rationale for the acquisition is part of the work to build out QuickBooks as an open platform, a goal that was emphasised when we met the Intuit exec team earlier this year.

In the end, a judge sentenced Slager to 20 years in prison, giving the Scott family the justice they had sought ever since a stranger came to them with the shocking video of Scott being killed. \n\u201cI forgive Michael Slager. I forgive you,\u201d Scott\u2019s mother, Judy, said as she turned toward her son\u2019s killer. \u201cI pray for you, that you would repent and let Jesus come in your life.\u201d \nSitting just a few feet away, Slager wiped tears from his eyes and mouthed: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \nThe punishment wrapped up a case that became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Slager, 36, is one of only a few police officers to go to prison for a fatal shooting, and his sentence is by far the stiffest since the shootings came under extra scrutiny in recent years. \nAttorneys for the former North Charleston officer said he shot the 50-year-old Scott in self-defense after the two fought and Scott grabbed Slager\u2019s stun gun. They said race didn\u2019t play a role in the shooting and Slager never had any \u201cracial animus\u201d toward minorities. \nStill, Slager pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott\u2019s civil rights. As part of a plea agreement reached in May, prosecutors dropped state murder charges. \n\u201cThis is a tragedy that shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d U.S. District Judge David Norton said. \nSlager apologized to the Scott family, calling Scott\u2019s mother and brothers by their names. \n\u201cWith my actions that day, Walter Scott is no longer with his family, and I am responsible for that,\u201d Slager said. Of their forgiveness, he added: \u201cI am very grateful for that.\u201d \nSlager\u2019s emotions stood in stark contrast to his stoic demeanor during his state murder trial when jurors deadlocked over a verdict. He has several weeks to appeal his sentence and will be housed at the Charleston County jail until he\u2019s assigned to a federal prison. \nAfter the sentencing, Judy Scott and Walter\u2019s two brothers told reporters that, while they had made peace with the case, they remained adamant the officer should pay for his crime. \n\u201cWho are we not to forgive?\u201d Rodney Scott said. \nA bystander recorded the shooting on a cellphone, and it was shared around the world, setting off protests across the U.S. as demonstrators said it was another egregious example of police officers mistreating African-Americans. \nSlager fired at Scott\u2019s back from 17 feet (5 meters) away. Five of eight bullets hit him. \nThe video was seized on by many as vivid proof of what they had been arguing for years: that white officers too often use deadly force unnecessarily against black people. \nWhen the jury failed to reach a verdict in the state murder case, many black people and others were shocked and distressed, because the video seemed to some to be an open-and-shut case. Some despaired of ever seeing justice. \nThe shooting angered local African-Americans who complained for years that North Charleston police harassed blacks, pulling them over or questioning them unnecessarily as they cracked down on crime. But after the shooting, the Scott family successfully pleaded for calm, asking everyone to let the justice system run its course. \nTwo months after the shooting, a young white man killed nine black church members in a racially motivated massacre during a Bible study in Charleston. The family members of those victims struck a similar forgiveness tone after that attack. \nBefore Slager\u2019s sentence was handed down, the judge had to decide whether the shooting amounted to second-degree murder or manslaughter. Norton found that it was murder. \n\u201cNo matter what sentence I give, neither the Scott family nor the Slager family is going to think that it\u2019s right,\u201d the judge said. \nAfter the shooting, Slager picked up his stun gun and placed it next to Scott. Slager contended he was securing the weapon. Prosecutors think he put it there to bolster his self-defense story. \nThe judge also found that Slager obstructed justice when he made statements to state police after the shooting. \nA pre-sentencing report for Slager found that he committed manslaughter and recommended 10 to nearly 13 years in prison. But the judge was not bound by that review. \nIf Slager had faced another state trial and been convicted of murder, he could have been sentenced to anywhere from 30 years to life in prison. \nConvictions in police officer shootings are uncommon in the U.S. and prison time is even rarer. \nSouth Carolina has been aggressive in charging white officers who shoot unarmed black people. Four have pleaded guilty in state or federal court in the past six years. But only Slager and former state trooper Sean Groubert, who shot a man as he tried to get his wallet during a seat belt violation check, will have been sent to prison. Groubert was sentenced to five years behind bars. \nKinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP . Read her work at https://apnews.com/search/meg%20kinnard .

But that bubble burst in September 2017 when the Chinese Central Bank completely banned all ICOs . In spite of the ban, Bitcoin has managed to flourish, increasing by over 144% since the ban. Still, China isn\u2019t worried. According to the PBOC, Bitcoin is dying. \nSpeaking at a financial forum in Shanghai over the weekend, the deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, was asked to give his view on the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price. He was quoted as saying (translated): \nIf we had not shut down bitcoin exchanges and cracked down on ICOs several months ago, if China still accounted for more than 80% of the world\u2019s bitcoin trading and ICO fundraising, everyone, what would happen today? Thinking of this question makes me scared. \nPan further underscored his opinion of the digital currency by citing Eric Pichet, an economist and professor at the Kedge Business School in France, who just last week wrote an article in La Tribune (link in French) where he declared that Bitcoin is merely a bubble waiting to burst. As far as Pichet is concerned, Bitcoin is the \u201cnew avatar of the long series of speculative follies\u201d like the Tulip Mania in 1637 or the Internet bubble of 2000. \nPichet believes \u2013 like Pan \u2013 that it is just a matter of time before Bitcoin dies, whether through a massive and unrecoverable hack of the blockchain or through a joint initiative on the part of global governments to ban the digital currency. \nConcluding his talk, Pan again quoted Pichet, saying: \nAs Keynes has taught us, \u2018the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\u2019 There is only one thing left to do: Sit by the river bank and see bitcoin\u2019s body pass by one day. Gongsheng Pan, deputy governor PBoC: There is only one thing left to do: Sit by the river bank and see bitcoin\u2019s body pass by one day https://t.co/DvID4Hz8kl \n\u2014 cnLedger (@cnLedger) December 4, 2017 \nUnlike the Indonesian government , whose fear is the undermining of the country\u2019s fiat currency, China\u2019s fear is the social chaos that could erupt as a result of the losses in investments made by small investors in their financial market, and Pan\u2019s stance confirms this. The country has seen the recent effects of regional commodity exchanges and peer-to-peer lending schemes that resulted in losses in the millions of dollars. As far as China is concerned, investments and trading in Bitcoin are no different from those scenarios. So Where did the Bitcoin Mines go? \nAfter China\u2019s ban on ICOs and exchanges, trading platforms, bitcoin wallet providers, and mining pools had to move their operations abroad . This didn\u2019t stop die-hard investors, however. They merely turned to peer-to-peer marketplaces to continue trading or, in some cases, followed providers to their new destinations. \nIs China\u2019s goal to wipe out mining and trade completely? Rumors have been floating around for months that Beijing is getting ready to ban Bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency trading altogether.

It is important to evolve a strategy which ensures that only that much goes out to the media which is necessary for the information of the public. There are some issues related to defence which have to be kept out of the public domain. We can develop a relationship with the media through building confidence and gaining their support rather than keeping them away.\"\"In the good old days, we always said we do not discuss politics and women in the Army in any establishment, but gradually we find that we are inching towards that but that is best avoided.

The Kremlin is not amused. \n\"We are not allowed to honor a Russian statesman in Russia. Russian officials are fighting Boris Nemtsov even after his death.\"\nVladimir Kara-Murza, a longtime Nemtsov aide, did not mince his words at a city council hearing on renaming a stretch of the road outside the Washington Russian Embassy compound to Boris Nemtsov Plazaon Wednesday.\nThe new legislation sponsored by two D.C. Council members, Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, and Mary M. Cheh, would symbolically honor the pro-democracy Russian dissident and influential opposition leader who was gunned down in Moscow in 2015 .\nWatch video 01:25 Share A fearless rebel: Second anniversary of Nemtsov's murder Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine \nPermalink http://p.dw.com/p/2YLxp\nA fearless rebel: Second anniversary of Boris Nemtsov's murder Many believe the 55-year-old former deputy prime minister was assassinated for his opposition to Vladimir Putin's regime, or by dubious nationalist forces who were inspired by a state-controlled propaganda campaign calling the political opposition traitors.\n\"There is no doubt the murder was motivated by his political beliefs, his popularity and his frequent criticism of the Russian government,\" Cheh declared during the public hearing.\nAccording to Mendelson this new legislation is a strong \"statement in support of democratic values,\" and would send a clear signal to Russia. The honorary naming would also support those who \"show courage, tenacity and risk their freedom or even their very lives for the principles of democracy,\" Cheh added.\nHigh-profile murder \nNemtsov, a star politician whose career flourished during the 1990s, was long considered a potential successor to Boris Yeltsin, the first President of the Russian Federation. With Putin's rise to power and efforts to dismantle the the country's fragile new institutions, Nemtsov grew into a determined opponent of the president.\nRead more : Opinion: Political assassination of Boris Nemtsov still not solved \nOne of his final acts was to denounce the invasion of Ukraine. Just hours before his assassination, he had called on Muscovites to protest against the economic crisis and the war in Ukraine during a radio appearance. He was also supposed to lead a major protest march later that week.\nThe move to name a plaza in Nemtsov's name is unlikely to go down well in Moscow\nOn Feb. 27, 2015, Nemtsov was walking across a heavily guarded bridge, meters from one of the Kremlin towers, when he was shot four times from a passing car late at night.\n\"He [Nemstov] was smeared by state media as a traitor, he was arrested and jailed for peaceful demonstrations. He was silenced the only way he could have been,\" Kara-Murza said, who says he himself has been poisoned twice , presumably because of his political beliefs. \nThe murder is considered the most high-profile political killing in Russia since Putin's rise to power in 2000.\nNo justice for Nemtsov \nAuthorities later arrested five men , all ethnic Chechens from the volatile North Caucasus region. In June last year, a jury convicted them of murdering Nemtsov in exchange for a payment of 15 million rubles ($253,000, \u20ac215,000) offered by a Chechen security official named Ruslan Mukhudinov, who is still at large. Zaur Dadaev was found guilty of murdering Nemtsov while the other four were convicted of aiding in the assassination.\nAs a former officer in the security forces, Dadaev was closely connected to to Chechnya's Kremlin-backed, and notoriously brutal leader Ramzan Kadyrov who is a fierce defender of Putin. To date, the Putin regime has not identified or held responsible those who ordered Nemtsov's murder more than two years ago.\nNemtsov's followers are still seeking justice and keeping his memory alive. \"For more than 1,000 days, whether its snowing or raining, a group of volunteers has been bringing flowers, portrait and candles for my father to the Bolshoi Moskvoretsky Bridge, where he was killed,\" Zhanna Nemtsova, Nemtsov's daughter, who works as a journalist at DW, said during the hearing. According to her, the anti-democratic nationalist movement, presumably on the orders of high-ranking Russian officials, has dismantled the makeshift memorial more than 70 times since. \"The current political Russian regime wants to eradicate all memories of my father, since it believes correctly that symbols are important,\" she said.\nAn act of remembrance \nMembers of Congress and D.C. Council members have a history of renaming or attempting to rename streets in the city to make political statements.

Farmers in Vietnam's main coffee-growing province Daklak were offering coffee beans <COFVN-DAK> at 37,300-37,600 dong ($1.64-$1.66) per kg, compared with last week's range of 37,100-37,700 dong, traders said. The 5-percent black and broken grade 2 robusta <COFVN-G25-SAI> was quoted at a discount of $65-$75 per tonne to the ICE March futures contract. That compared to a discount of $50-$65 a week ago, but independent analyst Nguyen Quang Binh said trading was thin as buyers hesitated. \"Demand from buyers was strangely weak,\" Binh said. \"They have only bought beans for contracts due for delivery.\" Another trader, based in Ho Chi Minh city, said exporters accepted higher prices to secure contracts, while coffee roasters were not looking to buy and farmers held back beans to wait for better offers. Coffee roasters, the main buyers of robusta, were discouraged by weather changes which slowed down the drying process. \"Trading would pick up when beans harvest goes back on the rails and coffee roasters started buying,\" the trader said. Traders estimated 90,000-95,000 tonnes of Vietnamese coffee beans were shipped in November, after started low last month at the beginning of the 2017/2018 crop year. In Indonesia, the grade 4 defect 80 robusta was set with a $110-$120 a tonne premium to the January contract. A trader in Lampung, the main coffee growing province in Indonesia, said prices rose in line with the London market and traders were becoming more speculative in setting prices amid depleted stocks. \"The price jump did not have any effect (oo trade),\" the trader said, adding that no transaction took place this week.

The Wednesday night clashes broke out shortly after Trump officially declared the disputed city of Jerusalem al-Quds as Israel's capital, despite warnings from around the world that the measure risks triggering a fresh wave of violence in the Middle East. \nIn a speech at the White House earlier in the day, Trump said his administration would also begin a years-long process of moving the American embassy in Tel Aviv to the holy city. The announcement was a major shift by Washington that overturns decades of US foreign policy. In a televised speech after Trump's announcement, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Jerusalem al-Quds is the \"eternal capital of the State of Palestine.\" Abbas added that the US president's speech was \"tantamount to the United States abdicating its role as a peace mediator.\" Meanwhile, Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip staged a demonstration against the US and Israel, condemning Trump's recognition of Jerusalem al-Quds as Israel's capital. The Palestinian resistance movement of Hamas which rules Gaza condemned the US move as \"flagrant aggression against the Palestinian people,\" and called on Arabs and Muslims to \"undermine the US interests in the region\" and to \"shun Israel.\" Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said in a statement that the Palestinian people \"know how to respond properly to the disregard of their feelings and sanctuaries.\" He added that the decision \"will not change the facts of history and geography.\" As many protesters have gathered outside the US consulate in Istanbul in reaction to Trump\u2019s announcement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry denounced the speech as an \"irresponsible statement.\" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also said Trump's recognition does not automatically make Jerusalem al-Quds the capital of Israel. Apart from numerous condemnations from many other world leaders, such as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, UK Prime Minister Theresa May, and French President Emmanuel Macron, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres implicitly criticized Trump's announcement, warning that the Palestinian city\u2019s status must be resolved through direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. \"From day one as secretary general of the United Nations, I have consistently spoken out against any unilateral measures that would jeopardize the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians,\" Guterres said. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ismail haniyeh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio guterres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guterres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mevlut cavusoglu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bashar al-assad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foreign ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:49.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6a8792c0d7b0bb9f51b78a8aa14498572392de3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc74yNZ7KwBr7m.cJOc_HIYR", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/v/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/v/ - Video Games - 4chan", "title": "Which would you recommend at this point?", "title_full": "/v/ - Which would you recommend at this point?

With this one, it is pretty interesting ... It is a fair price.\u201d\nThe fund will pay 92.75 billion yen ($823.20 million) for its stake, valuing the portfolio at 132.5 billion yen, while partner Tokyu Land Corporation will acquire the remaining 30 percent, the fund said.\nThree properties are in the shopping district of Shibuya while the two others are in the upmarket area of Omotesando.\n\u201cI hope we can do more together,\u201d said Kallevig. \u201cI think they (the partner) are of a quality that we would like to do more. Now we still need to find opportunities that fit their strategy and our strategy,\u201d he said.\nThe fund invests the revenue from Norway\u2019s oil and gas output in stocks, bonds and unlisted real estate abroad. At the end of the third quarter, unlisted property accounted for 2.7 percent of the overall value of the fund.\nThe fund\u2019s long-term goal is to raise it toward 7 percent.\nOne of the cities the fund would like to invest in is Singapore, but it has yet to make a deal there.\n\u201cThere are some great companies (we can partner with in Singapore),\u201d said Kallevig. \u201c(But) there has to be assets that fit our strategy, at a price we can live with.\u201d\nThe fund has tended to buy upscale office and retail properties in the world\u2019s biggest cities, such as on the Champs-Elysees in Paris or London\u2019s Regent Street, focusing on 10 global cities.\nBut it has also bought logistics centers, as companies must have efficient supply chains that deliver goods to customers quickly.\n\u201cThere is nothing stopping us from doing logistics in Japan as well. It is not something that we are looking at right now.
