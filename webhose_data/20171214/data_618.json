The work was led by Brandy Clarke, a visiting assistant professor of educational psychology at the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln and an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. \nThrough the program, parents, healthcare providers and behavioral health consultants work together to solve problems and implement health strategies for young children who are overweight or obese. Christina Fernandez, a pediatrician with the Creighton University Medical Center, examines a child. A partnership that included researchers from four Nebraska universities shows promise in assisting parents with early childhood obesity. \n\u201cParents really are the driving force in the PHIT program,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cThey are the ones making decisions about how to plan for their child\u2019s health, and they\u2019re doing it with guidance and information from the consultant.\u201d \nThe pilot study included children ages 3 to 5 and their families. Participating families received a series of six home visits from behavioral health consultants. These consultants supported parents in using a structured, problem-solving process to address children\u2019s diet, activity levels and sleep. \nMany participating families had limited incomes and resources, Clarke said. Behavioral health consultants worked with parents to address issues including access to safe playgrounds, grocery stores and transportation. \nResearchers found that participating children had positive changes in body mass index \u2014 a common health screening tool \u2014 compared to children in the control group. The participants also spent less time doing sedentary activities and more time engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity. \n\u201cOur ultimate goal is to improve children\u2019s health, and we\u2019re doing that by supporting families to create environments that promote healthy habits,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cOur initial results are promising, but we still have more to learn about how we can change early health trajectories long term.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clarke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandy clarke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christina fernandez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of nebraska medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "creighton university medical center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:17.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d02af4b9b733b81dedb3770d6c8a47230897d017", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKOlPvBjFDQ95sRoSYpOQshhIG2oH9Om_5vXtZXXRe0w9iIYjn32NbfFwAYeQWbbDJHcXuHqfQKCzyCci0cWXGjS_tPYgnjIzToyLh_JFndgMjij4jl61sg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "Same Sex Marriage is now legal in Australia : worldnews", "title_full": "Same Sex Marriage is now legal in Australia : worldnews", "published": "2017-12-07T08:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 168, "participants_count": 115, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efdcd2438ad3681deae5206ad53ffac7e426a3c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKOlPvBjFDQ95sRoSYpOQshhIG2oH9Om_5vXtZXXRe0w9iIYjn32NbfFwAYeQWbbDJHcXuHqfQKCzyCci0cWXGjS_tPYgnjIzToyLh_JFndhj5rWxCu52kRJL1swAC4unH.AiK_VfOqY-", "ord_in_thread": 87, "author": "turbotailz", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "STRAYA CAAANT", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:17.034+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d02af4b9b733b81dedb3770d6c8a47230897d017", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKOlPvBjFDQ95sRoSYpOQshhIG2oH9Om_5vXtZXXRe0w9iIYjn32NbfFwAYeQWbbDJHcXuHqfQKCzyCci0cWXGjS_tPYgnjIzToyLh_JFndgMjij4jl61sg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "Same Sex Marriage is now legal in Australia : worldnews", "title_full": "Same Sex Marriage is now legal in Australia : worldnews", "published": "2017-12-07T08:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 168, "participants_count": 115, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "747a5013f9eb6cf28615f4d19cf6f200036604ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKOlPvBjFDQ95sRoSYpOQshhIG2oH9Om_5vXtZXXRe0w9iIYjn32NbfFwAYeQWbbDJHcXuHqfQKCzyCci0cWXGjS_tPYgnjIzToyLh_JFndhj5rWxCu52kUmERhE_v6ourbKt_r4HSsE-", "ord_in_thread": 88, "author": "AManTiredandWeary", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Good, fuck religious totalitarianism, also science is on our side.

Her job as a grocery store bagger isn\u2019t much help\u2026until the day she has a bizarre exchange with the cagey town recluse. When the woman abruptly surrenders to the police, Olivia feels compelled to dig deeper into her perplexing story. But the investigation stalls when Olivia receives another piece of news\u2014Andre Steele, the golden boy of Westmont and her previous tormentor, has unexpectedly returned from his four-year stay in Brazil\u2014and the whole school is buzzing! All at once, Olivia\u2019s dull and predictable life is uprooted, and she wonders if \u201cboring\u201d was so bad after all. Goodreads / Amazon / Barnes & Noble / iBooks / Kobo \u2014 EXCERPT: A stranger to me, I knew nothing about Jodie except that she lived on the outskirts of town. People referred to her as a hermit because she rarely ventured from her home, and when she did, it seemed only long enough to purchase groceries. She was nobody important to me\u2014just the occasional name carried through the wind when there was nothing else to talk about. However, like clockwork, I bagged her scant items every Thursday at four PM. The odd interactions I\u2019d have with the woman would sometimes be the most interesting part of my shift at Wayland\u2019s, a discounted store that served as employment during the summer, and now into my senior year.\nI met her eyes again, which seemed to never leave mine, peering at me with an intense silence that I couldn\u2019t explain. She didn\u2019t frighten me, exactly. On the contrary, there was a meekness about her that suggested her gentle nature. While she hardly smiled, she didn\u2019t have a mean face. It was more like the bland expression of a person who had little to smile about. Yet I wondered at her reservation, certain she had more to say than she ever allowed.\nJodie\u2019s slender fingers pulled cash from her wallet and she handed over the bills. When she turned to me once more, her teary eyes alarmed me. She swallowed hard, like she was washing down emotions that rose against her will.\n\u201cAre\u2026 are you okay?\u201d I asked, hesitating as I placed her grocery bags into the cart. Her hand fell swiftly on top of mine, squeezing my palm. Startled by the sudden physical contact, I jerked my hand away. I regretted my actions the moment her expression shifted.\nEyes wide, she shook her head, her mouth opening as though horrified by her behavior. A tear slid down her cheek, and she brushed it away in haste. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Sniffling, she snatched her three bags from the cart and scurried toward the exit. \u201cHey!\u201d I called after her. I exchanged a look of confusion with Marlene before following Jodie to the automatic sliding doors. \u201cWait! It\u2019s Jodie, right?\u201d She paused, sniffing once more. She looked back at me over her shoulder, eyes red and sorrowful. \u201cUm, can I help you to your car? I really should have double-bagged that one.\u201d I pointed to the bulging bag containing the heavy soups, grasping for an excuse to stall her from leaving.\nThe tiniest smile crept along the corners of her mouth. Her green eyes brightened beneath the sheen of tears. Relieved, I smiled back. Her next words fell from her lips in a low, quiet tone. \u201cYou take care of yourself.\u201d Then she walked out into the cool air.\nI stood there perplexed, watching this strange woman escape to the parking lot. Jodie had been a consistent presence in my life for months now, a once-a-week visit in which she spoke no more than a murmured, Thank you. Why did I feel a sudden permanence to her goodbye?\nA familiar female voice called out from behind me. \u201cI need a bagger on lane three please!\u201d\nI rolled my eyes and flipped around to see my friend Jordyn standing at the other end of the store, hollering into her cupped hands. I glanced at Marlene. My grey-haired co-worker pushed out her lips with a frown, throwing a hand onto her plump hip. I cringed and held up my index finger. \u201cOne minute,\u201d I mouthed, and hurried toward Jordyn before she could garner anymore unwanted attention from my employers.\n\u201cYou know Marlene hates when you stop by, right?\u201d I said to my best friend. She beamed confidence at me with her wide smile, her lips stained in a bright coral that I could never pull off. Though only one-eighth Native American, the tan skin she\u2019d inherited helped her get away with wearing colorful makeup combinations that I would never attempt on my fair skin. Jordyn also relished in the theatrics that I shied away from.\n\u201cI\u2019m a paying customer,\u201d she said, grabbing a box of powdered donuts off the shelf. She held them up to make her point, waving wildly at Marlene\u2019s scowling face. Jordyn raised her voice again, like she was hollering at the deaf elderly. \u201cShe\u2019s just gonna bag these for me and I\u2019ll be on my way!\u201d\nI shook my head at her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get me fired.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got other problems to worry about.\u201d Jordyn put her hands on my shoulders, and spun me around.\n\u201cWhat am I looking at?\u201d I asked, not seeing anything out of the ordinary. Leave it to Jordyn to make me guess, rather than just tell me. She rotated me forty-five degrees.\n\u201cNot what. Who .\u201d She dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cPast the cashiers. Aisle twelve.\u201d\nI loved her to death, but sometimes her games were a bit much. \u201cJordyn, come on\u2014\u201d I stopped, suddenly very aware of just who she was pointing out to me. I caught a glimpse of his smile first, gleaming brightly against his bronzed skin\u2014a deeper brown than I remembered, and a compliment from his Brazilian mother. I\u2019d almost missed him, hidden behind the cluster of kids clamoring for his attention. But then I heard his laugh, boisterous and infectious. Unique.\nAnd stirring memories I resented.\nI crossed my arms over my black apron. \u201cWhat is Andre Steele doing back in Arizona?\u201d\nJordyn inhaled noisily, letting out her breath as she spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but Brazil sure did a nice number on him.\u201d\nI scowled and nudged her with my elbow.\n\u201cBut we still hate him,\u201d she corrected, giving a nod of solidarity.\n\u201cOf course we do.\u201d We watched him disappear down aisle nine with his posse. Another burst of laughter trailed behind him, coupled with giggles from the girls hanging on him and the other guy slapping Andre\u2019s back like they\u2019d never heard someone so funny.\n\u201cThen again,\u201d Jordyn added, \u201cFour years can change a person. Maybe he\u2019ll surprise you.\u201d\nI stepped away from her, returning to my position at the end of the register. I grabbed the boxes of toothpaste and floss sliding past Marlene and tossed them into a fresh bag. \u201cI never liked his surprises.\u201d\n\nAuthor Bio:\nErica Kiefer\u2019s debut novel Lingering Echoes was published by Clean Teen Publishing in November 2013. She continued the series with Rumors (A Lingering Echoes Prequel) and her newest release Vanishing Act. All of her books can be read as stand-alone contemporary YA fiction, touched with romance, emotional drama and suspense. With a degree in Recreation Therapy from Brigham Young University, Erica\u2019s experiences working with at-risk youth have influenced the realistic and relatable nature of her writing. Her first inspirational non-fiction entitled Borrowed Angel (published in April 2014 with Currawong Press) describes the loss of her infant son and her journey towards healing.\nMarried since 2005, Erica resides in Las Vegas, Nevada with her four children and can often be found satisfying her sweet-tooth with chocolate-chip cookies and a glass of milk. Now and then, she dusts off her collegiate rugby skills and dives back into the game.\nWebsite / Goodreads / Facebook / Twitter GIVEAWAY! \na Rafflecopter giveaway \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erica kiefer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olivia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marlene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olivia cole", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andre steele", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jodie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andre", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "clean teen publishing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goodreads / facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goodreads / amazon / barnes & noble", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "currawong press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brigham young university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westmont", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wayland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:18.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0c8f07ea4d259c3d17b74ed53c77165c4166d246", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb8sjxCjkfjghzB0z_thk1IC1QgP4kkxZv_aQGWEsWvKSyuPIR1bQcSa68GLeov7pmy_u_ejBedR4vU6SPq7iIerZFWng21F6Y5WDnIsSdoKHDfogXVN8QdD1thxis9w5SFKgS694JkfA33pbDK4X6pCaJR03kE8mAVNRzswisllR7m2jqI4TNM1VMHWgYHhF7K.lIxZsV5GRbNT_PDkoRZeJHaaEdx0SXZZx7PqcnAlbUl1Q2S9R.03RFh20Svv2R29kWjECe0K5Q--", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9830002) Union coal mine closes in West Virginia putting 260 Trump supporters out of work three weeks before Christmas.

This will have no effect at all on the traffic or pedestrians wanting to head across the bridge. \nSt Peter's Bridge was closed on August 29 to allow urgent repair work to be carried out to replace rusted bearings - and was reopened three weeks ahead of schedule.

It has involved bearing replacement, ensuring HGVs and buses can continue to access the town over the bridge in the future. Waterproofing and resurfacing has also taken place. A view of the construction site, under the bridge, where repairs on the bridge continue. (Image: Shiela Rostata) \nStaffordshire County Council said that without these vital improvements lorries and buses would not have been able to use the bridge by 2019 - and it would eventually have had to be closed permanently. \nThe essential repairs of the bridge had originally been due for completion by the end of November, but hard work by the project leaders had brought the reopening forward, Staffordshire County Council subsequently confirmed.

We will continue to spread the message that Burton is very much open for business.\" St Peter's Bridge will remain open while the work continues. (Image: Shiela Rostata) \nWhen will Burton Bridge be repaired? \nResidents may be celebrating the re-opening of St Peter's Bridge but there are more traffic frustrations to come when Burton Bridge closes next year. \nBurton Bridge will be repaired next summer after Staffordshire County Council held a consultation with people and businesses to ask when they wanted the work to be carried out.

It is cold. It is dark. The days feel incredibly short with the nights dragging and feeling as if they last forever. I know that I personally always struggle with this time of year, once Christmas has been and gone and there isn\u2019t the excitement of the festivities, everything just goes by a little slower and there can almost seem to feel as if there is this bleak outlook on life. I know that in a few weeks time all I will want to do is curl up on the sofa in my cosiest PJ\u2019s cracking open the leftover tub of Quality Street watching cheesy rom-coms until it\u2019s time to sleep. I find it hard to get on with work in winter and find any motivation at all to get on with the simplest of tasks. SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) is a very real thing and can be summed up as depression that comes and goes in a seasonal pattern with Winter regularly showing the hardest of symptoms. Even if you do not suffer from SAD, Winter can still be a very hard month, especially as we lead into the New Year. But, we all know that sometimes doing the littlest of things can help in the biggest ways and today I wanted to share some of my tips for keeping yourself productive during Winter. Keeping those motivation levels and trying to find the very best in this season! Here\u2019s to a wonderful Winter! Get Enough Sleep (And wake up earlier!) Getting enough sleep is essential any of time of the year to help stay productive (and awake!) but I certainly find that I need my full eight hours in Winter more than anytime. With it getting dark and bleak so early, it\u2019s already so easy to feel tired and lethargic so by making sure you\u2019ve had the right amount of sleep your body needs, you can help tell between the feelings of actual tiredness due to lack of sleep and tiredness due to it being Winter and everything that involves. Getting a good nights sleep is so effective on our mood as well, I know that I am always that little bit happier with a small spring in my step if I feel as if I have had a decent nights slumber! I\u2019m personally yet to try it (it\u2019s on my wishlist though) but the This Works Can\u2019t Sleep Kit is meant to be amazing at helping you fall asleep easily alongside Lush\u2019s Sleepy . Anything to help, eh! Believe me, waking up in the dark and when it\u2019s minus god knows what outside doesn\u2019t equal me jumping out of bed to start the day. But, by setting your alarm a little earlier (and going to bed a little earlier too) means that once your up and about, you\u2019ll experience more daylight, equalling in the nights not feeling as long (thankfully!). When Winter really started to kick in, I found myself sleeping into about ten or even eleven in the morning just because I wanted to stay warm in bed. But by not sleeping till about one am, it was so dark for long and I just hated it. Instead, I now go to bed around eleven pm and wake up around half eight. The difference it has may in my mood is amazing! And because I\u2019m up earlier, even just seeing the daylight for longer outside my Window whilst I\u2019m typing away really helps to keep me productive! See the Daylight Even just getting outside for ten minutes a day can really help with your productivity. We all know that being in the daylight is good but fresh, the crisp air also really helps to wake me up and revitalize me. A short walk around the local park or even to the shops can really make the difference to my day and it is always lovely to see the delights of Winter whilst you\u2019re out and about, honestly, there is something very beautiful about a frosty morning! One of my favourite things to do to get me out and productive is to use the time out and about effectively. For instance, if I am going for a short walk around the park, I will just let my mind wander and find inspiration in the beauty of Winter. Or I\u2019ll grab my laptop and to-do list and walk to the local coffee shop to do some work there and lastly, bringing the dogs out with me which of course, benefits them too! Just make sure to bring all your Winter woollies with you! Onesie: optional. Find The Magic in Winter Winter, despite its arctic temperatures and short days, is a truly beautiful season and we are lucky to get to experience it here in England. We typically have negative thoughts surrounding Winter and sometimes, just changing those thoughts can really play a huge part in improving your mood and therefore improving your productivity. Frosty mornings, ice crystals, cosy nights in, hot chocolates, warm apple pies, snow, ice skating, fluffy scards and hats, Christmas, new beginnings, the beginning of Spring, fairy lights, cosy fires, dogs wearing coats, rosy cheeks, pumpkin spice, nutmeg, cinnamon, spending gloomy Sundays baking, bright days, relaxing with a good book, homemade soup, lighting up a room with candlelight and last but not least,bubble baths. Winter truly is a magical season. Set Goals & Reward Yourself One of my biggest motivators to stay productive is that feeling when you have finally achieved a goal. Nothing beats that feeling of pure accomplishment when you have worked hard and it has eventually paid off. Winter is the perfect time of year to re-evaluate your goals and gives you the chance to think about what you would like to achieve before the end of the year. For me, my goal to achieve before 2018 starts is Blogmas! It is my first year of giving it a go and it takes up so much time. Not a complaint at all, I\u2019m really enjoying this and by having this new project, it is keeping me motivated and actually excites me which is just fab! Rewarding yourself when you complete your goals is a great motivator too. Whether that reward is simply a break or a little shop on ASOS heading straight towards your saved list, having something to look forward too can help you race towards the finish line. Talking of rewards, I am yet to figure out just what I am going to reward myself with if I post all twenty-five days of Blogmas\u2026 any ideas?! \nI hope these tips help you with your productivity levels this Winter?

It looks truly mythical - heat rising from the vast sandy plains and temples for days. That's no exaggeration; there are a ridiculous 2,200 temples (or pagodas) dating back to the 11th century still standing today - which begs the question - which to see first? Let me help you! How we got here But first, a bit of background. We arrived by bus from Naypyitaw , costing 8800 kyat each - just under \u00a35 in today's prices. The set up wasn't quite as luxurious as our journey from Yangon to Naypyitaw , but it got us there. Note of caution: the bus dropped us in the middle of nowhere and told us we'd have to get a taxi with some bloke for a huge sum - we later learned we were just around the corner from the bus station and this is a scam. By this point, we thought we had sussed these out! Anyway, if this happens to you be sure to make your way to the bus station where you may have better luck getting a taxi and avoid being ripped off. Where we stayed As I have said countless times, although we had back packs, we weren't backpacking as such. No hostels for us! We stayed at Hotel Yadanarbon where we paid \u00a325 a night for a clean and comfortable double room with breakfast. The best thing about this hotel, though, was the pool! It was absolutely scorching in Bagan when we visited in April (2016) - around the 45\u00b0c mark - and come midday the pool was more than welcome. What we did Well, this is an easy one. We temple-hopped. Hire an electric bike from your hotel - we did this for around 8000 kyat a day. Tourists are banned from hiring motorbikes or scooters in Bagan, so these electric bikes are the next best thing. It is so hot you don't want to be cycling a push bike around, trust me. I vividly remember at one point feeling like there were 10 hair dryers blowing boiling hot air on to me as we biked back to our hotel... it is scorchio! My advise would be to get out there early, and be back to the pool for midday. Firstly, the sunrises are incredible and worth seeing, and second it gets so hot you wont actually be able to stand barefoot on the temples (you must remove your shoes) during the midday sun. Oh yeh, if you didn't know, you can gain access to the top terraces in most of the temples in Bagan by climbing up through often hidden, winding passages. I think the government has restricted climbing some of the pagodas now, but this experience was just so unique and incredible - truly one of those once-in-a-lifetime, pinch-me moments. When sunrise looms, get back out there! As I say, there are over 2000 temples to visit - you can't see them all. These are the 5 best temples we visited during our three day stay in Bagan. Law Ka Ou Shaung: a little girl who lives in the house just behind this pagoda let us in, and showed us around. We were the only ones there! Incredible views and a beautiful temple. Be sure to find someone to let you in and make your way to the top for a stunning vista. Pya Tha Da: by no means a hidden gem - this one gets whole coach loads of tourists turning up for sunset, so get there in plenty of time to secure a spot to watch the sun go down. North Guni (or Myauk Guni): I absolutely loved this one as it is huge, but relatively quiet. We again went to this one for sunset and loved how peaceful the whole area was. Kyan Ma Ba: just south of the mighty Gawdawpalin Pagoda, its far less busy and has great views over Gawdawpalin itself. Shwesandaw Pagoda: again, this one is no secret! At an impressive 328 feet tall, you can climb up the five terraces to oh-so-stunning views over Old Bagan. Just brace yourself, it's quite the climb. My top tips for exploring Bagan: 1. Wear flip flops - you'll do most of your travelling by bike, but once you get to the temples you'll need to remove your shoes. 2. Cover up - Myanmar is not the place for short shorts or cami tops, folks, but Bagan especially. These temples are holy sites - be respectful. I wore culottes and threw a scarf over my shoulders. 3. Avoid the middle of the day - it's too hot! 4. Try and get accommodation with a pool and aircon - so you can relax during these sweltering lunch time hours. Get back out there once it starts to cool down again. 5. Eat at Weatherspoons - don't worry, it's heaps better than the UK version! Amazing burgers and cold beer, it makes a perfect rest-stop. 6. Get up for sunrise - it's cooler and beautiful to see the sun rise over the horizon. 7. Don't worry if you can't afford a hot air balloon ride - the views of the balloons themselves looks magical! We missed the season as it it usually runs from October through to March, but would love to see scores of balloons sailing over the temples. 8. Sunrise and sunset never looks as good on camera - so put your camera / phone down and experience it, in the moment.
