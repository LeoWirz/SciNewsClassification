(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Weekly turnover since Thursday last week amounted to $24 million which is way below the market's standard as seen over the past 10 weeks. The rough average for weekly turnover over the past 10 weeks was $40 million. An analyst with a MMC Capital, Kudzanai Samudzi, said the low turnover this week was a result of investors taking a wait and see approach as the nation waits for the 2018 budget set to be presented by the Minister of Finance today. \"Trading activity was relatively lower, with trades being concentrated in a few blue chip stocks. Our view is that a lot of investors were seeking further policy direction from the 2018 National Budget, hence the wait and see approach. Pronouncements will likely be very material and the direction of the market will hugely depend on the outcome of the policy measures.

Dozens of other party members have fled the country in a snowballing crackdown on critics of the prime minister. \nThe State Department said its move was a \u201cdirect response to the Cambodian government\u2019s series of anti-democratic actions\u201d. \nHun Sen, one of the world\u2019s longest serving leaders, has used the kingdom\u2019s pliant judiciary to smother his critics as elections loom. \nTies between the two nations have withered in recent months with Hun Sen preferring Beijing\u2019s no-questions-asked offer of loans and investment to Washington\u2019s opprobrium on rights as he looks to extend his 32-year grip on power. \n\u201cIf Cambodian people cannot go to US, it is ok, it is not a problem,\u201d government spokesman Sok Eysan said, shrugging off the State Department threats. \n\u201cIf we can not join any meetings in the US, there are many other meetings outside the US that we can join.\u201d \nThe State Department did not disclose which Cambodian ruling party officials would be affected by the restrictions but said in certain instances, their relatives could be also be barred from entering the US. \nHuy Vannak, an undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Interior, called the move a \u201cdesperate measure\u201d that unpicks President Trump\u2019s \u201cpolicy of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states.\u201d \nCambodia\u2019s relations with the US have gone into deep freeze in recent months. \nHun Sen\u2019s government has singled out US-funded media outlets critical of the regime, limiting access to Voice of America and forcing Radio Free Asia to shutter. \nTwo former RFA journalists have been arrested and charged with espionage. \nAt the same time, Cambodia has moved into a closer orbit of China. \nIts economy is growing fast thanks to Chinese investment and soft loans that come without directions on human rights or democracy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Refuting social media messages, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) said that as on date there is no stay from the Supreme Court on Aadhaar and its linking to various services. \n\"That Aadhaar Act being in force, all notifications for requiring Aadhaar for various welfare programmes, verifying bank account, PAN card and SIM card with Aadhaar stand valid and lawful,\" it said in a statement. \n\"Today's legal position is that there is no stay as on December 7, 2017, from the Supreme Court on Aadhaar and its linking to various services,\" it added. The government has made it mandatory for verifying bank account and PAN to weed out black money and bring unaccounted wealth to book. The same for SIM has been mandated to establish identify of mobile phone users. \n\"The mandatory requirements of Aadhaar for PAN, bank accounts, welfare programs, and SIM cards have been challenged in the Supreme Court and no stay has been granted. Therefore, it is clear that the video is outdated because it does not reflect the latest legal position as on today (December 7, 2017),\" the statement said. \nUIDAI said the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 was passed by the Parliament on March 16, 2016 and notified in the Gazette of India on March 26, 2016. \n\"Therefore, subsequent notifications issued under section/s of Aadhaar Act for requiring Aadhaar as primary identifier by various ministries and departments of Government of India and States/UTs Governments for various services, benefits and subsidies hold the field today,\" it said. \nUIDAI asked people not to get misled by an outdated video doing rounds in the social media and Whatsapp and said \"people should instead verify their banks accounts, investment accounts, SIM cards, etc as per the current laws and deadlines as early as possible to avoid any inconvenience.\" \n\"UIDAI has clarified on a video circulated purportedly out of the context of a lady lawyer on WhatsApp, Twitter, and Social Media and said that the video refers to an order passed by the Supreme Court on August 11, 2015, when the court had restricted use of Aadhaar to only few programs,\" the statement said. \nThe video, it said, does not reflect \"true legal position\" as it stands today because, after the said Supreme Court order of 2015, Aadhaar Act was passed by Parliament in 2016. \nSubsequent to the Act, notifications have been issued making Aadhaar mandatory for availing various welfare benefits such as public distribution services (PDS), cooking gas LPG, MNREGS, scholarships, and pensions. \nThe Income Tax Act was amended in March 2017 to make Aadhaar mandatory for PAN cards. On June 1, 2017, PML Rules have been amended to make Aadhaar mandatory for linking all bank accounts, insurance, pension, mutual funds and DMAT accounts. \n\"Supreme Court too in Lokniti Foundation case through an order passed in February 2017 has approved verification of all SIM cards with Aadhaar,\" UIDAI said.

I mean, imported juices sold as Japanese blends or \u2018pure\u2019 malts, with kanjis, cherry blossom, Noh masks and whatnot on the labels\u2026 Akashi White Oak \u2018Cognac Cask\u2019 (62%, OB for Mitsukoshi Isetan, cask #1122, +/-2017) This rather rare baby was matured in French Cognac casks and bottled for famous and rather prestigious Japanese general store Isetan. We had enjoyed another Cognac Cask bottled at 55% very much a few months ago (WF 89). Colour: gold. Nose: strong and rather woody, varnishy, plankish, lacking expression, and frankly too dry. I suppose water is needed\u2026 With water: there\u2019s still a little varnish, but also patchouli, green tea, humus\u2026 Mouth (neat): very strong, and much better this time, with bitter herbs, crushed bananas, barley, ginger cookies, porridge, caraway\u2026 With water: very good, with some sweet and spicy bread, gingerbread, cinnamon mints, caraway. That I\u2019m getting any Cognac from this would be an overstatement. Finish: long, dry, with even more spicy bread. Quite some pepper and even chilli in the aftertaste. Comments: really to my liking, but I\u2019m finding it a little rough and a little less sexy than the one at 55% vol. (pink label). SGP:261 - 83 points. Another go at White Oak\u2026 Akashi White Oak 8 yo (50%, OB, sherry butt, cask #5184, 900 bottles, +/-2016) Akashi\u2019s the name of White Oak\u2019s single malts, while when there\u2019s only \u2018White Oak\u2019, it\u2019s probably a blend. Colour: gold. Nose: oh lovely! Musty old bodega in winter (yes, a recent experience), a little natural rubber, leaves, walnuts, peonies, drops of old vase water\u2026 With water: gets rather wonderfully muddy and earthy. It\u2019s been raining around that bodega. Mouth (neat): very good indeed, it\u2019s actually a rounder cake-y/bready whisky, with dried figs aplenty, gingerbread again, some raisins, and a sweeter kind of tobacco. Also stout beer, and touches of leather. With water: excellent, still young, but the sherry added some depth of flavour and a nice Christmassy touch. We\u2019re thinking Christstollen. Finish: long, drier, spicy, with a little cardboard, perhaps. Cinnamon. Comments: I really enjoyed this little Akashi! SGP:451 - 85 points. Chichibu\u2019s turn\u2026 Chichibu 2012/2017 (63.2%, OB for The Whisky Exchange, peated, cask #2088, 225   wow, this medicinal? We\u2019re nosing tincture of iodine, tiger balm, old-school embrocations, Betadine\u2026 To tell you the truth, I\u2019ve rarely encountered a malt whisky that was this \u2018hospitaly\u2019. With water: perfect. Smoky mud, humus, gravel, new plastic (new stereo set), Laundromat\u2026 Mouth (neat): ultra-vertical! This, I like a lot. Lemon and citron juice, plus brine and smoked water, punto basta. As I sometimes say, it\u2019s a blade, Kill-Bill-style. With water: fabulous. Tangerines! Please call the Japanese anti-maltoporn brigade! Finish: long, blade-y, ultra-precise. Comments: great work, mister blacksmi\u2026 I mean, mister distiller. This is malt whisky in high-definition, I would say, rather for hardcore whiskyphiles. SGP:367 - 91 points. Chichibu 2012/2017 (62.5%, OB for La Maison du Whisky, second fill bourbon barrel, peated, cask #2087) It does not take a rocket scientist or someone in Washington to figure out that this is a sister cask. Does it? Colour: pale gold. Nose: this one\u2019s a little more complex, and rather less blade-y. The cask may have been a little more active, in fact, as we\u2019re finding rhubarb, kiwi, patchouli, lime-flower tea and riesling (clearly, riesling!) And of course peat, camphor, seawater, oysters\u2026 This nose is totally brilliant, not sure it even needs water. But while we\u2019re at it, with water: stunning. A walk on Islay \u2013 correction, around Chichibu. And it\u2019s raining cats and dogs\u2026 Mouth (neat): amazing, totally amazing. I\u2019m reminded of when I bought a bottle of Port Ellen 20 yo Rare Malt, when that beauty had just come out \u2013 except that this Chichibu is only 5. Barely.

Have you ever been in charge of buying the wine for a party? Have you ever wanted to sit there and just enjoy the nicest bottle of wine by yourself on a rainy evening? Consider the following helpful advice when thinking about what wine you are going to buy next.\n<iframe src=\" https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d14031.649330480024 ! http://www.foodandwine.com/travel/europe/italy-piedmont-region-guide -81.489879!3d28.452059!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2! http://www.post-gazette.com/life/food/2017/12/06/Feast-of-the-Seven-Fishes/stories/201712060005 %3A0xeeb0eb55425a9848!2sChristinis+Ristorante+Italiano!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1512046365265\u2033 width=\u201d600\u2033 height=\u201d450\u2033 frameborder=\u201d0\u2033 style=\u201dborder:0\u2033 allowfullscreen>\nIf you are new to wine tasting, you should know that true connoisseurs actually spit the wine after tasting it. Spitting the wine is the best way to avoid overpowering your taste buds so you can keep tasting other wines. Take a small sip of wine, wait a few seconds to feel all its different flavors and spit it.\nKeep in mind that the color of the wine is not always the same as color of the grapes that are used to make it. The color results from the process of wine making and it is the skin of the grape used in the process that gives an individual wine its final color.\nWhat you like when it comes to wine is what is most important. Recommendations will come thick and fast regarding wineries and regions, but it really is down to what you like. If you want a cheap white, drink it! You should enjoy the wine you choose.\n\nTry one of the many discussion forums about wine online. You can learn much from other people by interacting in the forums. Prior to signing up, check out the board to make sure it \u201cfits\u201d you.\nGo to wine tastings when you can. Wine tastings are the best place to test your pallet against the many different types and brands of wine. You can even find some that are free, but do remember to spit your wine. You can not accurately tell the taste of a wine once you begin to become intoxicated.\nOn one hand, respect the knowledge of wine experts, but don\u2019t take their words unquestioningly. The best wine expert is one that continues to evolve, and whom can admit their mistakes. Their tastes may not mirror your own very well. It is important to trust your own tastes, also.\nWhen ordering wine at a restaurant, you should not spend too long looking at the list. If you are having diner with someone who knows a lot about wines, they will assume you are not familiar with the wines you see on the menu. It is best to choose within ten minutes.\nA good tip if you\u2019re interested in drinking wine is to make sure you serve your wine out of a good glass. You don\u2019t want to serve your guests wine out of something silly and embarrass yourself A good wine glass should be large, have thin glass, and a long stem.\nIf you enjoy storing wines in your home, consider investing in a small wine cooler. Wine coolers are meant to keep the temperature of the bottles around fifty five degrees, which is considered the ideal temperature for wine. They are relatively small, inexpensive and can even add a decorative touch to your kitchen, dining room or living room.\nThe body of a wine is a great way to pair it with a dish. The \u201cbody\u201d of a wine refers to how substantial the wine is. It often also correlates with the alcohol content, with fuller-bodied wine containing more alcohol than a lighter wine. Heavier dishes should be paired with a full-bodied wine, as a lighter wine runs the risk of tasting watery when paired with something like a hearty steak.\nExplore all of the possibilities when pairing wine with food. You will be surprised when you find a new pairing that someone else may not have shared with you. Play around and have fun with it.\nAlways smell your wine before you taste it. One reason is that it could be spoiled, which can be easily identified by smelling it, which could save you from getting sick. Additionally, you can also learn a lot about the wine from its aroma, and if you stick with this habit you will begin to identify how over time.\nDo not allow the opinion of others to dictate your preferences. If there is a particular wine that you enjoy, then it\u2019s sure to be a great selection. That is your rule of thumb. Your palate is different from anybody else\u2019s. If your friends dislike your wine, you get to have more of it!\nSearching for glasses for your wine? The best kind of glass is one that is 20 ounces or more, has a long stem and inward curve at the top, and is no more than $15. These statistics have been thoroughly researched as the best for a wine glass. You should never spend a lot of money on a glass because glass is easily breakable.\nAs you can see, choosing the right wine does not have to be an ordeal. Once you know a little more about wine, it is easy to find a great wine for your next meal. Just remember what you have learned from this article. Before long, you will be enjoying a wonderful vintage.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:25.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eef6f44bcc742c780ea12f631b7d390672f48e10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDwEeUGv6ok5nDojdw_GgSqGOqNsfGizEFun8A4osJOyBco8qkwK2JRLN0Jjn1hacweiW_j4wlX1sRRs84yF4sP4tmtAxWfEvbWwntJW.m7OChxTqUpRiDdHw76nfivBFD.8FFtldI9Q--", "site_full": "www.watchlistnews.com", "site": "watchlistnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.watchlistnews.com//rss/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Watch List News", "title": "Amdocs Limited (DOX) Shares Sold by Allianz Asset Management GmbH", "title_full": "Amdocs Limited (DOX) Shares Sold by Allianz Asset Management GmbH", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/amdocs-limited-logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eef6f44bcc742c780ea12f631b7d390672f48e10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDwEeUGv6ok5nDojdw_GgSqGOqNsfGizEFun8A4osJOyBco8qkwK2JRLN0Jjn1hacweiW_j4wlX1sRRs84yF4sP4tmtAxWfEvbWwntJW.m7OChxTqUpRiDdHw76nfivBFD.8FFtldI9Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lindsey Winhoffer", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Amdocs Limited (DOX) Shares Sold by Allianz Asset Management GmbH", "text": "Tweet \nAllianz Asset Management GmbH lowered its holdings in shares of Amdocs Limited (NASDAQ:DOX) by 12.9% in the 3rd quarter, according to its most recent Form 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
