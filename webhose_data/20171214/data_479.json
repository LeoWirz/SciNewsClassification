I took my 110 priest through Stockades to see what dropped and I was surprised to receive a very large number of lockboxes.\nIn 2 runs of Stockades I received 49 ornate bronze lockboxes. I sent them to my rogue to unlock and then back to my priest to DE. All the greens I received from them were low level greens that disenchanted in to strange dust/lesser astral essences.\nI figured I would try out another dungeon to see what happened and went to Zul'Farrak. I only did one run but I got 29 reinforced steel lockboxes and the greens from those gave dream dust and greater nether essences.\nSo the ability to farm greens for lower level enchanting mats still exists, just now they're locked in a box that requires some help from a rogue.\nWell this is good to hear. Was the lock box gear level locked to the toon that opened the box? Or was it more in line with how drops are on live currently?\nOut of curiosity did you get any rare quality gear out of those lock boxes? I ask because another thing that seems to be eliminated is the ability to get a sweet rare drop that could be mailed to an alt to use.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:57.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "339a424e574c65b19f62fa389b40f890c8eb2a14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pDSIlap_VpOZLE_Y24sCI1M24r4zXVqS2", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/an/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/an/ - Animals &amp; Nature - 4chan", "title": "pls post crying cats", "title_full": "/an/ - pls post crying cats - Animals & Nature - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-02T12:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.173, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "98ba6c6b36f03a4abf93fedb5b432c19100e18ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pDSIlap_VpOZLE_Y24sCI1J8b2pMiTwWfWSKcdzQlzVY-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-04T08:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Bump", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:57.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e921ad3473c3994d8a047bf124aaca7b976fc322", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSX66fZOWxt.Y538NTwyHgQ_J7eCIRfTrL3B_M_MtJPekpBIaHIT.zkvV1wUmLMuaAfBSOpFA3u5epPiR1.sdb4TnNUjpK96MyL6zj62TY1_f23NeFnZZMbw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Assassin's Creed", "title": "[AC Origins Spoilers] I beat the main story yesterday.", "title_full": "[AC Origins Spoilers] I beat the main story yesterday. : assassinscreed", "published": "2017-12-07T05:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cca6c63d56fc144f4e2b00c4dedc0b31f4b5bc84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSX66fZOWxt.Y538NTwyHgQ_J7eCIRfTrL3B_M_MtJPekpBIaHIT.zkvV1wUmLMuaAfBSOpFA3u5epPiR1.sdb4TnNUjpK96MyL6zj62TY1_dl8RnSUo1Ve___16AbI.P9MLHriSbZ4gY-", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "edwinstree", "published": "2017-12-07T11:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Try reading Desert Oath.

I would be completely satisfied with that.\nI'm still hoping that the lockboxes can have blues though ;)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:57.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e921ad3473c3994d8a047bf124aaca7b976fc322", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSX66fZOWxt.Y538NTwyHgQ_J7eCIRfTrL3B_M_MtJPekpBIaHIT.zkvV1wUmLMuaAfBSOpFA3u5epPiR1.sdb4TnNUjpK96MyL6zj62TY1_f23NeFnZZMbw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Assassin's Creed", "title": "[AC Origins Spoilers] I beat the main story yesterday.", "title_full": "[AC Origins Spoilers] I beat the main story yesterday. : assassinscreed", "published": "2017-12-07T05:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8b3c1eb990aef6c0b4a3e165461fb61198527aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSX66fZOWxt.Y538NTwyHgQ_J7eCIRfTrL3B_M_MtJPekpBIaHIT.zkvV1wUmLMuaAfBSOpFA3u5epPiR1.sdb4TnNUjpK96MyL6zj62TY1_dl8RnSUo1Ve3wCSYTxZyr5usIxZYS6mTU-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Mistrvl", "published": "2017-12-07T06:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The original leak mentioned a trilogy based on the same character, that's probably not happening but there's a sequel for Aya in the upcoming comics and the DLC with Bayek", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:57.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "90c095e9d9d04514ec1182728bd11a274fd34f81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_BhnyqhXrhieaoNsc3xcCbyco6A6uw0VF9WXe0.dMbVkF85N37AGvsr0.BnkItPZrf3O3A7HWz8rW7BtapeDkn", "site_full": "www.blogging.blogs4all.co.uk", "site": "blogs4all.co.uk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "UKIP LEADERSHIP 2017 | The Blogger's Politics Blog", "title_full": "UKIP LEADERSHIP 2017 | The Blogger's Politics Blog", "published": "2017-12-07T11:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "90c095e9d9d04514ec1182728bd11a274fd34f81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_BhnyqhXrhieaoNsc3xcCbyco6A6uw0VF9WXe0.dMbVkF85N37AGvsr0.BnkItPZrf3O3A7HWz8rW7BtapeDkn", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "UKIP LEADERSHIP 2017 | The Blogger's Politics Blog", "text": "Subscribe to Blog via Email \nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.

Nationaltaxreports.com article, tax preparation planner Frank Ellis explains what is IRS Form 1040EZ for filing taxes in 2018. He explains it is the quickest and easiest of three main forms to fill out. The form is used by taxpayers who do not have to itemize deductions or have dependents. \nAfter comparing it to 1040A , a longer, more involved form, Ellis explains the limits for 1040EZ related to health care. The author says the form cannot be used once someone purchases a health insurance plan from the federal marketplace. Premium tax credits for helping people pay for their insurance plan are explained, along with how this applies when filing taxes. Ellis also states what happens if the advance is not enough or if taxpayers still have a balance to pay. IRS Form 8962 should be filed with 1040/1040A to see whether advanced funds were distributed correctly. \nThe article also explains how filing a 1040EZ form can cost a taxpayer money. This is especially so if one doesn\u2019t claim credits and deductions they apply for. Ellis also says the form doesn\u2019t allow student loan interest to be deducted, or have space to claim an Individual Retirement Account to reduce taxable income. \nFrank Ellis does, however, explain how filing other forms can put one into a lower tax bracket . Standard deductions and personal exemptions further reduce taxable income. Other forms also support education credits and Ellis talks about how one credit, the Lifetime Learning credit, can work for a taxpayer. \nFor more detailed information about the advantages of filing IRS Form 1040EZ over other forms, and when different tax forms should be used, go to http://nationaltaxreports.com/2017-irs-1040ez-tax-return-form-guide/ \nAbout Frank Ellis \nFrank Ellis is a Traverse City Tax Preparation Planner and published author. He has written tax and finance related articles for eight years and has published over 900 articles on leading financial websites. \nContact:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frank ellis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ellis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank ellis  frank ellis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "irs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:58.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18bd0673337ff78a7b0c95e5fd3b3fbc369d2df1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Fsl59LiHyHLe_huI1WvSwCKCuWCsjKWHCPFkCzruaSeWR9bx1aMHbu9KfPYu2W6nZ8FmS2BGMXw--", "site_full": "www.travbuddy.com", "site": "travbuddy.com", "site_section": "http://www.travbuddy.com/forums/viewforum.php?id=9", "site_categories": ["travel"], "section_title": "Asia - North East &amp; South East - Travel Forums - TravBuddy ", "title": "Bangkok hotel recommendation?", "title_full": "Bangkok hotel recommendation? - Travel Forums - TravBuddy", "published": "2017-12-07T09:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.534, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 50616, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "18bd0673337ff78a7b0c95e5fd3b3fbc369d2df1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Fsl59LiHyHLe_huI1WvSwCKCuWCsjKWHCPFkCzruaSeWR9bx1aMHbu9KfPYu2W6nZ8FmS2BGMXw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "emeraldgreen", "published": "2017-12-07T09:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "Bangkok hotel recommendation?", "text": "Hi\nCan anyone recommend a nice hotel in Bangkok that is suitable for all ages, children right up to grandparents, near Koh San Road and it would be a bonus if it had a pool for the kids?

Power was restored around 2am and that was when the fire started. There was a sudden explosion in the shop. It was difficult to get close to the place because everywhere was on fire. The heat was intense. \n\u201cLater, firefighters brought out their corpses. It was the body of the woman that was brought out first, before those of the two children. They initially couldn\u2019t find the pastor. After some search, they found his corpse in the shop, where he was probably attempting to find a way out,\u201d the printer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. \nThe two children, Miracle and Marvellous, were said to be aged six and three respectively. \nA friend of the victim, Okechukwu Idoko, claimed to have mobilised some residents to put out the fire before the arrival of the firefighters, adding that their efforts were futile. \nIdoko said he had discussed with the victim the previous day on the completion of his (Kenneth\u2019s) house in the Ikorodu area of the state.

That was our last discussion before he died. Despite the fire, the money he made from the previous day sales in the shop, and his telephone were intact,\u201d he added. \nNigerian Pilot gathered that Kenneth\u2019s wife, Favour, had been sick for some time. \nHer sickness was said to have been caused by two caesarean births, which left her bedridden. She had to be taken to the village for treatment. \nA family member of the victim, Okey Emereonye, said the sickness affected the finances of the family, which made Kenneth to quit his former apartment and relocate the family to the shop. \nHe said, \u201cWhen I visited them on Sunday at this place, I was surprised to see that she had returned from the village. She was making chin-chin , which she branded, \u2018Mirvel,\u2019 from the names of their children. I asked why Favour was brought back and Kenneth said he believed that being around her children would hasten her healing. I never knew it was the last time I would see them. \n\u201cKenneth was the breadwinner of the family. His parents are still alive. They have been informed and the bodies of the victims were taken directly to the village through the help of his church members.\u201d READ ALSO Libyan wealth fund trial against SocGen to start in UK court \nThe Director of the Lagos State Fire Service, Rasak Fadipe, said the agency received a distress call around 2.48am, adding that the Alausa and Ilupeju fire divisions responded. \nHe said, \u201cWe met the fire well alight and our men put it out. There were two levels of burglar proof \u2013 one at the entrance of the shop, while the other covered the extension. We found it difficult to gain access because of the burglar proof bars. \n\u201cWe should not turn our houses to prisons. Safety is very important. Every member of a family should know how the door is locked at night. We should discourage the use of keys to lock doors. When there is a fire incident, people should raise the alarm before it gets too late.\u201d \nHe said the cause of the fire incident had yet to be established, adding that investigations were ongoing. \nThe Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Chike Oti, confirmed the fire and the deaths. \n\u201cIt happened inside a chemist. A man, his wife and their two children were consumed by the fire, which started early in the morning. We alerted the fire service and other emergency responders to the scene,\u201d he added. \nThe Head, Corporate Communications and Media, Ikeja Electric, Felix Ofulue, said the IE was not aware of the incident. \nHe added that if the power company was at fault, the emergency workers would have informed the company.

The global market is intensely competitive characterized by the presence of a number of small- and mid-sized companies fiercely competing against each other. For instance, Maxwell Technologies Inc. accounted for the major share of approximately 25.0% in 2014. However, owing to intense rivalry amongst players the leading manufacturer is gradually losing its dominance, which is further predicted to decline over the years. In the recent years, the global supercapacitors market has witnessed a surge of new entrants with the number of players increasing to more than double. A major chunk of the players are from various countries of Asia Pacific. \nSome of other prominent players operating in the global supercapacitors market are Nippon Chemi-Con Corporation., LS Mtron, Supreme Power Solutions Co., Ltd., Ioxus, Inc., and Nesscap CO. LTD. In the coming years, the competition in the market is likely to intensify further. The future horizon looks exciting with several players engaged in developing cutting-edge energy storage technologies to meet the rising demand for robust energy harvesting systems in a number of end-use industries. \nThe global market for supercapacitors stood at US$1.21 bn in 2014 and is projected to rise at a significant CAGR of 22.3% from 2015 to 2023. Expanding at this pace, the opportunities in the market is projected to surge to US$7.37 bn by the end of the forecast period. \nThe major product types in the market are pseudocapacitor, hybrid capacitor, and double layer supercapacitors. Of these the hybrid capacitor is predicted to rise at the major CAGR of 23.5% during 2015\u20132023 and is projected to lead the market in the coming years. Among key regional markets, Asia Pacific is projected to rise at the leading CAGR during the forecast period. The growth of the regional market is primarily fueled by the substantial demand for advanced energy storage systems in the electronics industry. \nFill the form to gain deeper insights on this market @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=8359 \nPeak-output Auxiliary Power Supply for Smart Electronics to Boost Market \nThe drive for supercapacitors essentially stems from the need for high-performance, flexible energy harvesting systems in a wide variety of applications. The rising demand for peak-output auxiliary power supply for a number of smart electronic appliances is a key factor driving the market. The need for rapid charge and discharge capabilities to extend battery lifespans in various end-use industries, especially automobiles, is a crucial factor leading to the preference of supercapacitors over conventional dielectrics. The growing demand for high-output in next-generation energy systems has led to the adoption of supercapacitor to be used along with a secondary battery. \nThe intensifying demand for a cost-effective, durable, and powerful rechargeable electricity energy systems in several hybrid and electric vehicles has bolstered the uptake of supercapacitors. \nThe application of capacitors for longer cyclic lives is also advocated by environmental conservationists, since the performance of conventional power systems, including lithium ion batteries, is constrained by the need for their frequent replacement over the product life-cycle. In addition, strengthening emission-control regulations, especially in countries of North America and Europe, is predicted to boost the supercapacitor market. \nThe non-biodegradability of these batteries can cause significant environmental concerns. In recent years, the proliferation of IoT devices is a key trend bolstering the uptake of supercapacitors in developed and developing countries. These devices are multi-functionalized and hence require vast processing speeds. \nGovernment Funding in Developed Markets to Provide Impetus to R&D Activities \nThe high cost of development of supercapacitors and the limited commercialization are crucial factors likely to hinder the market growth to an extent. Nevertheless, intensifying inclinations by governments toward the development of next-generation energy harvesting systems.

Hydroponics require subsequently lesser water for growing crops and is less vulnerable to diseases and bugs. Additionally, the pumice used in hydroponics makes growing environment more cost effective and efficient and is the best alternative for soil. However, the Aeroponics segment will experience the highest CAGR of 21.1% during the forecast period of 2017-2024. Aeroponics does not require water or soil for the plant growth but nutrient rich solution. Nearly any plant can be successfully grown using aeroponics, especially vegetables. The plants grown by using aeroponics grow faster, yield more, and are generally healthier than those grown in soil. \nAsia-Pacific is the largest market for vertical farming supported by growth from Singapore and Japan \nThe Asia-Pacific region led the global vertical farming market by holding nearly half of the total share. It is expected to dominate the vertical farming market during the forecasted period as well, aided by the demand from Singapore and Japan. Japan has more than 200 plant factories which grow twenty thousand lettuce heads per day, using the vertical farming technique. Additionally, growing population will increase the demand for food in the Asia-Pacific region, which in return will lead to new trends in smart farming through precision. This strong growth can be attributed to shifting of agricultural activities from farm operations to in-house methods. \nBrowse complete TOC with 154 Pages \u2013 List of Tables 30 and List of Figures 53 of Vertical Farming Market@ https://www.esticastresearch.com/market-reports/vertical-farming-market/toc \nVERTICAL FARMING MARKET KEY FINDINGS Hydroponics was the largest segment accounting to approx. 40% of the total market share in 2016. \u2022 European vertical farming market is expected to grow with the highest CAGR of 21.8% during the forecast period. \u2022 Asia-Pacific market was the highest revenue generating market valued at $720 million in 2016. \u2022 The green house building material market held the largest share of more than 50% in 2016. \nAmong top five market players, Aerofarms holds the largest market share.

fun with your friends and family. It\u2019s probably one of the best karaoke games available on console at the moment and it should be a hit selection for your summer karaoke parties. Thanks to the SingStar MIC app everyone can join in on the celebration. \nCelebration is another PlayLink and PlayStation exclusive release, like Knowledge is Power and Hidden Agenda . It\u2019s a rebrand of the famous series for the PlayStation 4 and transforms your smartphone into a microphone using the SingStar MIC app, which is available for Android and iOS smartphones but does not work on tablets. You can also use compatible wired or wireless microphones. Thankfully, the MIC app worked pretty well over the Wi-Fi network and I hardly experienced any problems. The app also comes in pretty handy when creating playlists with your favourite songs. \nLike previous releases, Singstar Celebration includes 30 pop classics with a wide range of songs for everyone, ranging from golden oldies to newer pop songs. You can purchase hundreds of extra songs (for around R20) and get free demos from the online SingStore to sing-a-long to. \nThe party mode allows for up to 8 players to join in on the fun by singing duets and doing other fun challenges to beat your family and friends. You can also show off your talents online using the PlayStation Camera by recording your performances and uploading videos and photos to social media or to the online community.

I was so upset. I was making a presentation for my class. It should have to be few minutes to finish it. Most of the time when you are in a hurry, it seems that the world around teases you and seems that everything stuck, the traffic, your motorcycle doesn\u2019t work, if not, its tire becomes flat, your children poops, somebody calls you for an emergency, blah\u2026 blah\u2026 blah\u2026 \nThis is what happened to me when the time I needed to finish my presentation and my laptop got slow. So, my emotion rose up and I needed to refresh it. What I did was I pressed F5 key (I thought). \nWhile thinking that my computer is refreshed, I noticed it didn\u2019t blink. So, I tried again to do my presentation. I noticed that it got worse now. Instead of just facing the very slow processing of my laptop I observed that my mouse pointer is not moving too (remember I was not using a portable mouse). Thus, I used my keyboard to continue my job. \n\u201cOh, man\u2026 it\u2019s getting worse. Ahhhh!\u201d I said. \nUsing the keyboard is not easy. If you are in a hurry, it\u2019s not preferable. It gets the situation worse. \nSo, I said to myself that I had to really turn my laptop off to refresh it to the very beginning. Therefore, I turned it off believing that everything would be fine and my computer would run smoother again. \nI waited for about 7 minutes for my computer while it\u2019s booting because it also has a \u2018Getting windows ready\u2019 message. \n\u201cWhy does it have a \u2018Getting windows ready\u2019 message? I already set my computer up to not to come that message up again when it boots.\u201d \nBut I just had to wait until it restarts. And boom! It started and I was facing on my desktop. I was so excited to continue my presentation. So, I had to find my file again in my File Explorer. I touched my touch pad. I couldn\u2019t move my mouse pointer! \n\u201cWhat happened? I\u2019m in a hurry. What happened to you?!!\u201d I said sadly. \nI tried to restart again. But of no avail. I tried to figure out what I did because if your computer has no problem it would really be refreshed when you restart it. But this time I had to recall what I did before why this happened. I started to examine the chronology of the events at the back of my brain. And it revealed that instead of pressing F5 key, I pressed F6. F6 key in a Lenovo keyboard layout is for freezing the touch pad. Lenovo laptop keyboard \n \u201cTsk! Tsk! Tsk!\u201d \nThere are times when we want to get rid of problems and sometimes we are upset when problems come. But there are many problems that it is us who made them. Sometimes a problem is added by another problem if we are not careful how to solve them. Instead of solving or minimizing them, what we do we add another one thinking that it is the solution to the problem and sometimes we are careless because we are upset and it makes them worse.  \nEmotion matters everything! \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "lenovo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:59.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "24d1ddb631d45a62347363de7cc3e16c8391496e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9Nu5JIMrPN8LAPFPIrZV1hbYjtLsoWL6sB8YDKMROSJHtBKNLHV5UvL_Aq06wov13F856RpWdlb6YjZuzvQehIWTeEZFUPKdVe9pbc1kAj9SZ", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html?page=4&sort=newest&pagesize=15&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'html' Questions - Page 4 - Stack Overflow", "title": "- Bootstrap Trello-like horizontally scrollable board with containers", "title_full": "html - Bootstrap Trello-like horizontally scrollable board with containers - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.062, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "24d1ddb631d45a62347363de7cc3e16c8391496e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9Nu5JIMrPN8LAPFPIrZV1hbYjtLsoWL6sB8YDKMROSJHtBKNLHV5UvL_Aq06wov13F856RpWdlb6YjZuzvQehIWTeEZFUPKdVe9pbc1kAj9SZ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "alexvalley", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "- Bootstrap Trello-like horizontally scrollable board with containers", "text": "Like the title says, I would like to implement a Trello-clone as an exercise in using Bootstrap.

The company pointed out that the transaction fee the customer gets charged had risen from 20 cents when Valve originally began accepting Bitcoin to almost $20. Although Valve doesn\u2019t control these fees, they feel that it\u2019s an unfair position to place users in. \nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s volatility also means that it\u2019s value is only guaranteed for a set period of time. It\u2019s because of this that, should a transaction not take place within a limited window of time, the amount of Bitcoin needed might change drastically. \nPreviously, Valve covered the remaining balance by charging more or refunding the payment based on the value of the cryptocurrency but, with increased recent volatility, it has become more difficult for Valve to support Bitcoin as a payment option. Valve did, however, mention that they would be willing to re-evaluate the decision at a later date. \nCryptocurrencies have been in the spotlight for months now as some believe it to be the way of the future and others are waiting for the bubble to eventually burst. It seems Valve has decided to take a step back and see how Bitcoin pans out.

READ ALSO Internet Blackout: Startups now operate from \u201cinternet refugee camp\u201d \n\u201cThe commission, while acting on the petitions, discovered through preliminary investigation that a number of civil servants in the OHCSF, who benefited from the policy had not paid for the houses since 2005. While some had completely defaulted, others owe the government a sizeable amount of the money. \n\u201cThe investigation further revealed that 32,305 houses were captured by the committee on the sale of government properties while 24,345 were eventually sold to beneficiaries. \n\u201cHowever, civil servants in some government agencies, notably OHSCF and the Federal Housing Authority, have allegedly turned the policy into a shoddy business with the aim of defrauding the Federal Government.\u201d \nThe ICPC said it also found out that some public servants and government agencies were concealing government properties and collecting rent on same without the consent of the Federal Government. This, the agency noted, flouted the intent of the policy that primarily focuses on divesting government\u2019s interest from providing housing for its employees. READ ALSO Davido lied, He knows how Tagbo died \u2013 Lagos State Commissioner of Police \nThe commission said an employee of the OHSCF allocated some of the houses to undeserving beneficiaries who were not public servants at the time of the exercise and some of the properties had yet to be allocated. \nIt added, \u201cThe investigation has so far yielded fruitful result with the recovery of N18, 031,000 from some civil servants and a host of companies including Montgomery & Campbell Ltd. and SICCONS, which has been paid into the coffers of the government.\u201d \nThe ICPC vowed that anyone found to have contravened the law would be prosecuted upon conclusion of the investigation. \nMeanwhile, the commission says it has arrested a retired Justice of the Court of Appeal, Justice Mohammed Tsamiya, for allegedly demanding N200m bribe from one Mr. Nnamdi Orji, in exchange for a favourable judgment in a National Assembly election case that was pending before the Imo State Judicial Division of the Court of Appeal. READ ALSO Police exhume body of 63-yr-old kidnap victim in Imo \nThe ICPC said the offence, which violates Section 10 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000, was alleged to have been committed in 2015, when the retired Justice asked Orji, who was the candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance for the Arochukwu/Ohafia Federal Constituency, to give him N200m to enable him to influence the court\u2019s decision in his favour. \nOrji had approached the Court of Appeal, Imo State Division, to seek redress in a case involving an alleged inflation of the result of election in the Arochukwu Local Government Area of Abia State, which he had earlier lost to his opponent, Mr. Nkole Ndukwe, at the National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal. \nThe retired judge was alleged to have assured the appellant of getting a favourable judgment from the court upon the payment of the money. \n\u201cJustice Tsamiya has since been granted bail by the commission upon the fulfilment of his bail conditions even as investigation continues,\u201d the ICPC added.

Jason does the run/walk every year and sometimes talks Connor into going with him. I'm usually home cooking. This year we all did it. Kaiden rode on dad's shoulders for the majority of the walk. After wards we got coffee/cocoa and came home to play games and relax. Dinner was a rotisserie chicken, mashed sweet potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce, asparagus, salad (both boys love salads!), olives, and for desert I made chocolate chip pumpkin cookies.

V10 bit codes plus multi-threaded decoding for H.264, MPEG-4/Xvid and WebM, as well as the ability to play HD and BluRay. Also useful is the fact that you can use VLC media player to preview files you are downloading since it plays incomplete parts of video files.

Bacteriological Testing Services market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.8% \nThe bacteriological testing market, by services, is estimated to be valued at USD 9.58 billion in 2017 and is projected to reach 13.98 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 7.8% from 2017 to 2022. The market is driven by global increase in outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, implementation of stringent food safety regulations in developed economies, and increase in microbial contamination in water reservoirs due to rise in urban & industrial waste. Lack of food control systems, technologies, infrastructure, and resources in developing countries are the major restraints for the growth of this market. \nSalmonella led the market with the largest share in 2016 \nSalmonella testing dominated the market for bacteriological testing in 2016; it is also projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. The cases of Salmonella infection are sometimes found to be fatal. It is the most common pathogen causing foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks found in the US and other countries. The severity of the infection is generating demand for Salmonella testing of food and water samples, which in turn is driving the market for bacteriological testing. \nRequest a Sample copy of Bacteriological Testing Market Report @ https://www.bharatbook.com/request-sample/961176 Consumables & reagents projected to be the fastest-growing component segment from 2017 to 2022 \nThe bacteriological testing equipment market, by component, was dominated by the instruments segment in 2016. The dominance of instruments is attributable to the introduction of sophisticated & improved technologies, increased effectiveness of instruments, and high prices of such instruments compared to other components. The market for consumables & reagents is projected to be the fastest-growing during the forecast period. Consumables & reagents are vital components to be used to follow the set compliances of equipment. Therefore, increasing technical and regulatory complexity and their wide use in different instruments is driving this market. \nNorth America led the bacteriological testing services market with the largest share in 2016 \nThe North American market was the largest in 2016, owing to the stringency of food safety regulations and laws pertaining to nutritional content and labeling here. It has the highest number of testing laboratories among all regions and tests the most number of bacteriological samples. The Asia Pacific market is projected to be the fastest from 2017 to 2022 and is driven by China, Australia, and Southeast Asian countries, as these countries are becoming more aware of food safety and are implementing regulations for their testing. \nThe breakdown of the primaries on the basis of company, designation, and region, conducted during the research study, is as follows:\u2013 By Company type: Tier 1: 28%, Tier 2: 33%, and Tier 3: 39%\u2013 By Designation: C-level: 49%, D-level: 21%, Others: 30%\u2013 By Region: North America: 25%, Europe: 30%, Asia Pacific: 40%, and RoW: 5% \nKey bacteriological testing services providing players include the following:\u2013 SGS (Switzerland)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cagr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "salmonella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.074+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "964a68f853e5c60c5fe8506ab41dcf3dc5ece5cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWbSvRpOnLegpZ2Srag.YNWUH4m5A7Q41TnRuvjDSCGknw7lM8RBXVvb", "site_full": "hvac-talk.com", "site": "hvac-talk.com", "site_section": "http://hvac-talk.com/vbb/forumdisplay.php?49", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "painting", "sports", "home_video_dvd", "tech", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "scuba_diving", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "The ARPA Zone/Open Membership Discussion Forums", "title": "What's the best 1/4\" hex drill chuck for an impact driver?", "title_full": "What's the best 1/4\" hex drill chuck for an impact driver?", "published": "2017-12-06T06:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://hvac-talk.com/vbb/images/mobile/HVAC-Talk-mobile-header.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 68751, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2bda3a6e2b22ebd2b32a844ec410dfc2018797f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWbSvRpOnLegpZ2Srag.YNWUH4m5A7Q41TnRuvjDSCGkn2v7.m8Wi7NjPlrEjOu9MUdi_pLw6slkDMAfNZJziHW.", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "pacnw", "published": "2017-12-06T07:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Originally Posted by pacnw Our guys have issues with these;\n1) If you used a standard driver to install the screw in a tight spot(like on the flange of the plenum to the furnace) most likely you won't get this on the screw head, it's bigger around.\n2) they have a high failure rate on the magnets, they fall out.

To answer some questions:\nFrom Cool GTX:\nDid you do a \"Clean install of Win 10\" ? (if you did an upgrade I'd redo with a Clean install)\nI just did an update to get the license - I figure if I need to do a clean install I will (last clean install was when I built her in 2013). However, since I've updated to Windows 10 I have had no further issues (so far). I'm planning a new build next year so if there are no further issues I will leave Windows 10 as is.\nHow is Nvidia Control Panel setup ?\nI'm going to say default?\nCheck your Voltage +12 & +5 is it stable ?\nHow can I check that?\nTemps? room, cpu, gpu\nRoom stays at 68 F at all times. GPU temps would vary from around 44/45 C (idle temps) and up. CPU temps also vary from idle on up (starting at 27 C). I'd have to do some gaming with the monitoring stuff up to see if it does it again (which so far hasn't since the upgrade to Win 10).\nOC software ?\nNone. Run the card at base values (SC).\nRe-seat GPU and RAM, confirm locked in place (pull the plug and let capacitors discharge first & ground yourself ESD)\nI could do that. If it happens again I will try that (though the card is seated currently correctly)\nConfirm all PSU connections\nYup, all good.\nFrom CraptacularOne:\nHa, good to see you are still around. I remember you from my 8800 GT posting days.\nSo this only happens during gaming sessions?\nAt first, yes, but then it started happening randomly. Excel spreadsheet open? Crash to black screen. Watching Netflix? Crash to black screen. Not doing anything at all? Crash to black screen. Happens on a game that came in in 1995 with a 2D screen as well as games on up. But some days I can game for hours and be fine. Other days I can be writing a note in notepad and bam, black screen. Thought maybe it was the monitor (which I did have some issues with that monitor as well), but it happened with a different monitor (well, two different monitors). But now that I've updated to Windows 10 the issue has (for now) seemed to have stopped.\nAre you using voltage monitoring in software like MSI Afterburner?\nNope\nIf he's not using voltage monitoring software then I'm thinking it may be PSU related since it's only happening under high stress situations like extended gaming sessions\nNot even extended sessions, sadly. Happens in and out of games, sometimes only minutes after the PC boots up. Sometimes after hours. It's random.\nFrom AHowes:\nPSU.. how old? I'd say enough has gone on with thst windows that it's now time for a fresh clean install of Windows 10 as Cool GTX has mentioned.. but wait till you slap a new psu in there so the problems don't persist on and mess up another windows installation.\nPSU is from 2013. I'm up for a fresh install of Windows absolutely, however as I mentioned in a reply to Cool GTX, I am hoping to build a new machine next year so I'm putting off reinstalling Windows until then. I did do a non-fresh upgrade to Windows 10 after finding the thread I mentioned in the edit and so far the issue has ceased, but obviously if it suddenly happens again then I will do a fresh install. The only part I plan on re-using is the GTX 1080 - rest will be fresh\nMSI Z87 G45 | Intel i5 4670K @ 4.0 GHz | 32 GB 1866 G-Skill RAM | nVidia GeForce GTX 1080 SC | Samsung 1TB 850 EVO | Dell U2718Q & Dell P2715Q | Still on Windows 7 Pro 64-Bit\nPlanned Upgrades:\nSamsung 2TB or 4TB SSD\n2nd Dell U2718Q\nWindows 10 Pro\n#8", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:01.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7cdd90e7720dafa6813ed15af2084c95f663a1e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJULqzuHyJrdEZsKHqWIAopg7M8i1e.axmjnyFhNpBhgKq8hja_fuWkHVwlqaDEwXW6AShQAvnACLg--", "site_full": "nigerianpilot.com", "site": "nigerianpilot.com", "site_section": "http://nigerianpilot.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigerian Pilot: Nigerian Newspaper", "title": "Boko Haram war: Army removes commander", "title_full": "Boko Haram war: Army removes commander", "published": "2017-12-07T10:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://nigerianpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/boko-haram-3.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7cdd90e7720dafa6813ed15af2084c95f663a1e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJULqzuHyJrdEZsKHqWIAopg7M8i1e.axmjnyFhNpBhgKq8hja_fuWkHVwlqaDEwXW6AShQAvnACLg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "afodiya", "published": "2017-12-07T10:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "Boko Haram war: Army removes commander", "text": "tweet \nThe Nigerian Army on Wednesday removed the Theatre Commander of t he Operation Lafiya Do le, Maj.

By Charlotte Gao for The Diplomat December 07, 2017 \nOn December 6, Jilin Daily , the official state-run newspaper of China\u2019s Jilin province, near the border with North Korea, published a page of articles discussing how to protect against injury in the case of a nuclear attack. \nThe full-page nuclear attack survival guide \u2014 which included information on nuclear weapons, protective measures, and the difference between various disasters \u2014 was published one week after North Korea launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile on November 29 . The article immediately alarmed the Chinese public as well as foreign media, as the public couldn\u2019t help worrying about the subtext behind the newspaper giving the advice at such a sensitive time. \nAs The Diplomat reported earlier, North Korea\u2019s nuclear test in September caused strong tremors \u2014 both physically and mentally \u2013 in China.The September explosion generated tremors equal to a 6.3 earthquake and was strongly felt in northern China, including Jilin province. Many local Chinese residents shared their experiences on Chinese social media and started to circulate guides on Weibo detailing how to protect oneself in case of a nuclear blast and nuclear radiation.

Just $5 a month. \nLater, on December 6, Jilin Daily declared that its full page of information on the same subject was provided by the People\u2019s Air Defense Office of Jilin Province and the article was published in an attempt to \u201cstrengthen normal national defense education.\u201d The People\u2019s Air Defense Office of Jilin Province also explained that the content dealing with nuclear arms is only \u201ccommon sense,\u201d and \u201cshould not be over-interpreted.\u201d \nCompared to Japan and other developed countries, China\u2019s education on nuclear issues is \u201cfar from enough,\u201d the Office added. \nAt the regular press briefing on December 6, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang didn\u2019t directly answer a question about Jilin Daily \u2019s article but instead teased the journalist who asked: \u201cIt never occurred to me that you are a reader and follower of Jilin Daily ! \u201d \nGeng then encouraged the journalist to follow other local media so as to \u201chelp flesh out your perception of China.\u201d \nNo matter what the Jilin Daily \u2019s intention really was, Chinese state media\u2019s recent remarks on North Korea have sent some new disturbing signals to the world. \nOn November 30, China Daily published an editorial titled \u201cGrave concerns that DPRK crisis is getting out of hand.\u201d The editorial threatened the world to be prepared for two choices: \u201clearning to live with the DPRK having nuclear weapons or triggering a tripwire to the worst-case scenario.\u201d \nOn December 6, Global Times , one of the most aggressive state-run newspapers in China, also published an editorial defending Jilin Daily. The editorial argued that the article \u201c doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the province faces the risk of nuclear attack.\u201d Yet the editorial further claimed: Even if a war erupts on the peninsula, it is South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. bases in the Asia-Pacific that will likely be priority targets for North Korea. There is a slim chance that the U.S. or North Korea will intentionally launch military attacks at China as they have no grounds. Meanwhile, as a powerful nuclear state, China will resolutely return like for like. \nSuch rhetoric actually has deepened the Chinese public\u2019s anxiety over the North Korean crisis.

The operatives who employ cyber terrorism can come from government agencies, political activist groups, even terrorist organizations. Some of the most notorious and widely publicized news stories include the Cyber Caliphate, WikiLeaks, The Morris Worm and The Sony Entertainment Hacks. Many of these cyber terrorists seek to compromise the US government\u2019s secret files. Some of these cyber terrorists claim to be patriots working towards transparency believing the government should keep no secrets from its citizens while other cyber hackers are working in the name of Islamic fundamentalism.        Cyberterrorism has been around since the late 1980s. According to the site NatoInternational in 1988 The Morris Worm was the first recognized virus to affect the world\u2019s cyber infrastructure. The virus rapidly spread to computers throughout the United States. The virus identified weaknesses within the system, replicating itself on a regular basis. Mostly only affecting computers in America, The Morris Worm slowed down computers across the country to the point of being unusable. Robert Tapan Morris, the criminal mastermind behind The Morris Worm, was subsequently arrested and became the first person to ever be charged under The Computer Fraud & Abuse Act . After his arrest, Morris claimed that \u201cI was just trying to gauge how big the Internet was.\u201d He now works as a professor at MIT.        Corporations have become a prime target for cyber terrorist activities. According to The Washington Post in 2014 hackers broke into the computer systems of Sony Pictures stealing confidential documents. This hacker group calling itself Guardians of Peace leaked email correspondence between co-workers, salaries of the company\u2019s executives and the bank account information of many other employees. A month later Guardians of Peace demanded that Sony halt the release of its upcoming comedy flick The Interview. The plot of the film depicts the assassination of North Korean communist dictator Kim Jong-Un. United States intelligence operatives believe Guardians of Peace \u2019s attack was sponsored by the North Korean government. The North Koreans have publicly denied any participation in the Sony hacks.      Many online hackers who\u2019ve dedicated their time and resources to exposing government secrets consider themselves political activists. According to the British Newspaper The Guardian , WikiLeaks was founded in 2006 by Australian computer programmer Julian Assange. WikiLeaks is a non-profit journalistic organization that publishes classified media from anonymous sources. In 2010, the site gained international recognition when it publicly released 76,000 classified documents from the US State Department. Some of the most scandalous documents exposed included the 2007 Baghdad airstrike. Iraqi journalists were among those killed. Another document allowed the mapping of 109, 032 Iraqi civilians deaths by insurgents. In 2011, WikiLeaks published 800 secret files regarding the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Fearing extradition to the United States for violations of the Espionage Act of 1917, Julian Assange fled to the British embassy in Ecuador where he currently resides.        There are some cyber terrorists working in the name of Islamic fundamentalism. According to the site GovTech an online hacker group claiming to be affiliated with ISIS, known as Cyber Caliphate , has been making worldwide headlines for a number of online incidents. After hacking into US Central Command, Cyber Caliphate threatened the lives of US soldiers and their families, publicly posting their names and home addresses online. Despite common stereotype tropes, Arabs are not the only operatives working in the name of ISIS. Cyber Caliphate hacker, Sally Jones, is a British citizen who converted to Islam and moved to Syria work as an ISIS recruiter. As a recruiter she hopes to appeal to more Westerners using her various twitter account aliases. Sally Jones posted on her social media platforms the phone numbers of the heads of the CIA, FBI and the NSA. US Intelligence agencies fear that ISIS recruiters like Sally Jones are becoming more and more successful in appealing to young people.      As our reliance on technology grows ever more pertinent we will continue to see a rise in cyberterrorism. The threat of hackers and potential harm they can do has brought considerable alarm to security experts and politicians. Intelligence agencies like the CIA seeking to protect national security interests are beefing up their defenses by hiring the best computer programmers they can find, while online activists like Julian Assange continue to make it their mission in life to expose the perceived corruptions within the US government. So whether we like it or not we are living under the threat of a new form of warfare.     \n      ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":
