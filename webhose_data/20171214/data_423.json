Nkabinde and Jafta, however, questioned its lawfulness.\nTheir counsel submitted that the tribunal had not been properly appointed, that its rules were invalid and that there was no complaint to investigate.\nThey then filed an application with the high court in Johannesburg, challenging the tribunal's lawfulness.\nIn 2014, the application was dismissed and the tribunal was told it could continue.\nJafta and Nkabinde approached the Supreme Court of Appeal, which further delayed the tribunal. The SCA dismissed the case in March 2016.\nNkabinde and her husband have four children.\nIn Thursday's special ceremonial session of the Constitutional Court to mark Nkabinde's retirement, the Chief Justice and other justices, as well as representatives of the executive, Parliament and the legal profession will participate.\nThe Constitutional Court said the event was open to the public, but added that seating would be limited.\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/news24", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bess nkabinde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hlophe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nkabinde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dikgang moseneke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacob zuma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john hlophe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jafta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris jafta", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "constitutional court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "concourt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court of appeal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of zululand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of north west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judicial service commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north west bar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bophuthatswana", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:06.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4f9470d1006f87dc5ef931dca04b6f7a6398099", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_rnZiGhPcZ9hUJke.xK3Ke7zS_461P8oE1q9Cn1qoMLvmbWZMZ6VK0XqIIVuw4uhDkqigbXuRypQ--", "site_full": "www.eastdulwichforum.co.uk", "site": "eastdulwichforum.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.eastdulwichforum.co.uk/forum/list.php?9", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "The East Dulwich Forum ", "title": "We know how difficult it can be to get stuff moved from A to", "title_full": "We know how difficult it can be to get stuff moved from A to", "published": "2017-12-07T00:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d4f9470d1006f87dc5ef931dca04b6f7a6398099", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_rnZiGhPcZ9hUJke.xK3Ke7zS_461P8oE1q9Cn1qoMLvmbWZMZ6VK0XqIIVuw4uhDkqigbXuRypQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "peckwoman", "published": "2017-12-07T00:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "We know how difficult it can be to get stuff moved from A to", "text": "Did a job for me this week with things I bought from here, excellent service.

Boris Collardi's overnight exit reveals how reliant the bank's board had grown on the CEO: the bank is effectively rudderless, despite quickly filling the vacuum at the top with deputy CEO Bernhard Hodler (pictured below). \nBut Hodler, who had only been appointed Collardi's deputy two months ago after being supplanted in his risk job, is a mid-term solution for Julius Baer, at best. Inside the bank, jockeying for position to replace him in running one of Switzerland's largest private banks has already begun. \nSovereign vs Subsidiary? \nInextricably linked with the succession planning is the question of Julius Baer's long-term aim: will the next CEO passionately defend the bank's sovereignty and acquire actively, as Collardi did? Or one who could imagine leading Julius Baer into the arms of one of Switzerland's giants like Credit Suisse? \nChairman Daniel Sauter is not only under pressure to present a succession plan \u2013 he must also keep the bank's share price afloat, as the best defense against takeover advances. \nWho are the top candidates to replace the energetic Collardi, who defined the face of Julius Baer so distinctively in the last eight years? The finews.com shortlist. \nWalter Berchtold \nThe former Credit Suisse banker's name was the first to begin circulating: Walter Berchtold has been itching to run a bank for over ten years now. In 2007, he lost out to Brady Dougan in the Credit Suisse CEO race. He was parachuted into Falcon Bank last year to clean up after the 1MDB mess , but didn't last long: Berchtold left suddenly after a spat with the bank's Abu Dhabi owners. \nThe Swiss banker, nicknamed \u00abWaedi\u00bb in Zurich banking circles, would probably slot in well in Julius Baer's heavily Credit Suisse-infused culture. Whether the 56-year-old is the right figurehead for Swiss banking's new era is, however, doubtful. \nGian Rossi \nThe 47-year-old career private banker knows Julius Baer inside out \u2013 he was one of the Swiss bank\u2019s first Credit Suisse recruits in 2006. Rossi, an ally of Collardi\u2019s, has endeared himself to management as a pinch hitter: he stepped in earlier this year as Swiss head when former Credit Suisse banker Barend Fruithof left following a recent revamp . \nHis qualifications are impeccable, and he is no stranger to Julius Baer\u2019s second home market, Asia (Rossi even briefly ran Credit Suisse\u2019s private bank in Singapore \u2013 albeit before it was as relevant as it is today \u2013 from 2000 to 2002). It is unclear whether Rossi, a father of two who doesn\u2019t court the limelight as Collardi did, wants a larger job than the one he already has.

Even though people love all different types of dogs, bulldog puppies and cute puppies, there are some that are considerably better with children than others. Even among the breeds that are considered good family dogs and those that aren\u2019t, there are exceptions that you should look for to make certain it is the right dog. Here we\u2019ll take a look at tips on finding a puppie that is good with children. Questions To Ask Your Breeder 1. What is the puppies overall temperament? It is important to understand what the general temperament of the particular breed that you\u2019re looking at is, as well as what the individual puppies temperament is. Generally speaking, a well-bred puppy will have the temperament that you would expect. But if you\u2019re getting the puppy from a pound or from an individual, then the treatment of that dog before you get it will play a part in its development. To avoid any unwelcome surprises, make sure that you get a puppy from someone that you trust who knows the puppy well and can tell you their temperament. 2. Is the puppy safe to be around all family members? Very young children are very difficult for some types of dogs and puppies . For this reason, if you have very young children you want to make sure that the puppy you\u2019re choosing is one that will be safe around your very young children. There are some dogs and puppies that will take almost anything young children can dish it out and they will continue to be loyal and loving and protective of that child. Other dogs will soon lose patience with children. 3. Does this dog type get along with other animals? It is very common for families to have other pets such as cats or another dog and if that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019ll want to make certain that the breed your choosing and the particular dog or puppy that you\u2019re interested in is capable of getting along with your other pets. Dogs And Puppies Known To Be Very Good Family Pets The Labrador retriever is by far one of the most popular family dogs and for good reason. This dog is very intelligent and is in almost every way a perfect dog for all members of the family. Another dog that is similarly popular is the golden retriever. It is known to be very gentle as a puppy and adult and at the same time is not timid which makes it a great dog for the whole family . The Vizlsa is a dog that you may not have heard of and yet it should be listed among the most loyal family dogs someone can own.

Regions like North America and Europe are the largest consumers of these type of products and the same is being propagated in to the developing regions like Asia- Pacific and Latin America. Recently the developing regions have been in great demand by the producers and the trend of such consumption is passing on to the developing countries.

It turns out that much of the food in such sediments comes from the creatures that lived in the water column, but then died and their remains sank to the bottom. The sinking cadavers may be as big as those of whales or as small as those of bacteria. Dead algae may be as big as giant kelp or as small as members of the picoplankton. And what is the fate of the cadavers once they reach the bottom? It turns out that their DNA is a significant component of this food resource. Eleven years ago, here in STC, we had a post commenting on articles from marine scientists Dell'Anno and Danovaro and colleagues ( here and here ) that described the abundance and residence time of DNA in ocean sediments. We were struck by the sheer magnitude of the amount of DNA estimated to be present in the top 10\u2009cm of the world's marine sediments. About 10 7 metric tons of extracellular DNA were estimated to be deposited on the ocean floor every year! But of course, that area is huge\u2009so\u2009it's\u2009important to consider the amount of extracellular DNA (cadaver-derived) relative to that of the organisms living in the sediment. This was still very impressive, extracelular DNA was estimated to be six- to eight-fold more abundant than that from all of the live organisms in the top 10\u2009cm of sediment.\n\nA scene from the bottom of the ocean (deep benthos). Source \nFast forward to the present and consider the implications of this work for metagenomic analyses of marine sediments. Such analyses would use as substrate for\u2009deep\u2009sequencing the total sediment DNA, a minority of this being from local (benthic) residents and the\u2009majority\u2009from\u2009organisms that never saw the sea bottom while they\u2009were\u2009alive. Given that the papers we commented on eleven ago were published when metagenomic analyses were in their infancy, we wondered whether those results had some influence in the way marine sediment analyses (and metagenomic studies in general) are done today. So we did a quick analysis by simply glancing at subsequent papers that have cited the original paper by Dell'Anno and Danovaro. We were delighted to find out that the paper has not been forgotten, the Web of Science shows that paper has been cited 146 times. After a cursory reading of those abstracts, perhaps the most reassuring fact that stood out was that many of the metagenomic analyses used both DNA and RNA substrates for amplifications (given the short half-life of RNA, there is very little of it outside cells in contrast to DNA). That way, the genes from living cells can be distinguished from those from extracellular DNA. One particular paper published in 2015 by Andrea Torti and colleagues did a very thorough analysis of the origin and dynamics of the extracellular DNA pools in marine sediments. We found one speculation of theirs very appealing and provocative, namely that \"extracellular DNA may provide an integrated view of the biodiversity and ecological processes occurring on land, in marine water columns, and sediments themselves, thereby acting as an archive of genetic information which can be used to reconstruct past changes in source environments.\" Enter a new tool in our quest to reconstruct the past!\n\nOn a final note, this issue of extracellular DNA influencing metagenomic analyses is clearly not limited to the ocean floor. In this regard, it was nice to find among the citing articles, one published last year by Paul Carini and colleagues whose title says it all: \"Relic DNA is abundant in soil and obscures estimates of soil microbial diversity.\" Bottom line (pun intended), it was a nice exercise to revisit an old post and see what influence the work of over a decade ago has had on the field. That's impact.\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roberto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elio   ever", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul carini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danovaro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea torti", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:13.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f9adf7504d2ce1892c2789ecdd821843477795d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pwYVyQ48uVCdr01GRejWNgy3qhfSJZPAg", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/mu/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/mu/ -
