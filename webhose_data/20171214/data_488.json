(AP) \u2014 Mitt Romney\u2019s allies lashed out at former White House strategist Steve Bannon on Wednesday, a day after he said at an Alabama rally that Romney and his family \u201chid behind\u201d their Mormon religion to avoid military service.\nSen. Orrin Hatch and other prominent Utah Republicans criticized Bannon for comments they said amounted to an ill-informed attack on the Mormon faith. Romney received a draft deferment during the Vietnam War while doing missionary work, which The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints strongly encourages for young men.\n\u201cI\u2019d be more than happy to sit down with Mr. Bannon and help him understand more about the LDS Church at his convenience. I\u2019ve got a copy of the Book of Mormon with his name on it,\u201d Hatch, a Mormon, said in a statement.\nThe dispute was tied to the nest of politics entangling the Utah and Alabama Senate seats and the larger GOP civil war.\nHatch, 83, is believed to be considering retirement, and Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who now lives in Utah, is eyeing a run. That makes him a target for Bannon, an anti-establishment firebrand who has vowed to defeat several Republican Senate incumbents in next year\u2019s midterm elections because, in his view, they haven\u2019t done enough to support President Donald Trump\u2019s policies.\nRomney fiercely criticized Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and recently denounced Bannon\u2019s preferred candidate in the Alabama Senate race. Romney said Monday that electing GOP candidate Roy Moore, who is accused of molesting two girls decades ago when he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s, would be \u201ca stain on the GOP and on the nation.\u201d Moore has denied the women\u2019s accusations and has rejected calls to leave the race before the Dec. 12 election.\nIn a curious twist, just as his former political adviser was slamming Romney, Trump was on the phone with the 2012 GOP presidential nominee. Two people familiar with the conversation say that Trump and Romney discussed taxes and other issues and that Bannon\u2019s name did not come up.\nThe people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private call.\nIt was unclear whether Trump and Romney discussed the Utah or Alabama Senate seats. Earlier in the week, Trump urged Hatch, already the longest-serving Republican senator in history, to seek an eighth term next year, at least in part to block Romney\u2019s Senate ambitions.\nBannon drew loud cheers at a Moore rally in Alabama on Tuesday night when he charged that Romney used his religion to avoid military service. He noted that Moore graduated from the U.S. Military Academy, while Romney received a draft deferment for his missionary work in France.\n\u201cYou hid behind your religion,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cDo not talk to me about honor and integrity.\u201d\nBannon also touched on Romney\u2019s presidential bid and family in his criticism.\n\u201cYou ran for commander in chief and had five sons \u2014 not one day of service in Afghanistan or Iraq. We have 7,000 dead and 52,000 casualties, and where were the Romneys during those wars?\u201d Bannon asked. He added, \u201cJudge Roy Moore has more honor and integrity in his pinky finger than your entire family.\u201d\nBannon served in the Navy after the Vietnam War. He later worked as a strategist for Trump, who obtained deferments during the Vietnam War for his education and for bone spurs. Neither of Trump\u2019s adult sons served in the military.\nRomney\u2019s eldest son, Tagg Romney, declined to respond to Bannon\u2019s remarks, but several Utah Republicans defended the Romney family.\nHatch called Bannon\u2019s verbal assault \u201cdisappointing and unjustified.\u201d\n\u201cI also resent anyone attacking a person\u2019s religious views, but particularly our own Christian LDS faith and the selfless service of missionary work,\u201d Hatch said in his statement.\nUtah Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, tweeted that Romney and his family \u201crepresent the best of Utah values.\u201d\n\u201cUtahns rejects the ugly politics and tactics\u201d of Bannon, he added.\nThe state\u2019s junior Republican senator, Mike Lee, said, \u201cYou can\u2019t credibly call into question (Romney\u2019s) patriotism or moral character \u2014 especially on the basis of his religious beliefs or his outstanding service as a missionary.\u201d\nMiller reported from Washington.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mitt romney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve banno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tagg romney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary herbert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orrin hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christian lds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "church of jesus christ of latter-day saints", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lds church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. military academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romneys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ala.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montgomery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:54.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66233118d3415a818f54a874ec1cb46370f902e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_6gK.pJBcZV1W0s1TBiPI0rfgc83YdDLlvYfZ0925d0WtQOei9RGJipCm2OP_GLfi1VTtWkLPxfd0aRWIQDsVM6rAmJzP7DB7ppxhpUC87ow0OBhfnZOZxWoCISS79cmU-", "site_full": "www.lcf.org.ph", "site": "lcf.org.ph", "site_section": "http://www.lcf.org.ph/index.php?option=com_ninjarsssyndicator&feed_id=1&format=raw", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "News", "title": "JGF\u2019s Project ACE Scholarships Helps Youth Secure a Brighter Future", "title_full": "JGF\u2019s Project ACE Scholarships Helps Youth Secure a Brighter Future", "published": "2017-12-07T03:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66233118d3415a818f54a874ec1cb46370f902e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_6gK.pJBcZV1W0s1TBiPI0rfgc83YdDLlvYfZ0925d0WtQOei9RGJipCm2OP_GLfi1VTtWkLPxfd0aRWIQDsVM6rAmJzP7DB7ppxhpUC87ow0OBhfnZOZxWoCISS79cmU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "communications@lcf.org.ph (Communications)", "published": "2017-12-07T03:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "JGF\u2019s Project ACE Scholarships Helps Youth Secure a Brighter Future", "text": "Member News Archive JGF\u2019s Project ACE Scholarships Helps Youth Secure a Brighter Future Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC) has always believed in the powerof the youth to transform, make positive changes, and contribute to a better society. In 2004, Jollibee Group Foundation (JGF) launched Project ACE (Improving Access, Curriculum, and Employability) Scholarships to provide underprivileged but deserving youth with access to quality education. JGF has partnered with Don Bosco technical-vocational schools and different academic institutions across the country including Don Bosco centers in Mandaluyong City (Metro Manila), Canlubang (Laguna), San Jose City (Nueva Ecija), Legazpi City (Albay), Cebu City and Mati City (Davao Oriental). JGF works closely with its partner schools to ensure scholars gain the necessary skills and training that will prepare them for the workplace. Last October and November, 114 Don Bosco scholars graduated from technical skills training, increasing the number of graduate scholars from these schools to 310. To date, Project ACE has also helped 178 scholars obtain their college degrees. Project ACE graduate scholars from Don Bosco Canlubang pose for a group photo. A total of 114 scholars graduated from four JGF partner Don Bosco centers from October to November 2017. Graduate scholars Simeon Labrador (left) and Carlos Golosinda (right) pose with their proud parents after the graduation ceremonies. A Grateful Scholar Monique Velasco, 24, is now an Assistant Restaurant Manager in Jollibee. The former ACE scholar from Legazpi City is grateful for the program that helped her access college education and exposed her to support programs that ensured employability. \u201cMy college studies would not have been possible without ACE. It was truly a blessing for me and my family. It helped me finish college and developed me to reach my full potential,\u201dshe said. Unique to the ACE scholarship is the on-the-job training provided by JFC during their third and fourth years in college. This is where the values of hard work and dedication are further inculcated to help reach their fullest potential. Monique is motivated to reach another achievement as she aims to get promoted as a Restaurant Manager within the next two to three years. She is proof that nothing is impossible with hard work and dedication. Project ACE alumna and Jollibee Assistant Restaurant Manager Monique Velasco credits the scholarship program for helping her complete her tertiary education and gaining work experience that helped ensure her employment. Expansion Plans JGF has also partnered with the Human Resource Department of Jollibee, Chowking, and Greenwich to provide workshops and on-the-job training to ACE scholars pursuing the food service and restaurant management track. This ensures that the graduates are ready to take on roles in the workplace upon graduation. \u201cIn the coming months, we are looking into Agriculture and Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) Management \u2013 related courses. We hope that with these plans, we will be able to add more female scholars and add more facilities like food laboratories that the scholars can use,\u201d said Ms. Laize-Ar Cruzat, Program Manager of Project ACE.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jollibee foo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monique velasco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don bosco canlubang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mati city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don bosco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simeon labrador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carlos golosinda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monique", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laize-ar cruzat", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "human resource department of jollibee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nueva ecija", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jollibee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jollibee group foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davao oriental", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "legazpi city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laguna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canlubang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandaluyong city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metro manila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cebu city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenwich", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:54.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "99a9872a70ec49e188498928f3514f51de1ea191", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3fq59MhvWkPZzqjO1DdPOlUKDlq8eTP7k7UC6AgMVFRcoaF1FOmA43adVb2g.Q5.oFm4TBrOv5YGhjbEYviev.tTIgfGbMfY_3cnw2h0iaBrJB7.Qvjl4Fh8lmVgCezs-", "site_full": "themeshreport.com", "site": "themeshreport.com", "site_section": "https://themeshreport.com", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The Mesh Report", "title": "Shulkin urges emergency aid for VA private health care soon", "title_full": "Shulkin urges emergency aid for VA private health care soon", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "99a9872a70ec49e188498928f3514f51de1ea191", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3fq59MhvWkPZzqjO1DdPOlUKDlq8eTP7k7UC6AgMVFRcoaF1FOmA43adVb2g.Q5.oFm4TBrOv5YGhjbEYviev.tTIgfGbMfY_3cnw2h0iaBrJB7.Qvjl4Fh8lmVgCezs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "the Mesh Report Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Shulkin urges emergency aid for VA private health care soon", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In a fresh warning, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin said Wednesday there could potentially be delays in providing medical care to tens of thousands of veterans if lawmakers don\u2019t act soon to approve billions in emergency funding for the ailing private-sector Choice program.\nIn a statement, Shulkin said he was heartened by several congressional bills that would provide longer-term fixes to the Department of Veterans Affairs program by giving veterans wider freedom to see private doctors at taxpayers\u2019 expense. But pointing to the lack of a clear consensus so far, Shulkin made clear he would be \u201copen\u201d to emergency short-term funding from Congress for now \u201cto ensure our veterans receive uninterrupted care.\u201d\n\u201cAs we have made clear for many months, Congress needs to pass a bill this year,\u201d Shulkin said.\nHis statement comes as lawmakers wrestle over legislation that would overhaul Choice, amid the threat of a government shutdown over the federal budget and disagreements over cost and how much access veterans should have to private doctors.\nThe Senate Veterans Affairs Committee last week passed a $54 billion bipartisan plan over five years to revamp Choice, which provides $4 billion in emergency short-term funding for Choice and other VA programs for 2018 and also expands a popular caregivers program. But the measure faces some resistance from Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Jerry Moran of Kansas, who are co-sponsoring a separate bill intended to give added access to private care \u201crather than relying on the VA bureaucracy to determine eligibility criteria.\u201d\nThe House Veterans Affairs Committee, led by Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., meanwhile, has yet to reach agreement on how to pay for the $39 billion cost of its long-term proposal to revamp Choice. Republicans have proposed $2.1 billion in emergency short-term funding for Choice in a separate bill that would also establish a presidential commission to review VA facilities for possible closure, which is opposed by Democrats.\n\u201cAt this time, the committee is working with the department to review the Choice account and determine when that account will need additional funding,\u201d said Tiffany Haverly, Roe\u2019s spokeswoman.\nIn September, the VA warned that Choice could run out of money sooner than expected in late December or early January, even after Congress approved $2.1 billion in emergency funding in August that was intended to last until February. Earlier this year, it began limiting referrals to outside doctors in July when money first began to run low and veterans reported delays in care.\nThe Choice program currently allows veterans to see private doctors if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or travel more than 40 miles to a VA facility. President Donald Trump has pledged to triple the number of veterans \u201cseeing the doctor of their choice,\u201d raising concerns among major veterans\u2019 groups about \u201cprivatization\u201d of VA care.\nMore than 30 percent of VA appointments are currently made in the private sector.\nFollow Hope Yen on Twitter at https://twitter.com/hopeyen1 \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david shulkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shulkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tiffany haverly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phil roe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry moran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john mccain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house veterans affairs committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate veterans affairs committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of veterans affairs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-tenn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "va", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:54.038+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d3582cdfbd624cd60e1e2c5b090b7895af1eb02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Uchosh.C6CSzu1wIRHyKm3T_h_vIltQWTVMEBqAogaqie1FjeqwcuUM8yA50ZLhXnWjj6c4.sSWHCYU.WA3vNtK9aXDy1UO0qxuZPJ5KCO8bA--", "site_full": "dyanmicmovies.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://dyanmicmovies.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Dyanmic Movies | Watch & Download Movies for Free", "title": "iGyaan Network: Xiaomi Redmi 5 And Redmi 5 Plus Launched", "title_full": "iGyaan Network: Xiaomi Redmi 5 And Redmi 5 Plus Launched", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d3582cdfbd624cd60e1e2c5b090b7895af1eb02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Uchosh.C6CSzu1wIRHyKm3T_h_vIltQWTVMEBqAogaqie1FjeqwcuUM8yA50ZLhXnWjj6c4.sSWHCYU.WA3vNtK9aXDy1UO0qxuZPJ5KCO8bA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mukul Tomar (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "iGyaan Network: Xiaomi Redmi 5 And Redmi 5 Plus Launched", "text": "iGyaan Network India's Largest Online Independent Network, with Tech Reviews , Cellphones, Smartphones, Laptops, Tablets and Gadgets, Fashion, Food, Culture and Art  Xiaomi Redmi 5 And Redmi 5 Plus Launched Dec 7th 2017, 08:58, by Vipul Vij \nXiaomi has launched two new budget-oriented smartphones Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus at an event in China today.\nThe Redmi 5 is priced at CNY 799 (Rs 7,800 approx) for the 2GB RAM/16GB storage variant and CNY 899 (Rs 8,800 approx.) for the 3GBRAM/ 32GB storage variant and will be available in Black, Blue, Gold and Rose Gold colours.

But, considering the popularity of the Redmi series in India, it won\u2019t be a stretch to assume that at least one of the devices will be launched in India sooner rather than later.\nYou are receiving this email because you subscribed to this feed at blogtrottr.com .

Businesses like banks, plumbers, anything where you could only get the service locally. It\u2019s less important for companies that don\u2019t rely on a bricks-and-mortar presence to sell their product or service, say a software vendor or someone who sells products online only. \nThere are a number of high profile local directories and mapping services but there is one we recommend focusing on: Google My Business . The \u201cLocal 3-5 Pack\u201d listing unit from Google My Business shows above normal organic website listings for local oriented queries and are often as deep down into the search results page as a user will go. Learning how to optimize your listings will give your business more visibility. Because of that, these next few tips are just as important as optimizing your website. \nWe optimize for Google My Business, and local SEO in general, by making sure the listing itself has a few of the essentials locked in. A company\u2019s name, address, and phone number (often referred to as NAP) should be consistent everywhere this business is listed on the internet. \nAcross the internet, the business should have the same formatting of the phone number, same formatting of the address, etc. There are many websites out there that scrape the internet for company information, and those can be where the NAP of a business can be wrong. \nThere are a number of tools to help with the crazy volume of online business directories. Our preferred wrangling tool is MozLocal which takes your Google My Business info and compares it against their list of other directories and notifies you when a directory has incorrect info. Sometimes it can even correct the information automatically. \nPast the NAP, you want to make sure your website is linked, your hours are listed, and that there are photos of the interior and exterior of the business. All of these details will make it more likely that Google will show your listing above your competition. \nReviews \nThe other big factor in ranking for local results is reviews. Proactively generating reviews is a long term initiative that requires effort across the organization. \nA business needs to think critically about how to generate reviews, and how to direct reviews to the right place. We recommend choosing a single review platform to direct customers to. This allows you to give clear directions and prevents dilution of reviews across multiple platforms. Google My Business will be that single location in most situations. Yelp is another platform to consider for business (like restaurants) where Yelp has a bigger presence. \nThe more reviews your business has, the better you\u2019re going to rank. The number of reviews, the quality of reviews, and the recency of those reviews all matter. \nAnd, we\u2019ve come up with a couple insider tips to get people to the right place to leave a review: \nStep 1: First, open up an incognito page on your smartphone (desktop does not allow you to do some steps of this process). \nStep 2: Then, search for your company\u2019s name. In this example, we\u2019ll use Room 214. \nStep 3: After a Google search, the maps will pull up, and you can select the location you are looking for. If your company has just one location, you can scroll right to it. \nStep 4: Scroll down to the \u201cRate and Review\u201d section and click the fifth star to give a rating. \nStep 5: Google will ask you to sign in, but you can just select the link and copy it. \nNow, when you send customers to that link, it will automatically have five stars selected and be on the right company for them to review. If you want to go a step farther, you can even create a simple URL on your site that redirects to the review URL. For example, you could redirect http://www.example.com/review directly to the review URL. That way your sales or service team can leave simple collateral behind with an easy-to-remember URL for customers that they\u2019ve had a positive experience with. \nThis is one of many steps to optimize your local SEO. Remember, make sure your NAP is consistent across the internet, make sure your business has its hours listed and photos of the inside and outside, and make sure you are directing your customers to the right place for reviews. \nEvery step matters in optimizing your local SEO.

But is this possible?\nAir Force General John Hyten, commander of Strategic Command, told the Halifax International Security Forum Nov. 18, that an order from the president to launch nuclear weapons can be refused if that order is determined to be illegal. In the face of an unlawful order, Gen. Hyten said, he would tell Trump he couldn\u2019t carry it out. \u201cIf it\u2019s illegal, guess what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d Hyten asked the gathering. \u201cI\u2019m going to say, \u2018Mr. President, that\u2019s illegal.\u2019\u201d\nFour days earlier, retired Gen. Robert Kehler, who previously held Gen. Hyten\u2019s top job at Strategic Command, testified likewise to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying that nuclear war commanders could \u201cignore any unlawful order by the president to launch a nuclear strike.\u201d\nGenerals Hyten and Kehler both said in their unprecedented public comments that the legal principles of \u201cmilitary necessity,\u201d \u201cdiscriminate destruction,\u201d and \u201cproportionality\u201d all apply to decisions about nuclear attacks. Senator Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, asked Gen. Kehler if he meant that Strategic Command could disobey a president\u2019s ordering a nuclear attack. \u201cYes,\u201d Kehler said.\nThat military officers \u201ccould\u201d disobey, or \u201ccan\u201d refuse unlawful orders are actually understatements in this context. US military service manuals explicitly require military personal to refuse illegal orders. As everyone sworn-in to the service is taught, disobeying illegal orders is mandatory; following them is a crime worthy of court martial. As CNN reported: \u201cUnder US military law, troops are obligated to not obey an unlawful order. If they received such an order, they could resign or force Trump to fire them.\u201d The point was made during last year\u2019s presidential campaign, when Trump promised to unlawfully torture prisoners, kill the families of suspected militants, and bomb civilians. CNN reported then that \u201cPentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook noted on [Nov. 17, 2016] that all US troops have an obligation not to follow illegal orders.\u201d\nCertain Weapons Effects Always Unlawful\nBut more importantly, there is a deep and startling absurdity and a shocking ignorance in these public nuclear war conversations. Any use of nuclear weapons would be indiscriminate and illegal by definition. Only the uninitiated, uninformed or willfully blind can still imagine that today\u2019s nuclear weapons could be used \u201cproportionately\u201d to produce more military good than evil. The uncontrollable, unlimited, and unfathomable magnitude of nuclear weapons effects have been established as unlawful in countless text books, law journals, government studies and independent analyses.\nThe use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances would be illegal because international covenants, treaties, and protocols forbid indiscriminate destruction, attacks that are disproportionate to a military objective, and weapons\u2019 effects that \u201ctreacherously wound,\u201d harm neutral states, or do long-term damage to the environment.\nIn her book Thermonuclear Monarchy Professor Elaine Scarry of Harvard reminds us that as long ago as 1995, Sweden, Iran and Egypt argued before the International Court of Justice that since nuclear weapons cause disproportionate suffering, they are prohibited by the 1868 Declaration of St. Petersburg and the Geneva Protocols of 1925, 1949, and 1977. The Republic of the Marshall Islands argued that using nuclear weapons would violate the 1907 Hague Conventions prohibiting weapons with effects that cross into neutral states. Both North Korea and India, neither of which possessed nuclear weapons in 1995, wrote to the World Court insisting that it judge them unlawful. India argued that any use of nuclear weapons, including the mere possession of them, is illegal under the Charter of the United Nations and international \u201crules of proportionality.\u201d\nCharles Moxley, in his 813-page study Nuclear Weapons & International Law, puts this list of treaty violations in perspective: \u201cNuclear weapons are not illegal just because they violate these laws of war, as exhaustively proven in this volume. They are illegal because they cause widespread and indiscriminate destruction without promoting the purpose of war: resolving conflict \u2026 They are not weapons but only wanton machines of symmetric destruction.\u201d\nPhysical Effects: \u201cComplete ruin\u201d\nWhat the generals and the congressional bureaucrats fail to grasp in their fantasies of legal nuclear attacks, is the vastness of the difference between conventional and nuclear weapons, and that the latter cannot be used in war without slaughtering hundreds of thousands of civilians\u2014that is, without committing war crimes. Some uncomfortable background information might be necessary.\nMoxley\u2019s Nuclear Weapons & International Law reports that, \u201cA nuclear detonation generates temperatures of 100 million degrees while a dynamite explosive about 3000 degrees.\u201d What this unimaginable heat does to cities is explained by Lynn Eden in her book Whole World on Fire. \u201cMass fire and extensive fire damage would occur in almost every circumstance in which nuclear weapons were detonated in a suburban or urban area. \u2026damage from mass fire would extend two to five times farther than blast damage.\u201d\nIn 1977, the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 653-page book The Effects of Nuclear Weapons notes with understatement, \u201cpersons in buildings or tunnels close to ground zero may be burned by hot gases and dust entering the structure\u2026\u201d In its lengthy consideration of radiation effects, taken from the US Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission, the FEMA study says in part, \u201cAmong them, apart from genetic effects, are the formation of cataracts, nonspecific life shortening, leukemia, other forms of malignant disease, and retarded development of children in utero at the time of the exposure.\u201d As Ann Fagan Ginger reported in her book Nuclear Weapons are Illegal, \u201cThey continue to maim and kill long after they explode in a test or in a war.\u201d\nA mass fire or \u201cfirestorm\u201d Eden writes, is \u201cthe simultaneous combustion of many fires over a large area, which causes a great volume of air to heat, rise, and suck in large amounts of fresh air at hurricane speeds from the periphery,\u201d Eden notes. \u201cWithin ten minutes after the cataclysmic events associated with the detonation, a mass of buoyantly rising fire-heated air would signal the start of a second and distinctly different event\u2014the development of a mass fire of gigantic scale and ferocity. This fire would quickly increase in intensity. In a fraction of an hour it would generate ground winds of hurricane force with average air temperatures well above the boiling point of water (212\u00b0F, 100\u00b0C). This would produce a lethal environment over a vast contiguous area.\u201d\nEden\u2019s research is worth quoting at length. \u201cThe first mass fire in history was created by allied incendiary raids at Hamburg on the night of July 27-28, 1943. Within 20 minutes, two of three buildings within an area of 4.5 square miles were on fire. In three to six hours, this fire so completely burned out an area of more than 5 square miles that the area was referred to by damage analysts as the \u2018Dead City.\u2019 Well-documented accounts describe wind speeds of hurricane force within the city. Air temperatures were calculated to be between four and five hundred degrees Fahrenheit, hundreds of degrees above the temperature of boiling water. [Up to] 100,000 people were killed in the attack. A mass fire resulting from a modern nuclear weapon could be expected to burn out an urban or suburban area of considerably larger size in a similarly brief time.\u201d\nLegal scholar George Delf\u2019s Humanizing Hell! The Law V. Nuclear Weapons is concise, bold, and direct. \u201c[A]rmed forces are committed by military, domestic and international law not to attack non-combatants. Any government which adopts a defense policy implying such an attack is therefore inciting its own forces to commit war crimes on a gigantic and suicidal scale.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://uziiw38pmyg1ai60732c4011-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/dropzone/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-5.02.32-PM-300x221.png", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/", "https://uziiw38pmyg1ai60732c4011-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/dropzone/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-5.02.32-PM.png", "https://uziiw38pmyg1ai60732c4011-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/dropzone/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-5.02.32-PM-768x566.png"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert kehler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george delf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ann fagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "generals hyten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john hyten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kehler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elaine scarry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben cardin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles moxley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lynn eden", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us atomic bomb casualty commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbs news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate foreign relations committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strategic command", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal emergency management agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "halifax international security forum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago tribune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international court of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pentagon press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moxley\u2019s nuclear weapons & international law", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. petersburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic of the marshall islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dead city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:56.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2787e636646c86cc41db50dcfe6fa9c16e4ef384", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJgfWf5qaY2C8aam16C8yCmMl1H9Ep0gmQiQFzrCFCqUotnmrRydv98UL8cj30p6KcONYSxl6DgZ8-", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Holiday-Decorations-Christmas-Decorations-Christmas-Lights/LED/N-5yc1vZc3tbZ1z11erc/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "REALLY BIG LIGHTS C9 -

- \nKSA, UAE, Kuwait and Bahrain visitors to UK up 6.6% in 2016 \nLondon top destination recording almost 3.5 million room nights Average spend of GCC travellers between $1,150 to $3,153 per trip 80% of stand space allocated for UK exhibitors at ATM 2018 already sold \n\nVisitors to the UK from KSA, UAE, Kuwait and Bahrain totalled 659,466 in 2016, an increase of 6.6%, amounting to almost 5,000 more visitors than the previous year, according to data released by Arabian Travel Market, (ATM), which is being held at Dubai World Trade Centre from 22-25 April 2018. \n\nThe UK welcomed over 350,000 visitors from the UAE; more than 150,000 from KSA; over 100,000 from Kuwait and just under 50,000 from Bahrain, which included nationals as well as expatriate residents. \n\nSimon Press, Senior Exhibition Director, ATM, said: \u201cThe average spent per trip to the UK by visitors from KSA, UAE, Kuwait and Bahrain, per person, ranged from $1,150 to $3,153 in 2016. With a choice of 32 weekly direct flights to the UK, visitors from Saudi Arabia alone spent $485 million in 2016, the highest average spend per visit of any of the UK\u2019s source markets. \n\n\u201cBecause GCC currencies are pegged to the US dollar, (Kuwait\u2019s dinar is pegged to a basket of currencies including the US Dollar and the Euro) outbound travellers from the GCC to the UK continue to take advantage of the dollar to sterling exchange rate. In June 2015, the UK pound was worth $1.59, today it is around $1.33, a fall of over 16%.\u201d \n\nThe report, which was conducted by ATM\u2019s research partner Colliers International, confirmed London as the most popular destination in the UK, recording almost 3.5 million room nights, compared to 3.9 million for the rest of England, 321,000 in Scotland, 215,000 in Wales, and almost 12,500 in Northern Ireland, in 2016. \n\n\nKeen to build on this growth, UK exhibitors already signed up for ATM 2018 include: current English Premier League champions Chelsea FC; AC Group, a leading supplier to the travel trade; the five-star family-run The Arch Hotel, in London; top children\u2019s attraction, Kidzania; Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, the international botanical research and education institute; national tourist board, VisitBritain; and luxury hotel operator, Macdonald Hotels and Resorts. \n\n\u201cThe popularity of destination UK with GCC travellers is echoed by increasing numbers of UK travel professionals attending ATM. Industry professionals from the UK visiting ATM were up 10% in 2017 compared to the previous year and we expect this number to keep rising, with 80% of stand space available to UK exhibitors already sold, five months out from the 2018 event. \n\n\u201cATM provides the perfect platform for UK destinations, hotels and attractions, as well as tour operators and travel agents, especially as Middle East travellers will continue to play a key role in the UK\u2019s tourism growth,\u201d added Press. \n\nThe UK stand will be managed by UKinbound for the first time in 2018 and CEO, Deirdre Wells is eager to capitalise on their presence at the show, allowing UKinbound and its members an opportunity to strengthen existing partnerships and foster new relationships from the GCC and other key regional markets. \n\nShe said: \u201cWe know that outbound travel from GCC countries alone is expected to grow by over 80% in the next 10 years. As the UK prepares to leave the European Union, managing the UK stand at the show is part of our new Global Britain strategy to broaden our international market appeal and will provide a platform to showcase the wealth of tourism attractions in the UK.\u201d \n\nAccording to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), the total contribution of Travel & Tourism to GDP was GBP209bn, 10.8% of GDP in 2016, and is forecast to rise by 2.2% in 2017, and to rise by 2.3% pa to GBP268.4bn, 11.4% of GDP in 2027, by which time international tourist arrivals are forecast to reach over 54 million generating expenditure of GBP42bn, an increase of 3.8% pa. \n\nATM 2018 has adopted Responsible Tourism as its main theme and this will be integrated across all show verticals and activities, including focused seminar sessions. \n\nCelebrating its 25 th year, ATM 2018 will build on the success of this year\u2019s edition, with a host of seminar sessions looking back over the last 25 years and how the hospitality industry in the MENA region is expected to shape up over the next 25. \n\nATM \u2013 considered by industry professionals as a barometer for the Middle East and North Africa tourism sector, welcomed almost 40,000 travel professionals to its 2017 event, including 2,661 exhibiting companies, signing business deals worth more than $2.5 billion over the four-day show.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "deirdre wells", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ksa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wttc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gcc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ac group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arch hotel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea fc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colliers international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world travel & tourism council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macdonald hotels", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuwait", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bahrain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kidzania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "visitbritain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai world trade centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal botanic gardens kew", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:56.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ccd5f8bd651c5a480339343b69fd9af31b1f39fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pCImt8UBblXlsuPoyQ7ZFAxtGhZfn7nsM", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/fa/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/fa/ - Fashion - 4chan", "title": "Is there any real way of telling how attractive you are 1-10?", "title_full": "/fa/ - Is there any real way of telling how attractive you are 1-10?

It is also, tragically, undergoing a decline in numbers. To the extent climate change and a degraded environment are responsible, we can be blamed for not heeding the repeated warnings of scientists and others.\nWarnings to humanity are much in the news again as the latest , signed by over 15,000 scientists from 184 countries, appeared in the journal Bioscience not long ago on November 13. But before, much before, there was an earlier one, now a quarter century past.\nThe late Henry Kendall was the winner of a Nobel Prize in physics, a founding member of the Union of Concerned Scientists, and the chairman of its governing board. He spearheaded the effort leading to the 1992 warning signed by 1700 eminent scientists, including then a majority of science Nobel Laureates. It appealed for the help of the world\u2019s peoples, its scientists, religious, industrial and business leaders.\nEarlier still, there was Rachel Carson\u2019s 1962 canary in the coal mine, The Silent Spring, famous for its attack on pesticides like DDT.\nWhile these warnings caution us on the degradation of our planet, there is one area that might be implied but is not specifically mentioned: the negative impact on the quality of our food. Noted first by Irakli Loladze, the relatively new discovery was hypothesized in 2002.\nIn the parts of the world relying on a plant-based diet, people cannot easily compensate for the loss of nutrients. The proven decline of protein, iron and zinc in grains, potatoes and vegetables will inevitably lead to stunted growth, anemia and more disease.\nThis distressing and unhappy prospect is not confined to humans. Bees rely on the goldenrod plant. It flowers late, and the protein in its pollen is vitally important for them to build themselves up to weather the winter. Unfortunately, as scientists have learned, the protein content in goldenrod has suffered a drastic loss of about a third as atmospheric CO2 levels have increased. There may be other causes like pesticides and parasitic mites but lack of nutrition has to be a major candidate.\nOn the other side of the world lives the harmless Koala bear. A marsupial, it is truly unique for feeding only on eucalyptus leaves. Most unusually the female has three vaginas, the outer two leading each to a separate uterus while the center passage is for delivery of its young. To complement this anatomy, the male is endowed with a double-pronged penis.\nMany causes are attributed to the serious drop in koala bear numbers, including habitat destruction, road kills, bush fires and loss of genetic fitness due to inbreeding, but also chlamydia. This STD has found a fertile field in its complicated genetic apparatus, aided possibly by weakened immunity. In some places infection rates are as high as 90 percent . Sadly, the little joeys pick it up suckling in their pouch. Moreover, the infection can also leave mothers infertile.\nNow a new threat has been identified leaving them on the brink . The koalas source of all nourishment, the eucalyptus tree, has been affected by increasing CO2 levels. The koalas rely on the mildly toxic leaves for food and water and up to now have been able to tolerate the toxicity \u2014 they sleep up to 20 hours to work it out . But the rise in CO2 has decreased nutrition content leaving them more poisonous. Feeding on these, the koalas are ingesting ever more poison. Worse, the Australian drought, blamed on global warming for its intensity, has left the leaves with reduced moisture content. The stresses have left the koalas dying from kidney failure.\nHow long before they are added to the ever-increasing endangered list? Unless the world really sits up and takes notice, we will be soon adding our pollinator bee friends and, eventually, ourselves to that list. It is what we have in common.\nArshad M.

IDF comprises of over 230 national diabetes associations in 165 countries, and has been leading the global diabetes community since 1950. The Dubai Diabetes Centre is the first and only such centre recognized within the United Arab Emirates. Dr Ahmad Bin Kalban, CEO of Hospital Services Sector at the DHA, said: \u201cWe are delighted that the Dubai Diabetes Centre is recognized in both categories, which is a remarkable achievement. Centre of Excellence in Diabetes Care includes centres that provide the whole range of comprehensive diabetes care and Centre of Education include those with a strong emphasis on patient education, a cornerstone of good diabetes care.\u201d Dr M. Hamed Farooqi, Director of the Dubai Diabetes Centre, said: \u201cSince the start of this centre in 2009, we have come a long way in ensuring that we provide specialised multidisciplinary services to people with diabetes under one-roof. Diabetes can cause serious complications if the sugar level is not well-controlled, this required specialised multidisciplinary care. At the centre, we provide international levels of care and have specialists such as nurse educators, dieticians, podiatrists, exercise therapists and retinal camera technicians. The centre has also started a paediatric endocrine clinic that comprises of a paediatric endocrinology, nurse educator and dietician specially trained to handle paediatric cases.

A study fuels hope that gene therapy can give long-lasting help and perhaps even cure the blood clotting disease called hemophilia. \n  \nBy ALAN FRAMAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Congress seems set to prevent a weekend government shutdown, but lawmakers and President Donald Trump still have longer-range disputes to settle over spending, immigration and other issues before they can declare budget peace. \nWith many on both sides deciding a headline-grabbing federal closure would be a political blunder - at least for now - the House planned to approve legislation Thursday financing federal agencies through Dec. 22. The Senate seemed ready to follow. Without legislation, many agencies would run out of money after midnight Friday and grind to a close. \nThe two-week spending measure is aimed at giving both parties' bargainers more time to reach longer-term budget decisions. To jumpstart that negotiating, Trump and congressional leaders were meeting Thursday to try reaching agreements. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., prompted the two Democrats to skip a bargaining session that was planned then. \nThis time, the White House smoothed the waters by following up with a more peaceable, written statement. It praised Pelosi and Schumer for choosing to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\" \nLater, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension. It also laid out administration budget goals, saying money for the military including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\" \nFor Republicans, a shutdown would put a humiliating bookend on a year in which they've controlled the White House and Congress with little to show for it. They want the public to focus instead on the GOP's prized $1.5 trillion tax bill, which party leaders hope to send Trump by Christmas. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nEven the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have been threatening to oppose the temporary spending measure, predicted passage. \n\"No one wants a shutdown, including Freedom Caucus members,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters. \nThe roughly 30-member caucus has been trying to win promises from leaders of spending curbs and quick passage of a full-year defense budget in exchange for backing the short-term bill. Without support from many of them, Republicans would need votes from Democrats to push the temporary spending measure through the House. \nWhile many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the short-term bill, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there. They know they'd still have leverage on subsequent bills needed to keep the government running. \nRepublicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes for passage. \nDemocrats have been using their leverage to insist on spending boosts for health care, infrastructure and other domestic programs that would match increases Republicans want for defense. \nDemocrats are also seeking an agreement to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. Trump ended safeguards against deportation three months ago but has expressed an openness to restoring them. \n___ \nAP reporters Andrew Taylor and Ken Thomas contributed.

YOUKYUNG LEEAP Business Writer \nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) - European stocks were higher while some Asian markets recovered from the previous day's losses on Thursday as investors focused on the U.S. tax reform and an upcoming U.S. jobs report. \nKEEPING SCORE: Britain's FTSE 200 rose 0.3 percent to 7,366.77 while France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent to 5,383.07. Germany's DAX gained 0.2 percent to 13,028.86. Futures augured flat opening on Wall Street. Dow futures remained unchanged while S&P futures added 0.1 percent. \nASIA'S DAY: Asia closed mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5 percent to 22,498.03 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5 percent to 5,977.70. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed earlier losses, adding 0.3 percent to 28,303.19. Most other regional benchmarks fell. The Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.7 percent to 3,272.05 and South Korea's Kospi lost 0.5 percent to 2,461.98. Stocks in Southeast Asia were mixed. \nANALYST'S VIEW: \"Asia equity investors found themselves standing in a sea of pain at yesterday's market close and are likely breathing a sigh of relief that both EU and U.S. equity investors appear a bit more level-headed for the time being,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading at OANDA. \nTAX: The U.S. Senate voted to begin negotiation with the House to reconcile their two tax bills on Wednesday in a sign that they can iron out differences. Republican leaders are pushing to send a final blended package to President Donald Trump to sign before Christmas. \nGEOPOLITICAL ISSUES: Market reaction was muted to President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, ending decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on the issue. In other global developments, the British and Irish prime ministers spoke, seeking to overcome a logjam in Brexit talks, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. \nU.S. JOBS: A report from payroll processor ADP showed private employers added 190,000 jobs last month, slightly better than expected. The report comes two days before a government jobs report, among the last key economic indicators before the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. \nOIL: Benchmark U.S. crude recovered slightly. It added 7 cents to $56.13 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the contract sank $1.66 to settle at $55.96 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 29 cents to $61.51 per barrel. It lost $1.64 to $61.22 a barrel on Wednesday. \nCURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 112.66 Japanese yen from 112.27 yen while the euro weakened to $1.1790 from $1.1796.

Recipients of the Ion Ratiu Democracy Fellowship will have an opportunity to engage with the Washington policy, media and scholarly communities, but also to find time for reflection and writing on democratic activism often not possible in the day-to-day struggle in their home/exile country. In this sense the IRDF will seek to replicate the type of life-changing experience that Ion Ratiu encountered as a young Romanian democracy activist in in Washington in the 1970s and 1980s. The IRDF is supported by the Ratiu Family Charitable Foundation, established in 1979. The Foundation aims to further education and research in Romanian culture and history, and to stimulate and support civil society in its understanding and application of democracy and democratic principles worldwide. The IRDF will be hosted by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars which aims to unite the world of ideas to the world of policy by supporting pre-eminent scholarship and linking that scholarship to issues of concern to officials in Washington. Eligibility The IRDF aims at thoughtful activists and engaged thinkers. Applicants with outstanding capability and experience from a wide variety of backgrounds (including government, journalism, the professions, NGOs, and academia) are eligible for appointment. Citizens or permanent residents from any country (applicants from countries outside the United States must hold a valid passport and be able to obtain a J-1 visa even if they are currently in the United States). English proficiency as the Center is designed to encourage the exchange of ideas among its fellows Fellowship Details The Ion Ratiu Democracy Fellowship provides awardees with a stipend to spend from one to three months at the Wilson Center. Under the terms of the grant, the IRDF offers a monthly stipend of $5,000. Fellows are required to be in residence at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. for the duration of their grant. Each fellow is assigned a furnished work space available to him or her every day around the clock. The Center is located in the heart of Washington, D.C., and includes conference rooms, a reference library, and a dining room. Fellows will also be provided a research assistant (intern) to support their research activities. Application Materials Both nominations and self-applications are welcome. A complete application/nomination package must include the following: 1. Application/Nomination Form (see below); 2. An essay on planned objectives and activities (not to exceed 2,000 words); 3. A curriculum vitae, listing relevant experiences, accomplishments and publications (not to exceed three pages); 4. A list of relevant literature and resources; 5. Two letters of recommendation (or one nomination letter and one additional recommendation). Selection Selection will be based on the merit of the proposed objectives and activities and the applicant\u2019s qualifications and experience. It involves a peer-review process guided by an advisory board composed of former Ratiu Awardees and Fellows and members of and advisers to the Ratiu Foundation. Successful applicants proceed to a second round of selection, which may include a phone or in-person interview.
