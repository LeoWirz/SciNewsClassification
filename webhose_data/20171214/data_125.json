CT and MRI findings were compared on the following imaging findings: the shape of the cystic lesions and the presence or absence of septum, calcification, and high-intensity fluid on T1- and diffusion-weighted images ( b factor\u2009=\u20091000). The degree of contact with the pancreatic tail was compared between the EDCs and six of the MCNs at the edge of the pancreatic tail.\nResults The EDCs were round ( n \u2009=\u20093) or oval ( n \u2009=\u20095), while the MCNs consisted of three round, five oval, six pear-like, and six multilobulated lesions ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). Septum was present in 4 of 8 (50%) EDCs and 19 of 20 (95%) MCNs ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). The presence of calcification (2 of 8 [25%] EDCs vs. 8 of 20 [40%] MCNs), high-intensity fluid on T1-weighted images (2 of 7 [29%] EDCs vs. 5 of 20 [25%] MCNs), and high-intensity fluid on diffusion-weighted images (5 of 7 [71%] EDCs vs. 5 of 20 [25%] MCNs) were not significantly different. The degree of contact with the pancreatic parenchyma was similar between the two types of lesions.\nConclusion Although the imaging findings for EDC without a solid component and MCN overlap, a pear-like or multilobulated shape may favor a diagnosis of MCN.\n\n\nfrom Cancer via ola Kala on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2B9CifE\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "edc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ola kala", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:16.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee624aa4f985b1a41cfdf54d6b752c2c6e8f7b7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTEPfOND8kMmv4kYVOtrHv.YSaRbTmCJbfSB9y7BwPywxRUbZa7KdQa4L9r3jPib4npmiH1qWIErrVQ.0kG0h.amW46bWq3vtjH1zXpDiJz3.rnkoOSoH085FyCagrUc1ccRM6YvDuEIZSgplkuCEd3Yiec8LjUewywnBZjirlIxPoFhcTYgswjYO2KM8SFeUc-", "site_full": "boydlong.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://boydlong.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Purchase the Cushions that Are The most effective in\u00c2\u00a0Business https://t.co/awa78boojO https://t.co/ESjcivHZGd \u2013 Site Title", "title": "Purchase the Cushions that Are The most effective in Business https://t.co/awa78boojO https://t.co/ESjcivHZGd", "title_full": "Purchase the Cushions that Are The most effective in Business https://t.co/awa78boojO https://t.co/ESjcivHZGd", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee624aa4f985b1a41cfdf54d6b752c2c6e8f7b7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTEPfOND8kMmv4kYVOtrHv.YSaRbTmCJbfSB9y7BwPywxRUbZa7KdQa4L9r3jPib4npmiH1qWIErrVQ.0kG0h.amW46bWq3vtjH1zXpDiJz3.rnkoOSoH085FyCagrUc1ccRM6YvDuEIZSgplkuCEd3Yiec8LjUewywnBZjirlIxPoFhcTYgswjYO2KM8SFeUc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "boydlong", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "Purchase the Cushions that Are The most effective in Business https://t.co/awa78boojO https://t.co/ESjcivHZGd", "text": "Purchase the Cushions that Are The most effective in Business https://t.co/awa78boojO https://t.co/ESjcivHZGd \n\u2014 Boyd Long (@jivevoguxane) December 7, 2017 \nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js \n\nfrom Twitter https://twitter.com/jivevoguxane ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "boyd long", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:16.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "957df4fbcc81f9102ce7125219013885d0c7c955", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TdDeGOxVTGrOf0WpU2tVDr9__EOe03m8E0yPrOBvYLNmogIqV04JM11BnLYlu9S.HDeYPCdRfLwBIHOrrXbeoD_iwCMQH8zbesMAT96rLQNA--", "site_full": "averypublicsociologist.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://averypublicsociologist.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "All That Is Solid ...", "title": "On Stoke-on-Trent's Homeless Tax", "title_full": "On Stoke-on-Trent's Homeless Tax", "published": "2017-11-22T01:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "70bc02da0bc1ab3db2cab31d60c5bb9c7cf8de91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TdDeGOxVTGrOf0WpU2tVDr9__EOe03m8E0yPrOBvYLNmogIqV04JM11BnLYlu9S.HDeYPCdRfLwBIHOrrXbeoD_iwCMQH8zbf8PaY4oQxWBxquD48qp5.P", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "ejh", "published": "2017-12-06T16:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Labour would probably be better off without him but is that a fair reason for excluding him?

Socialism, as its name suggests, is based on a belief in the notion of action through the community, in the idea that individuals do not stand alone, and that it is not merely morally right that we should think of ourselves in this way but that it is the most rational way to organise our lives. The world we face today makes a socialist approach all the more relevant: from new technology to the arms race, co-operation surely makes more sense than competition. \u201d\n\u201c Post-war Britain has seen two big changes. First, and partly as a result of reforming Labour governments, there are many more healthy, wealthy and well-educated people than before. In addition, employment has switched from traditional manufacturing industries to a more white-collar, service-based economy. The inevitable result has been that class identity has fragmented. Only about a third of the population now regard themselves as \u2018working-class\u2019. Of course it is possible still to analyse Britain in terms of a strict Marxist definition of class: but it is not very helpful to our understanding of how the country thinks and votes. In fact, of that third, many are likely not to be \u2018working\u2019 at all: these are the unemployed, pensioners, single parents \u2013 in other words, the poor.\nA party that restricts its appeal to the traditional working class will not win an election. That doesn\u2019t entail a rejection of socialism\u2019s traditional values: but it does mean that its appeal, and hence its policies, must address a much wider range of interests. \u201d\n\u201c The trick for Labour is not to follow them and abandon the notion of government and collective provision: but to re-fashion it so that real power is exercised by people and not by institutions or bureaucracies. The fundamental error of Dr Owen (and, oddly, of David Steel since the election, though not before it) has been to surrender to Mrs Thatcher\u2019s philosophy and say that power can only be devolved through the market. The 1990s will not see the continuing triumph of the market, but its failure. \u201d\n\nRoy Hattersley: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/24/labour2001to2005.news\n\u201c Tony Blair discovered a big idea. His destiny is to create a meritocracy. Unfortunately meritocracy is not the form of society which social democrats want to see. ... A Labour government should not be talking about escape routes from poverty and deprivation. By their nature they are only available to a highly-motivated minority. The Labour Party was created to change society in such a way that there is no poverty and deprivation from which to escape . ... The certain knowledge that the Conservative Party would be a worse government than Labour is not enough to sustain what used to be a party of principles. ...

Rupert Murdoch's place, valued at $30 million plus, is now a smoldering ruin. He isn't alone. A combination of high nighttime winds (50 mph and up) and less than 10% relative humidity is combining to spread embers and therefore flames with uncontrollable speed. Tuesday night the fires were eating up more than one acre per SECOND. This one could be very, very nasty and very, very expensive before it is all over.

Dec 5 Introducing Podia: Coach has changed its name (and launched Memberships!) We have three big announcements today. We\u2019ve changed our name. We\u2019ve launched a powerful new way for creators to make money. And we\u2019ve raised some funding. But first, a bit of important context as to why. Making money as a creator is hard Many people try to turn their knowledge into online courses, eBooks and other digital products to help others. Then they try to sell those products, and they realize how hard and unrewarding it can be. They quickly to run into problems like: Technical headaches from trying to figure out how to create, deliver, host and manage their products. Overwhelm from being forced to go from \u201cwriter\u201d to \u201cwriter/designer/product manager/marketer/IT administrator/customer support agent\u201d An array of tools that seem as if they were built to squeeze creators at every turn. Slow payouts, arbitrary limits on products and files, and steep transaction fees. But as a creator who wants\u200a\u2014\u200aand deserves\u200a\u2014\u200ato earn money for your work, what other options do you have? Sure, you could try to generate enough traffic to make money from ads on your site. But it\u2019s a hard way to make a living; you\u2019ll likely need 2.5+ million visits per year to earn even $1,000 per month. Or, you could try and court sponsors. But for most creators without millions of readers, sponsor payouts are meager and unpredictable, and like ad networks, they put your income into the hands of someone else; someone who can cut that revenue off at will. Neither of these options are good for creators. We believe that everyone has something to teach, and that everyone should be able to earn an income from doing so. The best, most profitable and most sustainable way to do this is by selling directly to your audience. And today, we\u2019re excited to take a few more big steps toward making life\u200a\u2014\u200aand success\u200a\u2014\u200aa whole lot easier for creators. Yesterday we were Coach. Today we\u2019re Podia. For a while now, we\u2019ve wanted to change our name to something that better represented what we help our creators do. We\u2019d been brainstorming new names, when a few months ago, a customer suggested the name Podia. po\u00b7di\u00b7a [ poh -dee-uh] Definition: The plural form of podium , a small platform on which a person may stand to be seen by an audience. Right away, it felt perfect. Podia captures exactly what our product helps our creators do: stand and be seen by their readers, fans and customers. A podium creates authority, and authority is the foundation on which thousands of our creators have built their online businesses on. We love the name, and we hope you do, too. Check out the new look of Podia . Memberships are here: recurring revenue for creators Since 2015, we\u2019ve been fortunate to help more than 7,500 creators sell millions of dollars in online courses and digital downloads with Podia. And today, we\u2019re adding a new way for our creators to make money. One that can generate steady, predictable income each month: Membership subscriptions. In exchange for sharing something with your members\u200a\u2014\u200aexclusive content, behind-the-scenes updates or private online events, for example\u200a\u2014\u200ayour members pay you a monthly fee. With the help of many of our customers, we\u2019ve built what we believe is the best and easiest-to-use membership platform on the market. What makes Podia Memberships different from any other tool out there, aside from its simplicity, is that it seamlessly integrates with your other Podia digital products. So if you have Online Courses or Digital Downloads with Podia, you can include them as Membership perks with a single click. You can now sell your Online Courses, Digital Downloads and Memberships from a single digital storefront, and keep all of your customers and payments\u200a\u2014\u200aacross all of your products\u200a\u2014\u200ain one place. Learn more about Podia Memberships on our new site . We\u2019ve raised $3m in funding Our mission to empower any creator to build an online business is an ambitious one. And while we\u2019ve done a lot with our six-person team, there\u2019s a lot more we\u2019d like to do. So we\u2019ve (very) carefully raised $3 million in funding from a group of amazing and supportive investors who share our vision. We\u2019re going to spend every penny on making a better product that helps you earn more money, and on building a better business so that we can be around to serve you for many years to come. More to come With Memberships released, we\u2019ve taken a huge step in making it easier for creators to earn money online. But we still have a lot to do. Over the coming months, you\u2019ll be seeing more updates and new features in Podia that will make creating and selling digital products easier, more profitable and more fun.

Palestinians play cards during U.S. President Donald Trump's televised speech in the West Bank City of Nablus, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. Defying dire, worldwide warnings, President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke with decades ... \nJERUSALEM (AP) - The Latest on the fallout from President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital (all times local): \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.

Then, get to it.\nThe Firm Hand Try a classic\u2014an over their knee spanking \u2014 but pop in a few vibrating Ben Wa Balls beforehand so each strike gives you a little jolt. If they slide a hand under you to stroke your clit gently in between slaps, you will be lost in the best way.\nThe Butt Bongos Adding P-in-V to a spanking makes the foreplay extra fulfilling. He sits in a chair. You sit on his lap, lowering yourself onto his boner, then lean all the way down so your hands are on the floor. He lifts your hips or swats your bum, as needed/desperately wanted.\nSpank the Monkey\n Send your partner into a transcendent pleasure-pain state by taking control. Have them lie across your lap with their knees bent up so their bum is exposed to you. Tease their bum s with whatever you're gonna be hitting them with (hand, flogger, spatula...) then give a sharp surprise smack. Alternate the pain with a gentle stroking or a hand job. (If you're with a penis-haver, a slippery masturbation sleeve is nice as well.)\nStrike, Dear Mistress To try out some dom/sub role play, have the spankee lie backwards on a couch with their legs bent back by their head and butt up on the back of the couch. The spanker stands behind the couch wielding the instruments of their choice. If the spankee wishes to touch themselves during, they may, but only when the spanker gives permission after a satisfactory amount of begging.\nThe Dungeon Doggie\nDoggie is ideal for being *~ravished~* with a spanking-sex combo. Assume the position but put your face down into a pillow so you'll experience your partner's touch more vividly. He alternates stinging strikes with deep thrusts. A well-placed, yet sporadically applied vibrator, will add an infuriatingly pleasurable layer of torment.\nJill Hamilton writes the blog In Bed With Married Women .

That's amazing considered how our roster is constructed: no rim protection and poor perimeter defense. However, we have to find a better way to lose games as LAC joins the tanking race. They'll have an even worser roster than Bulls pretty soon.\nBack to the basics. I think we've to help Dennis out for growth. He's to be the best reader on court. Given that he lacks ideal size (short wingspan and arms), he's to be the best on-court reader to hold his own as a defender and capable finisher at the rim. I think we've to create some indicators and individualized film section to help him growth. So far, I've concluded 3 particular part of his game. He tends to read the opponents wrongly on 3 things:\n1. Getting fool to the wong side. He can't stay in front of his man coz he predicts the opponents to go in different direction.\n2. Getting fool to jump up to the air. He allows wide open layups as he bites on pump fakes and jump up to the air.\n3. Getting blocked while attempting layups. He can't create enough space for layups as he tends to rely heavily on straight-line drive. Even if he's beaten opponents off dribble, shot-blockers are able to recover the distance. He needs more options in those particular situation. He needs more options under those siuations. What he could have done differently is the area he can improve on. I think Barea and Harris can help him a lot. They are elite among PGs converting layups.\nExtra film sections and statistics (that shows how he's done in these areas in % will help him grow tremendously). We may see a much better decision-maker in Dennis very soon.\nAs for Barnes, he's done everything right rebounding wise. And he's done a brillant jobs in creating a go-to moves off iso-set. I want him to work to be an ideal 3D specialist.\n1. Defense. He lacks the elite size for defense. So he's to read the actions of opponents a little more.\n2. Perimeter shooting. He needs to hit at least 40% from the arc.\n3. Team offensive scheme. He needs to be more integrated into team's offensive scheme. He may gets more scoring off balls (putbacks off glasses, wide-open transition baskets, defense for coast-to-coast fastbreaks, catch-n-shoot efficiency), and learn to be an able distributer.\nGenerally, court vision is the area of concerns for Barnes. I really hope we can bring back VC to help him out. Efficiency (PER) is the major indicator to his growth. He's now 15.51 PER as a starter. He needs to be over 20 PER in his prime.
