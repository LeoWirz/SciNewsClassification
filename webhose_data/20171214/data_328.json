Keep that up until you get to where you want to be? I mean, yes, preferably you could use steam-engine to evaluate how many wraps and what diameter you need, but there is nothing wrong with building coils and test firing them on the ohms reader and getting a resistance that way. Yep, you'll waste some wire, possibly. But that seems to me the only way to proceed, honestly, since you have NO information.\nBecause otherwise you'll have wasted all of it, which to me is not a catastrophic event, but if you really want to try it, just wrap a build!

The policy announcement will come at the annual investors\u2019 meet to be held on January 16 and 17. The state government has for quite sometime been mulling over a comprehensive IT policy to woo investment in the sector. Over the last six years, it has, in patches, announced policies relating to hardware making, software companies, start-ups, ITeS and for incentivising investments. \u201cOur comprehensive and new IT policy will be announced in January,\u201d the Chief Minister said during the inauguration of Infocom 2017, an annual IT conclave organised in the city. Sops for Investors In fact, Banerjee went a step further to add that her government would provide sops to investors. She promised faster clearances, minimum red-tape, property tax waivers, reduced rentals, tax breaks, and more importantly, land availability. According to her, there was enough land available in the state for IT companies to set up shop. \u201cAt least 2.6 lakh jobs can be created through IT and we have the space for companies to come and set up shop here,\u201d she said. IT majors including TCS, Cognizant and ITC Infotech have expressed willingness to expand operations in the state. She stated the example of TCS, which was hiring around 20,000 new recruits for its Rajarhat (on the north eastern fringes of Kolkata) campus. Even Cognizant is expanding its presence by adding 15,000 to its workforce here, the Chief Minister claimed. For the state the focus areas for investments would include companies working on fin-tech, cyber security and block-chain technologies. A Centre of Excellence focusing on imparting training in these areas would also be looked at. A 10-acre plot has also been identified for setting up a fin-tech hub.

It has been 4 years since 2013\u2019s critically acclaimed, Grammy nominated, and number 1 Billboard Blues album Seesaw was released by singer-songwriter and blues-rock powerhouse Beth Hart and guitar hero Joe Bonamassa. Since then, they have both been on fire, riding creative tidal waves both in the studio and live. So, the time was primed perfectly to reunite for another collection of scorching interpretations of ten soul gems that twins Hart\u2019s breath-taking vocals, that sweep and delve deep into the belly of the song and Joe\u2019s masterfully expressive playing make Black Coffee, released on January 26th, 2018, a captivating listen. With producer extraordinaire Kevin \u2018The Caveman\u2019 Shirley (Joe Bonamassa, Led Zeppelin, Black Crowes, Aerosmith, Iron Maiden, Rush) back at the helm, the result is the stunning rollercoaster that digs deep into the soul catalogue where they honour but re-imagine songs from Edgar Winter, Etta, James, Ike & Tina Turner/Steve Marriot, Ella Fitzgerald, Lil\u2019 Green, LaVern Baker, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Lucinda Williams and Waldeck. Each one having the majestic heart and soul that Beth and Joe bleed on each record. Recorded in 5 days at Studio at the Palms, Las Vegas in August 2016 with some of the finest musicians around, they have once again recalled some familiar names in Anton Fig (Drums/Percussion), Ron Dziubla (Saxophone), and Lee Thornburg (Horn Arrangements/Trumpet/Trombone) and welcomed in Reese Wynans (Keyboards), Michael Rhodes (Bass), Rob McNelley (Rhythm Guitar), Paulie Cerra (Saxophone), Mahalia Barnes (Backing Vocals), Jade Macrae (Backing Vocals) and Juanita Tippins (Backing vocals). Talking about the sessions behind Black Coffee, Seesaw, 2011\u2019s Don\u2019t Explain and 2014s Live in Amsterdam, Shirley gives some insight of what they are looking to achieve; \u201cWe\u2019re trying not to dig into a playbook that\u2019s been done many times which is the old soul classics. We try and find a different spin on it, originally it was about trying to find some songs that people didn\u2019t know at all and bring them back to people\u2019s attention.\u201d One such song, was a Joe suggestion, the album opener Give It Everything You Got taken from 1971s Edgar Winter\u2019s White Trash album, with its hard rock meets Stax infused sound, the band deliver a formidable performance. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a song a lot of people know, it\u2019s an old soul classic but it\u2019s not really amongst the pantheon of the ones you expect,\u201d says Shirley \u201cOne of the things Jeff Beck had said to me once that I thought was so wonderful was\u201d explains Hart. \u201cHe said, as soon as you get comfortable, and if you stay there, you\u2019re just gonna start dying as an artist. And I feel that, one of the gifts that I\u2019ve got with working with Joe is that I\u2019m always uncomfortable- in a good way. \u201c S hirley adds about the band, \u201dthose guys just played live, they just came in and played, it was mind numbingly incredible to be in the studio when that happens, the band were so great.\u201dLullaby of the Leaves, originally recorded by Ella Fitzgerald, was one of the lesser known songs on 1964\u2019s Hello Dolly and like with how they approached Strange Fruit on Seesaw, they transformed the song into a delicate but brooding and cinematic offering. \u201cFor me I\u2019m able to explore the kind of music I have always admired from afar,\u201d reveals Bonamassa. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want to hear me singing Ella Fitzgerald\u2026\u201d he explained as Beth joins in. \u201cI would never do Ella Fitzgerald without being with Joe, the things I get to do with you are things I think I grew up always wanting to do, but never believed I could.\u201d The gospel flavoured R&B workout Saved originally performed by LaVern Baker - only the second female solo artist to be inducted in to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 - has been covered by; Elvis Presley, Brenda Lee, Billy Fury, Elkie Brooks and The Band amongst others and is a full throttle, raucous, tongue-in-cheek moment, written from the perspective of someone who had lived a fast, loose life but is then \"saved\" and is now standing on a corner preaching to the passers-by. They also take an altogether different mood on the luscious Soul on Fire, where they pay homage to Baker\u2019s first ever solo release. Sitting On Top of The World is a stone cold classic and has been recorded by some of the world\u2019s most iconic artists; Ray Charles, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, B.B. King, Cream and the Grateful Dead have all stamped their mark on it. Here it has a swirling duel from Bonamassa\u2019s searing guitar and Wynan\u2019s keys whilst Hart\u2019s voice helps propel the song through the stratosphere. The sultry punch of Lucinda Williams\u2019 Joy has an irresistible guttural groove. \u201cWe have tracks like that in which, it was such a noisy jam in the studio, and I love that track, the energy in it.\u201d Shirley enthuses. Addicted, is taken from the 2007 trip-hop leaning album by Austrian Electronic trio Waldeck which Shirley came across whilst on holiday and \u201cshazamed\u201d it. The smouldering Damn Your Eyes is taken from Etta James 1988 comeback record Seven Year Itch, Kansas Joe McCoy\u2019s jazz-blues Why Don\u2019t You Do It Right? made its first impact on Lil Green\u2019s 1941 version before Peggy Lee covered it a year later which went on to sell over 1 million copes after appearing in the movie Stage Door Canteen in 1943, both see the after dark bar room Jazz shine through. They harness prime Steve Marriot on his take of Ike & Tina Turner\u2019s Black Coffee, inspiration coming from his version live on the BBC\u2019s Old Grey Whistle Test in 1973, which see\u2019s Beth sing with fire, fury and soul. \u201cIt\u2019s really predicated on the vocals,\u201d Bonamassa explains. \u201cWe can\u2019t cut these tunes without Beth singing and once she starts singing, it\u2019s the glue that inspires us to get the extra 10% out of the playing. If we just cut them and sang later, the magic wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s something the two of us stopped doing many, many years ago\u201d agrees Hart. \u201cThere was all this layering and layering and then it\u2019s time for you to sing and it\u2019s like you\u2019re not even making music any more. There\u2019s nothing like being able to sit there live and see Joe, seeing the drums, seeing the bass, being able to see Kevin. I can feel the vibrations, it changes the whole thing.\u201d \u201cKevin really gets that that,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s like he wrote that idea. It just works the best, in the old old days, that\u2019s how they did it, bad ass singers and bad ass musicians would have a couple of hours to get a wh ole record done or whatever it was they were doing and that was it, it was time to go.\u201d One of the key aspects of the sessions is to push everyone as much as possible. \u201cThey are always out of their comfort zone in the studio, this session especially wasn\u2019t a comfortable session,\u201d Shirley reveals. \u201cEveryone left feeling challenged. It\u2019s intriguing. We go into the studio for 5 days and all of the musicians are challenged, they are all very good musicians, very experienced musicians, top of their field, nothing is easy, this isn\u2019t a summer in the grass session, just a couple of chords, this is people digging in deep. With producer extraordinaire Kevin 'The Caveman' Shirley (Joe Bonamassa, Led Zeppelin, Black Crowes, Aerosmith, Iron Maiden, Rush) back at the helm, the result digs deep into the soul catalogue where they honour and re-imagine songs from Edgar Winter, Etta, James, Ike & Tina Turner/Steve Marriot, Ella Fitzgerald, Lil\u2019 Green, LaVern Baker, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Lucinda Williams and Waldeck . Tracklisting: 1. Give It Everything You Got 2. Damn Your Eyes 4. Lullaby Of The Leaves 5. Why Don't You Do Right 6. Saved 7. Sitting On Top Of The World 8. Joy 9. Soul On Fire 10.

Also take into consideration whether you're having one main roast, or having a few different options as part of a buffet.A smaller bird or joint will go further if you are cooking stuffings and pigs in blankets, plus all the Christmas veg.And if you love having leftovers in the days after Christmas, or are have invited extra-hungry friends and family, remember to add a little extra. \u200b ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:17.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8796ffb41fa9bfb4579382085a9bfc7788c86751", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc6.6pnob22drhp2Rqzjpjx5", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/v/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/v/ - Video Games - 4chan", "title": ">hey man, could i borrow your game? i'll give it b", "title_full": "/v/ - >hey man, could i borrow your game? i'll give it b - Video Games - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T02:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 283, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "43d161646116381f331054c35a83f35e0020bc4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc6.6pnob22driCKaPUldStVhTxiHNTi1yI-", "ord_in_thread": 164, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T06:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "not videogames but I had a friend who stole half my Pokemon card binder.

I just leveled a paladin and it already has a much easier time doing wq's and stuff as ret in like 840 gear. I really liked Shadow in the past, but in my opinion, it's the most annoying spec blizzard has ever come up with.

He\u2019s not really a candidate.
