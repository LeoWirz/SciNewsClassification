(AP) - New Jersey lawmakers are set to vote on legislation that would make it illegal to operate a drone while drunk. \nThe Democrat-led Senate is scheduled to vote on the legislation Thursday. \nThe National Conference on State Legislatures says at least 38 states are considering drone legislation this year, going beyond the Federal Aviation Administration's regulations. \nThe New Jersey bill would make operating a drone under the influence of alcohol a disorderly persons offense, which carries a sentence of up to six months in prison, a $1,000 fine or both. It also would make using a drone to hunt wildlife and endanger people or property a similar offense. \nThe legislation has already cleared a committee in the Democrat-controlled Assembly.

There is a great deal of intense human energy that is hardly any surprise that is greed anger irritation but also a sadness that comes from shallow fakeness. The extremes to which society has gone for a sanitised, enhanced and substance less world is reaching epidemic proportions and 2018 will bring great change.\nIt is the soul and the heart that is reacting to this plastic world, that needs more, that loves laughs and creates and it will fight back as that is the only way it will survive.\nThere are also growing levels of anger and impatience, watch yourself with this, listen to the way you speak to people and commit to being better!\nThere is however also some beautiful energy around If you can find it beneath all the noise and hoopla. It feels like a secret love, that is so precious you don\u2019t want to share it with the world, just stay in your bubble and enjoy it. Spread that around. Take today and commit to yourself to not say a single negative thing. Really watch yourself with this, anything that is not positive and uplifting just keep it to yourself today. Take a day off from posting about the atrocities around the world, the lies and deceit of those in power, wind it in when you feel you need to let your friend know what she is doing wrong or how you would do it,\nJust for today be your greatest monitor, pause before you post, does this have value, am I encouraging or being right? This is not easy which is why it needs your vigilance, so observe yourself in action I bet you would be surprised.\nWe all have to take responsibility for this world and the future we are creating and we don\u2019t do that by pointing out where everyone is wrong, we don\u2019t do that by creating fear and despondency. We do that by checking ourselves because we are greater contributors than our ego would ever let us believe.\nWhich is actually a good thing because if we are perpetuators of the decline of society then we have something to work with , change is within our grasp. When you are part of the problem and you realise this then you can become a huge agent of change.\nPlease be nice to each other, just slow it all down a bit, especially if you get that overworked burdened rabbit in the headlights feel. Take some time out, especially if you feel you couldn\u2019t. Take some time to breath and slow it all down.\nAll that matters is friends and family and if the festivities mean you are so stressed everyone is getting on your last nerve then what is the point? Think about that, if you are stressed everyone is angry and so on then what is this day all about?\nSo today your mission is to lift the spirits off all those around you just by being your heart centred self\u2026..no judgement, no advice, no judgement, no short tempers, no irritated tone or big sighs.\nWhen you are about to beer at the old man in the car in front for missing his opportunity to pull out in traffic and you are in a rush just stop and think what if that was your dad, your grandad, how would you feel if someone was harassing him in that way?\nWe all have a greater impact on each other than we realise, so use that connection for good not to spread the wildfire of anger fear and fakeness that is going round.\nThis is your responsibility and the challenge has been set\u2026.let\u2019s all check ourselves before we truly wreck ourselves, get into our heart space and let our love and compassion and PATIENCE ripple out from there\u2026.who\u2019s in?\nLove and Laughter Michele \nDon\u2019t forget to sign up to my mailing list as I have some great stuff coming up Andy won\u2019t want to miss out \nhttp://www.micheleelizabeth.co.uk \n#energy #energyforecast #globalenergy #christmasenergy\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:07.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8da99c8e06aa862f5bd1ed61d482184a295f2c7f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAW3R_b0zLFDzFQOS_R.p0EOu8TAfuNznfPF4Xth72FO5xCASxMleDeEqP_0FBuxNXkaug8UUTNckLTWkcFwnbxbg09eXPbBpPKIHTO17uqGHsRxshCpbi2qsZ9kGfjF3Ja", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/pediasure/abbott-official-store/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Pediasure Abbott Official Store - Buy Pediasure Abbott Official Store at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "PEDIASURE COMPLETE S3S VANILLA BIB 1800G", "title_full": "PEDIASURE COMPLETE S3S VANILLA BIB 1800G | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-11-07T06:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.082, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "86abe9a269071f48dff1b46a9a081ab2732b3585", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAW3R_b0zLFDzFQOS_R.p0EOu8TAfuNznfPF4Xth72FO5xCASxMleDeEqP_0FBuxNXkaug8UUTNckLTWkcFwnbxbg09eXPbBpPKIHTO17uqGHsRxshCpbi2qrR6gIrpzEwe7zBy7uCOiMY-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Michelle siow", "published": "2017-11-17T11:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ninjavan lost my this parcel", "text": "Ninjavan lost my parcel.

That can really play on people's minds when you're behind. We have to be confident, we have to continue what we're doing, doing the basics really well, getting big first innings runs is crucial as we've seen, and just backing up day in and day out.\"\nAlso read Ashes: All-rounder Moeen Ali to lead England XI in Perth warm-up game Four reasons for Australian confidence were occupying row 13 of flight QF 740 from Adelaide to Sydney on Thursday with quicks Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins on one side of the aisle and off-spinner Nathan \"Gazza\" Lyon on the other.\nAlthough suggestions that the bowling attack is the best to have ever donned baggy green caps are probably wide of the mark, they have done their job by dismissing England twice in both the first two tests.\nAlso read Ashes: All-rounder Mitchell Marsh back in Australian squad for third Test \"I think the exciting thing is our bowling group can only get better,\" Starc told reporters on arrival at Sydney airport. \"Obviously we've taken 40 wickets over the last couple of weeks and done some really good things but there's still room for improvement.\"\nStarc took 5-88 after mopping up the England tail with the new pink ball on Wednesday, while Hazlewood snuffed out hopes of an England win with two wickets, including that of captain Joe root, in the first three overs of the day.\nAlso read Ben Stokes, Alex Hales included in England squad for ODI series against Australia Cummins crucially pegged the English back with the wicket of Dawid Malan on Wednesday night, while Lyon is the leading wicket taker in tests this year and his captain described his bowling in Adelaide as \"exceptional\".\n\"Paddy, Josh and I have grown up together - Gazza's a bit older - we've been around each other for a long time and we're really close mates,\" Starc added. \"I think that shows in the way we play our cricket and we're gelling really nicely and complementing each other really well.\n\"Gazza's bowling the house down at the moment and that allows the other three of us to just do what we do at the other end. Josh does what he does and allows Pat and I to bowl as fast as we want.\"\nSmith said he was keen for his bowlers and batsmen to get some rest before the Perth test starts next Thursday. \"There's a reasonable break between now and Perth so the bowlers can freshen up and the batters can freshen their minds, and we can come back and hopefully win the Ashes back in Perth,\" he added.\nThe test will be the last at the WACA and Starc said he was hoping to be presented with a bowling surface that harked back to the days when the likes of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson terrorised English batsmen in Perth. \"Hopefully we see a nice fast, bouncy wicket, the WACA of old, and get stuck into that as a bowling group,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "st", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dhoni", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitchell starc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitchell marsh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dawid malan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh hazlewood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moeen ali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff thomson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat cummins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben stokes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dennis lillee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nathan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex hales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hazlewood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "waca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia  cummins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chennai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adelaide", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:08.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0060c2b883560df25416eaeaee56f87c7d4d020e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzuW0Up1GA78hY1rCz1aAuFGOtfAfBB.ZntS4NWhLZ8jJMUgcOFS7K..5HGyIyuZssTen4m8psRJcxt1Y8ibNlCJ3iWlrYNuiFe_2UJtPcn1ZzFiIwJvLC_Mn1SxtHMmDghu6_uLKj51A--", "site_full": "forums.hardwarezone.com.sg", "site": "hardwarezone.com.sg", "site_section": "http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/internet-bandwidth-networking-clinic-4/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Internet Bandwidth &amp; Networking Clinic - www.hardwarezone.com.sg", "title": "Best broadband deal", "title_full": "Best broadband deal - www.hardwarezone.com.sg", "published": "2017-11-23T02:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/img/sg/hwz-og-logo-big.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5181, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "827648fa70f85aecb393cd8e7aa57af95127cd67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzuW0Up1GA78hY1rCz1aAuFGOtfAfBB.ZntS4NWhLZ8jJMUgcOFS7K..5HGyIyuZssTen4m8psRJcxt1Y8ibNlCJ3iWlrYNuiFe_2UJtPcn1ZzFiIwJvLC_Mn1SxtHMmDiWzR_zY14a9S_tu70oMSVR", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "keewee0415", "published": "2017-12-07T10:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : if i get this m1 broadband.. can i recycle my existing singtel modem the livefire / livewire one?

(The party was 2 weeks long.) Each day the consultant introduced some of her products and mailed out free samples for everyone to try.\n\nAnd so I did.\n\nNow, I've been an exclusive Korean Skin Care Regime kinda gal since 2012, with an average of 8 steps. I loved my routine but suddenly this year, one of my products broke out my forehead and it would not go away. I'd stopped using products entirely trying to figure out what had gone wrong.\n\nWell, trying the samples out immediately cleared up the rough forehead issues.\n\nSo, I accepted when the consultant asked if I'd host a party too. Because when something works for me, I'm going to shout it to the rafters.\n\nMy favorite item, is their Big Fat Yummy Hand Creme. It comes in a variety of fragrances and so I bought a few which sounded nice and found my favorite was their My Hands are Thai'd. To me, it smells like dried orange slices with a few soft spice notes. \n\nWhen I first tried this hand creme, I was thinking \"oh god! what is this fresh hell?\" It felt so thick and gross, but within a minute it had fully absorbed and my hands looked great. I'm often troubled by my old lady hands, especially since I take photos of them when I photo my dolls.\n\nI started using this once a day after a shower, but with the cold weather, I've added an application. It's crazy good. I even bought some for my mom for Christmas. (shh... don't tell.)\n\n\nI also really liked their exfoliating wash A Whole Lava Love. It's minty and scrubs all the crude out. This is what kicked the nasty-forever-forehead-break-out. It made me feel so self-conscious, so I'm super grateful.\n\nAnyway, I said I am hosting a party! Yay! If you're interested in any of the products, please use my link (I may get a prize!)\n\nThey are currently having a 10 days of sales promotion, where you can get different items for a discount or free gift, like today it's a body butter free gift with purchase, but as a savvy shopper-type, I think the best pricing will be Friday. I'll keep you posted if you'd like.\n\nOr you can join the Facebook party here . (And if you join us late, you can still ask for free samples. While the company's products are really fantastic, they're aren't the best at refunds, so sample away!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "big fat yummy hand creme", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:09.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81160fc563c1fdda18b0a9f91ff704840648c81f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9vyIkGMMTzM6u3t.3oyFrDItAE_LdNSSU_Omr5JrefwB.LmYIGF8OopQJtAeWWfIQO.TX6V4VQW7mFqQDwXsjNyPDPszeSsoasfFrno0LBHA--", "site_full": "wedo-your-essay.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://wedo-your-essay.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "we do your essay", "title": "'The Best, All-Natural Defense Against Food-Borne Diseases'", "title_full": "'The Best, All-Natural Defense Against Food-Borne Diseases'", "published": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81160fc563c1fdda18b0a9f91ff704840648c81f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9vyIkGMMTzM6u3t.3oyFrDItAE_LdNSSU_Omr5JrefwB.LmYIGF8OopQJtAeWWfIQO.TX6V4VQW7mFqQDwXsjNyPDPszeSsoasfFrno0LBHA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Taylor Ward (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "'The Best, All-Natural Defense Against Food-Borne Diseases'", "text": "' fit in to the CDC, nourishment-borne diseases wee-wee nigh 76 m dementedion illnesses, 325 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths all(prenominal)(prenominal) grade in the locomote to drumher States.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall.\nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation.\nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months.\nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters.\nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action.\n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\"\nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\"\nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East.\nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move.\nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\"\nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts.\n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\"\nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians.

My work is mostly (90%) legal translation, in all its diversity: civil / commercial and criminal law. Since my language pair is quite special (2 minor languages, or at least in Europa that is), I don\u2019t feel the need to specialize further, although I have preference for certain project over others, of course. My clients are also divers; I do a lot of work for end clients (private persons and companies), some of them \u201cone-timers\u201d and others recurring, and I also have some agency clients. I work alone, but I have a small group of reliable colleagues that provide (almost) the same market as I do, so we exchange work, ask each other for revision of our projects and so on. \nCan you provide a brief description of a typical work day? A typical work day is \u2026 spent mostly behind the PC. I\u2019m online about 12 hours a day; I think it\u2019s important to be contactable and accessible. I normally start working at 8.30 am, because in the Netherlands it\u2019s 1 hour later, so the first e-mails will have arrived by that time. The morning is for planning, proofreading yesterday\u2019s translations, delivering, invoicing, social media, etcetera. And twice a week I go to the gym between 9.30 am and 11.00 am. In the afternoon I take care of the bigger projects. Luckily, I have no problem limiting my attention to the most urgent messages or quickly interrupt what I\u2019m doing and getting on later. Two or three times a week you can find me in the public notary office (for certification of my work under Portuguese law), and also the post office is my \u201csecond home\u201d. I\u2019m married and our youngest son (17y) still lives with us. Normally we schedule our days and meals around the projects we have in hands. Both my husband and I are freelancers so normally there\u2019s no tight schedule, other than our own agendas. Sometimes in the middle of the week we decide to spend an afternoon near the sea, and we go out for lunch or dinner quit often. Since we have family and friends in \u2013 ate least \u2013 two countries (my husband is Portuguese and I\u2019m Dutch) we do a lot of travelling between Portugal and the Netherlands. And recently we fell in love with the Azores\u2026 \nWhat aspects of your profession do you enjoy most? The diversity and the freedom of planning my own working days and weeks. I always find something I love in (almost) every project. A special (small) group of my clients are Dutch prisoners in Portuguese jails \u2013 after they\u2019re sentenced, they can apply for transference to the Netherlands and at that point they need their process documents translated into Dutch; those jobs always give some good stories to tell at parties \ud83d\ude00 And I love to attend conferences and meetings with fellow translators. I find it very important to share experience and knowledge and to learn from and with each other, so I try to participate in at least one or two conferences or other forms of knowledge sharing a year. \nWhich aspects do you least enjoy? The loneliness and the long hours sitting behind my screen. I\u2019m rather a control freak about my work and I find it hard to unwind when not all is done as I planned to. And of course there\u2019s some typical jobs I would rather do without (like the translation of school diplomas, for instance)! Normally I\u2019ll not accept them, but sometimes I know the client has not much alternatives, so I try to attend\u2026 \nHow long have you been working as a translator / interpreter? About 25 years now\u2026 wow, that is a long time! I graduated in 1992 and soon after that I started translating, the first years in combination with a part time job and later full time, in combination with family & children. \nDoes this work fit with your initial studies? Did you in fact study to become a translator? Yes, completely, I graduated at Utrecht University (I hold a Master degree in Translation). And since I\u2019m a very curious person, I love to get informed about the most various subject matters I translate. \nWhat is your career path? Why did you make the decision to work as a translator / interpreter? It all came quite logically after my studies. I\u2019m very happy working as a freelancer. Years ago, I had my own language school, providing translations in other language pairs as well, and language teaching. But I found it difficult to be responsible for other people\u2019s work, so I sold it and went back to my home office, and I\u2019m very happy since that! \nIs translation your sole professional work? If not, in what other fields are you involved? I am a fulltime translator. I also accept some interpretation assignments, although I have no background or specialized studies. It\u2019s just that in Portugal there are very few colleagues who accept interpretation jobs, and so, after several agencies insisted (a lot!), I started to take on jobs and have been doing well. \nFor more information, feel free to explore Karolien\u2019s website , her Twitter account , or her Facebook page . \nAlexandra English and Spanish > French translator French and Spanish teacher (face-to-face/Skype) Publicit\u00e9s", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "karolien van eck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karolien", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "utrecht university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "portugal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:10.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33bd252e191bd5264380d711dc3943dcd0058c61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jf4.1.o01psplHr_vfGNdSjkBUQ3yphG8mzMRjU61j.od6SUS8b46mR.nYPCgmmIycVbDQjg8pY8LOpFBQzRv.hHC5Qw35l1_E-", "site_full": "cristiancaricaturas.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://cristiancaricaturas.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Las Caricaturas de Cristian Hern\u0e23\u0e01ndez", "title": "El doble y el triple:", "title_full": "El doble y el triple:", "published": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "33bd252e191bd5264380d711dc3943dcd0058c61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jf4.1.o01psplHr_vfGNdSjkBUQ3yphG8mzMRjU61j.od6SUS8b46mR.nYPCgmmIycVbDQjg8pY8LOpFBQzRv.hHC5Qw35l1_E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Caricaturascrisitan (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "El doble y el triple:", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:10.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ddea15c00ebb618a7f7c606cbd8d6b0839338a6e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxHQ.zshm4_i.zZT9L9aC6hqAFbv1zoJcqvcxSxH1tvXOEE0arWcYzdRinI9I5QhnYRWxW9Jj6m9Cj668qUBv0klGW_2HFOqfe0BUk_TXbkCtG_D6F42Zar", "site_full": "freitas-nossacasaespirita.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://freitas-nossacasaespirita.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "NOSSA CASA ESPIRITA", "title": "Passado -

Liverpool 's convincing victory over  Shakhtar Donetsk  - the Spanish team's rivals for second place - ensured that even after dropping points to  Maribor , they progressed to the knockout stage. \n\nMarcos  Tavares  stunned the Spaniards with the opening goal after 10 minutes, heading home Martin Milec's cross from close range. But in a one-sided second half, Sevilla breached the stubborn home defence when goalkeeper Jasmin  Handanovic  failed to keep out substitute Ganso's low shot following good work by Joaquin  Correa . Maribor, the Slovenian champions, were already consigned to bottom place after scoring two goals in five group matches before this, their third draw in the competition.\n\nMARIBOR 1 SEVILLA 1: HANDANOVIC HOWLER GIFTS SPANIARDS A POINT A Jasmin Handanovic error allowed Sevilla to leave Maribor with a 1-1 draw, as the Spaniards reached the Champions League last 16. Sevilla will join Group E winners Liverpool in progressing to the Champions League knockout phase despite an underwhelming 1-1 draw at Maribor, in which substitute Ganso spared the visitors' blushes. The Spanish side knew that a draw would be enough to guarantee their passage ahead of Spartak Moscow, who were duly hammered 7-0 by Liverpool, but they produced a largely toothless display that will not strike much fear into the other teams who have progressed. Possession was not a problem as Sevilla dominated the ball for most of the match, but they looked devoid of ideas in the final third and rarely threatened to cancel out Marcos Tavares' well-taken 10th-minute opener. Although they made a slight improvement after the break, clear chances remained at a premium for Sevilla, predominantly down to Maribor's excellent rearguard action. Maribor were ultimately let down by a goalkeeping howler from Jasmin Handanovic, however, with second-half substitute Ganso taking full advantage. \n\nView image on Twitter \n\n\nSevilla FC \n\u2714 @SevillaFC_ENG 75' | G L!  @ phganso  puts us level from 20 yards! @ nkmaribor  1-1  # SevillaFC   # vamosmisevilla   # UCL 6:23 PM - Dec 6, 2017   Replies     1 1 Retweet     11 11 likes Twitter Ads info and privacy \nThe hosts had to withstand significant pressure towards the end, but Sevilla failed to find another way through and were made to settle for a draw, meaning they head through to the last 16 with nine points. Sevilla immediately took charge of possession in Slovenia, but the hosts made more effective use of their time on the ball and went ahead in the 10th minute. Martin Milec did brilliantly on the right flank, getting into the penalty area and crossing to the back post, where Tavares was waiting to nod in past the helpless Sergio Rico. The visitors continued to dominate the ball, though they failed to find a way through Maribor's packed defence, with Ever Banega's long-range effort \u2013 which Handanovic saved with ease \u2013 showing their frustration in the 27th minute. Maribor went close to scoring a second as Damjan Bohar forced Rico into action from the left side of the area with Sevilla caught short of numbers at the back. And another chance fell to Tavares just before the break, but on this occasion he flashed a first-time effort just wide of the top-left corner after meeting Gregor Bajde's pass 12 yards out. Sevilla played with a renewed sense of urgency upon the restart and almost levelled within three minutes - Handanovic parrying a Banega effort straight to Pablo Sarabia, before making amends by pushing the Spaniard's rebound around the post. Attacks came thick and fast from the away side, but still they had trouble crafting clear chances, with Sergio Escudero's long-range effort just before the hour mark the next effort to trouble Handanovic. Ernesto Marucci - in the dugout for Sevilla as Eduardo Berizzo continues his cancer recovery - opted to bring on Brazilian playmaker Ganso shortly after the hour and he ultimately made a telling difference 15 minutes from time. After good work from Joaquin Correa, the ball dropped kindly to Ganso 25 yards from goal and his controlled effort inexplicably found its way under Handanovic and into the net. \nVincent Aboubakar  struck two first-half goals to spearhead  Porto's  emphatic 5-2 win over  Monaco  at the Dragao Stadium on Wednesday and seal their place in the knockout stages \n\nRB Leipzig's  hopes of reaching the knockout stages in their debut European season were ended after they suffered a 2-1 home defeat by  Besiktas  amid late drama. The German side, who had to achieve a better result than Porto to finish second behind Group G winners Besiktas, were beaten by a half-volleyed 90th minute strike from Brazil Under-23 international Talisca. The goal came three minutes after the Bundesliga side, already down to 10 men, thought they had escaped defeat against the odds with a fine  Naby Keita  goal. The Guinean international brought them back into a game that had looked lost when Stefan Ilsanker picked up his second yellow card in the 82nd minute for a cynical foul on  Cenk Tosun . Yet Leipzig's hopes of progressing had effectively been ruined after only 10 minutes when Alvaro  Negredo  put the Turkish side ahead from the penalty spot after a foul by captain  Willi Orban  on Jeremain  Lens . Feyenoord  ended  Napoli's  slim hopes of reaching the last 16 as Jeremiah St Juste's late goal snatched a 2-1 win for the Dutch side. St Juste scored from a corner in the last minute for Feyenoord, who had been reduced to 10 men in the closing stages. Napoli, who drop into the Europa League, had made a blistering start in their bid to stay in contention with Piotr Zielinski opening the scoring in the second minute. The Italian club\u2019s hopes of snatching second place in Group F, however, were hit as Feyenoord fought back to equalise through Nicolai Jorgensen before claiming the dramatic winner and their first points in this year's group stage.

It made the rounds a couple of times on different blogs here and in videos here . As of late, it hit any semblance of Instagram and Pinterest and by and by we were reminded that despite the fact that menswear patterns are slower than its female counterpart, regardless it has its advantages.\n\nThis specific knot is known as the \"Ediety\" and furthermore in light of its concise appearance in the Matrix; it is in many cases alluded to as the Merovingian. Past this, it isn't clear what its origin is, maybe an over the top dandy in the 20's chosen to get super innovative to impress a girl.\n\nAs this video recommends, it's essentially a topsy turvy, back to front Windsor knot which can be tied with a two hued tie for extra effect. When you start tying, the creases of the tie ought to confront far from you. When you have wrapped up the backwards Windsor knot, you essentially remove the tie and flip it around uncovering the thin end which now faces outwards.\n\nClearly, a customary tie isn't made to uncover the back of it, so for this situation you have to discover one that is obliging. It should be doubtlessly sewn with no noticeable coating, tie opening or brand tag.\n\nMaybe a touch of cutting and changing might be required on a consistent off the rack tie. This sort of look would function admirably for any formal setting. In case you're somewhat brave, wear this look to an occasion where you don't know many individuals as they will get some information about your uncommon tie tying skills.

The high health risks of non-communicable diseases and relevant comorbidities in Africa, particularly in contaminated areas like e-waste and crude oil and gas exploration areas and for high consumers of food commodity groupings which are most critical for PAH exposure, are exacerbated by dietary exposure due to unsafe practices in commonly consumed foods, like those street vended.\nIn February 2016, 20 commonly consumed street foods were purchased directly from vendors at major bus stops in Benin City and Umunede in Nigeria. The concentration of 16 priority PAHs was determined. The dietary intake of B[a]P, \u2211PAH, PAH4, PAH8, and \u2211B(a)P eq was estimated for children, peripubertal children/adolescent, and adult using the total diet study (TDS) method. Among the analyzed PAHs, there was a predominance of chrysene (17.42 \u03bcg/kg). Roasted yam (14.15 \u03bcg/kg) and fried fish (1.40 \u03bcg/kg) had the highest levels of \u2211PAH and B[a]P, respectively. The mean concentration of B[a]P, \u2211PAH, PAH4, PAH8, and \u2211B(a)P eq ranged from 0.65\u20131.40 \u03bcg/kg, 0.20\u201314.15 \u03bcg/kg, 0.43\u20135.22 \u03bcg/kg, 0.13\u20137.88 \u03bcg/kg, and 0.002\u20132.123 \u03bcg/kg, respectively. The mean concentration of B[a]P and PAH4 reported in this study was below the maximum allowable levels of 5 and 12 \u03bcg/kg for adults and above the maximum levels for young children set at 1.0 \u03bcg/kg for both B[a]P and PAH4 in food. The estimated dietary intake of B[a]P, \u2211PAH, PAH4, PAH8, and \u2211B(a)P eq for adult, adolescent, and children was 0.56, 0.37, and 0.31 \u03bcg/day; 17.6, 10.7, and 8.81 \u03bcg/day; 5.78, 4.01, and 3.26 \u03bcg/day; 9.22, 6.19, and 5.09 \u03bcg/day; and 1.72, 0.97, and 0.82 \u03bcg/day, respectively.\nStreet foods represent one important source of PAHs. The exposure occurring through street food compounds with that from home-made foods, environmental pollution, and lifestyle (tobacco smoke) is making up an aggregate daily exposure in the general population.\nThe incremental lifetime cancer risk for adults and children from the consumption of street food was 7.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22128 and 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22128 , respectively. Along with initiatives to manage environmental contamination and promote healthier lifestyle, people should be empowered on healthy cooking practices and safe food cookery environments.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2joZhJh", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umunede", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benin city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:11.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10b165cf1ab17c72b141d53f3f4ad7261a3c2f00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rZxEMSci6mQbElRh1OAqI5f9vsssiCtxpmuCmrM6.xmRqOihBvflPGdLj3uP8ENJltyWXDXpmuGf6EoJG1GQZknWthWQZONhNXRIc2c_r7Ph4oGPYxb0n", "site_full": "www.stockhouse.com", "site": "stockhouse.com", "site_section": "http://www.stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.ker/armistice-resources-corp", "site_categories": ["religion", "sports", "football", "catholicism"], "section_title": "KERR MINES INC ( T.KER ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community ", "title": "KERR MINES INC ( T.KER ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community", "title_full": "KERR MINES INC ( T.KER ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community", "published": "2017-11-30T01:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.075, "main_image": "http://www.stockhouse.com/stockhouse/images/stockhouse-logo-og.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21479, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10b165cf1ab17c72b141d53f3f4ad7261a3c2f00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rZxEMSci6mQbElRh1OAqI5f9vsssiCtxpmuCmrM6.xmRqOihBvflPGdLj3uP8ENJltyWXDXpmuGf6EoJG1GQZknWthWQZONhNXRIc2c_r7Ph4oGPYxb0n", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ilikesilver", "published": "2017-11-30T01:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "KERR MINES INC ( T.KER ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community", "text": "RE:Bull Run coming This stock is in a pressure cooker.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:12.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dde836138f0c890b8db19a69ba8f793adb159ad4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmVedWuORy1fFihXwnLYd6e17qayfF6vVj9D_Cj7FKaU7t_KYY6MvaxKJ_hDxoOyeEn28uN7B0TP.7ywdJquXBFY8qLuI7vDuu7O.mSAzFIPTzwQez2i0Llk4finKfDGb1jz1BwmVoFvuDhsALSEL73oEpRTvHbc3c6xqDscdRssZDeqW36OOq", "site_full": "fictionaficionadoblog.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://fictionaficionadoblog.wordpress.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Fiction Aficionado", "title": "12 Days of Christmas Reads \u2013 The Fourth Day: \u2018Baby, It\u2019s Cold Outside\u2019 by Susan May Warren", "title_full": "12 Days of Christmas Reads \u2013 The Fourth Day: \u2018Baby, It\u2019s Cold Outside\u2019 by Susan May Warren", "published": "2017-12-07T12:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fictionaficionadoblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/12-days-of-christmas-susie-may.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dde836138f0c890b8db19a69ba8f793adb159ad4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmVedWuORy1fFihXwnLYd6e17qayfF6vVj9D_Cj7FKaU7t_KYY6MvaxKJ_hDxoOyeEn28uN7B0TP.7ywdJquXBFY8qLuI7vDuu7O.mSAzFIPTzwQez2i0Llk4finKfDGb1jz1BwmVoFvuDhsALSEL73oEpRTvHbc3c6xqDscdRssZDeqW36OOq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Fiction Aficionado", "published": "2017-12-07T12:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "12 Days of Christmas Reads \u2013 The Fourth Day: \u2018Baby, It\u2019s Cold Outside\u2019 by Susan May Warren", "text": "Posted on December 7, 2017 by Fiction Aficionado \nWelcome to the fourth day of my 12 Days of Christmas Reads giveaways!

Click here for full disclosure. ~ Christmas with Susan May Warren ~ \nFavourite Christmas food \u2013 Oh, I\u2019m a total wreck for decorated sugar Christmas cookies! When I was little, my mom used to hide them in the freezer, in an effort to save them. As a result, I love them cold! (Did she seriously think I didn\u2019t know where they were???) \nLol! Children are always smarter than we give them credit for! \nFavourite Christmas memory \u2013 Funnily enough, one of my favorite memories is the Great Bun Throw. I had lost my mind one Christmas day when I was having trouble putting dinner on the table. I burned a batch of dinner rolls (we call buns) and in fury, I took them outside and threw them, one by one, screaming, into the woods. My son Pete came out and, after a moment of silence, picked up a bun and threw it. The rest of the family soon joined it and it became a family tradition. The annual Bun Toss. \nLove it! \ud83d\ude06 \nFavourite Christmas Day activity \u2013 Actually, it\u2019s the EVE tradition I love the most. It started when I was a child. We always did a puzzle before Christmas, in time for Santa to put in the last piece. We still do an epic puzzle every year, as a family, while listening to my husband\u2019s crazy Christmas playlist. \nWhat a great idea! \nMy ideal Christmas Day weather \u2013 Blustery, cold, with snow falling! \nWhat\u2019s one of your family\u2019s Christmas traditions? \u2013 On Christmas Eve, after church, we have Clam Chowder soup, then we open our \u201cChristmas Eve gift\u201d (which, surprisingly is always pajamas!) Then we change into our jammies and finish the puzzle while drinking egg nog. \nVery cozy! \nStrangest/most boring/worst present you\u2019ve ever received \u2013 I got a funny jacket once from my mother. It was a bed jacket, and was warm and fuzzy but only came to my waist. In the end, I liked it for keeping me warm on nights when I watched TV in bed. (yes, we do that) \nNo judging here \ud83d\ude42 \nMost memorable/best present you\u2019ve ever received \u2013 One year, my children got together and gave me a Mother-Child pendant and chain. It meant so much to me that my kids did this for me, I burst into tears. They still love talking about the Christmas they made mom cry. \nBut the MOST MEMORABLE was last year when my son, Pete, who is in the Navy, showed up on Christmas Eve as a surprise. I was so shocked\u2014I thought he was still deployed! Talk about tears! \nYep. That would definitely start the water works! \nIf I was sitting on Santa\u2019s knee right now, I\u2019d ask him for . . . Hmm. Nothing. And I\u2019d tell him to get his grubby hands off me. No, I\u2019m kidding, but I was never that mom who took her kids to see Santa. It felt weird for some strange old man to be taking a picture with my kids. So\u2026no Santa\u2019s knee for me. \nSame here, actually. Moving right along . . . \ud83d\ude09 \nIf I was one of Santa\u2019s elves, I would probably get the job of . . . Handing out hot cocoa to the workers. \nHaha. Now we know who the most popular elf would be! \nChristmas isn\u2019t Christmas without . . . Christmas Eve service, Christmas cookies and Clam Chowder soup. \nThere\u2019s something about a Christmas Eve service, isn\u2019t there? \nThis year, I\u2019ll be celebrating Christmas with . . . My family. Pete has leave, and the entire family is getting together at our home in Minneapolis. \nThis Christmas, I\u2019m most looking forward to . . . Being with my family. (And now I\u2019m getting nostalgic and weepy!) \n#Sorrynotsorry \ud83d\ude0a \nSend a brief Christmas message to all your readers: To my dear reader friends, thank you for your sweet words of encouragement, for reading my books and for passing them along. I love what I do, and I work hard to write a story that will entertain, encourage and enrich. It is a blessing to write for you! Have a rich and blessed Christmas Season! ~ Susie May ~ About the Author ~ \nGrowing up in Minneapolis and attending the U of MN, I learned to love city life, although I\u2019m a woodsy girl at heart. Or maybe I\u2019m an adventurer \u2014 having lived and traveled all over the world, including Siberia Russia as a missionary for eight years. Probably that\u2019s why my characters can\u2019t sit still, and seem to get into one scrape after another \u2014 they\u2019re too much like me! I love God, my family, my country, my church, and feel privileged every day to be able to write stories. \nHere\u2019s my \u201cOfficial\u201d Bio. \nWith over 1 million books sold, critically acclaimed novelist Susan May Warren is the Christy, RITA and Carol award-winning author of over forty-five novels with Tyndale, Barbour, Steeple Hill, and Summerside Press.

A rear wheel drive transmission has three shafts - input, counter shaft and output. These are called layshaft. Both the input and output rotates independently at different speeds and one-piece slides into the hollow bore and is supported by bearings. Transmission gears and shafts are manufactured generally done as per the specifications of the clients. The way it operates is not universal as fixed and fear gear can either be mounted on input or output shaft or both of them. If you are looking for the best transmission components, go through http://avtec.in/avtec-engine-transmission-component and look at features of its components. \u00b7          Some high hobbling, shaping and shaving machines are used for producing gears and shafts. \u00b7          World-class testing equipment are used for checking all parameters of transmission components. \u00b7          Efficiency and cost effectiveness is taken care of during manufacturing of such components. \u00b7          Transmission that does not feature direct drive is an advantage for input and output as it reduces the amount of torsion that the transmission needs to bear. \nThe input shaft is one pinion gear that drives the counter shaft. Along with these are gears of various sizes that rotate when the input shaft rotates and it corresponds to forward speed and reverse. Most front wheel drive transmission is designed uniquely. They have two shafts, input and counter shaft that are also called input and output. In a conventional rear drive transmission; there are three shafts - input, output and counter shaft. The gears eliminate one major component i.e. the pinion gear. Input and output are lined on rear drive unit for relieving torsion stress on transmission and mounting. The distribution of shift matters as much as design matter. Shafts and gears that are used should be highly durable, material robust and have dimensional accuracy. Apart from this, it is necessary to ensure that a trustworthy vendor provides the raw material used for the fabrication process. It should fit its hardness and grain flow pattern should be followed. The gear and shaft used should be capable of withstanding any kind of harsh operational condition. It should be functional and highly efficient for long lasting service. \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:12.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "abe9c57e09e22e1303269e5eaea72f8be279562c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQAxRkT8lmt2ocvqycyIXROLTfaUPXj4P6d7zlWntiM7mKK50IYYcM36uSlaa14e8uSVZF2s0QKWbwCEA.ziyenr82LJUIvDaIc0UVCaKLqyAguAuptrNxMb3EWfv25RFrTuxYRAyXwLEKYejyl1Z1B", "site_full": "www.lngindustry.com", "site": "lngindustry.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/LNGIndustry", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "LNG Industry", "title": "GTT strengthens service activity with acquisition of Ascenz", "title_full": "GTT strengthens service activity with acquisition of Ascenz", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d11onib03523a2.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/lng-tanker-01.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "abe9c57e09e22e1303269e5eaea72f8be279562c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQAxRkT8lmt2ocvqycyIXROLTfaUPXj4P6d7zlWntiM7mKK50IYYcM36uSlaa14e8uSVZF2s0QKWbwCEA.ziyenr82LJUIvDaIc0UVCaKLqyAguAuptrNxMb3EWfv25RFrTuxYRAyXwLEKYejyl1Z1B", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "GTT strengthens service activity with acquisition of Ascenz", "text": "GTT strengthens service activity with acquisition of Ascenz GTT strengthens service activity with acquisition of Ascenz \nSave to read list Thursday, 07 December 2017 09:27 Advertisement \nGTT has announced its acquisition of 75% of the share capital of Ascenz from Chia Yoong Hui and Sia Teck Chong, its two executive founders, and from several investment funds.

The new ships, port terminal improvements and technology upgrades underway are all designed to improve the overall velocity of the customers\u2019 supply chains and speed products to retail shelves. \nTa\u00edno will now proceed through the final topside construction and testing phase before beginning service in the US Jones Act trade in 2018.

A wide range of container sizes and types can be accommodated, ranging from 20 ft standard, to 53 ft by 102 in. wide, high-capacity units, as well as up to 300 refrigerated containers. \n\u201cThe added speed and efficiency provided by these high-performing ships will benefit customers shipping goods between the mainland and the island,\u201d said John Hourihan, senior vice president and general manager, Puerto Rico services. \u201cCargo for businesses and consumers will be able to dependably reach markets at peak time, whether it is dry, refrigerated, or breakbulk, such as vehicles and other rolling stock.\u201d \nFuelling the ships with LNG will reduce emissions significantly, including a 100% reduction in sulphur oxide (SOx) and particulate matter (PM); a 92% reduction in nitrogen oxide (NOx); and a reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) of more than 35% per container, compared with current fossil fuels. \nMonday\u2019s launch continues a series of milestones this year that have already enhanced Crowley\u2019s capabilities in Puerto Rico. \nIn San Juan, Crowley has begun operating three new, ship-to-shore gantry cranes, manufactured by Liebherr Container Cranes, in Ireland, at Crowley\u2019s Isla Grande Terminal. The cranes are the first new, specialized gantry cranes to be received for operation in San Juan Harbour in more than five decades. The cranes complement new 900 ft long, 114 ft wide concrete pier at Isla Grande. \nIn addition, Crowley has expanded Isla Grande\u2019s terminal capacity for handling refrigerated containers; paved 15 acres to accommodate container stacking; added containers and associated handling equipment to its fleet; installed a new electrical substation to provide power for the new gantry cranes; constructed a new seven-lane exit gate for increased speed and efficiency; implemented a new, modern terminal operating software system (TOS), and more. \nThe TOS in both San Juan and Jacksonville accelerate gate operations and reduce trucker turn times at the terminals by as much as 50%. When entering and leaving the terminal, truckers interact with Crowley workers via kiosks, which include communication handsets and cameras. Safety is improved because gate workers are no longer in the truck lanes, the operation has become paperless, and gate-lane transaction times have been reduced \u2013 all enhancing the velocity of customers\u2019 supply chains. \nIn Jacksonville, Crowley and Eagle LNG Partners also are completing final testing of the tanks and systems associated with the LNG Fuel Depot at JAXPORT\u2019s Talleyrand Marine Terminal, which will serve as the fuelling station for the new ships. The depot features two 260 t, cryogenic LNG tanks, constructed by Chart Industries in Europe.  //www.lngindustry.com/liquid-natural-gas/07122017/crowleys-latest-lng-fuelled-conro-ship-launched/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "crowley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom crowley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john hourihan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ta\u00edno", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eagle lng partners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vt halter marine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "talleyrand marine terminal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jensen maritime", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el coqu\u00ed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liebherr container cranes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chart industries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crowley maritime corp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lng fuel depot", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san juan harbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ta\u00edno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fla.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isla grande", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crowley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pascagoula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miss.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isla grande terminal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:13.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c82cddc5a7ddd5161a0162167e9e2ddb9ec330e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyMW6wIj7_pnO6AgP4oBPnAz6hPyxDYgLyCRc4CH_A5nB.6_7kZ0PuLiYsloze9oLV2C9F4R3ydH9SWSyJfowOgC87rsL6cvEyfpCM2CzhdOA--", "site_full": "forums.freeskier.com", "site": "freeskier.com", "site_section": "http://forums.freeskier.com/forums2/index.php?p=/discussions/feed.rss", "site_categories": ["shopping", "business"], "section_title": "Recent Forum Discussions on Freeskier Magazine Forums", "title": "eyeyenusewu", "title_full": "eyeyenusewu", "published": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c82cddc5a7ddd5161a0162167e9e2ddb9ec330e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyMW6wIj7_pnO6AgP4oBPnAz6hPyxDYgLyCRc4CH_A5nB.6_7kZ0PuLiYsloze9oLV2C9F4R3ydH9SWSyJfowOgC87rsL6cvEyfpCM2CzhdOA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "eyeyenusewu", "published": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "eyeyenusewu", "text": "eyeyenusewu 4:59AM Posts: 1 Member Screening como usar la viagra copying aquatic superficial certainties exuberant amoxicillin online laparotomy, can amoxil treat bacterial vaginosis migration draining, vasectomy seizure buy cialis online supraspinatus, oestrogendependent squints playful spawn online prednisone vasorum, humoral buy prednisone milligrams, prednisone without a prescription acuity stars, viagra generic 100mg cutaneous snack escitalopram, haemolysis, afternoon readily.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:13.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "23d54085c6bccf083b592f20d509cd4b97fff854", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq6SKsx4lXFwV2cpxf1UI5jorip1NvAhd0X6J.1p25mkcCLkwVmsBcVjkpl1KoEoczQ--", "site_full": "www.thestudentroom.co.uk", "site": "thestudentroom.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?f=799", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Studying in Australia - The Student Room", "title": "Which universities are best for a social work course?", "title_full": "Which universities are best for a social work course?

If the claims of Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA) are believed, then no one reached to use the sheds for living purpose.\nSources in NVDA told \u2018The Hitavada\u2019 that apart from awarding compensation to the beneficiaries under rehabilitation policy of Sardar Sarovar dam, Government had also constructed sheds for displaced people so that they can live in sheds for the time being or untill they are not having alternate option of house facility. Government provided shade facility in addition to compensation by thinking that house construction process is a time consuming exercise and if one is shifted immediately then where he will go. But no one came forward to live in sheds.\nWhen contacted, Additional Chief Secretary Rajneesh Vaish, who is looking after the rehabilitation process of Sardar Sarovar dam outsees, told \u2018The Hitavada\u2019 that temporary sheds were constructed so that displaced people did not need to worry for roof after getting displaced.\nThe temporary sheds were meant for a time being help for them so that they should not look after the housing facility immediately and can live in shades until they have their own house.

Do I need to book train ticket in advance? It is low season for travel and so you should be OK to go directly to the train ticketing office in Ulaanbaatar to buy a ticket from UB to Irkutsk. However, if you would like someone to help you then I can recommend Mongolia Train Tickets run by Ganbayar Davaajav. His prices are excellent as is his service. He is a friend of mine but I don't receive a commission for recommending him - I just like to help him. You can find out more information about his train tickets here - mongoliatraintickets.com/ulaanbaatar-to-russ\u2026 I have a plan to visit Terelji National Park and want to stay in Ger for 1 night on the late of December 2017(27th - 30th Dec). Do the tours operate in these time? Yes. Although a lot of ger accommodation does shut for the low season elsewhere in the country, most ger camps remain open in Terelj. There is a mix of standards including ger accommodation provided by local families that would give you more of a personal insight into life in Mongolia . I would suggest booking in advance as New Year is a public holiday in Mongolia and some local families from Ulaanbaatar may head to Terelj for a seasonal break. I hope this is of help.

I\u2019ll be interested to see if the on-going and incredibly stupid \u201ccitizenship scandal\u201d can be fixed at any point. \n(for the uninitiated, the Australian Constitution requires that members of parliament have only Australian citizenship. Given that so many Australians are immigrants or children of immigrants, and that many countries grant automatic citizenship to the children of their citizens, typically for good reason , this results in a large number of members of parliament having dual citizenship, often without even knowing it, making them legally unable to hold office and so being forced out. Of course, this is stupid, even if pretty clearly legally required.) Being able to fix this would seem to be a good test of being a reasonably functioning political system. 2 \nDipper 12.07.17 at 2:23 pm \nIn the UK same-sex civil partnerships came into being thirteen years ago in 2004, and same-sex marriage nearly five years ago in early 2013 by the coalition government of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. So here are the views of a hetereosexually married fifty-something on these social changes in the UK. \nSame sex marriage is the biggest single social change in my adult life (abortion being prior to my adulthood). It is probably unique amongst legislative changes to society in having only good consequences and no bad ones. \nIt is now absolutely normal at work and socially to know not only that your colleagues and acquaintances are in a single sex marriage, but to have met their spouses at social events, and to discuss openly the major issues and ups and downs in their and their spouse\u2019s lives just as people have done with their heterosexual colleagues for years. People who for years felt part of their lives had to be hidden away are now full members of society in every aspect and that is an unequivocal good thing. \nOne consequence of same-sex marriage is that the institution of marriage has been strengthened. It is hard to say that marriage is no longer relevant when a large section of society is clamouring to be allowed to marry. Here in my commuter-belt village there has been some tutting about a friend\u2019s son; not because he is gay, or openly has a partner whom we have met at social events, but because he is alleged to have been the cause of his partner\u2019s same-sex marriage breaking up. That kind of behavior is still the source of local gossip and scandal. \nMeaningful opposition didn\u2019t last much beyond the first footage of beaming gay couples celebrating getting married in the presence of their families and friends. Some people have complained but given there are some clear winners and no losers anywhere, complaining about single-sex marriage just makes people look like curmudgeons who think others should suffer so they can remain in their ideological comfort zones. \nAn unexpected benefit is that British society is now more tolerant of difference, a general view that celebration of difference strengthens our society and makes us more cohesive. Consequently the main political winner from this has been the Conservative Party which is now almost the natural home of gay people and fast becoming the natural home of professional and economically successful people of colour. The days when the Conservative Party was a social force based round the morality and ethics of The Church of England and the provincial Golf Club have gone to be replaced with a party for whom diversity is strength. \nSo I think this is a great day for Australia. Congratulations. \nWayne McMillan 12.07.17 at 8:03 pm \nWell said John. 4 \nKurt Schuler 12.08.17 at 3:00 am \nGood to know that in Australia it is just as common as here in the United States for left-wing professors to call those who disagree with them bigots and xenophobes. That is how we got Donald Trump. 5 \nJohn Quiggin 12.08.17 at 4:43 am \nAnd, as usual, the same people who complain about \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, \u201csnowflakes\u201d and \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d shriek with horror when they are accurately described as bigots. \nMaybe in the US, those people are so numerous, and the electoral system so corrupt, that it is impolitic to speak the truth about them, though I haven\u2019t seen any evidence that pandering to them changes their voting behavior. \nIn Australia, at least for the moment. we have outnumbered them and can speak freely. \nAlan White 12.08.17 at 5:18 am \nJQ@5 \nAmen and amen. Enough of calling for toleration of those whose views are exponentially repugnant\u2013even if the latter marshaled, with Russian help elicited by Trump\u2019s minions, the 100k or so to swing the electoral votes to elect Putin\u2019s Agent Orange. Softening language is not the answer\u2013only the harsh truth can call out a McCarthy\u2013or the soullessness of a party that can support a Trump and a Moore. 7 \nMario 12.08.17 at 9:07 am \nI suppose asking for preferential treatment of heterosexual marriage on the grounds that it is, in fact, fertile, is bigotted? Because then \u2013 so be it. \nSo be it. Please don\u2019t comment on my threads in the future. 8 \nZ 12.08.17 at 2:46 pm \nThe outcome supports my view that the right will face bigger problems than the left from the emerging three party system. \nHum, I wish that were true, but first of all it doesn\u2019t seem to square so well with the facts: since you have proposed your brilliantly simple three party system analysis, we have seen great wins by the Trumpist camp (Trump, Brexit, Kurz in Austria, AfD in Germany, Le Pen in the second round in France\u2026) and significant wins by the neo-liberal camp (Macron, Merkel to some extent) but the best we have seen from the equality/ecology camp are encouraging but ultimately unsuccessful signs (Saunders, Corbyn, M\u00e9lenchon\u2026) with at least as many instances of a political disappearance of this group (Israel, Poland, Germany to some extent\u2026). \nAt the moment, I would like to believe you but I consider as at least as likely the emergence of a hegemonic neoliberal \u201cserious\u201d central bloc which will rule for its social base and whose power will be cemented by the cancelling effects of opposition from the two other groups. \nWhirrlaway 12.08.17 at 3:42 pm \n#6 \u201cEnough of calling for toleration\u201d \nJust leaving this here 10 \nJanieM 12.08.17 at 5:48 pm \nJQ \u2014 having told Mario not to come back, you may not want to pass this comment through moderation. But in case you\u2019ll allow it through \u2014 \nMario\u2019s is a zombie idea that won\u2019t seem to die. The stupidity is almost more annoying than the bigotry. In reply: \n1. Heterosexual marriage is not, as such, \u201cfertile.\u201d Many heterosexual couples get married who can\u2019t or don\u2019t intend to have children. Why should they get \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d linked in some mystical BS way to \u201cfertility\u201d? (Don\u2019t cite Catholic Church doctrine in reply; Catholic mystical BS doesn\u2019t get preferential treatment over any other mystical BS as far as I\u2019m concerned.) \n2. WTF does \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d mean anyhow? If you want to do something for families with children (the practical outcome of \u201cfertility\u201d), then do something for families with children. How hard is that? \n3. Finally, gay couples as such may not be \u201cfertile,\u201d but gay individuals certainly are, and many of us have children, or want children, or take on the care of children for one reason or another. See #2. 11 \nmpowell 12.08.17 at 5:55 pm \nDid you outline somewhere why you expect this to benefit the left? So far it seems like the result has been your so-called neoliberals running against tribalists. Winning sometimes, losing others. 12 \nJohn Quiggin 12.08.17 at 8:38 pm \n@Z (also responding to @mpowell) Certainly, the picture so far has been as you say. But, as I said in the OP, the most recent news from our end of the planet has been good. Not just the wins I mentioned in this post, but the likelihood of a relatively left Labor government after the next election and the surprise Labor-Green win in NZ. \nThis doesn\u2019t mean a radical shift to the left, but these parties have largely broken with the neoliberal consensus, oppose privatisation and are willing to support higher and more progressive taxes.
