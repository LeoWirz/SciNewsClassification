I don't have any solutions to offer, but I do have some advice.\nStart focusing on yourself first. The golden rule here is, if you're not healthy physically or mentally, you cannot help anyone. You can try, but in the end, you may be in a worse situation than before.\nHave you been told in the past to write your love one (daughter) a letter, but don't send it? Write out all your resentment, anger, hostility, basically everything you wanted to say to them in whatever beautiful language you desire. Through this act, I hope you can relieve some of those emotion that are building up inside of you.\nI believe it is okay to say no. Your daughter is not in a position where you are require to take care of her. How society sees it, as soon as the person turn 18, you are no longer legally require to be their guardian. Their choices are theirs a lone. Forgiveness can always come later. Asking for some space is not at all wrong, so I hope you can give yourself that without any guilt. Additionally, if you could write out a letter to your daughter explaining that you are currently not in the best shape, but am proud of her for getting help and will be in contact when things are easier on your side.\nI would also recommend writing down a list of things you would like to improve for yourself. Set some small achievable goals. A new month is approaching, so setting the goals for the end of the month (december) might not be a bad idea.\nI look forward to hear your progress.

Drug use began 4 years ago. Building psychosis for those last 4 years, with the crescendo of psychosis for the past year. In that time, she has abused me, put holes in walls, crashed her car, got into huge debt, got me into debt, threatened me physically, wanted to kill people ect ect. I had to take her to the hospital where she was admitted to the psychiatric ward with the diagnosis of drug induced psychosis. Not easy things for parents to go through.\nThe biggest reason that I allowed her treatment of me to go as far as it did, was guilt. I carried an enormous amount of guilt of what the then 9 year old heard in court due her brother's sexual assault court case. At the time, the police investigation and court case takes a toll of everybody and she had a lot of viral tonsillitis at the time.\nSo after several stays in the psych ward, she began to feel good in herself and then used drugs again with an instant psychotic result. This moment cut the cord of guilt that I had and has been replaced by resentment, anger, hostility and antagonism towards her. I told her that I didn't want to see her for a long time until I could work through my issues. She however, got a big fright about that and encouraged her headspace caseworker to initiate family counselling.\nI know her worker is all about my daughter, as she should be, but she keeps telling me how unwell my daughter is and they are still getting her medication right and that I should be more patient with her. But at what point is it ok for me to say \"hang on, what she did to me was bad and I am struggling with it\".\nBeginning to feel as though I should just lay down and be a doormat to anybody who wants to wipe their muddy feet on me and that I am expected to just suck up the 4 years of hell and move on as though no psychological damage has been done.\nJust over it and right now don't know which way to go in my own thinking. Part of me knows that what she has put me through has been horrific, but the other part thinks that I should find a way to forgive her for her poor behaviour as my feelings in this situation just don't matter.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:56.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "24c1c46f2de62f828e4aeaff642e676953bac70b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBItOjajtAGVrj0BDnCdR7NxBPO8uwemi5UzSQlwHcafxXAoEHj6ZpNMLOO1CUGuOjKgqoB2gPd2wk", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/shareChat.asp?view=thread&ShareTicker=KIBO", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Kibo Mining Share Chat - Chat About KIBO Shares - Stock Quotes, Charts, Trade History, Share Chat, Financial Terms Glossary ", "title": "Kibo Mining Share Chat - Chat About KIBO Shares - Stock Quotes, Charts, Trade History, Share Chat, Financial Terms Glossary", "title_full": "Kibo Mining Share Chat - Chat About KIBO Shares - Stock Quotes, Charts, Trade History, Share Chat, Financial Terms Glossary", "published": "2017-12-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.02, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 22289, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "24c1c46f2de62f828e4aeaff642e676953bac70b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBItOjajtAGVrj0BDnCdR7NxBPO8uwemi5UzSQlwHcafxXAoEHj6ZpNMLOO1CUGuOjKgqoB2gPd2wk", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wimbledon", "published": "2017-12-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Kibo Mining Share Chat - Chat About KIBO Shares - Stock Quotes, Charts, Trade History, Share Chat, Financial Terms Glossary", "text": "shareholder conference call well thats a new one", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:56.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c22af4c18b0c338d42d9916e29e6d6b335eb517", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYDqSx6l4NqsvEI27puikv64", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "So... should I buy IOTA now?

All things I am well aware, have followed for the last 20 years, yet in the heat of crisis completely disappears!\nMy husband and I have had no support in the four years of her drug use and building psychosis. On her first release from the psych ward into our care, I insisted that we were given support if we were to manage the situation proactively. We were assured that the Crisis Assessment Team would contact the family and assess what we needed and would get us in touch with the relevant support groups. She was released at the end of April this year, and at the time of writing this, we have not heard anything from the CAT team in relation to our needs.\nAlso, I attended a meeting at Headspace at the end of July, that included my daughter, her case worker, the centre manager and her GP. I told then that I did not know how to handle the situation, her moods, her psychosis and was even at the point where I wasn't sure how to be a mother anymore. I was told by all of them, that could help me out with that. Again, at the time of writing this, I am yet to hear from anybody.\nI guess a big part of the problem is that in this situation that creates a feeling of vulnerability and confusion, that we look to these organisation to guide, direct or point in the right direction. As I know, when I am in that high stress zone, I lack the ability to think clearly and rationally and basically unable to go off in search of help myself. And if these organisations make the offer to help, of course I am going to wait around for it. Afterall, they are the professionals in this matter. But when they don't contact at all, and I am highly stressed, I know my thinking reverts into self-punishment. I start to think that I should be able to cope, I should know what to do, I am carrying on about nothing. I am also aware that that type of thinking is unhelpful and not accurate. In times of high stress, my rational self doesn't get much of a say as the irrational comes out to play.\nI think also that I have been unwilling to vent my frustrations towards these organisations as they are helping my daughter when she needs it and I don't want to harm her recovery in anyway.\nThank you for listening, just being able to offload does clear some of the fog that is floating around in my head.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:56.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "049bc1930b3ed0d0de79fe041d25c9815be9e425", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpN75wdASpJ1iPUUq487Xz7HQ5F3kCMbZN7S2P4TP18LJU7oC6S9xIqrfF6v0i0qjBEgR7U0qaMpvz6kY56p_dM88Bi2wf5Z4J.gf_1C_MAzA--", "site_full": "s-trance-zone.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://s-trance-zone.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Paolo Grillo (S-Trance)", "title": "SPECTRO SENSES & ORECCH - Crystal Planet (Original Mix)", "title_full": "SPECTRO SENSES & ORECCH - Crystal Planet (Original Mix)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IT", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "049bc1930b3ed0d0de79fe041d25c9815be9e425", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpN75wdASpJ1iPUUq487Xz7HQ5F3kCMbZN7S2P4TP18LJU7oC6S9xIqrfF6v0i0qjBEgR7U0qaMpvz6kY56p_dM88Bi2wf5Z4J.gf_1C_MAzA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Paolo Grillo (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "SPECTRO SENSES & ORECCH - Crystal Planet (Original Mix)", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:56.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "049d671a2a2d2232a5b56354b95d9d8b96590de3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYA2kG.yUWx_CivPA6ZNdilI", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp;

It marked the seventh time this season Louisville won by more than 10 points and the fifth time it won by 25 or more. \nThe Cardinals (9-0) are off to the second-best start in program history. The 2006-07 team began 15-0. \nCoach Jeff Walz is especially pleased with how his team is doing, considering the Cardinals have played three ranked opponents and a couple tough mid-major schools.

SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"I would have told you at the beginning of the season if we could have been 7-2 right now, I would have been excited about that, knowing where we were going to be playing and who we will be playing,\" Walz said. \nAgainst the Skyhawks (3-5), the Cardinals closed out the first quarter on a 16-2 run to build a 29-9 lead in the final minute of the period. The spurt was spurred by reserves as the Cardinals scored 14 points after Walz made three substitutions with 4:24 left in the quarter. \nThe Cardinals shot 17 of 32 after halftime in extending their lead. Asia Durr and Jazmine Jones each added 14 points for Louisville, which had five players finish in double figures. \nLouisville shot 52.3 percent for the game and dished out 21 assists on 34 baskets. UT Martin, meanwhile, shot just 32.8 percent and committed a season-worst 22 turnovers. \nChelsey Perry led the Skyhawks with 15 points. \nBIG PICTURE \nUT Martin: The Skyhawks entered the game as one of the worst defensive teams in the country, with their 73.7 scoring average against tied for 301st in Division I. Louisville exploited that weakness by topping 90 points for the fourth time this season. \nLouisville: The Cardinals took full advantage of their size to overpower the Skyhawks. At the beginning of the game, UT Martin resorted to using Kendall Spray, a 5-7 guard, to defend the 6-1 Hines-Allen. Mismatches like that allowed the Cardinals to post a season-high 10 blocks and outscore the visitors 44-20 in the paint. \nCARTER STEPPING UP \nArica Carter scored 10 points for the Cardinals, marking the second consecutive double-digit scoring game for the junior and just the fifth of her career. \nShe sat out last season recovering from a groin injury and while she has started all nine games this season. The 5-8 point guard said it's taken some time to realize where she fits in on the team, especially within the offense. \n\"For me, the biggest adjustment is understanding where I am supposed to play, understanding where (Walz) wants me to be aggressive,\" she said. \nIt appears Carter's figuring it out. Although she's shooting 44.2 percent through the first nine games, she's made 10 of 15 shots in her last two games. Walz said that's due to her finding her range. All of Carter's field goals Tuesday came within 15 feet of the basket. \nPOLL IMPLICATIONS \nThe Cardinals play two more times before the next poll is released, but barring a loss later this week, Tuesday's performance should keep them perched no worse than their current ranking \nUP NEXT \nUT Martin: The Skyhawks return home to host NCAA Division III foe Rhodes College on Thursday morning. \nLouisville: The Cardinals also have a short respite as they return to the court Thursday evening to face Vanderbilt.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "myisha hines-allen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "carter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ut martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff walz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jazmine jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bittenbender", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arica carter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hines-allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia durr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsey perry", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ut martin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ncaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardinals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kendall spray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanderbilt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janekia mason louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skyhawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee-martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhodes college", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south park magazine louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee-martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:57.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3121b4787db02d68525f3fe6451d257bd7e77007", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YmnQl.JyFnAuNgStgGyXl0rzdhFXFKvAN2W98d7xQ2hvIoBN9XNVjaMZ1FkWFlZHh.ZlkcyNlG94_fHRqJiYXr5fbVEEIMfhHK.nZ2gIotYeJGIpPJNIvBFBLKbXu8ps-", "site_full": "www.chinaspeakersagency.com", "site": "chinaspeakersagency.com", "site_section": "http://www.chinaspeakersagency.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "China Speakers Agency | The Leading China International Speakers Bureau", "title": "Prof Anil Gupta and Haiyan Wang Included in Thinker50 2017", "title_full": "Prof Anil Gupta and Haiyan Wang Included in Thinker50 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.lynda.com/authors/8179330_250x250_thumb.jpg?v=370768450", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3121b4787db02d68525f3fe6451d257bd7e77007", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YmnQl.JyFnAuNgStgGyXl0rzdhFXFKvAN2W98d7xQ2hvIoBN9XNVjaMZ1FkWFlZHh.ZlkcyNlG94_fHRqJiYXr5fbVEEIMfhHK.nZ2gIotYeJGIpPJNIvBFBLKbXu8ps-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "China Speakers Agency", "published": "2017-12-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "Prof Anil Gupta and Haiyan Wang Included in Thinker50 2017", "text": "Prof Anil Gupta and Haiyan Wang Included in Thinker50 2017 \nWe are most delighted that Prof Anil Gupta and Haiyan Wang , are included once again in the 2017 Thinkers50 rankings of the \u201cworld\u2019s most influential management thinkers\u201d! \nProf Anil Gupta and Haiyan Wang have co-authored several highly influential books including The Quest for Global Dominance , Getting China and India Right , and The Silk Road Rediscovered .

Maloof updated her followers on Twitter, confirming her family\u2019s evacuation from their lavish Southern California home.

Terms of use . 22 \nA long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, George Lucas really screwed up. He did not have Star Wars toys available during the 1977 holiday season. Kenner fixed that the following year with a movie merchandise rollout that every sci-fi, fantasy, and superhero flick of the last 40 years has followed: glut the market with toys in case your film actually is the next coming of Star Wars . (Spoiler: it isn't.) \nThe only thing to come close: more Star Wars . It began again with Episode VII: The Force Awakens several years ago, and last year's Rogue One was a smash success. Now Episode VIII: The Last Jedi is upon us, and the desire for merchandise from a galaxy far, far away will only increase. \nWith it comes toys and plenty of other merch suitable for fans of any age. We combed through as much new Star Wars stuff as we could\u2014no one can see all the licensed material Disney has out\u2014and picked our favorites. Fellow geeks, get your orders in now, whether for yourself or a young padawan, and awaken your own Force by Christmas Day. View As: One Page Slides 1 Star Wars: Nvidia Titan Xp Graphics Cards When you're outfitting a PC with the highest end graphics for playing PC-based Star Wars games, you obviously would gravitate toward an Nvidia graphics card with full Jedi Order green or Galactic Empire red designs that look a little lightsaber-y on the edges. Each of these Titan Xp collector's edition GPUs using the VR-ready Pascal architecture with 12GB of GDDR5X memory will set you back a pretty credit, but they deliver a resolution on screens up to 7,680 by 4,320 pixels at 60Hz. at 2 Sphero R2-D2 Last year we all got used to seeing BB-8 from Sphero careening around; this year, Sphero goes back to the first cute droid we fell in love with: R2-D2 . This is an astromech unit you control with your smartphone. Like in the movies, his head swivels and he'll move from bi-pod to tri-pod stance as needed to get around. Best of all, he'll interact directly with other Sphero Star Wars droids, or with you as you watch Star Wars films side by side. at 3 Sphero BB-9E The only evil version of R2 is in the comic books. But BB-8's getting an on-screen counterpart from the First Order in Episode VIII . Called BB-9E , all we know so far is that he's a BB-unit with a similar build, but a sharper head dome and he serves on board the ship run by Supreme Leader Snoke himself. On the set he was called BB-H8 (as in BB-\"Hate\") so that doesn't bode well for his attitude. at 4 LittleBits Droid Inventor Kit Want your kid to get creative and learn a little something at the same time? Rather than the usual Star Wars toys, get him into robotics\u2014and coding\u2014with this LittleBits kit for building a working astromech droid in the style of R2-D2. Everything goes together magnetically, is color coded, and is way better than Erector Sets of the past. ( For more, check out our Q&A with LittleBits CEO Ayah Bdeir . ) at 5 Funko POP Jyn Erso Funko POP figures are fantastic, and it's hard to 1) not find one for a Star Wars character and 2) narrow down which one to feature here when choices include K-2SO , Captain Phasma , Chopper (from Rebels ), and Maz Kanata , among hundreds. But Jyn Erso \u2014hero of Rogue One, the woman who made the ultimate sacrifice when she made it possible for the Rebels to get the plans to the original Death Star\u2014deserves a shout out whenever possible. at 6 Marvel's Star Wars: Doctor Aphra Digital Comics In the Star Wars universe there are many characters you don't get to see unless you read the books and comics. Among the coolest is the archeologist named Doctor Aphra , sort of a female Indiana Jones off in galaxy far, far away. She just so happens to work directly for Darth Vader himself in the time after the Battle of Yavin (in Episode IV). Read how she managed to survive it\u2014and fall out of Vader's favor\u2014in the ongoing comics. You can sub to Marvel Unlimited for $9.99 a month to read all the back issues, and a lot more. at 7 From a Certain Point of View (Audio Book) One of the most talked about Star Wars books in a long time, From a Certain Point of View shines as an audiobook for the famous narrators involved\u2014including Jon Hamm of Mad Men playing Boba Fett. But it wouldn't be anywhere without a kickass lineup of authors including big names like John Jackson Miller, Nnedi Okorafor, Adam Christopher, Chuck Wendig, Mur Lafferty, and many more. All 40 tales inside are about various characters encountered in the 40 years since Star Wars made its debut. at 8 Nerf Rival Apollo XV 700 Star Wars Mandalorian Edition Gamestop is the only place to buy this Mandalorian Edition Nerf Rival Apollo XV-700 blaster (it shoots Nerf ping-pong-sized balls) and Face Mask with the same color scheme as the most famous of Mandalorian armor of all, that of Boba Fett (who wasn't even from Mandalore. Dude was a clone.) at 9 Star Wars: Battlefront 2 Deluxe Star Wars Battlefront 2 has a lot to live up to, and doesn't quite reach it (no thanks to complicated upgrades and microtransactions). But, this is a game with a pedigree that shows: incredible graphics, excellent mechanics and sound, a nice multiplayer mode, and finally a good (albeit short) campaign mode where you play an Imperial Commander in the time right after Return of the Jedi . at 10 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story on Blu Ray I'm going to say it: Rogue One is probably the best Star Wars film ever (at least since The Empire Strikes Back ), certainly one of the best war films of all time, and now, you can own it on Blu-ray. And you should. at 11 Star Wars: 3D Holodisplay Star Wars fans know holograms are part and parcel of the communications systems. Now, holograms come to you. You have to get the steel-core base station , which depicts the trench run on the original Death Star first. Then there are options to get holograms mounted on black gloss acrylic featuring Kylo Ren and R2-D2. at 12 Star Wars: The Ultimate Vinyl Collection Star Wars episodes I to VI have many iconic components, and the music is second to none thanks to the work of Oscar-winning composer/conductor John Williams. Now it's possible to get the ultimate collection of all his music for the films on LPs or Audio CDs in Ultimate collections you'll be listening to for a long, long time. at 13 Crosley Cruiser Deluxe Portable 3 Speed Turntable with Bluetooth When it's time to play those LPs, you may need a turntable to get up to speed. Crosley sells a number of portable 3-speed turntables\u2014they kind that look like they are in a mini-suitcase\u2014including this CR8005D-SW model , fully decorated on the outside with the first poster for Star Wars , Episode IV. The turntables also support Bluetooth, so you can broadcast the sound to a portable speaker of choice, or use the built-in speakers or output via RCA and headphone jacks. at 14 iHome Star Destroyer Bluetooth Speaker This Resurgent-class Battlecruiser of the type used by the First Order, based on classic Star Destroyers of the Empire, is for more than conquest. It's for playing tunes and taking calls, as it's a fully portable, lithium-ion battery-powered Bluetooth speaker . Included: one saved song in memory\u2014the Star Wars main theme, to play whenever you like. at 15 Plox Official Star Wars Levitating Death Star Bluetooth Speaker If you like your Bluetooth sound to be more of a planet killer, this floating Death Star model is what you secretly desire. The deadly sphere floats on magnets over the base; it delivers 5 watts of sound power for up to five hours per charge in a full 360 degrees. at 16 First Order Stormtrooper Robot with Companion App Plenty of droids from Star Wars are out there to play with, but the first working bi-pedal robot isn't C-3PO. It's a mini-Stormtropper of the First Order . Don't assume he'll get you drinks or retrieve your blaster. He does walk about, but is mainly for playing AR games and talking to (he takes voice commands and does facial recognition), and can be put into sentry mode to warn of intruders; he'll patrol an area you designate. You control him via mobile apps on your smartphone. at 17 Jedi Challenges We got to try Jedi Challenges recently, and found this AR lightsaber game to be a tremendous amount of fun, especially for uber- Star Wars fans. The controller is a very high-quality lightsaber handle; it works with both iOS and Android phones set inside a Lenovo Mirage AR headset . It's not just about sword fights with light; there's also a holochess mode. Just remember to let the Wookie win. at 18 Luke Skywalker's 12-Volt Ride-On Landspeeder Radio Flyer makes a lot of great things for kids to ride in\u2014like wagons\u2014but nothing beats the \"anti-gravity\" ride of Luke's X-34 Landspeeder across the deserts of Tatooine. This Toys R Us exclusive comes with realistic-looking controls, pre-dented accents to match Luke's, and the 12-volt battery will propel it around 5mph (2mph in reverse). It'll hold two riders, age 4+, up to a weight of 130 pounds each. at 19 Lego Ultimate Collector Series Millennium Falcon Kit Remember when Rey said that ship was garbage? Well, the Millennium Falcon \u2014the ship that did the Kessel run in only 12 parsecs!\u2014is still kicking ass in the outer rim. Prove that the hunk-of-junk Corellian freighter can be put back together no matter what the damage by spending several days building it yourself out of 5,195 Lego pieces. The finished product is a full 33.1 by 22.2 by 8.3 inches\u2014big enough that the included Lego Mini-fig characters of Leia, Han (young and old), Chewie, Obi-wan, Luke, Rey, Finn, C-3PO, BB-8, a mynock, and a porg, are all to scale. It weights 24.2 pounds. It costs... a lot. at 20 Force Link Starter Set Force Link is a wearable tech for kids that unlocks the power inside several different toys on the market. This one includes a Link-activated Kylo Ren action figure . There are plenty of other Force Link figures including Chewbacca (with a porg) , Vader with an Imperial Probe Droid , and many more\u2014including a slew of figures of characters from Episode VIII: The Last Jedi . at 21 Powerbot Star Wars Robotic Vacuums Samsung's latest Powerbot robot vacuums are both Star Wars motifs\u2014one with the visage of Darth Vader himself, the other looking like a stormtrooper. They'll spew random bits of movie dialog as they skirt your floors, sucking up crud. You can control them using smartphone apps. Seems only fair these space villains would have to, at the very least, clean up your spills and detritus from the floor. at 22 Propel Star Wars Drones There are few more exciting dog-fights in the skies or space than watching the whirling X-Wings of the Rebellion/Resistance taking on the TIE Fighers of the Empire/First Order. Recreate them now with your own quadcopter drones , one for each type of fighter ship, specifically the T-65 X-wing of Luke Skywalker, and aTIE Advanced X1 like the one Darth Vader himself piloted. Plus there's a 74-Z Speeder Bike drone you can throw into the action! You can learn to control each in a virtual environment on an iPhone or iPad before you take to the skies at 30mph on a cushion of air. All use infra-red lights to score hits on each other, recording accurate \"damage\" when in combat. Multiple players with multiple fighters are allowed, and you can follow the combat on your smartphone screen.

We give out  these red envelopes during the Holidays, the New Year and other special occasions to wish luck and good fortune.  \nSome assembly tips, to make the stocking I cut out two stocking bases and adhered them securely together all along the sides (leaving the top open ).  I used a sewing machine to pierce the holes around the cuff. The blue snowflake is also a cutting file from the Milk & Cookies collection and I made a solid red mat under the snowflake by offsetting the snowflake by a 0.100 factor.  Some added details are the enamel dots and a scalloped green border. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope you have fun crafting some holiday gift ideas!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:58.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "044228d5051c426cf5ddb8dd0a61a03f491076e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpgZqS8Hp5VC3nWvyBdpW49P2bnT7WanGI.LZtKK_Z4fw--", "site_full": "snewsi.com", "site": "snewsi.com", "site_section": "http://snewsi.com/rss/ABAPCBCNCSFOLANBNYREUTWPWS_SPOBUSPOLENTSCIHEATECGAMTRAOPISTREDUENVRELARTSTYCELFOOCRIOBIAUTWEALOCWOR", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "sNEWSi is News", "title": "IRB Infra slides as CBI files charges", "title_full": "IRB Infra slides as CBI files charges", "published": "2017-12-07T11:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i.snewsi.com/og/default.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "044228d5051c426cf5ddb8dd0a61a03f491076e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpgZqS8Hp5VC3nWvyBdpW49P2bnT7WanGI.LZtKK_Z4fw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "IRB Infra slides as CBI files charges", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "irb infra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:58.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c22af4c18b0c338d42d9916e29e6d6b335eb517", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYDqSx6l4NqsvEI27puikv64", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "So... should I buy IOTA now?

The 7-foot center had 20 points and nine rebounds to support Russell Westbrook\u2019s triple-double, and the Thunder defeated the Utah Jazz 100-94 on Tuesday night. \nThe Thunder have won three straight, and Adams\u2019 offensive play has been critical. During the streak, he has averaged 22 points and 8.3 rebounds and made 28 of 34 shots from the field. \n\u201cThat\u2019s good, mate,\u201d the New Zealander said. \u201cGood stuff.\u201d \nThe two new stars did their parts, too \u2014 Paul George scored 11 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter and Carmelo Anthony added 14 points and eight rebounds. They also opened things up for Adams, and now, teams have been forced to decide whether to focus on Adams or on George and Anthony, two of the league\u2019s most capable scorers. \n\u201cThe reason why Steven is doing what he\u2019s going is because of Carmelo Anthony and Paul George,\u201d Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re patient on offense, Steven\u2019s going to get those opportunities. Steven\u2019s not doing really anything different from maybe he\u2019s done in the past.\u201d \nWestbrook finished with 34 points, 14 assists and 13 rebounds to register his seventh triple-double of the season. Oklahoma City outscored the Jazz 32-14 in the fourth quarter to complete a rally from 17 points down in the third. \nRookie Donovan Mitchell scored 31 points and Joe Ingles added 16 for the Jazz, who had won six straight and scored at least 106 points in each game. \nThe Jazz led 47-39 at halftime, and they opened things up even more early in the third quarter. A driving layup by Alec Burks put the Jazz up 72-55 as the Thunder continued to misfire on open shots. \nWestbrook closed out the third quarter strong and helped the Thunder cut Utah\u2019s lead to 80-68 by the end of the period. He scored 11 points in the quarter. \n\u201cRussell Westbrook, the MVP of the league, got going,\u201d Utah coach Quin Snyder said. \u201cI thought in the third quarter, he gave them a lot of energy and gave them points.\u201d \nOklahoma City cut the deficit to six points early in the final period before Westbrook re-entered the game after a brief rest. The Thunder finally took the lead on a layup by Westbrook with about four minutes remaining. \nAdams didn\u2019t put up big numbers late in the game, but he made a critical tip-in with 43.2 seconds left to put the Thunder up five. \nOklahoma City\u2019s defense \u2014 statistically one of the league\u2019s best \u2014 tightened up late in the game. Utah shot 30 percent in the fourth quarter. \n\u201c(Andre) Roberson\u2019s one of the best defenders in the league, Paul George is one of the best defenders in the league. Russell Westbrook turned it up defensively, and that\u2019s tough,\u201d Snyder said. \nThe Thunder now have won three straight close games after making a habit of losing them. \n\u201cWe stayed with it,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cTeams are going to make runs. It\u2019s about what you do when you get hit in the mouth. We learned our lesson, and we know that we have to continue to fight, and we did that tonight.\u201d \nTIP-INS \nJazz: Starters shot 13 for 25 in the first half, but reserves went 3 for 14. \u2026 Shot 60 percent in the third quarter. \u2026 Were outrebounded 46-35. \nThunder: Westbrook and Anthony combined to make just 3 of 13 shots in the first half. \u2026 Made 1 of 9 3-pointers in the first half and 4 of 18 overall. \u2026 Made 12 of 21 shots in the fourth quarter. \u2026 Westbrook was issued a technical foul in the third quarter. \nSTAT LINES \nGeorge and Anthony combined to score 19 of their 35 points in the fourth quarter. Westbrook had six points, five rebounds and four assists in the final period. \nHE SAID IT \nDonovan, on how the Thunder played in the first half: \u201cWe played hurried, we played rushed, we played like we were down by 20 points with five minutes to go in the game. That\u2019s the way we played the first half. Without question, from start to finish, I thought our defense gave us a chance tonight. We were very lucky in my opinion to only be down eight at the half. We could\u2019ve been down drastically more.\u201d \nUP NEXT \nThunder: Play at Brooklyn on Thursday. \nJazz: Host Houston on Thursday. \nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP \nMore NBA basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "westbrook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "anthony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy donovan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donovan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alec burks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russell westbrook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe ingles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andre) roberson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmelo anthony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donovan mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quin snyder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snyder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven adams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "host houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah jazz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oklahoma city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma city thunder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:58.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ea89343294e351415566e72f1185e96353b49f52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFebxItgpty0KKl8r1W1YZVloL4_HF4H6qWFALzm5.tQW04VaSX57fO5WG_BHCFq4cYz0uS6HcaD0WcAX61Z3a9pVSfEIXQRu0bebhMKVHGH1_CKIGqCGIx4A--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/sports-outdoors-accessories/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Sports Accessories With Best Price At Lazada Malaysia", "title": "LP Support 710 Hinged Knee Stabilizer", "title_full": "LP Support 710 Hinged Knee Stabilizer | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2016-05-16T10:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.228, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d767bdb1d5449b990094b3c65f9916d694c60be7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFebxItgpty0KKl8r1W1YZVloL4_HF4H6qWFALzm5.tQW04VaSX57fO5WG_BHCFq4cYz0uS6HcaD0WcAX61Z3a9pVSfEIXQRu0bebhMKVHGH19U1aelmlk3IyFJ2.z1GvsB", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Adam Shiman", "published": "2017-11-16T06:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "Quality assured", "text": "Packed in original LP packaging.

Last year when a soft-spoken lobsterman rose to his feet and challenged us at Spruce Head Community to seek a shepherd who would lead us and love us, we began praying and seeking to that end. The seeking and the finding has united us, and we are blessed to have welcomed a godly man and woman who are living small-town life alongside us, all the while holding forth the Word of Truth.\nWinn Collier is also a small-town pastor, but with Love Big, Be Well: Letters to a Small-Town Church , he\u2019s wearing his fiction-writer\u2019s hat. Nonetheless, his heart for ministry comes shining through along with a clear-eyed affection for Christ\u2019s body, communicated through the character of Pastor Jonas McAnn.\nThe pastoral search committee of Granby Presbyterian Church had grown tired of searching, weary of interviews, and fed up with the pretense when Amy Quitman, resident of Rural Route 28, took matters into her own capable handwriting and penned a letter that wrapped itself around one question:\n\u201cDo you actually want to be our pastor?\u201d\nFormalized by four signatures, the letter went forth to all future candidates.\nIn a half-hearted search of his own, Jonas McAnn saw in the letter a reason to reply with his own epistle, and finally, to leave behind his safe and predictable life in an insurance company cubicle, and to risk following his heart back into the trenches of pastoral ministry.\nWhat follows is a bundle of letters from Pastor Jonas to his flock, randomly spaced and warmly personal. They have landed on my doorstep as well with their revelation of one side of a \u201cspacious\u201d conversation between a man who knows he was not called into the pastorate to fix anything or anybody and a group of people who have committed themselves to contributing \u201cdisruptive input\u201d to each other\u2019s lives.\nWith engaging characters and a page-turning narrative arc, Love Big, Be Well is a satisfying read for the story alone. Shades of John Ames of Gilead and Tim Kavanagh of Mitford made me hope for a sequel to follow Jonas\u2019s return from sabbatical and future ministry at Granby Pres. However, at the risk of being banished to Wendell Berry\u2019s desert island of exile for finding a subtext where none was intended, I will share that I came away with valuable insights \u2014 not in the form of a treatise on ministry, but rather more like thoughts overheard from a corner table at Stu\u2019s Mud.\nThoughts on Calling Jonas came to life in Granby with the settled conviction that he was committing himself to a web of relationships:\n\u201cSo I committed my life to walking alongside people who I hoped to call friends. I committed to learning how to help people pray. I determined it would be my job to simply recount, over and again, that one beautiful story of how Love refused to tally the costs but came for us, came to be with us, came to heal us. . . \u201c \nThoughts on the Role of a Pastor Jonas McAnn came from a long line of pastors and proudly owned his heritage as one who fulfilled a unique and valuable role in the community:\nto \u201clive with people\u201d (42); to pray with them; to ponder Scripture with them; to \u201cspeak in good faith to other people who are trying very hard to listen in good faith\u201d (47); to receive the wisdom of God as \u201ca slow drip, not a sudden knowing,\u201d (60) and then to keep showing up where it will do the most good; to \u201cnot take a position\u201d when that is the most honest response; to take cues from the farmer who \u201ctend farms small enough to know and love, using tools and methods they know and love, in the company of neighbors they know and love.\u201d Thoughts on the Role of the Church Amy ruefully described Granby Presbyterian to a friend and managed to capture every other church in the process:\n\u201cUnfortunately, if you\u2019re looking for people to disappoint you, we will provide the material. In spades.\u201d \nEven so, under Jonas\u2019s leadership, the church was called away from a shiny and boisterous presence into a resourceful availability to clean up messes \u2014 with the humble admission that the church is called to go first in admitting to our own messiness. \u201cThis is why we need the church all the more . . . [for] the only thing worse than our failing to inhabit mercy and holiness would be our making no attempt at all.\u201d\nOn a practical note, the pastoral/congregational relationship gets off to a good start when the body is there en masse to greet and unload the moving van. From that point forward, the liturgy of even the most non-liturgical band of worshipers is one of \u201cshowing up, doing the work, being together.\u201d\nThoughts on Love Pastor McAnn\u2019s eponymous \u201cBig Love\u201d comes down to \u201csimply circling and staying near.\u201d It was God\u2019s big love that called Granby Pres. member Don Brady into the kingdom and that carried him through the rigors of cancer treatment as he wisely concluded:\n\u201cLove\u2019s the main deal.\u201d\nThoughts on Prayer When elderly Miss Nelson prayed over Don\u2019s cancer treatment, she reminded me that even when we do not know the will of God on a matter, there\u2019s nothing wrong with reminding Him of how much we love and need someone in our community.\nGiven my own uneasy relationship with prayer, I collect wisdom to keep me in the game. Jonas related a homely parable on prayer from a fruitless fly fishing adventure with Luther that left him flat on fishing, but tutored him in the practice of prayer:\n\u201c\u2018Why would anyone torture themselves with this galling pastime?\u2019\n\u2018I like how you\u2019re just in it. You\u2019re in the water, in the woods. Everything\u2019s happening around you.\u2019\nI\u2019ve concluded that my problem (aside from how I have no idea what I\u2019m doing on the river) is my focus on casting properly, on actually catching fish. Luther, however, comes to the river in a much different way. \u2018I like being in the water,\u2019 he explained, \u2018with the breeze and the scent and the solitude. Even when I don\u2019t catch anything, I come back different than when I left. \u2018\u201d\nJonas McAnn wrote letters to his congregation from a desire to pay attention and to help his people do likewise. He wanted to remind his readers that life together is good and it consists of shared stories \u2014 shared experiences that call us toward the Light. For anyone who is committed to this calling over the long haul, Love Big, Be Well is a benediction, a reminder that ministry is \u201cshot through with blessing,\u201d and a celebration of the dignity of the slow work of ministry in community.\n//\n\nThis book was provided by William B.

The Cessna Tests build upon ABWN's successful May 2017 proof of flight concept test performed in Roswell, New Mexico, which utilized two Boeing 767s and successfully demonstrated the ability of aircraft equipped with Infinitus Super Highway(TM) to act as airborne repeaters / routers to send and receive broadband signals from one aircraft to another. The proof of flight concept test also successfully demonstrated aircraft-to-ground communication, ground-to-aircraft communication, and aircraft-to-aircraft-to-ground-and-back communication.\n\n          Michael Warren, CEO of ABWN, said, \"Our collaboration with Mynaric in our upcoming Cessna Tests provides an important step in initiating our proprietary Hybrid Radio and Laser Communications System and moves us closer towards achieving the commercialization of our Infinitus Super Highway(TM). We expect this demonstration will confirm data rates between two airborne platforms that was not previously technologically possible.\"\n\n          \"We are proud to work with Airborne Wireless Network in this significant milestone in the eventual realization of full operational status of its Infinitus Super Highway(TM),\" said Dr. Markus Knapek, Board Member of Mynaric.\n\n          Through its July 25, 2017 patent application, ABWN is seeking exclusive rights in the method of synchronizing laser links between aircraft in flight for use in its proprietary Infinitus Super Highway(TM) technology. ABWN will be using this method as a roadmap to attempt to exponentially increase data transfer speeds for the ABWN's contemplated Infinitus Super Highway(TM).\n\n          The Mynaric Flight Laser Terminals being used for ABWN's Cessna Tests will test the interruption of the laser link to further validate ABWN's Hybrid Radio and Laser Communications System. The Cessna Tests are being designed to prove that \"self-synchronizing\" and \"self-restoring\" airborne laser links are feasible and practical. ABWN presently anticipates that it will be able to conduct the Cessna Tests and a larger airborne test involving up to 20 commercial aircraft during the 2018 calendar year. If successful, ABWN would seek to complete the hardware and software development in order to launch Infinitus Super Highway(TM).\n\n          About Mynaric \n\n          Mynaric (formerly Vialight Communications) is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to establish dynamic communication networks in the air and in space. Its wireless data transmission products include ground stations and laser terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly over long distances at high speeds.\n\n          Mynaric recently completed its IPO raising over EUR 27 (USD 30) Million. Mynaric trades on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under ISIN DE000A0JCY11 | symbol M0Y\n\n          For more information see: www.mynaric.com \n\n          About Airborne Wireless Network \n\n          The Company intends to create a high-speed broadband airborne wireless network by linking aircraft in flight, called the Infinitus Super Highway(TM). The Company expects that each aircraft participating in the Infinitus Super Highway(TM) network will act as an airborne repeater or router, sending and receiving broadband signals from in-flight and ground stations, creating a digital information superhighway in the sky. The Company intends the Infinitus Super Highway(TM) network to be a high-speed broadband internet pipeline to improve coverage and connectivity. The Company does not intend to provide retail customer coverage to end users, but, instead, act as a wholesale carrier with target customers, such as internet service and telecommunication providers.\n\n          Currently, the world's connectivity is achieved by use of satellites, undersea cables and ground based fiber, among other sources. The Company believes that the Company's Infinitus Super Highway(TM) may be a solution to fill the world's connectivity void and enhance the world's connectivity. Once the Infinitus Super Highway(TM) network is developed and fully implemented, it may provide low cost, high-speed connectivity to rural areas, island nations, ships at sea, oil platforms, commercial and private aircraft in flight, in addition to internet service providers and telecommunication providers.\n\n          For further information see: www.airbornewirelessnetwork.com \n\n          Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: \n\n          This release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

They said KBL has been giving opportunities to non-residents from other counties. PROTEST They sat outside the gates of the plant for the better part of the morning in protest. KBL, part of the East African Breweries Ltd, plans to open a Keg brewing plant in Kisumu next year. The factory is currently being built. The Sh15 billion plant has given hope to jobless locals on the prospects of securing employment. But the company said it would announce plans on how it will recruit staff. Earlier, the firm said the new plant would provide up to 110,000 new jobs. JOBS \nDeputy Governor Mathews Owili said jobs that can be sourced locally should be given to locals. \n\u201cWe are going to formulate a committee that will recruit residents for the opportunities that the EABL plant will provide,\u201d said Dr Owili. \u201cThe committee will comprise of representative from the county government, office of the area MCA, MP and two members of the community.\u201d Dr Owili said the workers should do a fresh registration with the proposed committee to root out claims of biased recruitment. \n\u201cWe want to know the total number of people and skills they have for recruitment. The office will be situated outside the premises for fair recruitment of our people,\u201d he said. Railways MCA David Arao said the company should give 70 per cent of the jobs to locals when the plant is complete.

However, Naver Search Ad is very different from Google AdWords, so if you are to succeed, then you need to learn how to use it properly. \nHere are three things you need to be aware of if you want to succeed at PPC on Naver. 1. Languages and location targeting \nGoogle AdWords supports 43 languages, and allows advertisers to target countries all over the world. On Google AdWords, you can target very specific locations, such as cities or the radius around a business. \nIn contrast, Naver Search Ad only supports the Korean language and the location targeting options are much more limited. You can target 17 regions within South Korea, and there is also an \u201cOutside Korea\u201d option. However, this cannot be broken down into regions or countries. 2. Where ads are shown \nOn Google, adverts show on the search results page, above the organic results. Up to 4 ads can appear here. They can also show on the Google Search Network and the Google Display Network, if these options are selected by the advertiser. \nIn contrast, on Naver, ads can appear on the search results page, Naver search portal, Naver search partners and content sites. Within the search results page, up to 10 ads can appear in the Power Link area near the top of the page, and up to 5 ads can appear in the Biz Site area near the bottom of the page. 3. Match types \nOn Google AdWords, there are the following match types: exact match, phrase match, broad match (and broad match modifier). \nOn Naver Search Ad, however, there is only one match type \u2013 exact match. Therefore, when you conduct keyword research for Naver, you need to add as many relevant keywords as possible. However, there is an option called Keyword Expansion (Beta), also known as Keyword Plus, which basically functions as a broad match, bringing in search terms which are related to your keywords. \nI hope this has given you a useful introduction to Naver PPC.

Temperatures going from freezing to simply cool can cause water mains to expand and contract, putting stress on vulnerable areas. This stress can cause water main breaks that disrupt water service and traffic. You can track active water main breaks and real-time status updates using the tracking tool at Fairfax Water at this link .\n\nWater from Fairfax Water is distributed through approximately 3,200 miles of water mains to the county\u2019s homes and businesses. It is a lot of piping to keep track of. You can also help Fairfax Water by serving as their extra eyes. If you see water coming from the ground or street, then notify Fairfax Water by: Emailing watermainbreak@fairfaxwater.org  or calling 703-698-5613, TTY 711. Though much of that distribution system in Fairfax is newer than the national average and Fairfax has a good repair and replacement strategy, they still have about 600 or so water main breaks a year and their repair crews are very busy during the winter months.\n\nAlthough winter weather is often the cause of breaks this time of year, there are a number of reasons water mains break. The age of the pipe often affects its vulnerability to breaks. Changes in water pressure within the pipes, vibrations caused by construction or heavy traffic, or changes in soil conditions caused by erosion or flooding can all lead to water main breaks.\n\nIn an emergency, having a supply of clean water is essential and should be part of a winter emergency kit. If there is a water main break or power outage (pumps are necessary to move the water through the piping system) you could have your water supply disrupted. Now is a good time to store emergency water: \nStore at least one gallon of water per person per day for a minimum three-day supply. Be sure to account for pets; dogs and cats typically need one gallon each per day.  Store water in a cool, dark place in your home. Replace water every six months and be sure to check expiration dates on store-bought water. Use of food-grade water storage containers, such as those found at surplus or camping-supply stores, is recommended if you prepare stored water yourself. Be sure to disinfect the storage containers first.  In case of a blizzard you might also want to store extra food in the winter so that you can wait until the roads are clear to go out.

This paper looks at the use of spectral evidence during the Salem witch trials and examines whether its use was legitimate and in accordance with the evidential standards of the time (1692). Ultimately this paper finds that the use of spectral evidence was legitimate as it followed the slim guidelines available at the time. The court followed a strong precedent and the limited statutory guidance and instructions that were available. However there was acknowledgement at the time that spectral evidence was limiting the rights of those accused and was leading to unjust convictions. As such these trials invoked an acknowledgement of more modern standards of evidence. Therefore spectral evidence was legitimately used given the guidelines of the time despite the unjust effect that it had. \nDownload the paper  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rebecca eaton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eaton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "victoria university of wellington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria university of wellington legal research paper", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "salem", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:59.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "049d671a2a2d2232a5b56354b95d9d8b96590de3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYA2kG.yUWx_CivPA6ZNdilI", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "Okay I'm tired of this shit biz", "title_full": "/biz/ - Okay I'm tired of this shit biz - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T13:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b4d0479cb323161405a48d0a7f48fbc3628c7200", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYA2kG.yUWx_CpMKMKMMZvnWT2lEaGJJal8-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">audible crypto\nbut how? i thought all cryptos have transaction history", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:59.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ca3418ca34cc5542e40ac2f1de23bdd88b7d8f8f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRjqLEK5IXQp9PMZCHADAqILiOTgE1jSgBbblWxwJ.GJ0I.z0EYH39GOAYi3AWghzrqZj7pGD0h_b2yMPnfahJl8U4zAQxLTmOSW1LtYkaThn_4PzZ4WpRJ", "site_full": "patient.info", "site": "patient.info", "site_section": "https://patient.info/forums/discuss/browse/mirtazapine-2945", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Mirtazapine.

Once you go through the door, it opens into a pink disco wonderland.\n \n \n \n \n \nBecause i never anticipated getting MOIC tickets, I left my ice cream truck purse and heels at home! Fortunately I had my Can\u2019t Clutch This Sprinkle purse with me! (The timing of that clutch release was fortuitous)! The dress is from ASOS. I loved the color and the sequins, and happened to pack it.\n \n\n \n \n \nTo showcase the LA location, they put a lot of Hollywood touches into this room.\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \nA whole wall of banana leaves in yellow and pink? Life was excellent indeed.\n \n\n \nPink and white stripes? I was in heaven.\n \n\n \nI brought my friend Jenn along, and we swung madly in this metallic banana hallway.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "catherine luceyassociated press  was", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2aa5aab379fad999e1238555a46a1cb97e6ac664", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpMe7Ak9m68yGq6fUz9dsSO6dC4x5Vdctc7.Pl17Mau7Hx3DxKhfHk5NLDBz9e4v2RojVP66izzSHuDAbBWRGeUOqNsYLsogdzOgkCwFlNLyw--", "site_full": "blog.firebrandtalent.com", "site": "firebrandtalent.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Job seekers: tips to find your ideal job without the struggle", "title_full": "Job seekers: tips to find your ideal job without the struggle", "published": "2017-12-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.147, "main_image": "http://firebrandtalent.com/wp-content/uploads/DMooney071217.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2aa5aab379fad999e1238555a46a1cb97e6ac664", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpMe7Ak9m68yGq6fUz9dsSO6dC4x5Vdctc7.Pl17Mau7Hx3DxKhfHk5NLDBz9e4v2RojVP66izzSHuDAbBWRGeUOqNsYLsogdzOgkCwFlNLyw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Job seekers: tips to find your ideal job without the struggle", "text": "Back Job seekers: tips to find your ideal job without the struggle In my line of work, I see a lot of job seekers who\u2019ve become frustrated with the job search process. Often I see them when they\u2019re at breaking point after sending out 100 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with nothing to show for it . What they often don\u2019t realise is that by using just one strategy to find a job (i.e. the advertised market) they\u2019re severely limiting themselves. For many of us, this isn\u2019t the most effective way to find work. When you want a new job and you\u2019re coming up blank, you\u2019ve got to be willing to throw everything at it and try a different approach. Here are my top tips for job seekers who want to find their ideal job without the struggle: Be willing to do what other job seekers are not This isn\u2019t as scary as it sounds. It\u2019s actually one of my favourite strategies because the easiest way to get a job. Pitching to a hiring manager or picking up the phone to invite someone for coffee, are things that most people simply don\u2019t do. Why? They all involve some degree of discomfort. I see job seekers spend hours on a job application but they won\u2019t take five minutes to call an employer about a job ad. If you can get past the discomfort, which only lasts a few seconds, you will be one of the very few people who do this . You also get to find out if the job is actually right for you before applying. Plus you\u2019ll have an opportunity to build rapport with the hiring manager to see if this is someone you want to work for. True story: I once called an employer about a job ad that had closed. I was kicking myself that I\u2019d missed it. The job had already gone to another candidate but the manager told me about another role that had not yet been advertised (I got the job). Always, always pick up the phone . Become a serial coffee dater I highly recommend you start asking strangers out for coffee . It may feel slightly awkward the first couple of times, but when you\u2019re looking for a new role, you need insights from people in the industry. I also believe that way more job offers are made over cups of frothy latte than at interviews \u2014 and for good reason. If I was going to hire someone, I would much prefer a casual coffee meeting than a formal interview , where it\u2019s sometimes hard to get a sense of what people are really like. If you reach out to a hiring manager, many will take the time to meet with you \u2014 if you approach them the right way. Reaching out to others for advice and insights on their experience is a sure sign that you\u2019re a highly motivated individual, and that\u2019s attractive to employers. Believe in what you can\u2019t see One trap that\u2019s easy to fall into when you apply for jobs through the advertised market is the belief that your job search is a zero-sum game. It\u2019s easy to have a scarcity mindset when you\u2019re seeing so few jobs being advertised and you know you\u2019re up against hundreds of applicants. The competition is real when you\u2019re answering a job ad, but you\u2019re not seeing the full picture. Advertised roles represent only a fraction of the opportunities that are out there. When you believe in what you can\u2019t see, it\u2019s easier to put yourself in situations where you\u2019re the only candidate under consideration. Make it into a game I know job hunting is a long way from being fun. But there are ways to make it more enjoyable and when you loosen up, things seem to flow a little more easily. I learned a trick from a mentor to help you think more creatively . You come up with three ways you could tackle a goal or challenge. For example: What are three ways I could approach this employer? Prepare for my interview? Or design my r\u00e9sum\u00e9? What are three ways I could get this person to say yes to my request? I always come up with a lot of new ideas whenever I do this exercise. If you do it every day, even practising with mundane things like what to cook for dinner, it helps to build your creative muscle . Try it and see how you go! What\u2019s been your most successful job search strategy?

The panel\u2019s goal is to collect input from across the state about barriers some people face to accessing the voting booth. That information will then be passed along to the federal commission, which will compile it with input from other states to create a national report. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be true to no taxation without representation, I think everybody in this country needs to be able to vote,\u201d Norris Henderson told the panel. He\u2019s the executive director of Voice of the Experienced (VOTE), an organization founded and run by former prisoners. \nOne woman, a PhD student at LSU, says her research shows that in Louisiana, there are fewer polling locations and voting machines in both poorer and African American communities. \u201cWhen you have fewer voting machines, you have longer wait times. People may see the lines and decide not to vote,\u201d Jhacova Williams said. \nOthers, including a Democratic state senator, says laws stood in the way of voter turnout, including one blocking voting rights for those on probation. \u201cTo be able to participate as any other person would, it seems to be fair to me,\u201d said Sen.
