Scott \n4.5 Stars **** 1/2  \nRelease Date: December 7th \n\n\nEverest\u2026\u2026the name conjures up thoughts of a mighty mountain in Nepal that is majestic, magical, breathtaking and deadly\u2026 all in the same breath.  Ethan Everest is all of those things in human form\u2026\u2026majestic, handsome, charismatic, wealthy and deadly.  In college he started a social networking website that brought him wealth and fame but because of a choice he made one night, and in classic Robert Frost words of taking the road less traveled, he chose the well-traveled path instead, which led him to mistrust, lies, suspicion and most of all regret of a chance lost with a girl named Singer. \nSinger Davis is sunshine on a dark and cloudy day.  She is the calm in a storm and is warm, caring, and a beautiful soul inside and out.  She is a choice that Everest had a year ago and never took.  If the truth be told Everest fell in love with Singer that one night a year ago and has never forgotten her.  Now a second chance has come his way with Singer and he will not be denied.  He will not fail this time.  He will take that path less traveled and it will now make all the difference in his life.  \nEverest is a heart pounding sexy romance with enough mystery woven in to hold any reader to the very end. It\u2019s a story of second chances, hope and fulfilling dreams. And yes, some misery as well.   Ms. Scott has created very real, deeply flawed, but extremely complex characters and an intricate story.  You love everyone, from the supporting characters of Aaron and Lars and beloved Melanie to our wonderful main characters Ethan and Singer.   Yes, the story starts out slow\u2026\u2026\u2026.very S.L.O.W. (thus my \u00bd star short of a 5 star rating) and Ethan\u2019s indecision at times in the beginning can drive the reader crazy.  I wanted to pull my hair out and ask him \u201cwell do you want to date her or not???\u201d  The same thoughts Singer was having.  But I do believe the author had reasoning behind this foundation building beginning.  We needed to understand where Singer and Ethan had been and where they were coming from.  And that understanding is what has made this book a beautiful love story of hopes and dreams (and of course some hot and sizzling but truly romantic sex!!!)  \n\n\nHang in there past the slow start and just like me, you will be amply rewarded with an unbelievable love story, one that you will not put down till you get to the wonderful ending.  I promise you! \nS.L. Scott is a former high-tech account manager with a journalism degree pursuing her passion for telling stories. She spends her days escaping into her characters and letting them lead her on their adventures. Live music shows, harvesting jalapenos and eating homemade guacamole are her obsessions she calls hobbies.Scott lives in the beautiful Texas hill country of Austin with her husband, two young sons, two Papillons and a bowl full of Sea Monkeys. Her novels include Naturally, Charlie, Good Vibrations, and A Prior Engagement. \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "diane \u2665 everest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s.l. scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diane   everest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s. l. scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melanie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert frost", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethan everest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "everest", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "everest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nepal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:31.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0195736d8b070cbb9b4851c712e4424e3f3131b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYCuIk8eytDCqOyRsyM1MXLp", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp;

fossil fuels for transportation, British researchers have managed to create a sustainable fuel using beer, as a key ingredient, that can probably end humanity's reliance on petrol. Lead study author Duncan Wass from the University of Bristol said, \"The alcohol in alcoholic drinks is actually ethanol - exactly the same molecule that we want to convert into butanol as a petrol replacement.\"\"So alcoholic drinks are an ideal model for industrial ethanol fermentation broths - ethanol for fuel is essentially made using a brewing process,\" Wass added.It is also important to know that ethanol is not an ideal replacement for petrol as it has issues such as lower energy density, it mixes too easily with water and can be fairly corrosive to engines.The researchers have been working for several years to develop technology that will convert widely-available ethanol into butanol.This has already been demonstrated in laboratory conditions with pure, dry ethanol but, if this technology is to be scaled up, it needs to work with real ethanol fermentation broths.\"If our technology works with alcoholic drinks (especially beer which is the best model) then it shows it has the potential to be scaled up to make butanol as a petrol replacement on an industrial scale,\" Wass stated.The technology used to convert ethanol into butanol is called a catalyst - these are chemicals which can speed up and control a chemical reaction and are already widely used in the petrochemical industry.The findings indicated that their catalysts will convert beer (or specifically, the ethanol in beer) into butanol.In demonstrating that catalysts work with a 'real' ethanol mixture, the team has demonstrated a key step in scaling this technology up to industrial application.Another advantage of this approach is that it is quite similar to many existing petrochemical processes.The research appears in Journal of Catalysis Science and Technology.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "duncan wass", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ani", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "university of bristol", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:31.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "068e25ca9fe5a58e3a81b1ea7be446f7e176290d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeLDLpeLZQsIFjkk9JIx506.ab5wNZlHKwU8PvyCG9BECl0CYi84VqPRteILHd2LClFMqgKd2fC2bEVGo2oshCptcLcRJeaHpUpGtB0576CJWox.mkQCPJTKUtlLnx0c9HroRcquKay81YT.F7gEiBLtmkTUhbgyxN8uc2neJXT8c-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/sports-outdoors-accessories/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Sports Accessories With Best Price At Lazada Malaysia", "title": "Portable 230V AC Electric Air Pump For Inflatable Air Bed Sofa Swimming Pool", "title_full": "Portable 230V AC Electric Air Pump For Inflatable Air Bed Sofa Swimming Pool | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2016-12-13T04:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 53, "participants_count": 52, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.061, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cef7887b7b4a6d291fa0ca713292df8d85ad610f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeLDLpeLZQsIFjkk9JIx506.ab5wNZlHKwU8PvyCG9BECl0CYi84VqPRteILHd2LClFMqgKd2fC2bEVGo2oshCptcLcRJeaHpUpGtB0576CJWox.mkQCPJTKUtlLnx0c9HroRcquKay81YT.F7gEiBLtmkTUhbgyxNtJD3XvsmpCxrFVhMq5.oqA--", "ord_in_thread": 47, "author": "Nabilah", "published": "2017-11-15T03:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "senang", "text": "Pump senang di gunakan. cuma wayar agak pendek utk smbg pd wall plug, kena pakai extension..Bunyi agak kuat sedikit.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:31.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44df3542b1d46d83bffe646101c04633b5b85c7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9bvn7cJ8CAtIQrQyclafQ9yS2BmtKAr6_vNZQE7wJkudN1zYdcHkGGiEbeVLHzkJVOuw5jIxBgtv46PnjQmqDpaKV6lbYjNMw1HE_zr5.EwQ--", "site_full": "www.mauldineconomics.com", "site": "mauldineconomics.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "", "title": "Germany's recent elections could mean trouble for Europe -

Business Insider", "text": "print \nGerman Chancellor and leader of the German Christian Democrats (CDU) Angela Merkel, standing with leading members of her party, speaks to the media in the early hours after preliminary coalition talks collapsed following the withdrawal of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) on November 20, 2017 in Berlin, Germany. Sean Gallup/Getty Images Germany has long been the economic and political center of Europe. But the recent elections saw big losses for the mainstream Christian Democrats and Social Democrats and gains for fringe parties of the left and right. The centrist parties will need to change if they want to hold off more extreme parties. \nGermany has the fourth-largest economy in the world and the largest in Europe. \nThis country has been the stable center of the European system for decades. Amid social and political tensions that have torn the European Union since 2008, Germany has been the solid rock on which Europe has rested. \n(I wrote about the origins of European geopolitical issues in my exclusive e-book, The World Explained in Maps , which you can download here ) \nIt is not an overstatement to say that if Germany destabilizes, the EU won\u2019t survive. Germany has not yet destabilized, but it is wobbling. The political ground in Germany has shifted \nOne sign is the inability of German parties to form a new government since elections in September . \nA reason for this is that Germany\u2019s political reality has shifted. Both the CDU and the SPD lost roughly 20% of their seats in parliament in the election. The Christian Social Union in Bavaria, the CDU\u2019s long-time partner, lost about the same. And the two left-wing parties, the Greens and the Left Party, gained hardly any. \nMeanwhile, the right-wing Alternative for Germany, or AfD, gained 93 seats to become the third-largest party in parliament, taking most of its votes from the CDU and the SPD. \nIn addition, the Free Democratic Party, a traditionally liberal party dedicated to free markets with a minority euroskeptic faction, became the fourth-largest party after failing to win any seats in the previous election. \nThis is not an earthquake, but the ground has shifted. \nThe CDU and the SPD can still form a grand coalition, but to date, they have been unable to do so. There are, as in all political matters, many reasons for this, but the deepest reason is that the CDU and the SPD have evolved into effectively the same party. \nThey have governed together, sharing the same Europhile ideology and holding similar views on the role of Germany and the manner in which German society should be run. The two major political parties have failed to provide the German public with different visions of the country\u2019s future, and different views on the matters that concern Germans, like the EU, immigration and social programs. The emergence of new marginal parties \nAs a result, other parties have emerged. \nThese parties are too small to expect to govern, and so they don\u2019t necessarily need to hold positions that have broad appeal. Instead, they have carved out niches with views designed to bring together fragments of German society. \nNone of these parties will rule, but together they constitute the only opposition to what are called the mainstream parties. \nThe problem is that the mainstream consists of many lesser streams, and the subtleties of even the governing coalition have been forgotten. This is one factor that has led to resentment toward this political hegemony. \nThe marginal parties attract not only fellow ideologues, but also those who are repelled by the decline in debate between the major parties. The SPD therefore is being very cautious in accepting a place in another coalition government. \nGermany needs mainstream parties that debate and disagree, not a hegemonic center that generates revolts from the margins. A looming political earthquake \nPolitics is seldom interesting from a geopolitical perspective. \nWatching the personal ambitions of various political figures rarely reveals the underlying social realities. But we live in a time when politics in the United States , the United Kingdom , Germany, and other countries reveal the deep social tensions that must be addressed. \nThe anger between factions is real, and bringing it to light is the only way to address it. \nGermany is not Angela Merkel, although she has skillfully built a political center that claims to speak for the whole country. But Merkel has also created an opposition that is now challenging the center on a range of issues. \nWhen a grand coalition ignores the dissenters or pretends that they are merely cranks, the ground under the coalition weakens. There is, in fact, a great debate in Germany over the country\u2019s future on issues from the role of German culture to the welfare state. \nA grand coalition brushes these matters aside, and the more it does that, the more the political system and social reality will diverge, until the earthquake inevitably arrives.

This is the second time it is taking off the support after it did it previously for the official YouTube app on these devices. Since the removal of the official app, Amazon was making use of YouTube's web version to deliver content to users but with the latest announcement, this will be ending soon as well. YouTube has stopped working on Echo Show immediately and it will stop working on Fire TV after January 1st . \nThe reason behind the move is the ongoing battle between the two tech giants where they refuse to support each other's products and services in one way or another. Talking about the decision to remove YouTube support, Google said that it is willing to work with Amazon but it is the eCommerce leader which is not reciprocating in the correct way. It said that Amazon has refused to Google Chromecast and Home devices and even Prime Video app does not support Chromecast functionality. The app itself arrived at Play Store earlier this year after a long wait and was restricted to Amazon's app store previously. With no Chromecast support, many Android users are not able to enjoy the content on bigger display. To make things worse, Amazon stopped selling a few of the Nest products on its website recently. \nHere is what Google said in the official statement, \n\"We've been trying to reach an agreement with Amazon to give consumers access to each other's products and services. But Amazon doesn't carry Google products like Chromecast and Google Home, doesn't make Prime Video available for Google Cast users, and last month stopped selling some of Nest's latest products. Given this lack of reciprocity, we are no longer supporting YouTube on Echo Show and FireTV. We hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon.\" \nOther than these reasons, Google is said to have decided to take the decision because Amazon opted to use a hacked version of YouTube instead of working directly with it. \nIn response, Amazon said, \n\"Echo Show and Fire TV now display a standard web view of YouTube.com and point customers directly to YouTube's existing website. Google is setting a disappointing precedent by selectively blocking customer access to an open website. We hope to resolve this with Google as soon as possible.\" \nWhile both giants seem to be struggling to reach a mutual point of understanding, we will keep you updated.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon echo show", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon echo show and fire tv google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "planos  google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google chromecast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "play store", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google home", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:32.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "183573cc648ed87deb255775a0be9d1e271aba3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.NZzuKWe7xFxPZJn4S3B4LSOVFyaRPY..rXNS30i19OXu2i7Z05CzEt9dQL6Bia_xIw6VidIL7vg--", "site_full": "www.michellespaige.com", "site": "michellespaige.com", "site_section": "http://www.michellespaige.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Michelle's Pa(i)ge | Fashion Blogger based in New York", "title": "GIFT GUIDE: 10 GIFTS UNDER $50", "title_full": "GIFT GUIDE: 10 GIFTS UNDER $50", "published": "2017-11-27T15:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "31fab6df1b614413753d2d1cce48112988bb58a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.NZzuKWe7xFxPZJn4S3B4LSOVFyaRPY..rXNS30i19OXu2i7Z05CzEt9dQL6Bia_zWP8A9M_jIXAG4AL0Fx4w4", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "PrintLand SEO", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "What a beautiful and colored dress!

I knew he'd be my fave! I love a moody brooding grumpy arse hottie and Chaz Jones wrote the rule book on that! I love him!! ~Kerry A is for Alpha B is for Books Chaz \u2013 \n\u201cYou need to answer your phone, man. Shit is blowing up left and right here. We have a month to finish the album before the tour launches. Marcy\u2019s bailing on us because her dad is sick. We\u2019ve hired a new road manager, and I\u2019m stressed as hell. You\u2019re either in or you\u2019re out. I\u2019m not kidding this time, Chaz. Either your ass is at my house and ready to record in two days, or you\u2019re out\u2026We need you, okay? The band isn\u2019t the same without you. After playing Grant\u2019s message a second time, I thought about my options. Go to Austin or move on. I wanted to go, but was worried things would be different. How could they not be? Thanks to Chelle, my life was a fucking mess. My rhythm was jacked to hell. To an outsider, a messed up beat didn\u2019t compute. It wasn\u2019t like losing a set of keys or misplacing a cell phone. A drummer without rhythm was like a writer with no words, an artist with no vision, a singer with no voice. It was essential to life, like breathing, sleeping, or eating. Without it, I felt like a stranger in my own skin, and all because I let that crazy bitch into my life. Even though I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t place all of the blame on Chelle. She might have lured me in with her magic pussy, but at the end of the day, it was my decision to stay. I believed the lies. I kept going back for more. Hell, I went back even after I had questions. What did that say about me? Nothing good, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019d always been loyal. In fact, I prided myself on my loyalty to my fellow bandmates. Yet, I\u2019d put that lying bitch ahead of my friends. Lesson fucking learned. I was an idiot who probably deserved to live my life in this rhythmless bubble of silence. I\u2019d been in this place once before, but that was a time I tried not to think about. A time where things were so dark that I\u2019d lost my desire to play and questioned my reason for being. I\u2019d been helpless back then, lost, suffocating\u2026dying a slow death. I tried to tell myself this was different. I was a kid then. I had no control over what happened. Too bad this didn\u2019t feel different. It felt exactly the same. That period in my life nearly broke me. Not this time. This time I would work through it. As much as I\u2019d like to forget, the memories were always there, like harbingers from hell. Always. Fucking. There... Mom married Don six months from the day we met. For my ninth birthday, they threw me a surprise birthday party and invited my entire class. I thought I\u2019d struck gold. In a way I had, because that\u2019s when Don gave me my first drum kit. The drums came with lessons from a guy who knew his shit. Not only did he teach me how to play, but he taught me that part of the reason I had trouble focusing was that I had such a strong internal rhythm. He taught me ways to tame the energy constantly thrumming through my body. For over two years I lived that golden dream, and then Don got demoted. Getting demoted on the police force was a big deal, at least for Don it was. Everything changed after that. My music teacher was let go and my life went to shit. Fucked up became my daily existence. It remained that way until I turned eighteen. I thought about the difference between now and then. I was a man now. I\u2019d taken my shit life and turned it into something to be proud of. I had more money than I knew what to do with. I had a career that most people would die for. Nash accused me of being closed off. Nash didn\u2019t know shit. He was in. They all were. I disliked people in general, but the guys\u2026they were different. I missed the laughter. I missed the bitching. I missed my life. Most of all, I missed the music. I guess I had my answer. For better or worse, it was time to go back. RB Hilliard lives in Charlotte, North Carolina with her husband and two children.

Strength and Conditioning coach Sam Guy spoke to the Falmouth Packet to explain. \nGuy is one half of fitness company Cornwall High Performance, and he and colleague Rob Smaldon have been working with Falmouth Town since the start of pre-season after being approached by manager Andrew Westgarth. \nGuy said: \u201cI guess in his [Westgarth\u2019s] mind he wanted the boys looking sharp and fit for the start of the season. We did two hours a week, one hour per session. We did between 12 and 16 sessions over pre-season and then we\u2019ve carried it into the season as well.\u201d \nSo what needs to go into a fitness session for a group of footballers? \nGuy said: \u201cFootball has a ton of changing direction, jumping, back-pedalling and lateral movement, tonnes of short mini-sprints and obviously having to maintain that for 90 minutes. So the sessions are geared around the physical demands of the sport. \n\u201cThe first 10 minutes are geared towards really good movement and jumping and landing properly because that underpins everything that happens on the pitch. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll then move into some speed work, starting with movement mechanics like sprinting, changing direction and accelerating properly, with correct body and arm positions. \n\u201cThen we\u2019ll get on to moving fast, so that might be acceleration over 20-25 metres, recover, repeat, so it\u2019s got a real speed element to it, and making sure that the lads are maximising their outputs on speeds. Then we finish the session with aerobic work.\u201d \nThe team has slowly begun to adapt to the gruelling sessions through repetition, but it had proved a shock to striker Rob Wearne, who re-joined the club in October following a short spell at St Austell . \nGuy said: \u201cRob Wearne has come into it and he said to me at the end of the session, \u2018Mate, I\u2019ve not done anything like that in a while!\u2019. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a repeated thing, it\u2019s not \u2018oh five sessions will fix it\u2019, it\u2019s repeatedly doing it that makes you effectively a better team.\u201d \nTown are certainly enjoying the fruits of their labour this season. \nThey have scored 21 of their 52 goals in the final 30 minutes of games \u2013 including five goals in the final 23 minutes in their recent 6-2 win at Callington. \nWestgarth said: \u201cWe score a lot of our goals at the beginning of the game and at the end of the game so it shows that we\u2019re good for the 90 minutes. \n\u201cI think if we were losing then they [the players] wouldn\u2019t buy into it because they\u2019d just think we were beasting them for the sake of it, but I think when you\u2019re winning, they see the benefit of it.\u201d \nAssistant manager Charlie Davis also championed the benefit the improved fitness levels have had on the mental side of the game. \nHe said: \u201cIf you become fatigued then the first thing to go is your decision making. If you\u2019re still feeling fresh or fit then you\u2019re more likely to make that good decision, and that\u2019ll be exaggerated if other teams are feeling a bit tired. \n\u201cLast season in the latter stages of games somebody would go and do a short corner and they would execute it really poorly and actually they haven\u2019t thought about the ramifications if it goes wrong. \n\u201cWhereas this year you expect them to set that corner up really well and go through all the bits we practised in training.\u201d \nSo the goal statistics and the feedback from the coaching staff show that there has been a clear impact on the players\u2019 improved fitness levels, but why has this happened? \n\u201cThe number one aim is to be as efficient and move as well as possible and this is the improvement that has happened. All of the pre-requisites and running mechanics that we do focus on optimal movement, which is why the lads are fitter because there\u2019s much less energy wasted,\u201d said Guy. \nDavis believes that other clubs at South West Peninsula League level will follow suit. \nHe said: \u201cI imagine it will be a trend over the next couple of years. Each year a team is trying to do something a little different and try to be a little bit more professional. The boys play on nice pitches and get nice tracksuits, and I think this is that next bolt-on really. \n\u201cIt\u2019s filtering down from the professional game that people are starting to realise the impact of being fit, and at our level where the football can be hit and miss, if at least you can work hard you\u2019ll always give yourself a chance of being competitive.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam guy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob smaldon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew westgarth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westgarth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob wearne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "falmouth town", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south west peninsula league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornwall high performance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st austell", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south west peninsula league premier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "callington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:33.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb173e7f37b249321e8e8be2607ce5d3af38dc50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGSdzMXLn52mnz2n8d1QgEgWMnhQQHovum9", "site_full": "www.pistonheads.com", "site": "pistonheads.com", "site_section": "http://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/forum.asp?h=0&f=108", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_cars", "vehicles", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Video Games - Page 1 - PistonHeads ", "title": "Destiny Xbox Players -", "title_full": "Destiny 2 - Xbox Players - Page 10 - Video Games - PistonHeads", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8486, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb173e7f37b249321e8e8be2607ce5d3af38dc50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGSdzMXLn52mnz2n8d1QgEgWMnhQQHovum9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "RemaL", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Destiny Xbox Players -", "text": "Not been on destiny 2 for a while and went on last night for a few hours.\nWow I am amazed how the update to 4k has made a huge difference to the graphics.

As we await an 18:9 display on the device which was previously spotted on TENAA , we have got another leak which gives us a hands-on preview of the Xiaomi device. \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 5 is expected to feature a 5.7-inch 2:1 display with a screen resolution of 1440 x 720 pixels with a 12MP primary snapper at the back. The entry-level Xiaomi device will be powered by the Snapdragon 450 SoC with 3GB of RAM and 16GB onboard storage . \nIt\u2019s surprising to see that XIaomi plans to offer the 2:1 display for the budget minded folks. This means the Redmi 5 will equip ultra-thin bezels which were first adopted by flagship device at the start of this year. Being the most successful lineup in the company\u2019s history, Xiaomi isn\u2019t shying away from bringing an almost bezel-less design to the smartphone. \nThough the latest video doesn\u2019t give us a peek into the display since all we see is the rear end of the device, the footage shows the Redmi 5 in Gold and Black variants . There\u2019s a single 12MP primary camera on the front which confirms that Xiaomi would only install the dual camera setup on the more expensive Redmi 5 Plus. \nIf Xiaomi manages to pack all this in a more durable build at the expected price of around $136 , we don\u2019t see it have any reasons for not being a hit.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "xiaomi redmi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "redmi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:33.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebcbdfb38fccdf33d03c3bda3b8cfb855b33d278", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVgFg1upPBCWHn7vgpLkpAy9wNpHWBlRiiHSp5B_bRw55lVvcVnVeAsoiaGT7BUh2fNiFiLBPBXVmjUvCjo6Q45lxcSTIc7xIg--", "site_full": "www.expedia.es", "site": "expedia.es", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.es/Collierville-Hoteles.d55089.Guia-Viajes-Hoteles", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "213 Hoteles en Collierville baratos con Expedia.es", "title": "Big Cypress Lodge", "title_full": "Big Cypress Lodge (Memphis, Estados Unidos) | Expedia.es", "published": "2017-10-18T06:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26131, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be9da7ae234e185316d46fb6507e01377406daa7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVgFg1upPBCWHn7vgpLkpAy9wNpHWBlRiiHSp5B_bRw55lVvcVnVeAsoiaGT7BUh2fNiFiLBPBXVmjUvCjo6Q45HJS4ASaReG9FiarwVSvT3D0IqTKRgYRRKMrWndm9DdA--", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-15T01:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Well it was okay.
