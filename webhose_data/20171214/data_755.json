May 2018 just can't come quickly enough. While the nuptials of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge certainly had more of an impact on the royal family, we might actually be more curious to see how things go for Meghan and Prince Harry. After all, we won't just be watching two people come together, but two cultures will be combining as well. The United States and United Kingdom may seem to be very similar countries; however, there are actually quite a few differences between the two when it comes to wedding traditions. Thanks to globalization, the UK is starting to adopt some American traditions, but many continue to hold strong.  \nGranted, not all of the British wedding customs apply when it comes to royalty, and Meghan may choose to respect the status of her fianc\u00e9 by embracing the practices of his homeland. However, for us commoners who find ourselves involved in a wedding across the pond \u2013 or one where the marriage is between a Brit and a Yank \u2013 it may be useful to keep these facts in mind: \n\n1. Couples living in Great Britain do not have as many pre-wedding activities as those in the United States. While they do have bachelor and bachelorette parties (called stag nights and hen dos, respectively), they do not hold bridal showers or rehearsal dinners. \n2. British brides will buy their bridesmaids' dresses, while American bridesmaids usually purchase their own. \n3. Typically American guests are invited to all parts of the wedding: ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception, while British weddings have an A-list and B-list. Acquaintances or unknown dates for the B-list are only invited to the evening portion of the celebration. \n4. Female guests at weddings in the United Kingdom will don elaborate hats or fascinators, which is uncommon attire in the United States.  \n5. British bridal parties are usually smaller than those in the United States, and instead of a maid of honor, a bride selects a chief bridesmaid. The bridal party precedes the bride in the US, but follows the bride in the UK. British bridesmaids sit during the ceremony, while most American bridesmaids stand beside the bride throughout the service. \n6. The United Kingdom has ushers, not groomsmen, and they do not walk in with the bridesmaids. In the US, sometimes they do and sometimes they walk in alone. \n7. In the UK, the groom traditionally faces away from the bride until she gets to the altar. \n8. It is very uncommon for British couples to write their own vows, since the majority of the population weds in the Church of England, which follows a strict script. \n9. While in the United States it is frowned upon for the best man to tell embarrassing stories, he\u2019s actually supposed to roast the groom in Great Britain. The maid of honor (or chief bridesmaid) in the UK does not give a toast like in the US \u2013 only men give speeches in British weddings. A British groom is liable to give a full speech, instead of a brief toast thanking the guests, like in the States. \n10. There is generally no grand entrance to the reception in the UK, especially for the bridal party. \n11. Americans can have pretty much whatever flavor they want for cake, while traditional English weddings have fruitcake. \n12. While both countries engage in the bouquet toss, only the United States has a garter toss as well. \n13. Having an open bar is very uncommon in the UK, while a cash bar in the States can be considered gauche. \n  \nRelated more :  https://pinkpages.com.au/evdressau-melbourne-1/11341146/listing \nhttps://www.quora.com/Where-can-you-get-prom-dresses/answer/Kitty-Smith-32?prompt_topic_bio=1 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "meghan markle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meghan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "duke", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:48.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c6a84334ed40637a40b762d2e34bd302ad4ee7ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyUjF4s1om.9A2ZGhtO2eL2iJh6UjV29VcaaaqpNKMMLXX_.JnuEC9Kq1yAEbCMXJ2EJap_gtcaUQ--", "site_full": "forums.timezone.com", "site": "timezone.com", "site_section": "http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=threadt&frm_id=4", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "TimeZone : Public Forum", "title": "What's the fastest you've ever flipped a watch back out?", "title_full": "TimeZone : Public Forum \u00bb What's the fastest you've ever flipped a watch back out?", "published": "2017-12-07T01:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.657, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 58223, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ceba1fad61fc216c6e9a1d2b87713fa46f502bd3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyUjF4s1om.9A2ZGhtO2eL2iJh6UjV29VcaaaqpNKMMLXX_.JnuEC9Kq1yAEbCMXJ1Ce9QwGJMDIvMax3jo7xz8", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "Boba Fet", "published": "2017-12-07T06:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Re: There was a TZer who flipped a watch while it was still in transit to him.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:48.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c6a84334ed40637a40b762d2e34bd302ad4ee7ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyUjF4s1om.9A2ZGhtO2eL2iJh6UjV29VcaaaqpNKMMLXX_.JnuEC9Kq1yAEbCMXJ2EJap_gtcaUQ--", "site_full": "forums.timezone.com", "site": "timezone.com", "site_section": "http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=threadt&frm_id=4", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "TimeZone : Public Forum", "title": "What's the fastest you've ever flipped a watch back out?", "title_full": "TimeZone : Public Forum \u00bb What's the fastest you've ever flipped a watch back out?", "published": "2017-12-07T01:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.657, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 58223, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "710f11cf392d19a919da1849b40bd32542c27eb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyUjF4s1om.9A2ZGhtO2eL2iJh6UjV29VcaaaqpNKMMLXX_.JnuEC9Kq1yAEbCMXJ1Ce9QwGJMDIuo_m.Ei5YNR", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "yardbird", "published": "2017-12-07T03:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Re: What's the fastest you've ever flipped a watch back out?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:48.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b091506a28db17c3a253a08135f4a3b10533900", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p5IYyUcv2ZgXcXhwZTOeglLCrYzL5cBNe", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/hc/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/hc/ -

Funding comes through CPB\u2019s American Graduate program, which is focused on supporting community-based solutions to educate youth and improve high-school graduation rates. \u201cThe 21 st century economy requires a skilled labor force that is able to compete on a global scale,\u201d Senator Capito said . \u201cIt is critical that young West Virginians, as well as their parents and teachers, realize the enormous opportunities a STEM education can provide. This funding allows West Virginia Public Broadcasting to help prepare our children and our state for the future.\u201d \u201cWe turn to our public broadcasters for our news and entertainment, and I\u2019m excited to now see the Corporation for Public Broadcasting invest in the workers of West Virginia.

Share prices were mixed in Asia on Thursday, with Japan and Australia leading gains after U.S. indexes stabilized overnight. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu) Vincent Yu Save \nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 European stocks were higher while some Asian markets recovered from the previous day's losses on Thursday as investors focused on the U.S. tax reform and an upcoming U.S. jobs report. \nKEEPING SCORE: Britain's FTSE 200 rose 0.3 percent to 7,366.77 while France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent to 5,383.07. Germany's DAX gained 0.2 percent to 13,028.86. Futures augured flat opening on Wall Street. Dow futures remained unchanged while S&P futures added 0.1 percent. \nASIA'S DAY: Asia closed mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5 percent to 22,498.03 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5 percent to 5,977.70. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed earlier losses, adding 0.3 percent to 28,303.19. Most other regional benchmarks fell. The Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.7 percent to 3,272.05 and South Korea's Kospi lost 0.5 percent to 2,461.98. Stocks in Southeast Asia were mixed. \nANALYST'S VIEW: \"Asia equity investors found themselves standing in a sea of pain at yesterday's market close and are likely breathing a sigh of relief that both EU and U.S. equity investors appear a bit more level-headed for the time being,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading at OANDA. \nTAX: The U.S. Senate voted to begin negotiation with the House to reconcile their two tax bills on Wednesday in a sign that they can iron out differences. Republican leaders are pushing to send a final blended package to President Donald Trump to sign before Christmas. \nGEOPOLITICAL ISSUES: Market reaction was muted to President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, ending decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on the issue. In other global developments, the British and Irish prime ministers spoke, seeking to overcome a logjam in Brexit talks, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. \nU.S. JOBS: A report from payroll processor ADP showed private employers added 190,000 jobs last month, slightly better than expected. The report comes two days before a government jobs report, among the last key economic indicators before the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. \nOIL: Benchmark U.S. crude recovered slightly. It added 7 cents to $56.13 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the contract sank $1.66 to settle at $55.96 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 29 cents to $61.51 per barrel. It lost $1.64 to $61.22 a barrel on Wednesday. \nCURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 112.66 Japanese yen from 112.27 yen while the euro weakened to $1.1790 from $1.1796. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Honda protege Nobuharu Matsushita set the initial pace in the afternoon session, leading the timesheets with 1m37.359s before improving to 1m36.864s. Laptimes tumbled in the final quarter of the session, with Kamui Kobayashi dispatching Matsushita to rise to the top of the standings. However, it was Nakajima who ended the day fastest, taking advantage of a 15-minute session extension to lap the circuit in 1m36.089s. The two-time Super Formula champion\u2019s lap was good enough to edge Koudai Tsukakoshi\u2019s morning benchmark of 1m36.143s by just 0.054s. Former Japanese F3 runner-up Tomoki Nojiri was classified third, while 2013 Super Formula champion Naoki Yamamoto made it three Honda-powered cars in the top-four. Amid a late flurry of improvements, Kobayashi and Matsushita got shuffled down to fifth and sixth respectively, the duo separated by less than a tenth of a second. Nirei Fukuzumi was classified seventh, 0.146s adrift of fellow Honda junior Matsushita. Defending champion Hiroaki Ishiura finished just 0.009s behind in eighth, while Nakajima Racing duo Narain Karthikeyan and Takuya Izawa completed the top 10. James Rossiter returned to the cockpit of a Super Formula car for the first time since quitting the series in 2016, the Englishman ending 12th after taking over Andre Lotterer\u2019s TOM\u2019S car. Indy Lights race winner Felix Serralles made his SF debut after missing Tuesday's action, propping up the timesheets in 21st after causing a red flag in the morning session. In all, the second day of test saw no fewer than six interruptions, which led to the aforementioned extension of the afternoon session by 15 minutes. Renault Academy driver Oliver Rowland, who had mentioned Super Formula as an option for 2018, received a late call-up to drive for Team LeMans in the final hour, but was unable to do so due because of issues with seat fitting.

Although cosmetic surgery should not be the first option, talking to a surgeon can help you decide if you want to go through with this important choice.\nGet your doctor to explain the antibiotic situation to you. You probably have to take this type of medication prior to surgery to reduce your risk of infections. Get a second opinion if your surgeon does not plan to prescribe antibiotics.\nAlways consider https://www.newbeauty.com/blog/dailybeauty/10709-real-housewife-erika-jayne-beauty-secrets/ before choosing cosmetic surgery. In place of surgery, there may be less-invasive treatments that can improve your appearance. You may be able to resolve problems by visiting a dermatologist, using cosmetics or using over-the-counter medications and other at-home remedies.\nPlastic surgery will always require at least one day of recovery. Many times the recovery period will be much longer. Ensure that you have planned these days out, including who will assist you and especially how you will maintain your expenses when you are away from work and salary.\nScarring is one of the side effects from surgery that you should understand. Many people are not informed about just how painful the post-operative period can be. You need to be mentally prepared for pain during your recovery in order to heal more rapidly.\nInquire about the risks and how your surgeon plans to minimize them. Research the topic by yourself to ensure your doctor\u2019s honesty; think about your surgery even more carefully when you know risks involved.\nOne very important thing to consider when deciding on whether, or not to have plastic surgery is to determine what the risks are. This is very important because, you want to make sure that your health comes first. You don\u2019t want to put yourself in a position for any potential health hazards.\nConsider having cosmetic surgery overseas. Plastic surgery in the United States can cost double, or triple the amount you would be charged in India. Doctors in many countries are just as well trained as U.S. doctors, sometimes more so. Research the clinic, and doctor you plan to use, either in the U.S. or overseas.\nWhen considering cosmetic surgery, it is important that you read reviews about potential surgeons that you will go to. This is critical in making sure that your overall experience goes well. Talking to, and reading reviews from former patients is one of the best ways to get real world advice.\nAsk about https://www.today.com/health/more-women-are-having-their-breast-implants-removed-or-downsized-t104783 in advance, and be sure to watch out for hidden fees. The surgeon\u2019s cost is not the only one in the equation. There are also fees for the use of the operating room, the anaesthetic, and the implant itself if one is being used. Ask about final walk-out-the-door costs.\nIt is not a good idea to undergo cosmetic surgery during a time of emotional duress. It will take you tons of energy to recover from the surgery, and this will be a lot more difficult if you\u2019re emotionally unwell. A slow recovery time could worsen your emotional health.\n\nAsk about charges for follow-up appointments to check on your healing status. Your surgeon should offer some number of follow-up appointments as part of the cost of the surgery. Generally, follow-up appointments and consults to determine the need for revisions are free inside of the first year after the procedure.\nDo not select a surgeon to do your procedure just because he is quoting you the lowest price. You need to weigh other factors before making a decision. Keep in mind that this will affect your entire life. Getting a discount should not be the highest thing on your list of priorities.\nPlan so that your life is not overly demanding for the two weeks immediately after your surgery. When you consider cosmetic surgery, it is not as simple as taking a day off, and then going right back to work. Factor in recovery time. Also as having someone available to help you if, you need assistance for a few days.\nKeep in mind that your body will age and that the cosmetic surgery will become more obvious with time. For example, breast implants will look funny on a 60 year old. Be sure that you will still look great, even though you\u2019ve had the surgery.\nCosmetic surgery is a process that requires more than one decision. Each should be handled with care, as the repercussions of any one choice can resonate within your life for years, if not decades.

Zenabi90 said: \u2191 I sincerely believe this forum to be absolutely instrumental in my success this go around, so let me add what I can. If it can be of help to a single person, then it will be worth the time and effort to post. I will be slightly re-ordering the questions because it seems to make more sense to me this way.\n5) What was your undergraduate major?\nMicrobiology (3.1 from Univ Calif NorCal)\n7) How long did you study for the MCAT?\nSept 2017 - 4 weeks dedicated (everyday except Sundays, from 8am-9pm). Factor in 30 min lunch break, 60 min exercise break, 30 min dinner break and that's 11 hours of studying daily May 2012 - 5 months, poor work ethic, concurrent classes\n1) Your individual scores and composite score\nSept 2017 - 517 (95%) : 129 (92%) / 129 (95%) / 130 (97%) / 129 (91%) May 2012 - 27Q (61%): 8 (55%) / 10 (84%) / Q (86%) / 9 (56%) 3) What materials you used for each section(Kaplan, TPR, Examkrackers, AAMC, TBR, etc)\n2012 exam: Kaplan and TPR. What an utter failure I was, but the material didn't help at all. Second go-around I settled on TBR because I thought I needed (and could handle) the depth. It was worth it. Whatever I needed to read twice or more in Kaplan/TPR was clear and concise in one reading of TBR so it actually SAVED time.\nC/P - TBR. So many people will state that it is just the best. I have actually used Kaplan, TPR and TBR and I can say that TBR is the best at C/P for me. By a long long margin. CARS - None - GOLDEN RULE plus being a broad reader Read 10-20 books every year since I was in middle school. 10 year Time subscriber More research journals than I can count Free Sunday newspapers for last 6 years it's not about the amount you read, but HOW you read B/B - TBR P/S - TPR P/S + TBR Psych\n2) The study method used for each section\nJust went through the books thoroughly. Had a composition notebook for each content book, plus one for error logs. Anything that seemed like it was high yield or important went into the comp book. I think one thing I did right was to go through the practice problem without looking at the solution or process. Just bang at it until I got it right, and then look at what TBR did. TBR did it a better way almost every time, but banging at it cemented how much better TBR's methods were and I was more likely to remember to do it TBR's way when it was better. C - Went through book thoroughly. P - Went through book thoroughly. Memorized all the formulas, and all the special kg/m/s unit conversions (like for N is kg*m/s^2 etc) for unit analysis CARS - None. Considered it my only strength from 2012. My sample exam proved it to me. Key here isn't the amount I read, but HOW I read. Immerse yourself, pretend you are the author. What main idea are you trying to get across? How are you supporting it? Is it a strong position or weak? How would you go about strengthening your position or attacking it? Argue against the author, argue for the author. If it's a creative work, how would YOU have changed or written it and would it make it better or worse? Quick example of personal opinion: Harry Potter lost a lot of people and went through a lot but never had to make a conflicted choice. His choices were easy and clear cut, and thus made his character rather boring towards the end. I was 8 when HP came out, and 17 when I read the last one. As a reader, I matured in that time. When I finished HP, that's what I was thinking afterwards. You should challenge yourself to read ACTIVELY and CRITICALLY Use the Golden Rule - oh I said that already? I'll say it again because it is the single best useful test-taking strategy I've come across for CARS. None of that rank the passages, rank the questions fluff that just waste your precious time without giving you a concrete strategy for every question. Wrong is wrong, least wrong is right 100% of the time. Note it isn't \"most right answer is the best answer\" that has been taught for decades in primary and high school. We don't live in the land of \"choose the best answer.\" We live in the land of \"choose the least bad answer.\" Remember that when a passage and questions are submitted, there has to be 100% clear reasons why answer choices are wrong or right. There aren't grey areas that are open to interpretation. Use this to your advantage . If any part, and I mean ANY part of the answer choice is wrong, RIGHT CLICK TO STRIKETHROUGH and read the next choice. Don't even finish reading the answer choice once you read something wrong. Even if its 100 words and its 99% correct, that 1% wrong makes the choice 100% wrong , not 99% right. B/B - Memorized the cycles by literally drawing them out DAILY forwards and backwards. Substrates first, then added enzymes, then added inputs/outputs like ATP and H2O, etc. Also memorized the amino acids using my own made up table template by writing it out daily. P/S - I actually mapped out which TPR chapters go with which TBR chapters and combined my readings. Please memorize Piaget and developmental milestones. Nearly no one cares about Freud anymore as he's mostly fallen out of favor. 4) Which practice tests did you use? (Optional: include scores)\nI only made time for 1 at the start pf my review. My low GPA means I need a stellar MCAT (515+) for any solid hope at MD/DO, especially considering this could potentially be seen as a \"retake\" AAMC Sample Exam (unscored) 94.75% : 78% / 96% / 85% / 80% 517: 129 / 131 / 128 / 128 via Reddit-source calculator It really looks like I didn't improve at all Realize that the general consensus is that the Sample Exam is 5-10 pts easier/inflated, so a \"517\" could easily be a 510 or 505, especially if you've somehow seen the content before I interpret this as: In 4 weeks, I managed a 5-10 point improvement. I would also compare my percentiles to my 2012 exam, and I am not ashamed to state how proud I am to have moved up from 56-61%ile to 92-97%ile\n6) Any other tips you may have for those of us who still have this test lurking over us?\nGeneral prep tips:\nClean yourself up. If you take care of your body, your mind will thank you for it. I went on a strict meal-prep diet for the four weeks I prepared, with only Sundays as cheat days I cut out coffee completely and while the withdrawal sucked, after 2 weeks I was functioning better without coffee than I was with the coffee. Controversial yes. I will always advocate for it. You can slowly add it back in towards the end, but only to jump start your morning Daily exercise: 15 minutes light aerobics and stretches in the morning, 60 minutes in the afternoon. Pretend every day is exam day: Wake up at 6, start your studying at 8. Wear your earplugs whenever studying and toss the phone in a drawer. Better, deactivate your social media. You grew up without it, you'll get by without it. Get your optimal sleep (for me, it's 7.2-7.5 hours) every single night. So I was off my phone by 10, in bed with lights out and eyes closed by 10:30 General Materials Tips\nUse Amazon. Buy all the different companies books but NOT as a box set. Individually. Then COMPARE. Whichever you like, keep. The rest, return to Amazon and get all your money back. You used to just be able to compare books in an actual bookstore. Amazon killed them all, so take advantage of them. TBR books sell on SDN generally for 70-90% of their original value, even older editions. EK1001 books will eventually be worth their weight in gold. Probably. You'll recoup most of your investment if you want to, just don't mark up your books and don't mess them up. Keep Error Logs. Any time you do discretes or practice problems or practice tests, fill in your error log. Question, answers, what you answered, the correct answer, why you think you got it wrong (gut reaction), why you think you got it wrong (24 hr later reaction), subject and concept tested (like Physics - Optics - TIR or CARS - best supports author's arguement). Every few weeks, search for patterns. Study Tips\nDon't be wasteful with your time. A strat or book isn't working for you? DITCH IT. Get a fresh perspective immediately. If you've read it twice or thrice and the concept still doesn't make sense, the explanation sucks. It's not that you're stupid or tired. You wouldn't be prepping for an MCAT if you were stupid (only if you're masochistic). So assuming the basic premise that you aren't an idiot and read it carefully, if it doesn't work the first 2-3 times, stop. Remember \"Einstein's\" Quote: on insanity. Use YouTube, use Coursera, use your friends or former professors. That's why we have networking and Wifi networks, FaceTime and screen-sharing. The foundations for success are made with careful planning, but don't stress if your plans go awry. Be flexible. If you fall behind or race ahead, adjust accordingly and get back to work. Life happens. Family happens. Bad days happen. Roll with the punches Read SN2ed's collection of threads, KoalaT, and MCATjelly. And I mean every single word. I printed out the threads and highlighted important things coalesced them all together to make the ultimate study plan. I'm 99% sure it would wreck if I still had to use it. But their reasoning and rationale for things answer so many of the questions I see get posted on this forum. Exam day tips\nVisit the testing center before test day. Talk to the staff about their procedure, temperature of testing area, etc so you can be prepared. Bring coffee, don't drink it. You don't need it for the first section, your sympathetic system will be all you can handle. Save it for your lunch break to combat the post-prandial coma. Green bananas constipate you. I ate green bananas the day before and the day of. One small 5 in green banana every break. Guaranteed I didn't poop until the day after the exam. This is of particular help to those with short GIT transit times or IBS. I am both. Cured the constipation the next day with very ripe bananas. Don't take risks with your food. You should know your body by now. Keep up the clean eating. My personal approach is to treat it like a marathon or long hike. Solid high protein breakfast (2 scrambled eggs, 2 strips bacon, one sausage link, and a french toast triangle from my hotel's continental breakfast). I had 4 Clif bars, 3 small green bananas, 1 large Gatorade, and 2 bottles of water. I don't trust prometric water coolers because when was the last time they were cleaned? I don't know. Mine had ants crawling on it. A clif bar and banana on each break, ate an extra cliff bar during lunch break. Works well for me; energy dense and low residue. Some takers think they ought to conserve energy during breaks. I argue that sound body = sound mind. Refresh your body with sprints, body weight exercises, and stretches. I did jumping jacks in the hallway and full stretch routines to fill my time during breaks. I also exercised my eyes by focusing on very far away objects in the window and closed them for short periods to alleviate the eye strain. LAYER. I wore basketball shorts, warm up pants, T-shirt, light sweater. I was sweating on the way to the test center because Glendale was 85F at 7:30 am, and I was the perfect temperature inside the exam room. The exam rooms are often colder than the waiting rooms. Bring extra earplugs. Pee every break time. Twice during the long lunch break. I regretted not taking the second pee halfway through my bio section. DON'T VOID. Trust me, don't. I'll post my personal anecdote but I'm so glad I didn't void. Only void if you can say with absolute certainty you will score below a 500 (usually because you didn't finish a section). YOU CAN WRITE DURING THE TUTORIAL PERIOD. I used that time to write down my cycles and amino acid table (muscle memory) and physics formulas onto the provided scratch paper. Also included the list of strong acids/bases, and NMR/IR wavelengths and patterns (thank you TBR for patterns). It saved so much time later on in the exam since it was like having a cheat sheet right there.

A crew of men and women here use a machine to drop seedlings into the black soil. Another group follows behind, stooped over, tapping each new plant.</p> <p>It is backbreaking, repetitive work. Ten-hour days start in the cold, dark mornings and end in the searing afternoon heat.</p> <p>More than 90 percent of California\u2019s crop workers were born in Mexico. But in recent years, fewer have migrated to the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Researchers point to a number of causes: tighter border controls; higher prices charged by smugglers; well-paying construction jobs and a growing middle-class in Mexico that doesn\u2019t want to pick vegetables for Americans.</p> <p>As a result, the average farmworker is now 45 years old, according to federal government data. Harvesting U.S. crops has been left to an aging population of farmworkers whose health has suffered from decades of hard labor. Older workers have a greater chance of getting injured and of developing chronic illnesses, which can raise the cost of workers\u2019 compensation and health insurance.</p> <p>\u201cThe slowdown is happening,\u201d said Brent McKinsey, a third-generation farmer and one of the owners of Mission Ranches in Salinas. \u201cYou start to see your production drop, but it\u2019s difficult to manage because there aren\u2019t the younger people wanting to come in and work in this industry.\u201d</p> <p>After a long day hunched over, cutting and bunching mustard leaves, Gonzalo Picazo Lopez, a farmworker, said the pain shooting down his leg is acting up. Lopez has been working in the fields since the 1970s, when he crossed over from Mexico. At 67 years old, he looks timeworn, with silver hair and a white beard. Deep lines mark his face.</p> <p>As Lopez described how he carefully picks the leaves with his right hand and bunches with his left, he opened and closed his fingers with difficulty.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2015 my left hand started to hurt,\u201d said Lopez. \u201cI went into work one morning and my hand was cold \u2014 ice cold.\u201d</p> <p>Lopez is a U.S. citizen and has Medicare. He hopes to work for almost another decade, until his wife, who is 61 and picks broccoli, can collect her Social Security.</p> <p>Chronic pain is a common complaint at Clinica de Salud in Salinas. Nearly all of the patients at this community clinic are farmworkers. Many don\u2019t have health insurance and pay what they can for medical care. Those who have immigration papers, rely on Medicaid.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.csvs.org/SalinasCASanbornSTAFF.htm\">Oralia Marquez</a>, a physician\u2019s assistant at the clinic, said older farmworkers often develop arthritis, back pain, foot infections and breathing problems from pesticides.</p> <p>Many of her patients, like Amalia Buitron Deaguilera also struggle with diabetes. Deaguilera is 63. She has Medicaid for insurance, but she\u2019s losing her vision from the disease.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was working in fields,\u201d said Deaguilera, \u201cI never had time to take care of myself and my health.\u201d</p> <p>Workers in the fields who have diabetes often cannot take their insulin because they have no place to refrigerate it, said Marquez. And they miss doctors\u2019 appointments during the busy harvesting seasons because many don\u2019t get paid when they don\u2019t work.</p> <p>\u201cMost of our patients want just something to relieve the pain and to continue working,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of the time they don\u2019t ask for disability. They don\u2019t ask for days off. They say they don\u2019t have time to miss days.\u201d</p> <p>Field laborers often delay health care, and that can lead to serious medical problems. Compared to older whites, older Latino farmworkers are much more likely to end up in the hospital, according to researchers at the Central Valley Health Policy Institute at California State University, Fresno.</p> <p>Faced with an aging and dwindling workforce, Mission Ranches\u2019 McKinsey says farmers are trying to mechanize planting and harvesting to reduce their labor needs.</p> <p>But machines can only do so much, McKinsey said. You can replace the human hand in a factory, perhaps. But out here, the fields are bumpy and the winds are strong and you need people to bring the plants to life.</p>  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gonzalo picazo lopez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah varney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lopez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amalia buitron deaguilera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brent mckinsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oralia marquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deaguilera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mckinsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "khn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of labor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central valley health policy institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mckinsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henry j. kaiser family foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mission ranches", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaiser health news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "clinica de salud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fresno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salinas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:50.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6cd2a32fe7ec00a89a681a3aa2b9342ea8f78ffd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXQUkzLCKgQKwcoKdDd8PL6MSTMvOvLKrW9FJFSWZMidE0GyrJ.YEWaCDCHb3e6Se21h3HVyp0tfRMrw06i4O8hLYA08IeTstafAaoilPqipYDsV4cxp_q", "site_full": "stargazerslounge.com", "site": "stargazerslounge.com", "site_section": "https://stargazerslounge.com/forum/217-for-sale-swap/", "site_categories": ["science", "space_astronomy"], "section_title": "For Sale / Swap -

Three in 10 adults covered by Medicaid describe their health as \" excellent\" or \"very good,\" compared with 59% of those receiving employer- or union-based insurance and 51% receiving military or veteran's health insurance. Even the uninsured (33%) and adults covered by Medicare (40%) -- which predominantly insures adults aged 65 and older -- are more likely than Medicaid recipients to rate their health positively. U.S. Adults' Reports of Their Own Health, by Insurance Source Would you say your own health, in general, is \u2026 Medicaid 18 Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index \nThese results are based on 147,465 interviews conducted among U.S. adults aged 18 and older Jan. 2-Nov. 5, 2017, as part of the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index. Currently, 9.3% of U.S. adults younger than 65 receive their coverage through Medicaid. \nOne reason that Medicaid recipients may be less likely to report being in good health is that the system is designed for individuals with disabilities and those in lower-income households who cannot obtain health insurance elsewhere. According to Gallup/Sharecare data, 63% of those insured by Medicaid report a household income of less than $36,000 annually. Gallup research has found a link between poverty and poor health -- including much higher rates of physical and emotional health problems. ##SPEEDBUMP## \nMedicaid Population Plagued by Chronic Health Conditions \nAmong adults not covered by Medicare, Medicaid recipients report the highest incidence of chronic health conditions compared with all other groups. Over a third of adults on Medicaid are obese (36%), and a quarter say they suffer from depression -- the highest among all insurance groups. Additionally, Medicaid recipients (17%) are significantly more likely to have high cholesterol, trailing only those on Medicare (34%) and on par with those who have military or veteran's insurance (17%). \nThe uninsured are the least likely to report having high blood pressure (12%), high cholesterol (7%) or cancer (1%), likely due in part to their younger average age relative to the other insurance groups and the fact that they are not being diagnosed as part of regular medical treatment. Almost a third of uninsured adults (31%) are younger than 30, compared with 20% of adults with some form of health insurance coverage. Eight percent of uninsured adults report being depressed, on par with 7% of those with employer- or union-based coverage who say the same -- the lowest of all groups. \nAlthough fewer uninsured adults have been diagnosed with most chronic health conditions, just 33% report having excellent or very good health, with only Medicaid recipients rating their health worse. This may be because those without health insurance are less likely to afford doctor visits and are thus less likely to be diagnosed with and treated for chronic diseases. U.S. Adults' Self-Reported Health Conditions, by Insurance Source Uninsured 23 Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index \nThe Medicare population -- those aged 65 and older -- are the most likely of all insurance groups to report having high blood pressure (47%) and high cholesterol (34%) -- both conditions for which advanced age is a particularly strong risk factor. \nMedicaid Population Most Likely to Smoke \nOne reason that preventable chronic conditions plague the Medicaid population may be that they are much more likely than other groups to smoke. Over a third of Medicaid recipients (36%) say they smoke, compared with less than a fifth of those in other insurance groups. About three in 10 uninsured adults (31%) say they smoke. Health-Related Behaviors, by Insurance Source Uninsured Eat fruits and vegetables frequently 49 61 Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index \nMedicaid recipients are roughly on par with most other insurance groups in their self-reported healthy eating, frequent produce consumption and frequent exercise habits. The uninsured population is the most likely to say they frequently consume fruits and vegetables, while Medicare recipients are the most likely to say they eat healthy. \nImplications \nAmericans spend over $3 trillion each year on medical care -- about $9,000 per person -- making the U.S. an outlier even among other high-income countries. Despite spending the most on healthcare, the U.S. does not boast the best health-related outcomes. For example, the U.K. spends about $5,000 less per person on healthcare than the U.S. but has a higher average life expectancy and a lower infant mortality rate. Relative to other high-income countries, the U.S. ranks poorly on obesity, life expectancy and other chronic health conditions. \nThis new analysis suggests that focusing on preventive care for Medicaid patients may help them avoid chronic conditions before they start. The Medicaid population is about twice as likely as other insured adults to smoke and is more likely than all other insured adults -- as well as the uninsured -- to be obese. Working to reduce unhealthy habits that lead to chronic conditions can improve the health of Medicaid recipients while also decreasing program costs. Survey Methods \nResults are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, 2017, as part of the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index survey, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is \u00b11.0 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. For results based on the total sample of 7,457 Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is \u00b11.6 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. For results based on the total sample of 12,778 uninsured adults, the margin of sampling error is \u00b11.0 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting. \nEach sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 70% cellphone respondents and 30% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods. \nLearn more about how the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index works. \nGallup Analytics ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "medicaid", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "medicaid population reports poorest health medicaid population reports poorest health", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gallup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. adults' reports of their own health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gallup analytics", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "district of columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:51.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "639198d197bde4f6d5932a2dabe43237e23b5f36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWOQi7cXjLjSn4kcV2Wuv8q3lY9faLpKE4jTxYb_qhAPyttnClKVpaxXDA3jzUi_11lDXvnrPrg1PgFc5NiuTCRa1hxlVIv.ZryM1b5zMa8i8bXHplQqeIwhjHtAKpKa2ggbN0CjcGkhgLR0PxE7uiHi0xpqPZn.HHcrnE7MGiQi0-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-women-tote-bags/?spm=a2o4k.category-090103000000.0.0.SaY8qG", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Women's Tote Bags - Buy Women's Tote Bags at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Coconiey Fashion Women Shoulder Bag Satchel Crossbody Tote Handbag Purse Messenger", "title_full": "Coconiey Fashion Women Shoulder Bag Satchel Crossbody Tote Handbag Purse Messenger | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-04-21T15:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 21, "participants_count": 21, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.203, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cbb1ae7e9e440c6c7725c3ac1e1ade8a90a2694d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWOQi7cXjLjSn4kcV2Wuv8q3lY9faLpKE4jTxYb_qhAPyttnClKVpaxXDA3jzUi_11lDXvnrPrg1PgFc5NiuTCRa1hxlVIv.ZryM1b5zMa8i8bXHplQqeIwhjHtAKpKa2ggbN0CjcGkhgLR0PxE7uiHi0xpqPZn.HH.3m3yn7V10cvF4eWj.Y7eQ--", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "Sumathi", "published": "2017-11-27T05:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Four Stars", "text": "It is convenient to carry around in a casual manner.

Fortunately, there are advanced backup and recovery systems out there that can help you prevent such situations from happening. Clonezilla is one of them. Backup disks and partitions for later restoring Designed as an alternative to expensive disk cloning apps, Clonezilla is capable of creating backups for the entire hard drive or individual partitions. When disaster strikes, you can use Clonezilla's disk or partition image to put everything back to its place and retrieve your lost files. There are two downloading options Clonezilla offers: ISO and ZIP packages, each for different booting media: the first for CDs/DVDs or PXE servers, the second for USB flash / hard drives. Deployment is not difficult but a boot disk creating application (such as Tuxboot , LinuxLive USB Creator or Rufus ). Alternatively, experienced users can perform this operation manually. Create bootable disks and start creating backups Booting from the Clonezilla media opens a menu where you can choose the running mode for Clonezilla Live and run memory tests. The console data configuration options are displayed as you proceed, allowing you to select the keymap policy. There are two options you can choose from after running Clonezilla, namely to clone or restore a disk or a partition using a previously created image, or clone (backup) a disk or a partition. Obviously, when running Clonezilla for the first time, you must take the time to create an image, which can be stored in various locations, namely a local or external drive, a SSH / Samba / NFS / WebDAV / AWS S3 server, an OpenStack Swift server, or the local memory (existing '/home/partimag/'). The latter option is not recommended, as it can overwrite data and render your computer unusable unless you know exactly what you are doing. More experienced users will be happy to find out that there are some advanced parameters they can tamper with. Once the image is created, you can either enter the command line prompt, start Clonezilla over, as well as power off or reboot your computer to access the host operating system. The safety net you need for your computer Clonezilla enables you to clone disks and partitions, storing resulting images on a backup storage device of your choice. While there is no Windows interface to work with and intuitive wizards where clicking 'Next' is enough, Clonezilla does offer a good option for creating disk and partition backups and keeping data files intact in case you need to restore them.

The interface of the program is very plain and simple to navigate through. Pictures can be imported by using either the file browser or the \"drag and drop\" method. So, you can navigate back and forth within the photographs, switch to full screen mode, as well as zoom in and out. In addition, you can change the background color, disable borders and enable high quality stretch. But you can also create and play a slideshow, set its delay and transition (e.g. slide in, blend), as well as enable infinite loop and random mode. Furthermore, you can rotate, resize and crop images, add borders, apply effects (e.g. grayscale, brightness, contrast, red eye), convert colors, configure JPEG settings (e.g. add EXIF thumbnail), use the undo and redo functions, as well as rename pictures or convert them to PDF documents. On top of that, you can use a batch processing tool for resizing and renaming images, view file information, make file associations, enable FreeVimager to automatically run at system startup, allow multiple instances, disable auto-opening with external programs, and more. The application requires a moderate amount of system resources, has a very good response time and didn't freeze, crash or pop up errors during our tests. Unfortunately, there is no help file available and the interface is slightly outdated. Other than that, we strongly recommend FreeVimager to all users.

Under those circumstances, the thrilled Noelle will accept an invitation to a party by a handsome classmate she has a crush on, only to be lured into his room and be viciously assaulted. As she leaves the house a different woman, Noelle will accidentally kill her rapist on the following night, and much to her surprise, an unexpected surge of inspiration will gradually fuel both her stagnant artistic expression and her thirst for revenge on those who destroyed the lives of innocent women. Now, Noelle is a pitiless vigilante who uses her newly-found sex-appeal to serve her cause. Who says seduction is a dying art?

If you're dealing with GraphQL syntax on a daily basis or you're ready to learn more about this arguably game-changing technology, then you might want to get your hands on a specialized tool that can help you interact with the APIs and the GraphQL server better. Flexible and comprehensive, unofficial GraphQL client This is why you might want to take a look at Altair , a super-handy GraphQL client written in Angular that aims to offer a far more compelling package than the official GraphiQL or ChromeiQL clients. The application can be deployed by undergoing a hands-off installation procedure, and it also doesn't require much regarding configuration in order to get it up and running. As we're sure you'll agree, it looks rather modern and, overall, it's nothing short of user-friendly. Here's everything Altair has to offer To start off, we'll point out that it sports a tabbed interface which means that you can work on multiple projects at the same time. Of course, it also boasts a smart autocompletion engine and syntax highlighting which should help you cut down on errors even as you code. You'll also notice that the bottom right side of the main window is dedicated to the documents. Basically, this GraphQL client is capable of retrieving docs from the server, all while providing you with an intuitive way of searching for them. One of the app's main advantages over the typical GraphQL clients is represented by how much flexibility it brings forth when it comes to headers and response stats. In short, Altair allows you to set custom headers and effortlessly view the time taken to completion of various requests. Last but not least, the utility also provides support for GraphQL variables and fragments which can be added in the code editor and direct from the docs section as well. A fairly interesting take on what a GraphQL should look like To conclude, if you're looking to improve the way you work with GraphQL and you feel that the official clients offer a somewhat non-flexible functionality, then you should definitely check out Altair. Of course, there's a lot more development time that could be poured into Altair (more useful features and such), making it significantly better we're sure, however, it's still very useful in its current form.

Reuters Australia's Mitchell Starc celebrates with team mates after dismissing England's Stuart Broad during the fifth day of the second Ashes cricket test match. Reuters Previous Next Australia captain Steve Smith thinks England will struggle to get back into the Ashes series after losing in Adelaide to trail 2-0 heading into next week's third test in Perth. \nSmith admitted to some nerves when the tourists mounted a comeback after he decided not to enforce the follow-on in the second test but said it would now be a long road back for England in the five-match series after a 120-run defeat. \n\"It's always tough coming back from 2-0 down, particularly when you're away from home,\" Smith said. \n\"You're really only one or two bad sessions away from the series, really. That can really play on people's minds when you're behind. \n\"We have to be confident, we have to continue what we're doing, doing the basics really well, getting big first innings runs is crucial as we've seen, and just backing up day in and day out.\" \nFour reasons for Australian confidence were occupying row 13 of flight QF 740 from Adelaide to Sydney on Thursday with quicks Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins on one side of the aisle and off-spinner Nathan \"Gazza\" Lyon on the other. \nAlthough suggestions that the bowling attack is the best to have ever donned baggy green caps are probably wide of the mark, they have done their job by dismissing England twice in both the first two tests. \n\"I think the exciting thing is our bowling group can only get better,\" Starc told reporters on arrival at Sydney airport. \n\"Obviously we've taken 40 wickets over the last couple of weeks and done some really good things but there's still room for improvement.\" Australia's Mitchell Starc celebrates with team mates after dismissing England's Stuart Broad during the fifth day of the second Ashes cricket test match. Reuters Starc took 5-88 after mopping up the England tail with the new pink ball on Wednesday, while Hazlewood snuffed out hopes of an England win with two wickets, including that of captain Joe root, in the first three overs of the day.\nCummins crucially pegged the English back with the wicket of Dawid Malan on Wednesday night, while Lyon is the leading wicket taker in tests this year and his captain described his bowling in Adelaide as \"exceptional\". \n\"Paddy, Josh and I have grown up together -- Gazza's a bit older -= we've been around each other for a long time and we're really close mates,\" Starc added. \n\"I think that shows in the way we play our cricket and we're gelling really nicely and complementing each other really well. \n\"Gazza's bowling the house down at the moment and that allows the other three of us to just do what we do at the other end. Josh does what he does and allows Pat and I to bowl as fast as we want.\" \nSmith said he was keen for his bowlers and batsmen to get some rest before the Perth test starts next Thursday. \n\"There's a reasonable break between now and Perth so the bowlers can freshen up and the batters can freshen their minds, and we can come back and hopefully win the Ashes back in Perth,\" he added. \nThe test will be the last at the WACA and Starc said he was hoping to be presented with a bowling surface that harked back to the days when the likes of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson terrorised English batsmen in Perth. \n\"Hopefully we see a nice fast, bouncy wicket, the WACA of old, and get stuck into that as a bowling group,\" he said.

It allows more than one circuit to connect to another and often contains two long aluminum or copper strips designed to link different components. These strips create a bus bar for power distribution which is sent to the connected components. Terminal blocks are modular, insulated blocks which unite two or more wires and are usually made of an insulating body and a clamping device to complete the connection. They include a broad range of fixed-mount and pluggable European cage clamps, U.S.-style screw clamps, spring clamp-style wire-to-board and wire-to-wire blocks, and related headers. \nThe global terminal block market can be segmented on the basis of type, application, and geography. In terms of type, the market is divided into the following categories: barriers, sectional, printed circuit board (PCB), and power. The barriers segment is further split into the single row and double row divisions, the sectional segment into Nema (American style) and IEC (European style) divisions, and the PCB segment into fixed and pluggable divisions. Applications of terminal blocks include business equipment, HVAC, power supplies, industry controls, instruments, telecom equipment, and transportation. \nRequest Report Brochure @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=21506 \nThis market is driven by factors such as the increasing demand for multipurpose, multifunctional, intelligent, finger-safe terminal blocks; the ever-expanding PCB market; advancements in various connection technologies; and the product\u2019s growing adoption in the telecom sector. Industry controls and HVAC are estimated to contribute a major market share during the forecast period. Developments in termination technologies of terminal blocks intended for usage in more rugged applications such as instrumentation, industry controls, and data acquisition spur their growth. Rapid urbanization, rising disposable incomes, strict energy regulations, financial incentives through tax credit programs for energy-efficient HVAC systems, and technological innovations also play a part in motivating the HVAC industry which eventually fuels the demand for terminal blocks in this industry. \nBy geography, the market is distributed over North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and Latin America. The U.S. and Canada are expected to propel the terminal block market in North America. In Europe, countries such as the U.K., Germany, France, Russia, Spain, Italy, and Sweden are the leading players. China, South Korea, Japan, India, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore are likely to dominate the terminal block market in Asia Pacific, with China being a rapidly developing country. Israel, Turkey, UAE, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Saudi Arabia are some of the leading countries in the market in Middle East & Africa, whereas Latin America is dominated by Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. \nRequest For Customization@ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=CR&rep_id=21506 \nThe global market comprises numerous companies operating at regional as well as global levels.

Oscar campaigning is in full swing and Hugh Jackman is on the cover of Variety, a favourite read of Academy voters. Is Hugh Jackman a contender? In October, Sarah wrote about his chances and she decided that he doesn\u2019t have a shot. I don\u2019t think Hugh knows that. This Variety feature feels like campaigning to me. It reads like a really long For Your Consideration ad . That\u2019s not a bad thing. I appreciate Hugh\u2019s hustle. This feature details just how hard Hugh has hustled \u2013 from the first X-Men film all the way to The Greatest Showman. \nThe Greatest Showman is described in this piece as the \u201cbright and ebullient\u201d musical antithesis to La La Land\u2019 s \u201cdarker realism.\u201d They\u2019re pushing it as a \u201cjoyful and optimistic\u201d feel-good holiday movie. It\u2019s a smart sell, even if PT Barnum is problematic as f-ck . (Sarah\u2019s suggestion when I whined about really wanting to like this movie despite its historical inaccuracies was to pretend it\u2019s fiction so that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do). We all know how well La La Land went over with Academy voters. In my opinion, if Hugh should be nominated for anything this year, it should be Logan but The Greatest Showman is a big musical biopic lead by one of the most likeable men in Hollywood. It\u2019s more in line with the Academy\u2019s vibe. Hugh is putting himself in the conversation at a critical point in his career. \nVariety points out that this is the first time in that high profile career that Jackman does not have another X-Men or Wolverine film on the horizon. Hugh\u2019s got Jason Reitman\u2019s The Front Runner up next and after that, he seems to want to focus on musicals. With this admission, Hugh Jackman proves that he occupies a singular space in Hollywood. What other A-list leading man is a superhero AND a singing and dancing superstar? The only other person I can think of having similar range is Channing Tatum. But he\u2019s not Gambit yet and he\u2019s not a Broadway star either. Hugh Jackman is going to be fine no matter what he decides to do because he\u2019s Hugh Jackman but the exciting thing to me is that he could really do anything and it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise. \nAlso not surprising is the way people around Hugh Jackman talk about him. He\u2019s got a great reputation. He\u2019s like Tom Cruise in that he leaves everyone who meets him in awe of his kindness. In Tom\u2019s case, the sincerity of his generosity is often questioned. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case with Hugh. I produced Hugh Jackman on The Social (that time his co-star Taron Egerton fell in love with Lainey ) and I can confirm that he is exceptionally nice. He learns your name and looks you in the eyes and basically does the bare minimum decent thing a human should do when they meet new people but he\u2019s a celebrity so HE\u2019S THE NICEST MAN ALIVE. But actually, he\u2019s super nice. And Hugh swears it\u2019s not just for show. \u201cI also genuinely love the family aspect of what we do, and I feel more comfortable being relaxed and myself with everybody, rather than a feeling of \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a big actor; you can\u2019t talk to me.\u2019 My way of connecting \u2014 maybe people attribute it as being nice, but it\u2019s just being a normal person.\u201d \nThat normalcy is what makes Hugh so likeable. He\u2019s got a few weeks of promoting Showman to remind everyone how nice and normal he is. He\u2019s also a GREAT showman \u2013 on talk shows, on late night. If Hugh hustles hard, shakes enough hands and kisses enough babies, maybe his chances aren\u2019t as bad as we think. \nYou can read the full Variety feature here .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kathleen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hugh jackman", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jason reitman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "channing tatum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pt barnum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lainey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taron egerton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hugh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom cruise", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "variety", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "logan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broadway", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:54.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "301deed8f0718443dedd29896ea660dc064e7cd1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTJzPl2mPlS2mlTREPwQYWiqrxKiDEUx8zbQMJkihxahBUQO1JEXO_whQWDxZMSTylsSLaFsBRn_j3u.egqPc8qDxVN8mBazjeCmN05GY0L.sytYpnDyib", "site_full": "www.bellanaija.com", "site": "bellanaija.com", "site_section": "http://www.bellanaija.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "fashion", "style_and_fashion"], "section_title": "BellaNaija", "title": "Adamawa Lawmaker & Wife welcome Triplets after 24 Years of Marriage", "title_full": "Adamawa Lawmaker & Wife welcome Triplets after 24 Years of Marriage", "published": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Lawmaker-triplets.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 6355, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 577, "comments": 0, "shares": 577}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "301deed8f0718443dedd29896ea660dc064e7cd1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTJzPl2mPlS2mlTREPwQYWiqrxKiDEUx8zbQMJkihxahBUQO1JEXO_whQWDxZMSTylsSLaFsBRn_j3u.egqPc8qDxVN8mBazjeCmN05GY0L.sytYpnDyib", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BellaNaija.com", "published": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "Adamawa Lawmaker & Wife welcome Triplets after 24 Years of Marriage", "text": "Adamawa Lawmaker & Wife welcome Triplets after 24 Years of Marriage 07.12.2017 at By BellaNaija.com Leave a Comment Lawmaker Lumsambani Dilli and wife with their triplets \nA member of the Adamawa State House of Assembly and his wife have welcomed a set of triplets 24 years after their wedding, Premium Times reports. \n\u201cThe mother and the babies are all hale and hearty,\u201d the lawmaker Lumsambani Dilli , who represents Demsa Local Government, said. \n\u201cWe found out we were having three.

Reuters Palestinian boys take part in a protest over US President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, in Gaza City Dec 7, 2017. Reuters Arabs and Muslims across the Middle East on Wednesday condemned the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital as an incendiary move in a volatile region and Palestinians said Washington was abandoning its leading role as a peace mediator. Related Stories \nJerusalem is Israel's capital, says Trump \nThe European Union and United Nations also voiced alarm at US President Donald Trump's decision to move the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and its repercussions for any chances of reviving Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking. \nMajor US allies came out against Trump's reversal of decades of US and broad international policy on Jerusalem. \nFrance rejected the \"unilateral\" decision while appealing for calm in the region. Britain said the move would not help peace efforts and Jerusalem should ultimately be shared by Israel and a future Palestinian state. Germany said Jerusalem's status could only be resolved on the basis of a two-state solution. \nIsrael, by contrast, applauded Trump's move. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video message that it was \"an important step towards peace\" and it was \"our goal from Israel's first day\". \nHe added that any peace accord with the Palestinians would have to include Jerusalem as Israel's capital and he urged other countries to follow Trump's example. \nTrump upended decades of US policy in defiance of warnings from around the world that the gesture risks aggravating conflict in the tinderbox Middle East. \nThe status of Jerusalem is home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths. Its eastern sector was captured by Israel in a 1967 war and annexed in a move not recognised internationally. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem for the capital of an independent state they seek. Palestinian boys take part in a protest over US President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, in Gaza City Dec 7, 2017. Reuters Israel deems Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital dating to antiquity, and its status is one of the thorniest barriers to a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, in a pre-recorded speech, said Jerusalem was the \"eternal capital of the State of Palestine\" and that Trump's move was \"tantamount to the United States abdicating its role as a peace mediator.\" \nThe last round of US-brokered talks foundered in 2014 over issues including Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank and Israeli accusations of Palestinian incitement to violence and refusal to recognise it as a Jewish state. \nThe Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which has dominated Gaza since soon after Israel ended a 38-year occupation in 2005, said Trump had committed a \"flagrant aggression against the Palestinian people\". Hamas urged Arabs and Muslims to \"undermine US interests in the region\" and to \"shun Israel\". \nProtests broke out in parts of Jordan's capital Amman inhabited by Palestinian refugees, with youths chanting anti-American slogans. In the Baqaa refugee camp on Amman's outskirts, hundreds roamed the streets denouncing Trump and urging Jordan to scrap its 1994 peace treaty with Israel. \"Down with America...America is the mother of terror,\" they chanted. \nAngry Palestinians switched off Christmas lights at Jesus' traditional birthplace in the West Bank town of Bethlehem and in Ramallah. A tree adorned with lights outside Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity, where Christians believe Jesus was born, and another in Ramallah, next to the grave of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, were plunged into darkness. \nAll Palestinian factions called for a general strike and protest rallies at midday on Thursday. \n\"Legally null\" decision \nThe Saudi Royal Court issued a statement saying that the kingdom followed \"with deep sorrow\" Trump's decision and warned of \"dangerous consequences of moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem\". \nThe statement described the move as \"a big step back in efforts to advance the peace process\", and urged the US administration to reverse its decision and adhere to international will. \nEgypt, which forged the first Arab peace deal with Israel in 1979, brushed off Trump's decision and said it did not change Jerusalem's disputed legal status. \nJordan said Trump's action was \"legally null\" because it consolidated Israel's occupation of East Jerusalem. \nLebanese President Michel Aoun said Trump's Jerusalem decision was dangerous and threatened the credibility of the United States as a broker of Middle East peace. He said the move would put back the peace process by decades and threatened regional stability and perhaps global stability. \nQatar's foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, said Trump's undertaking was a \"death sentence for all who seek peace\" and called it \"a dangerous escalation\". \nTurkey said Trump's move was \"irresponsible\". \n\"We call upon the US Administration to reconsider this faulty decision which may result in highly negative outcomes and to avoid uncalculated steps that will harm the multicultural identity and historical status of Jerusalem,\" the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. \nA few hundred protesters gathered outside the US consulate in Istanbul, a Reuters cameraman at the scene said. The protest was largely peaceful, though some of the demonstrators threw coins and other objects at the consulate. \nIran \"seriously condemns\" Trump's move as it violates UN resolutions on the Israel-Palestinian conflict, state media reported. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said earlier in the day that the United States was trying to destabilise the region and start a war to protect Israel's security. \nIn Southeast Asia, the leaders of Muslim-majority Indonesia and Malaysia denounced Trump's action. \n\"This can rock global security and stability,\" Indonesian President Joko Widodo, leader of the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, told a news conference in which he called for the United States to reconsider its decision. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May disagreed with Trump's embrace of Jerusalem as Israel's capital before a final-status agreement as this was unlikely to help nurture peace in the region, her spokesman said. \nHowever, May's spokesman welcomed Trump's stated wish to end the conflict and his acknowledgement that the final status of Jerusalem, including boundaries within the city, must be subject to negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he did not support Trump's \"unilateral\" move. \n\"The status of Jerusalem is a question of international security that concerns the entire international community. The status of Jerusalem must be determined by Israelis and Palestinians in the framework of negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations,\" Macron told reporters in Algiers. \n\"France and Europe are attached to a two-state solution - Israel and Palestine - living side by side in peace and security within recognised international borders with Jerusalem the capital of both states,\" he said. \n\"For now, I urge for calm and for everyone to be responsible. We must avoid at all costs avoid violence and foster dialogue,\" he said. \nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said there was no alternative to a two-state solution and Jerusalem was a final-status matter only to be settled through direct talks. \n\"I have consistently spoken out against any unilateral measures that would jeopardise the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians,\" Guterres said. \"I will do everything in my power to support the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to return to meaningful negotiations.\" Advertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "michel aoun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheikh mohammed bin abdulrahman al-thani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio guterres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guterres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khan younis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yasser arafat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joko widodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayatollah ali khamenei", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "un", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi royal court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump  the european union and united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "algiers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim-majority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bethlehem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramallah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:54.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "763bcbd503e5a976f4ba9c2e1985f72e24ff908a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0Q0CeeJbi5mQBCNh9M5FgQ", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=barbra streisand", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "barbra%20streisand News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Alec Baldwin Talk Show in the Works at ABC | TVLine", "title_full": "Alec Baldwin Talk Show in the Works at ABC | TVLine : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-12-05T03:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "763bcbd503e5a976f4ba9c2e1985f72e24ff908a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0Q0CeeJbi5mQBCNh9M5FgQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TV Line", "published": "2017-12-05T03:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Alec Baldwin Talk Show in the Works at ABC | TVLine", "text": "Get ready to hear lots of Alec Baldwin talking.
