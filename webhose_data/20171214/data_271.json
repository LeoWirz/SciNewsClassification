Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA disabled pensioner who said buses are her lifeline has issued an impassioned plea to council chiefs. \nRetired pub barmaid, Sally Goodall told Kent Live, Kent County Council must think again before it cuts funding to 78 bus routes. \nMrs Goodhall, 65, who cannot walk unaided, said councillors needed to \"try a day in her life without transport\" and if they did they would realise the vital link buses provided to her and thousands of others across Kent. \nThe pensioner, who has two artificial hips, suffers from arthritis and the debilitating condition, fibromyalgia which causes extreme tiredness and pain and muscle stiffness. Join the fight: Save Our Buses \nKent Live has launched a petition calling on Kent County Council to rethink its plans to cut the funding. Signing up only takes a few seconds but could make a huge difference - just click here \nShe said she uses the 401 which runs from near her Brasted home to Sevenoaks and back on a twice weekly basis for shopping but sometimes simply to get out and meet other people. Without it she says she will be stripped of her independence. Sally Goodall cannot walk without a stick and relies on buses \n\"I will go stir crazy,\" she said. \n\"Left staring at four walls. I will try and keep myself busy but my condition makes it impossible. \n\"The bus is my lifeline - very much my lifeline. But it is not just for me - but for everyone else who relies on the bus.\" Read More \nMrs Goodall says her plight is made worse because she lives alone at her West End home away from her three daughters and son and her mobility scooter has recently stopped working meaning she finds herself confined indoors. Sally Goodall cannot walk and her mobility scooter nolonger works \nShe said Brasted used to have three bus services but now has the one which is also under threat. \n\"The bus gives me that bit of indpendence. I never ask people for anything - that was the way I was brought up. If they did get rid of the bus I will be totally isolated,\" she added.

Kate McKinnon has been killing it as usual all season on SNL, but she\u2019s about to hit the big screen. It\u2019s hard to know where to start with this video of Kate McKinnon admitting that she eats garbage to Jimmy Fallon, except to say that it is hilarious. When it comes to impressions, Saturday Night Live MVP Kate McKinnon can do it all. As a guest on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d McKinnon talked to host Jimmy Fallon about recent \u201cSNL\u201d hosts, including Gal Gadot. To paraphrase a quote from last week\u2019s Torah portion, \u201cTo see Kate McKinnon do an impression of Gal Gadot is to see the face of God. Kate McKinnon will sometimes retrieve half-eaten snacks from her office trash can if she\u2019s hungry. After an appearance on The Tonight Show yesterday, Kate McKinnon gets to add another spot-on impression to her already impressive list which includes Hillary Clinton, Kellyanne Conway, and Jeff Sessions, just to name a few. She\u2019s a full-fledged comedy goddess, but even Kate McKinnon gets awestruck around Gal Gadot. Related: Kelly Clarkson\u2019s Daughter Is A Wonder Woman Superfan.Apparently, while prepping for the show, Gadot shelled out some pretty sage advice to Kate and fellow castmember Aidy Bryant. But then McKinnon whipped out her impression of the Wonder Woman star, switching to impressive, spot-on Israeli-accented English.

It included illuminated puppets and street entertainers and ended with a festive singalong in Stamford Square, led by The Music Place choir. \nThe Lantern Parade came two weeks after the Christmas lights switch-on. For the past few years Altrincham Unlimited have hosted a mini-Lantern Parade as part the lights switch-on day, but as it became such a popular event the team decided to take the parade further around Altrincham to involve as many of the town as possible. \nAltrincham Unlimited Communications Manager Linda Roy said: \u201cFollowing Altrincham\u2019s well-documented resurgence over the past few years, and in particular the huge increase in visitor numbers in the run-up to Christmas last year, we felt the time was right to separate the Lantern Parade and Christmas Lights Switch-On events, and give each a full day in its own right. \n\u201cThis enabled us to develop a separate identity for each event and really boost the cultural offer in Altrincham this Christmas. The town centre was packed on Switch-On day and the atmosphere was amazing, while extending the Lantern Parade route allowed us to include much more of the town. Working with professional artists and puppeteers took the whole event to another level, making for a truly magical afternoon. \n\u201cThere plenty more to come; Santa\u2019s Grotto will be popping up again next Saturday, the Alt. Great British Christmas Markets are open every Tuesday, Saturday & Sunday, you can get creative with wreath-making and other festive workshops and with many new shops, caf\u00e9s and restaurants having opened their doors in the past few months, excellent Christmas shopping and food and drink is a given. Altrincham continues to go from strength to strength and there\u2019s no better time than Christmas to enjoy everything our town has to offer.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "russell kirk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bollin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda roy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "altrincham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardwells theatre school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "altrincham unlimited communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "altrincham unlimited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa\u2019s grotto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aura music academy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "altrincham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stamford park junior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tucano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stamford square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:13.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18d7b6cf19ac17dd4143652d1985f07b6838880f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pkSOsKXlzarsALIPw6ATon30Z9PIdkNPu", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/o/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/o/ - Auto - 4chan", "title": "What oil and filter is in your car RIGHT NOW?

Without financial aid, GW has a cost of attendance of more than $70,000 a year. Tuition, housing, books and meal plans quickly add up. However, a large portion of that bill, which is designated as \u201ctuition,\u201d is a seemingly financial black hole to students. A majority of GW\u2019s cost of attendance is shelled under the ambiguous label, yet most students don\u2019t have a clear idea of what that tuition money actually goes toward. Faculty pensions, building maintenance and class equipment are some of the logical places students might assume are supported by tuition payments. \nBut there are other areas and projects tuition dollars may go to. Just last month, GW spent $500,000 on University President Thomas LeBlanc\u2019s inauguration. But the University\u2019s problem with unnecessary extravagance and marketing is not new. GW has recognized and altered its ways before, developing a more modest orientation years ago after being criticized for lavish features \u2013 including lasers, casino nights, ice cream socials and engraved chocolates on pillows. Even with all that gone, GW just can\u2019t seem to shake their profligate marketing. Just this past April, when I went to open my mail to get my acceptance letter, I took out a hefty cardstock folder, complete with shiny gold lining and my own graduation cap topper. In reality, marketing expenses like that have have little substance and impact on a student\u2019s college decision. \nGW fails to address more serious problems like cuts to the arts programs or student food insecurity. \nIt\u2019s not a secret that GW can spend extravagantly, whether it be through funding humongous inauguration parties or something as small as printing fancy admissions folders. As a student who was educated within the public school system all my life, this apparent extravagance at the hands of a private institution is foreign and even appalling to me. Students and their families work hard for their money, and thousands have made immense financial sacrifice to be able to attend GW, including dipping into savings and taking out student loans that can surmount to crippling debt. The University has a duty to not only be more transparent with how it budgets tuition dollars, but also strive to be more fiscally responsible with the money we spend to attend. \nThe University publishes a yearly budget online under the University Budget Office, but this is a bare-bones outline at best. The ambiguous \u201cPurchased Services\u201d acquire a hefty $175,000 in costs, while almost $38,000 is designated to \u201cOther,\u201d and no description is given for what these categories entail. The University lacks transparency concerning how exactly its revenue is being spent, and this needs to change. As students who pay tuition to this institution, we have a right to know exactly where the University is choosing to invest tuition. There is no justification for GW\u2019s lack of willingness to bring its financial endeavors to light. Other institutions of higher education like Purdue University have offices specifically dedicated to financial transparency, while Tufts University recently convened an advisory board on the subject. It is not unreasonable to expect GW to make the effort to be more transparent, especially with the University\u2019s high cost of tuition. \nIn addition, GW should practice more frugality. Ask almost any GW student about the recent inauguration of LeBlanc and you\u2019ll be met with an eye-roll. The University spared no expense when it came to an arbitrary party that served no purpose other than to boost public relations. But GW fails to address more serious problems like cuts to the arts programs or student food insecurity . The Student Association went as far as to pass a resolution to formally condemn LeBlanc\u2019s excessive inauguration and further demand GW release a complete annual fiscal budget and spending report. The University\u2019s willingness to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars for the sake of marketing, rather than curating funds to assist actual students, is a glaring error in judgment. Students\u2019 academic experience should be the first priority. At the top of the list should be rehabilitating academic programs that have been suffering from budget cuts like the music departments. The second priority should be allocating more money toward supporting students facing serious lifestyle challenges like food insecurity by contributing more support to The Store and providing more affordable dining options. \nGW may be a private institution, but we all have a right to understand where our money is appropriated. \nLeBlanc said that his top priority is improving the student experience. It is unreasonable that $500,000 was spent on a glorified party for him while some of the University\u2019s students face food insecurity and others work several jobs just to stay afloat. \nI understand the incredibly complicated nature of budgeting for such a large institution. And I don\u2019t claim to be an expert in the University\u2019s finances. However, I do recognize how unethical it is for GW to ask so much of students and their parents financially and then simultaneously deny them access to detailed and clear information on the use of that money. To make it worse, what budgeting details are released show a troubling misuse of funds by the University. \nGW may be a private institution, but we all have a right to understand where our money is appropriated. There must be more effort by University officials to make the GW experience worthwhile for actual students. This can be done by investing in students\u2019 academic success through diversifying suffering programs as well as making the expensive lifestyle here more accessible for financially struggling students. \nRonnie Riccobene, a freshman majoring in journalism, is a Hatchet opinions writer. \nWant to respond to this piece?

If you can't play your one trick, any pick you take will only be a liability. Especially if your one trick doesn't have transferable skills like mechanical aim. As a one trick, you cannot possibly perform to the SR standard you're matched by on any pick other than your one trick. It's no worse than \"healer mains\", probably better even, and since there are two healers that don't require much aim, I'd say even symmetra otps would do just fine. Maybe not great, but you don't have to do \"great\" to climb. You just have to do well.

And that, when you encounter someone exactly like you, you are rendered effectively useless? Not that you can't play another hero, anyone can, it's just you won't be anywhere near as good as your SR demands. And this is exactly what my friend basically argued, that even though he isn't as good on this one tricks pick, he is still trying to win etc.\nYou have to avoid people like you in order to be viable at your SR. \"Fillers\" or \"Flexers\" do not have this requirement.\nYou see this difference, yes? Anyone competent at team play enables me to \"one-trick\". If someone else manages to pick my character before me, and can't play anyone else, then that's that. No hard feelings, you just do the best you can.\nAs for this \"friend\" of yours, go back and read my analogy about having one arm. It doesn't matter that he's \"doing his best\" if he's being a $hitter and knowingly depriving the team of two capable teammates. Not one, but TWO. Himself AND the OT. He is throwing.

Basically just punishing your team for having the luck to be paired with you in this particular way.\nTbh, I think this is an adequate enough explanation, and I fully acknowledge you may be completely incapable of recognizing these things. I leave it at this. I had hoped for a more nuanced discussion, but I am in no way surprised this is how it turned out. It's expected. Anyone that one tricks in comp is a very self centered and egotistical type of person, and I don't get along well with those types of people. If you decide to play multiple heroes and drop in SR, than you decide to play multiple heroes and drop in SR. That's entirely up to you. If you're so self-centered that anyone not playing up to their fullest potential is \"punishing\" a team, then one, you [again] are probably a very angry boy on a regular basis, and two, the team probably deserved the \"punishment\" for not being able to play competently as a team. If you get outplayed, that's one thing, but in an average team situation, a \"flexer\" playing a healer they're not too hot with can, and usually will, do quite well. But oh, of course that's not \"punishing\" the team, it's a flexer, they flex. It doesn't matter that they aren't at the SR level they were matched at, they flex. But oh no, now here comes an OTP who can't play at the level they were matched at! Curses, my perfect game has now been foiled by this one person doing slightly sub-par!\nSeriously, apart from people with actual disorders or problems, do you think someone with subpar aim playing Symmetra will suddenly be an absolute retard on any other characters? I honestly expect this mindset from the regular tantrum throwers, but I thought better of you on this thread. I understand you might be projecting your ego on to others, but please, keep using your hypothetical situations in which any one-trick not playing their best character is bronze level and the sole reason for your team losing. Dude... Again you addressed nothing I brought up and you're just painting me as some horrible person I guess? Like I really don't even know what you're trying to achieve with this line of arguing as it has nothing to do with what I brought up.\nOh well. One trick logic at it's best. If you feel better by writing me off as some irrational person or whatever, so be it. You didn't even get close to my arguments as to why I don't Tracer one trick. I understand why you wouldn't, it's just... disappointing you still feel you have a point.\nC'est la vie.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:14.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ed31c5d95d658e52ab9fec3eaa8d459296d2ada5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_DRNYNHvKGwBXjWTOM6I0jd..jWSDNF29NKWpfEda7DI2Zr32PKEu", "site_full": "www.55188.com", "site": "55188.com", "site_section": "http://www.55188.com/forum-8-2.html", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "\u0104\u017e\u0161\u00c9\u0118\u0110\u0118\u013e\u0150\u02dd\u0110\u0139\u010e\u02d8\u02dd\u0165\u00c1\u00f7\u00c7\u0159\u0104\u017c - \u013e\u00da2\u0147\u0142 - \u0154\u00ed\u010e\u00eb\u00c2\u0170\u011a\u0142 \u00d6\u0110\u0161\u00fa\u010c\u00cb\u0106\u0159\u00d7\u00ee\u00cd\u00fa\u013e\u00c4\u0161\u00c9\u0106\u0105\u00c2\u0170\u011a\u0142", "title": "\u0104\u017e\u017a\u017a\u00c7\u00c9\u0104\u017c\u00d6\u00f7\u00c1\u015a\u013e\u00c4\u0110\u00c4\u00cb\u017a\u00c4\u0103\u0105\u0111\u02db\u00c2\u0104\u015e\u0104\u015e\u0147\u0165\u00b8\u00f6\u0154\u010e\u0118\u00d6\u013e\u00c4\u017e\u00ad\u0143\u00e9\u02c7\u00d6\u010e\u00ed - \u013e\u00da212\u0147\u0142", "title_full": "\u0104\u017e\u017a\u017a\u00c7\u00c9\u0104\u017c\u00d6\u00f7\u00c1\u015a\u013e\u00c4\u0110\u00c4\u00cb\u017a\u00c4\u0103\u0105\u0111\u02db\u00c2\u0104\u015e\u0104\u015e\u0147\u0165\u00b8\u00f6\u0154\u010e\u0118\u00d6\u013e\u00c4\u017e\u00ad\u0143\u00e9\u02c7\u00d6\u010e\u00ed - \u013e\u00da212\u0147\u0142 - \u0154\u00ed\u010e\u00eb\u00c2\u0170\u011a\u0142 \u00d6\u0110\u0161\u00fa\u010c\u00cb\u0106\u0159\u00d7\u00ee\u00cd\u00fa\u013e\u00c4\u0161\u00c9\u0106\u0105\u00c2\u0170\u011a\u0142", "published": "2017-10-27T03:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 25940, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54338836086c657dd0f50581b46715aaaa73d51c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_DRNYNHvKGwBXjWTOM6I0jd..jWSDNF29NKWpfEda7MmS6WZF7CJpEDm_5.6PbYPgYR6K_FDiIzfsB41krzt2JqQtLr3tu_E-", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "\u0139\u0141\u0118\u010e", "published": "2017-12-07T08:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\u0142\u00d4\u010e\u0155\u00c4\u0143\u017c\u00b4", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:14.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5158c15cf4132bdbe56f0b6051b718ea66a013f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkceTeHOhZtwyUwEu3hn0Jbj5kwGftTtAiqxiwZ_3h4j7pzJ_AOxK41OgBRmsspuJayAbeIADhmXX2ziWezqdzDaKac53zZKtNEgvTtJOTdUGSM-", "site_full": "www.expedia.com", "site": "expedia.com", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com/Fort-Hancock-Hotels.d55710.Travel-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Top 10 Fort Hancock, TX Hotels $64 | Hotel Deals on Expedia", "title": "Best Western East El Paso Inn:", "title_full": "Best Western East El Paso Inn: 2017 Room Prices, Deals & Reviews | Expedia", "published": "2017-05-23T09:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 416, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "80fa186fe71396eac68c5c296d19419c8a24a534", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkceTeHOhZtwyUwEu3hn0Jbj5kwGftTtAiqxiwZ_3h4j7pzJ_AOxK41OgBRmsspuJayAbeIADhmXX2ziWezqdzDaKac53zZKtNEgPkJ59MsGRljGt.dSQ_ZIMyOYlDxO2R6ThgeicXXMK7A-", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-16T00:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "My stay at the hotel was amazing!

But at GW, the price tag for that chance is too steep. University faculty and administrators often encourage students to take either a summer, semester or even full year to immerse themselves in a new culture and region \u2013 but the cost associated creates a major obstacle for students. Studying abroad is something every student should have the opportunity to experience without worrying about additional loans or sacrificing savings. \nThe decision to study abroad and where to study internationally should not be based on finances. \nIf you decide to study abroad at GW, you will pay a fixed rate of tuition to the University, plus an additional tier fee based on where you choose to go overseas. The tier fee is designed to help cover the costs incurred while studying abroad at a partner institution. Each study abroad program falls into one of the seven tiers, and that designation is decided on an individual basis depending on the costs associated with each specific school. Thus, the tiers range in price and inclusion. For example, if you decide to study abroad for one semester in a tier-one location such as University College London , the least expensive tier, then you must pay your fixed rate of tuition plus an additional $825 fee. If you decide to study abroad for one semester in a tier seven zone like the Centre de Danse du Marais in Paris, the most expensive tier, then you have to pay your fixed rate of GW tuition plus an additional $7,725 fee. But don\u2019t be fooled by opting to study abroad in a seemingly cheaper tier area. That additional fee typically only covers the tuition and health insurance of the study abroad program. Students are still expected to find and pay separately for housing, meals, orientation fees and other excursions in the less expensive tiers. \nEssentially, when studying abroad at GW, you are paying money to two different institutions but only really benefiting fully from attending one. It\u2019s already difficult for most college students to pay for a semester here without adding the additional cost of study abroad on top of it. This convoluted tier system puts a heavier financial burden than necessary on students and means that many students are unable to study abroad due to financial concerns. As a university deeply committed to the benefits obtained from studying abroad, GW could and should do more to support students who hope to study internationally. The University should do this by simply mandating students to pay the costs of studying abroad at their specific study abroad institution rather than pay GW\u2019s fixed tuition plus a tier fee. \nPersonally, one of the reasons I chose to attend GW was its diverse range of study abroad options. GW has approved more than 50 program partnerships in almost every region of the world and has sent thousands of students abroad in its history. \nCurrently, to help students pay for the additional costs associated with studying abroad, GW has set up a portal with a number of external scholarships and grants . There are additional study abroad scholarships through the University, but the amounts only range from $1,000 to $3,000. On top of that, the application process can be quite challenging for students and more importantly, does not actually guarantee any need- or merit-based aid. This forces students who don\u2019t receive scholarships, grants or have family members willing to pay for their study abroad experience to take out funds from savings or apply for high-interest loans to study abroad. \nForcing students to pay for both a tier fee and their fixed rate of tuition causes students to choose between financial security and a life-changing educational experience. \nSome schools, like Soka University of America in California, recognize the financial pressures of studying abroad and allow students to simply pay their respective universities\u2019 fixed cost of attendance with no additional costs. This causes the university to supplement the rest of the trips\u2019 cost including additional housing fees, related program fees, flights and excursions. However, Soka is substantially smaller than GW with a lower sticker price tuition , so it would be more of a long-term goal for GW to implement a similar policy. Many of our peer schools also have a similar tier fee system, like Georgetown University , American University and Duke University . But that doesn\u2019t mean GW can\u2019t be a leader in lowering the study abroad cost burden on students. The University should have students simply pay for their study abroad programs\u2019 associated costs, such as tuition and housing, rather than pay GW tuition plus a tier fee. This should be an intermediate step toward the aforementioned long-term goal of students only paying their GW cost of attendance while studying abroad. Schools like Boston University and Northwestern University already use this system. \nThe decision to study abroad and where to study internationally should not be based on finances or a college student\u2019s ability to pay. Looking forward past my first year, I hope to study abroad in Europe at some point during my sophomore or junior year. But I don\u2019t want my study abroad experience to be dominated by stress over getting one of the limited study abroad scholarships for my travels, or anxiety over taking out loans to pay for my time abroad. \nForcing students to pay for both a tier fee and their fixed rate of tuition with only limited financial aid opportunities causes students to choose between financial security and a life-changing educational experience. Many students \u2013 including myself \u2013 decided to attend GW based on its many international study partnerships, and the University needs to drastically improve how it helps students fund study abroad. \nColette Bruder, a freshman majoring in international affairs, is a Hatchet opinions writer. \nWant to respond to this piece? Submit a letter to the editor.

But that's not \"building around you\" is it? That's just what you do, common sense. But suddenly one of your teammates is a \"OTP\", oh no! Now you have to do things entirely different!

My hidden SR recently reset or something, so I was dropped from high plat to almost silver. Might actually have touched silver. I still climbed doing the same thing I did to lose those 50 or so games by being a \"OTP\", climbing back up to plat. So maybe I get one or two games where I'm ineffective, or \"can't play at my SR\", oh well. It's no worse than when I get full teams of throwing children who still believe you can get banned for one-tricking, or real throwers, or get outplayed by the enemy team.

If you can't play your one trick, any pick you take will only be a liability. Especially if your one trick doesn't have transferable skills like mechanical aim. As a one trick, you cannot possibly perform to the SR standard you're matched by on any pick other than your one trick. It's no worse than \"healer mains\", probably better even, and since there are two healers that don't require much aim, I'd say even symmetra otps would do just fine. Maybe not great, but you don't have to do \"great\" to climb. You just have to do well. If you're saying you need everyone on your team to be masterful no matter what they play, then you're probably a very angry boy whenever you play.\n12/06/2017 10:45 PM Posted by Quest So you admit fillers/flexers enable you to be able to one trick? And that, when you encounter someone exactly like you, you are rendered effectively useless? Not that you can't play another hero, anyone can, it's just you won't be anywhere near as good as your SR demands. And this is exactly what my friend basically argued, that even though he isn't as good on this one tricks pick, he is still trying to win etc.\nYou have to avoid people like you in order to be viable at your SR. \"Fillers\" or \"Flexers\" do not have this requirement.\nYou see this difference, yes? Anyone competent at team play enables me to \"one-trick\". If someone else manages to pick my character before me, and can't play anyone else, then that's that. No hard feelings, you just do the best you can.\nAs for this \"friend\" of yours, go back and read my analogy about having one arm. It doesn't matter that he's \"doing his best\" if he's being a $hitter and knowingly depriving the team of two capable teammates. Not one, but TWO. Himself AND the OT. He is throwing. Please try and make an excuse to say he's not. Make up a fake scenario where he's in the right for being an A$$HOLE. Where throwing a tantrum is okay for anyone over 4. I'm not arguing the morality of his actions. I stated earlier that I disagree with them. It was brought up to demonstrate a point.\nOfc it's no hard feelings for you, but what about the other 5 people on your team that was put together due to their SR etc that now has someone that suddenly went from masters to gold just because their one trick hero was taken from them?

By Cayla Harris   \nA new student organization is looking to embrace the tradition of left-wing radicalism on college campuses. \nThe Internationalist Students\u2019 Front, a roughly 20-member student group that launched on campus two weeks ago, aims to oppose nationalism across the world and contest popular narratives about U.S. foreign policy, members of the organization said. Group members said the organization will host teach-ins about the consequences of fascism and advocate internationalism, a political ideology similar to socialism that believes all people should unite to advance common interests. \nSophomore Sheng Zhang, a member of the organization, said the group was formed to help spread the idea that students should take a \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d approach to politics and international affairs instead of a nationalist view. He said a main tenet of internationalism is believing all people are equal. \n\u201cInternationalism means that we stand in solidarity with every single struggle against oppression in the world.\u201d \n\u201cA nationalist approach is very common on campus, and people somehow regard foreign policy as a chess game about \u2018how do we outrun Russia, and how do we outsmart China,\u2019 but international relations is never a chess game, and we cannot play with people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \nZhang said the idea for the organization first came up last academic year when he wanted to host an event with another student organization featuring a Kurdish speaker \u2013 a Muslim minority with communities in countries like Iraq and Turkey. He said the organization, which he declined to name, refused to host the event because Kurdish oppression was not a main focus of the group. \nZhang then decided to start a different organization that would act as an advocate for oppressed populations across the globe. \n\u201cInternationalism means that we stand in solidarity with every single struggle against oppression in the world,\u201d he said. \nZhang said the organization plans to host a memorial event either this month or next for those who died in the Nanjing Massacre, an early-20th century mass murder of about 300,000 Chinese citizens by Japanese troops during World War II. He said the organization also plans to circulate a petition and deliver a letter to Gelman Library demanding that two books \u2013 one of which is called \u201cThe Alleged \u2018Nanking Massacre\u2019: Japan\u2019s Rebuttal to China\u2019s Forged Claims\u201d \u2013 written by members of the Japanese far-right denying the occurrence of the massacre be taken down or labeled as propaganda. \nSenior Alaina Taylor, a member of the organization, said the group\u2019s main goal is to educate the public about new ideas and historical events they may have never heard about before, like U.S. interference in other countries\u2019 elections. She said the organization will host teach-ins about events like former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\u2019s role in the starvation of Indians during World War II. \n\u201cA lot of people on our campus just don\u2019t know about these things,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not taught this in high school and they\u2019re not taught in college either.\u201d \nTaylor said she hopes the organization can begin to change attitudes on campus away from the dominant U.S.-centric narrative on events like the Iraq War. \n\u201cA lot of people understand that people in their government will do bad things to them, but a lot of the time they don\u2019t extend that to fully understand the scope and full scope of what the U.S. government is willing to do to people abroad,\u201d she said. \nOn the group\u2019s Facebook page , organization leaders posted blurbs celebrating internationalist figures, like members of the Black Panther Party \u2013 a black nationalist and socialist organization that fought against police brutality in the 1960s \u2013 and former Cuban President Fidel Castro, a communist dictator and long-time U.S. nemesis who controlled the island for more than half a century until his death last year. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can really be characterized as a communist student org because our main focus isn\u2019t communism,\u201d \nSenior Clayton Boylan, a member of the organization, said that because the group was officially recognized so close to the end of the semester, it has been difficult to formally recruit members or put posters around campus. The organization held its first general body meeting Nov. 30. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t want this brushed underneath the carpet, because this is a very big issue and it has to do with denying things like the Holocaust, denying things like the massacre,\u201d he said of the organization. \nSophomore Josh Gomez, a member of the organization, said there have been accusations that the organization is communist, but that isn\u2019t the main purpose of the club.

By Brooke Migdon and Catherine Moran   \nWMATA\u2019s plan to eliminate negative balances on fare cards will inconvenience low-income riders, students and faculty say. \nStarting Jan. 8, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority fare system will no longer permit riders to complete rides on the bus or subway with a negative balance on SmarTrip cards. Some students and faculty said the new policy will affect Metro riders who don\u2019t carry change or cannot afford to keep a higher balance on their cards. \nIf a rider\u2019s card does not have enough money for the fare, the gate will not open and riders will have to add money at an exitfare machine, which will accept only cash and coins, according to WMATA\u2019s website . \nOver the last 17 years, unsettled negative balances have cost WMATA about $25 million, according to a release from the agency. \n\u201cIn an environment where every dollar counts, we are taking a common sense approach to ensure that Metro is properly collecting the value of the transportation it provides in order to reduce the demand on Metro customers and the region for additional funding,\u201d Metro Chief Financial Officer Dennis Anosike said in the release. \nJonathan Gaelen, a freshman music major, said he uses the Metro four to five times a week to explore the city, and he\u2019s had a negative balance on his SmarTrip card about four times. \n\u201cI never really think about how much the trip costs until after I have done it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will make a major inconvenience for anyone who wants to use the Metro.\u201d \nThe plan is likely to discourage him from using the Metro because he worries he\u2019ll be stuck if he doesn\u2019t have change or coins to pay the exit fare, he said. \nWMATA is asking riders to add enough money for their trip prior to swiping their SmarTrip cards and entering stations. Riders can opt into an auto reload program , which automatically adds value to a rider\u2019s card each time the value drops below $10. \nAnanya Vidyarthi, a senior studying international affairs, said the plan will take a way the convenience of not having to worry about the card balance before using the system. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t always remember what your Metro balance is, so if you\u2019re in a hurry and you have to refill it because you\u2019re 75 cents short, that\u2019s a bit ridiculous,\u201d he said. \nVidyarthi said he uses the Metro twice a week for an internship and has a negative balance about once every two weeks. \n\u201cI could see it impacting a lot of riders just because many people do find the Metro quite expensive,\u201d he said. \nRobert Baker, the director of performance studies in the GW music department, said the policy would have a more significant impact in the more disadvantaged parts of the District. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to folks for whom the Metro is their only method of transportation, and they are on a fixed or limited income,\u201d he said in an email Monday. \u201cThere are days in the week or month before you get a paycheck, that folks need to get home and don\u2019t have a penny left until the next day\u2019s paycheck.\u201d \nIn 2010, WMATA banned Metro riders from exiting stations without paying the full fare. After backlash from Metro riders, officials postponed development, shelving the plan until it was proposed again in 2012. \nIn 2013, the agency agreed that a $1.50 negative limit for Metrorail trips would be enforced. \nDavid Stephen, the communications coordinator for the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 689, which represents transit workers in D.C., said the move will increase rider stress and potentially physical assaults on Metro employees if fare disputes turn violent. \nHe said the plan could cause economic and accessibility issues, especially affecting people who rely on public transit. \n\u201cCarrying a negative balance is a courtesy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fares ought to be paid, but at the same time, Metro should do as much as it can to make sure the experience of riding is the least stressful it can be.\u201d Metro shutdown results in $2 million loss for WMATA After last week\u2019s safety checks, WMATA is out an estimated $2 million, according to Washington City Paper.

The letter collected 223 signatures when it was published Nov. 28. \nThe letter demands the industry address \u201cserious gender imbalances\u201d in senior leadership positions and calls for mandatory sexual harassment and abuse training across the field, as well as multiple channels to report abuse without fear of retribution. It is titled #Metoonatsec, a reference to the #MeToo movement, which sprung up in response to the recent rush of sexual harassment allegations against men in media, entertainment and politics. \n\u201cMany women are held back or driven from this field by men who use their power to assault at one end of the spectrum and perpetuate \u2013 sometimes unconsciously \u2013 environments that silence, demean, belittle or neglect women at the other,\u201d the letter reads. \nBen-Yehuda said she wrote the letter with Nina Hachigian, the deputy mayor for international affairs in Los Angeles, and the two collected signatures over the week of Thanksgiving. Ben-Yehuda said that even though the holiday was not an ideal time to draw attention to the letter, the response was still \u201coverwhelming.\u201d \n\u201cThis is happening to women everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to lend our voices in solidarity and change the conversation in the national security workspace.\u201d \nWomen who signed the letter had either personally experienced harassment or knew someone who has, she said. \n\u201cEveryone knows somebody,\u201d Ben-Yehuda said. \u201cThat\u2019s really what we want to draw attention to.\u201d \nAt least 38 percent of employed women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. \nBen-Yehuda, a former consultant who worked with the State Department, said the national security field is dominated by men in top positions. The culture surrounding sexual harassment in the workplace \u201csidelines\u201d talent from the workforce, especially in places where women are less represented, she said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a threat to our national security,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you take talented women out of the workforce, you\u2019re losing language skills and specialized training at the cost of the taxpayer.\u201d \nThe letter points to a report by the Foreign Service Journal that found that women in the U.S. Foreign Service are still routinely passed over for promotions to senior positions and many end up leaving the industry altogether. \nBen-Yehuda and Hachigian circulated the letter to groups like the Women Ambassadors Serving America and the Department of Defense, as well as to women serving in the U.S. military. \n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t want this major moment of national reckoning on sexual misconduct to pass without hearing from voices in the national security community,\u201d Hachigian said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure those victims knew they were being heard and supported.\u201d \nDeborah Avant, a professor of security and diplomacy at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver who signed the letter, said part of the struggle is realizing the prevalence of sexual harassment and the importance of workplace education to clearly identify and define it. \n\u201cI think this is an issue that all of us have dealt with all our lives without thinking of it very much,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that people are talking about it now, you realize we have to be making it not part of the landscape.\u201d \nNora Bensahel, an expert at American University\u2019s School of International Service, said the letter has made her male colleagues more aware of what women experience in the workplace. Bensahel said there have been more conversations about sexual harassment in the workplace among her colleagues as a result of the letter, conversations she hopes will continue. \n\u201cFor so many women in this field, and many others, we just don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Bensahel said. \u201cWe just have assumed for a very long time that that\u2019s the price of being a woman in the field.\u201d  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arianna dunham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elliott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared gans   courtesy of jenna ben-yehuda jenna ben-yehuda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenna ben-yehuda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben-yehuda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hachigian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nora bensahel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bensahel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nina hachigian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deborah avant", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "foreign service journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "women ambassadors serving america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elliott school of international affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of defense", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national sexual violence resource center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american university\u2019s school of international service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josef korbel school of international studies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of denver", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:15.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "010b064eb07afc73be6881e83eebd101bdd252a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSzHN3ayyqN_B80XcdQ8fjUEbih62Wuhil7p4l0N4rCM_8FQuSda9LUEdAWegyM1V9mzNcHD.8aoYg_YWIwnEey.efJ3jLXEaiKaHjCfHRwrg--", "site_full": "phantompilots.com", "site": "phantompilots.com", "site_section": "https://phantompilots.com/forums/general-discussion.4/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "General Discussion | DJI Phantom Drone Forum", "title": "Flying within an airport restricted zone", "title_full": "Flying within an airport restricted zone | DJI Phantom Drone Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T12:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://phantompilots.com/styles/drift/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 42906, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8738e5653eb958c17116801ea74baaac3eb8801b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSzHN3ayyqN_B80XcdQ8fjUEbih62Wuhil7p4l0N4rCM_8FQuSda9LUEdAWegyM1V9mzNcHD.8aoYg_YWIwnEey.efJ3jLXEai8oeXtuNb_a2mEm8omI71w", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Bakersfield Quad", "published": "2017-12-06T13:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Not good without consent of the Control Tower.

By Cayla Harris   \nStudents will soon be able to purchase boxes of fresh fruits and vegetables on their GWorld cards. \nThe Student Association partnered with Hungry Harvest, a Baltimore-based produce delivery service, to pilot a program next semester allowing students to purchase the service on their GWorld cards. Student leaders said the program will give students the opportunity to eat nutritiously on a low budget and also support Hungry Harvest\u2019s mission to lower food waste. \nLogan Malik, the SA\u2019s director of sustainability policy, said that in early February, students will be able to sign up at tables around campus to participate in the program. For $60, students would receive boxes of fresh produce on a biweekly basis over the course of two months, he said. \n\u201cWe really think this is going to be a step forward as far as addressing food insecurity but also ensuring that students who are struggling with that have access to healthy food,\u201d Malik said. \n\u201cWith food insecurity being such a prevalent issue on our campus, we are always looking for innovative ways to provide affordable options to students.\u201d \nHe said the boxes will include a mix of fruits and vegetables and that when signing up for the program, students will be able to indicate six products that they don\u2019t like and don\u2019t want included in their order. \nDuring the trial period, the produce would be packaged and delivered to campus and stored in a central location, like the Center for Student Engagement, based in the Marvin Center, or The Store \u2013 GW\u2019s food pantry in the basement of District House, Malik said. \nHe said conversations about the partnership first began last academic year but that planning started over the summer and the project came together this fall. It was advertised in the SA\u2019s weekly email to students Monday. \nIf the trial period goes well, he said the SA will work with the CSE and Hungry Harvest to make the service \u201cavailable and easy to use\u201d for more students in the future. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be primarily gauging through number of sign-ups,\u201d Malik said. \u201cI think if we just see a bunch of people clambering and interested in this, I think that\u2019s a pretty clear thing.\u201d \nHe said organizers may also send out a survey to users after the pilot period to see how well the service worked. \nSA President Peak Sen Chua said student leaders first began looking into Hungry Harvest because the organization already has a partnership with The Store and delivers extra produce to stock the pantry. \n\u201cBecause of Hungry Harvest\u2019s affordability and flexibility, we felt like this was something that students could really benefit from having easy access to,\u201d Chua said in an email. \u201cAdditionally, we think that Hungry Harvest\u2019s mission of reducing food waste is important and something that is worthy of support.\u201d \nChua said Hungry Harvest provides often-coveted fresh produce at affordable prices. The service offers food at a price 20 percent lower than grocery stores by delivering produce that couldn\u2019t be shelved at a supermarket. The fruits and vegetables it delivers would otherwise be thrown away because of an imperfect appearance or a surplus in product, according to Hungry Harvest\u2019s website. \n\u201cWith food insecurity being such a prevalent issue on our campus, we are always looking for innovative ways to provide affordable options to students,\u201d he said. \nConcerns about food insecurity led to the opening of The Store in fall 2016, which now has more than 500 users. \nLizzie Pearson, the SA\u2019s deputy director of sustainability policy, said the program will reduce food waste and push students to try out \u201cdifferent produce they might not be as inclined to buy when shopping at the supermarket.\u201d \n\u201cWe are very excited about the SA\u2019s work on this program and hope that it will benefit many of our shoppers in the near future.\u201d \n\u201cInstead of throwing out perfectly good and nutritious produce, people can eat well at a low cost,\u201d she said. \nThe SA also worked with Tim Miller, the associate dean of students, to help get the program up and running. Miller said he facilitated discussions with Hungry Harvest\u2019s team last fall to see if the organization\u2019s work with The Store could be expanded across campus. He said he is proud to see students leading the effort. \n\u201cStudents will be leading this initiative and the CSE will provide logistical support and assistance to help bring this food recovery program to GW,\u201d Miller said in an email. \nSaru Duckworth, the vice president of The Store, said fresh fruits and vegetables are something shoppers request frequently, and the produce supplied by Hungry Harvest \u201calways goes very quickly in The Store.\u201d She said The Store\u2019s executive board will also help advertise the new partnership to its shoppers. \n\u201cWe are very excited about the SA\u2019s work on this program and hope that it will benefit many of our shoppers in the near future,\u201d she said in an email. \nSarah Roach contributed reporting. Entering its second year, food pantry to become student organization The group\u2019s leaders said the change will allow a group of students to focus only on running the pantry as they try to start a larger conversation about food insecurity.

Read carefully folks. This is going to happen whether you like it or not. \n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday President Donald Trump gave the go ahead for the United States to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  \n\nThis means that bus companies and bus drivers in places like Pakistan must be prepared to see angry mobs burning their buses. Most likely beginning tomorrow which is a Friday - usually a good day for burning their own buses, getting shot by their own police, screaming in front of the US Embassy and such. Normal behaviour in many Islamic countries.  \n\n  Just got this. I told you so . \n\nWhile the Arabs and other Muslims around the world will be tripping and falling as usual in their daily lives other things are being planned by other people that will have great impact on Muslims. \n\nNot noticed by many Muslims, especially the Malays, a significant event has taken place between Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Egypt (and also Israel). \n\nSome background. In 1979 the Camp David peace treaty was signed between Egypt and Israel. Thus ending 31 years of conflict between them. The terms of the Camp David accords included \nIsrael handing the occupied Sinai Peninsula back to Egypt complete ban on the Egyptian military crossing the Suez Canal into the Sinai unrestricted shipping access to the Israeli port of Eilat in the Gulf of Aqaba presence of the US Marines and a Multi National Observer Force in Sharm El Sheikh to monitor the shipping lanes and the treaty. \n\n\n\n\nThe entire Gulf of Aqaba is an ecological paradise for marine life. In the 90s I had the pleasure of swimming in this warm Gulf and visiting Sharm El Sheikh and St Catherine in the Sinai. \n\nJust off Sharm El Sheikh are two small Egyptian islands or \"jazeerah\" known as Tiran and Sanafir which guard the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba. As part of the Camp David treaty these islands have been heavily mined (insane isnt it) to prevent anyone from accessing these most important islands.  \n\nWhoever controls these islands can choke off the Israeli port of Eilat and the Jordanian port of Aqaba which shares a border fence with Eilat.  \n\nLast year , t hese two islands were voluntarily handed over by the Egyptian government to Saudi Arab ia. The handover has caused significant protest inside Egypt. \n\nIsrael however has played a quiet but very big part in this handover.    \n\nFirst of all since the two islands are part of the Camp David treaty, the Egyptians and the Saudis had to get Israeli consent for the handover.  \n\nTh e Israelis have done so but with huge strings attached.  \n\nThe strings are attached to Gaza, Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Palestinian issue,  Jordan, Egypt,  Saudi Arabia,  Al Qaeda, ISIS,  Yemen, Hezbollah and Iran. And Donald Trump is also behind this ' ultimate deal'. \n\nHere is some news,  \n\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel consents to Egypt\u2019s return of two islands to Saudi \n\nRiyadh undertakes to respect relevant terms of Israeli-Egyptian peace deal. \n1967 Egypt blocked Strait of Tiran that prompted Middle East war.  \n1979 peace deal Cairo promised freedom of shipping in Aqaba and Eilat \ncommitment that Saudi will uphold when it takes over the islands \nEilat is Israel\u2019s only port in Gulf of Aqaba  \nAqaba is Jordan\u2019s sole outlet there. \nNow here is a well researched article by Jonathan Cook.  \nTruncated for 'slow learners' !! ( Just kidding). \n\nHow Israel gains from Egypt-Saudi Red Sea islands deal \nby Jonathan Cook  24 Jun 2017 \nTwo small, uninhabited islands, Tiran and Sanafir \nbetween Egypt, Saudi at mouth of Gulf of Aqaba.  \nhighly controversial , Egyptian parliament approved handover of islands to Saudi \nIn return, Riyadh to provide billions in loans , investments to Egypt\u2019s economy \nIsrael quietly gave blessing. \nmovement of vessels to Eilat hangs on 1979 peace treaty  \n\nEffectively, Riyadh responsible for treaty clauses  \nrelating to Israeli shipping through the Straits. \nhistoric hostility between Israel - Saudi obsolete \nIsrael much to gain from handover. \n\nbenefits include normal relations with Saudi  \nemerging Israeli-Arab front against Iran. \nfurther isolate Palestinian leadership in Gaza, West Bank \nIsrael to use leverage with Egypt/Saudi for imposing solution on Palestinians \npressure to accept arrangements on best terms for Israel. \nIsrael\u2019s increasingly tight ties with Cairo , Riyadh \nincreasingly relaxed attitude towards 1979 peace treaty Israel turned blind eye to Sinai\u2019s demilitarised status \nallowed ever-larger number of Egyptian troops into Sinai \nto deal with violent Islamist groups there  \nand blockade Gaza, alongside Israel\u2019s own siege. \nEgypt/Saudi coordinating in Sinai \nIsraeli drones fly over Sinai and share intel \nwidespread reports of Saudis/Israelis normalising trade, security , intel \nIsrael reported to be training Saudi army officers. \nIsrael/Saudi forging economic ties  \nIsraeli businesses to open in Gulf  \npermit Israeli aircraft fly through Saudi \nfurther tightening relations between Egypt, Saudi , Israel \nCairo/Riyadh revived 10km-long bridge at mouth of Gulf of Aqaba. rail and road link, transport goods to Egypt  \nthousands of jobs for Egyptian workers. plans to extend rail line between Saudi / Jordan / Israel. \nBonds between Israel / Saudi stronger under Mohammed Bin Salman Bin Salman\u2019s elevation \u201cdream come true\u201d for Israel.  Iran now biggest enemy \nSaudis believe they need Israel to help fight \nIsrael pushing for handover of Tiran and Sanafir islands to Riyadh. Israel prefers Saudi authority over islands  effectively tie Riyadh to 1979 Camp David peace treaty. \ncloser security arrangements between Israel, Saudi, Egypt , Jordan allow Israel closely involved in surveillance of ISIS in Sinai. \nSaudi now happy to go public with alliance with Israel \n\nIsrael will parlay Egyptian, Saudi help on Palestinian issue. Israel persuade Cairo, Riyadh to impose on Palestinians \nstrategy already has a name - \u201coutside-in\u201d approach. Israel stand better chance to realise deal more to its liking. \nArab countries prefer to focus on Iran over Palestinian issue.  \nPalestinians are a hurdle to regional strategy. \noutlines of US-Israeli-Saudi-Egyptian plan for Palestinians emerge. \n  \u201csecret program\u201d involve US, Europe, Egypt and Gulf states \nwould offer Hamas a mini-state in Gaza under Egypt \ncementing enclave\u2019s separation from West Bank \nEgypt, Saudi would use Mohammed Dahlan, rival to Abbas, as their man Earlier this month Hamas leaders met Dahlan in Cairo.  \n\nIn return, Arab states would pump millions into economy \nEgypt would open Rafah crossing to Gaza  \nincrease electricity supply to Gaza \nWest Bank become Jordan\u2019s responsibility. Amman won\u2019t be able to resist pressure from Saudi, Egypt, Israel, US \npressure Hamas into ceasefire and demilitarisation in return for aid. \nMy comments : Online media says t he two uninhabited islands of Tiran and Sanafir ar e being used for military training between Israel and Saudi Arabia. \n\nM y guess is Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman 's secret visit to Saudi Arabia in September was to sign this deal. The Israeli condition for Saudi Arabia to take over these two islands is that Saudi Arabia must step into the Camp David Treaty between Israel and Egypt and guarantee uninterrupted access to the sea lanes going up to the Israeli port of Eilat. \n\nIt is a backdoor \"official recognition\" of Israel by Saudi Arabia. \n\nIn return Israel will help Saudi Arabia fight Iran.  \nSaudi airspace is already open to the Israeli Airforce.  \n\nWhat happens to the Palestinians? \nGaza goes \"back\" to Egypt. \nThe West Bank will be more complicated. \nAfter a while all Gazans will have Egyptian passports and become Egyptians. \nArab West Bankers may become Jordanians. \nNo more Gaza. No more West Bank?? \nEnd of Palestinian problem. \n\nBottom line : t he Arabs are doing what they do best - sell each other out. \nSo janganlah orang Melayu begitu bodoh terpengaruh dengan onar pak arab padang pasir. \n\nRelak brader. Elok jaga tepi kain sendiri yang makin lama makin kotor dan koyak.  \nPiti makin habis. \n\nAlso do read this   \n\n  \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tipu melayu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st catherine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sinai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed dahlan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanafir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamed bin salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "piti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed bin salman bin salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dahlan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al qaeda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hezbollah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us marines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "multi national observer force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gaza and east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharm el sheikh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel   israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank  egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf of aqaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riyadh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza  west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camp david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aqaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt-saudi red sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eilat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi   riyadh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suez canal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank  israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "straits", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cairo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf of aqaba   aqaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sinai peninsula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:15.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18d7b6cf19ac17dd4143652d1985f07b6838880f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pkSOsKXlzarsALIPw6ATon30Z9PIdkNPu", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/o/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/o/ - Auto - 4chan", "title": "What oil and filter is in your car RIGHT NOW?

By Judy Lu and Rebecca Leppert   \nA new student group is pushing the University to create a more welcoming environment for commuter students. \nSophomore Sofia Alpizar, who commutes to campus every day from Potomac, Md., is leading the new group \u2013 the GW Commuters Students Association \u2013 which officially formed two weeks ago. She said the organization will help to build what is currently a nonexistent community for GW\u2019s commuter population and will advocate more commuter student representation on leadership organizations like the Student Association. \nShe said the organization will push to add resources like lounges in District House and the Marvin Center with refrigerators that would allow commuters to bring their lunches to campus. The group also wants to add personal lockers \u2013 so commuter students wouldn\u2019t need to trek all of their belongings back and forth every day \u2013 and Metro stipends, which would fund students\u2019 trips on the Metro each semester. \nGelman Library began offering personal storage lockers for rent on its fourth and fifth floors in 2016. That same year, the University rejected a proposed Metro program that would have given all students unlimited Metro rides for an added tuition fee. \n\u201cIf I have extra time, I can\u2019t just go back to my room. I have to find a space to hang out.\u201d \nAlpizar first came up with the idea for the organization when she met several other commuters during last year\u2019s Freshman Day of Service, an annual day of volunteer work for first-year students. After realizing there are no decided funds or common spaces for housing-exempt students, and no student representatives for the commuter community, Alpizar said she decided it was time for change. \n\u201cI really think if we all work together, we\u2019ll really increase awareness of our existence here,\u201d she said. \nThe University allows students to avoid the three-year on-campus housing requirement if they can prove they live outside the Foggy Bottom area, but within a commutable distance of campus, according to GW Housing. \nThe group will reach out to student organizations and academic departments and design Facebook pages to advertise the group. The group is also pairing up with the admissions office in hopes of appearing on student-led panels during spring admissions days to show prospective students that commuters have a vocal presence on campus, Alpizar said. \nThe organization has also been using Fordham University, an urban school with a large commuter population in New York City, as a model for some of their requests. Fordham gives its commuter students a $2,000 MetroCard stipend and has lounges and activities for commuters on campus. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s necessary for GW, being such an urban institution, to incorporate something similar and so we presented that model to the administration as well,\u201d Alpizar said. \nSophomore Jacob Folvag commutes from Arlington, Va. and said his transportation costs come to about $5 for every day that he attends class. Folvag said as a commuter, he has nowhere to go to relax between classes. \n\u201cIf I have extra time, I can\u2019t just go back to my room,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to find a space to hang out.\u201d \nThomas Germain, the assistant director of community support and leadership in the Center for Student Engagement, has been working as the group\u2019s adviser to brainstorm potential locations for lockers and a commuter lounge, Alpizar said. \nGermain said the CSE offered \u201csupport and guidance\u201d to Alpizar as she made the first steps to form the organization last spring to help ensure the longevity of the club. \n\u201cCSE staff will continue to work with this new organization to gain a better understanding of the needs of this important population at GW and support these students in helping them find their place as part of the GW community,\u201d he said in an email. \nAbel Amare, a sophomore who commutes from Gaithersburg, Md. and serves as vice president of the organization, said he hopes GW will provide a \u201chome\u201d or \u201cbase\u201d for commuters. He said the organization plans to host events like coffee time and study hours for commuters so that they can come together, talk and relax. \n\u201cIt definitely makes it hard to hang out with people or get involved with stuff that\u2019s going on on campus for sure.\u201d \nAmare said the organization is still struggling to figure out who the commuters are around campus because GW Housing cannot offer commuters\u2019 names out of privacy concerns. \n\u201cThe way you find out the person is a commuter is you talk to them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not easy to talk to strangers to figure out. I\u2019m not going to walk the downstairs and ask whether you are a commuter.\u201d \nSenior Rachael Helman, who commutes every day from Brown Hill, Va., said that becoming socially involved on campus can be particularly difficult for commuter students because many student groups require hefty time commitments and meet late at night. \n\u201cIt definitely makes it hard to hang out with people or get involved with stuff that\u2019s going on on campus for sure,\u201d she said. Proposed bullet train could create 15-minute commute to Baltimore from D.C. Students from cities like Philadelphia and New York may get a much shorter trip back to GW in the next few years.

Williams High School in Alexandria, Va. over the last year to establish a health academy that will educate high schoolers on topics across the medical field. News By Lauren Peller   \nVirginia high school students will soon be able to take college health care courses designed by faculty in the medical school as part of a new dual-enrollment program. \nFaculty in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences have been working with T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Va. over the last year to establish a health academy that will educate high schoolers on topics across the medical field. Officials say the program, which will launch next fall, aims to address a shortage in health care workers in the D.C. area and increase representation in the field. \nReamer Bushardt, the senior associate dean for health sciences in SMHS, said the partnership will train students for high-demand health care jobs and allow them to gain college credit from GW or other medical schools while sill in high school. He said the agreement between SMHS and Alexandria City Public Schools committed the two schools to run the academy for five years, but he hopes for a long-lasting partnership. \n\u201cMy expectation and hope are that our two organizations will partner for many years beyond that, and this academy is the tip of the iceberg in terms of innovative endeavors we can accomplish together,\u201d Bushardt said in an email. \n\u201cToday\u2019s health care workforce is not representative of American society.\u201d \nThe academy will enroll between 100 and 150 students each year, and high school teachers will lead the classes at T.C. Williams High School. Medical school faculty will help design the curriculum to ensure the classes meet both GW\u2019s standards and requirements set by the Virginia Department of Education. \nFaculty in both schools are working to flesh out curricula for seven potential career and technical education concentrations including pharmacy, nursing, surgical technology, biomedical informatics, sports medicine, energy emergency medical services and medical laboratory sciences, Bushardt said. \nHe said the program is designed to give students a number of options immediately after high school graduation, including work in entry-level health care positions. Students can also move on to Northern Virginia Community College to receive an associate\u2019s degree or transfer into SMHS through a guaranteed admission program, having already earned credits toward a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nStudents who apply and are accepted into the academy can earn up to 22 college credits from GW, beginning as early as ninth grade, while meeting their high school graduation requirements. Bushardt said accepted students will complete a summer bridge program, supported by the medical school, which will prepare them for the difficulty of college-level courses. \nSMHS has had a relationship with T.C. Williams High School since Qing Zeng, the director of GW\u2019s Biomedical Informatics Center and a professor of clinical research and leadership, worked with students there on a project to create video games that address issues in adolescent health, Bushardt said. \nHe said the academy \u201cis an opportunity to increase the diversity and cultural competency of the health care workforce in our region.\u201d T.C. Williams High School maintains one of the lowest counselor-to-student ratios in the country and draws from a population that is racially, economically and ethnically diverse, he added. \n\u201cToday\u2019s health care workforce is not representative of American society, and that is working against the ultimate goal of ensuring every person in America has the opportunity to achieve his or her optimal health,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt will enable ACPS students to access college with credit and potential scholarships.\u201d \nOfficials said the program aims to address a shortage of health care workers in Virginia and D.C. Bushardt said the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, has boosted the number of patients who have health insurance and that the demand for care has also increased. \nJobs in health care are projected to grow 18 percent through 2026, adding about 2.3 million new jobs to the U.S. economy, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Still, Helen Lloyd, the communications director at Alexandria City Public Schools, said medical school faculty wanted to make a larger investment in the future of the medical workforce. \n\u201cGWU considers this an intellectual investment with hopes that ACPS students matriculate to the School of Medicine and Health Sciences upon completion of any of the seven pathways,\u201d she said. \nShe said that through the academy, officials hope to grow the number of industry certifications awarded to high school students and provide internships, mentorships, and clinical and cooperative experiences. \n\u201cThis partnership is incredibly positive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will enable ACPS students to access college with credit and potential scholarships. It will also enable GWU and ACPS to be able to contribute to the shortage of health workers across the region and country.\u201d  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bushardt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qing zeng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reamer bushardt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helen lloyd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c. bushardt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "medical", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandria city public schools", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gwu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biomedical informatics center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. bureau of labor statistics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "acps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia department of education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern virginia community college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school of medicine and health sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "t.c. williams high school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "va.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauren peller    virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:15.049+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6aad45acefa86297d01f07eee799be6fbd2fa13b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8sqLyKX_Vcy8nELX1oh5uM9p5oEP93xJRiqSANI.StT3_aoqHjV5G_KKPuIv9MRSd9scW5_8YlGNaAEuveLwfSzXWcNaViDzml54yIVJHaddEh7MPQ_G0HUJcY2u5JlyKRb.TLAJHVjV3QXlqa3KnjdoxYWi1ECc-", "site_full": "www.gwhatchet.com", "site": "gwhatchet.com", "site_section": "http://www.gwhatchet.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The GW Hatchet", "title": "University opposes planned net neutrality rollback, citing equal access to internet", "title_full": "University opposes planned net neutrality rollback, citing equal access to internet", "published": "2017-12-07T07:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.gwhatchet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/FCC_GS-1000x670.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6aad45acefa86297d01f07eee799be6fbd2fa13b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8sqLyKX_Vcy8nELX1oh5uM9p5oEP93xJRiqSANI.StT3_aoqHjV5G_KKPuIv9MRSd9scW5_8YlGNaAEuveLwfSzXWcNaViDzml54yIVJHaddEh7MPQ_G0HUJcY2u5JlyKRb.TLAJHVjV3QXlqa3KnjdoxYWi1ECc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Meredith Roaten", "published": "2017-12-07T07:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "University opposes planned net neutrality rollback, citing equal access to internet", "text": "University opposes planned net neutrality rollback, citing equal access to internet Media Credit: Graeme Sloan | Hatchet Photographer The University came out against the Federal Communication Commission's recent decision to repeal federal regulations governing internet delivery, saying the proposal would negatively impact equal access to information online. News By Annie Dobler   \nThe University came out against the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s recent decision to repeal federal regulations governing internet delivery, saying the proposal would negatively impact equal access to information online. \nThe FCC announced a repeal of federal policies meant to ensure equal access to the internet \u2013 known as net neutrality \u2013 last month. Professors said the repeal could allow internet service providers to charge for access to some sites, which could constrict faculty and student use of the internet. \nNet neutrality is the principle that internet service providers treat all internet websites and data equally. Protections to safeguard net neutrality were put into place by the Obama administration in 2015. \nLast month, the Trump administration\u2019s new FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, announced plans to overturn the regulations to prevent individual states from creating their own rules and decrease government regulation of business, a decision that sparked a nationwide debate about the value of a free internet. \nUniversity spokeswoman Maralee Csellar said GW supports net neutrality and that the planned rollback \u201cis counter to the concept of equal access to information, content and collaborators.\u201d \n\u201cFree, open, and equal access to services on the internet promotes knowledge attainment, free thinking, collaboration, innovation, and entrepreneurship,\u201d she said in an email. \nCsellar said the University is monitoring the rollback attempts and the FCC\u2019s planned Dec. 14 vote on the issue. \n\u201cShould any changes occur, we will work to mitigate any negative impacts on students, faculty and staff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe continue to receive updates from various higher education professional associations.\u201d \nEarlier this year, the American Council of Education and other higher education groups asked the FCC to uphold net neutrality because accessibility to the internet is important to the work that students, faculty, staff and researchers conduct. \nNima Zahadat, a professor of data science, information systems security and digital forensics, said the rollback of net neutrality will allow internet service providers to offer different internet speeds to companies and individuals \u2013 and to charge more money. \nHe said the move will impact students because websites they use will be forced to pay more for access to their internet, which could result in higher costs for the University when providing internet access to students. \n\u201cMy students utilize a lot of services like Amazon Web Services, so what\u2019s going to happen is Amazon is going to be forced to raise their prices, which means it\u2019s going to cost the University more money,\u201d he said. \u201cHow that will play out for our students is it will probably be a hike in tuition, or various fee to pay for it.\u201d \nZahadat added that these changes will likely not impact distance learning if students are mainly using Blackboard and downloading lectures. But if students have to stream videos from websites like Blackboard, he said they may have to pay more. \nResearch will also be affected because many professors rely on web services that providers could potentially charge more to use, he said. \n\u201cOur research depends on having access to high-speed connection, and it will definitely impact us and all the partners that we\u2019re working with that require high-speed access,\u201d Zahadat said. \u201cWe will all be impacted because we\u2019re going to start paying a lot more money for having this access.\u201d \nDavid Alan Grier, an associate professor of international science and technology policy and international affairs, said video streaming services like Netflix \u2013 which many film classes rely on \u2013 will be \u201cgreatly impacted,\u201d if internet service providers raise prices. \n\u201cISPs will say \u2018if you want to have the same access we give our stuff, you\u2019re going to have to pay for it,\u2019 so it\u2019s going to be differential pricing services in a way that we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d he said. \nUnless people see marked changes to the internet or major price hikes, Grier said the planned repeal will not have a huge impact, despite the wave of backlash following the FCC\u2019s announcement. \n\u201cMy feeling is that there is going to be a big flurry over it, and unless we see something like rising cable bills that we have seen or radical straightening of very popular sites, there\u2019s going to be grumbling or complaining but we\u2019re going to buy it,\u201d he said. \nTad Miller, a junior majoring in computer science and president of GW Cyber, a student organization that focuses on software and hardware security, said repealing net neutrality will allow internet service providers to charge different rates to visit different websites like Facebook, Netflix or Google. \nHe said he is particularly concerned about how the proposal will affect his ability to do research as a student. \n\u201cOn a personal level, for doing homework or whatnot, if you\u2019re on your house network and you want to go on Google Scholar or something like that, and you don\u2019t have the package, that could have a major impact because you can\u2019t look at that content, you\u2019re not allowed to load it,\u201d he said.

The cards, designed as a stand-up Christmas jumper, have all been personalised by each child with their own Kenning poem. \nThe Year 7s from Wellington School in Timperley held a Christmas card competition and Home Instead were on hand this week to choose a winner. Ines Starbuck won the competition and her card will be printed to go alongside the donated gifts. Home Instead are also going to use Ines\u2019 design for their own Christmas cards this year. \nDeputy Head Teacher, Elizabeth Copeland said: As part of our 80th anniversary celebrations, Wellington School were given the opportunity by Home Instead Senior Care to take part in a Christmas card competition. The whole of year 7 were invited to enter the competition, and although a winner has been selected, the entries were so brilliant that they will all be sent with presents to go out to the elderly.\u201d \nAlan Savage, owner of Home Instead Altrincham and Sale commented on the school's involvement. \nHe said: \u201cThank you so much to Heyes Lane Primary School, Wellington Road School, Altrincham College of Arts, and Broomwood Primary School for supporting our \u2018Be a Santa to a Senior\u2019 campaign. \n\u201cIt is heart-warming to see the community banding together to support our very own elderly community members, and we know that the donated gifts and homemade cards will make a big difference to those who might be lonely at this time of year.

The set, created by Cheryl deWardener, was all hand painted, from the beautiful hardwood floors to the golden swirls on the blue walls. The costumes were everything I had hoped them to be, with more simple and light colored dresses for the younger women, and more sparkles and bolder dresses for the older women. The men all had, as J. Edward Clarke says, \u201cpenguin suits!\u201d and these costumes, created by David T. Howard, really helped the audience solidify the world that Wilde had created. \nOf course, without anyone to play the roles the set and costumes would be for naught. Fortunately though, Lady Windermere, played by Emily Turtle, soon makes her appearance as she talks to her friends on her birthday, from the handsome Lord Darlington, played by Daniel F. Greene, to the hysterical and no-nonsense Duchess of Berwick, played by Valerie Ferris, followed closely behind by her daughter. \nThis show is about Lady Windermere, who is told that her husband is having an affair with a woman named Mrs. Erlynne, and although she tries her hardest not to believe it, it seems too true. Later, at her birthday party her husband invites the woman against her wishes, causing Lady Windermere to make a drastic decision. The audience soon finds out the Mrs. Erlynne is not who we thought her to be and the audience breathes a sigh of relief that Lord Windermere is a faithful and loving husband all along. As Mrs. Erlynne saves Lady Windermere from a tricky situation, the show ends back in the first room of the show and Mrs. Erlynne and Lord Augustus leave London, leaving the Windermere\u2019s and a few kept secrets behind. \nI had interviewed some of the actors and actresses who performed in the show, and it was very fun talking about their characters with them. Speaking with Emily Turtle, J Edward Clarke and John T. Cunha, I asked them how they connected with their characters, and for Turtle, she said the toughest part of it was thinking of the etiquette of the time, what they wore, how they held themselves and how to be proper overall. She also said that she admired Lady Windermere because she has always stayed true to herself, and she feels very strongly about what she believes in. \nClarke said it was pretty fun for him because Lord Windermere is a very analytical man, from how he speaks, to why he does what he does. Overall everything he does in the show is for his wife, and in the goodness of his heart, because, \u201cwe all have people in our lives we would do anything for.\u201d \nFinally Cunha gave an excellent analysis of his goofy character, saying that because Lord Augustus is an older man, who has been divorced a few times, he has become sick of all the gossip, which Cunha says is funny because \u201ceveryone back then were just as bad as [we are] today\u201d. All his character really wants is to simply find a good woman. \nOverall this play was beautifully told, through english accents, the beautiful costumes and set, and, of course, how the actors brought the story to life. \nThe show still has one more performance on Dec. 10 at 2 p.m. SHARE ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lady winderm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kayla michaud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cheryl dewardener", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clarke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turtle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david t. howard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lady windermere", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel f. greene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erlynne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j edward clarke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john t. cunha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. edward clarke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "augustus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valerie ferris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cunha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emily turtle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oscar wilde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryna wortman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of rhode island theatre", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uri theater", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lord windermere", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darlington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "windermere", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berwick", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:16.184+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15124561, "moreResultsAvailable": 15124461, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512639136184&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 665}
