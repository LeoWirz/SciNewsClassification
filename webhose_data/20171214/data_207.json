GTX 765M isn't exactly amazing, though it handled DOOM like a champ. I don't know if MSI is just good at putting together good computers or if it's the i7 CPU/12 GB of RAM I have or what, but it's chugging along handily.\nMeanwhile, my wife's new 'puter is an MSI that's similar specs to mine, but a GTX1060 and .2Ghz more processor speed and an SSD for loading the OS, and she's barely gotten to play anything on it at all.\nYeah, I recall yours was a little bit ahead of my old one. Is that 765M soldered in, or could you upgrade it to a 780M or something? That would give it a bit of a boost if you could. The i7 (not sure which gen you have but I'd guess at 3rd?) and the 12GB is still enough for most stuff. The GPU is always where these things start bottlenecking first. The 1060 is definitely where her machine has a massive advantage.\nI think Doom was supposed to be a pretty well-optimized game if I remember right.\nSteam: JazzMX5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://steamcommunity.com/id/jazzmx5", "http://i.imgur.com/ABqjEVo.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:24.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ca24ac9408ee08743b63cb75aec7f7c00b34119", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9cVsry0F0PBOo_IAfIocV2w0TXE3YLzGuw7WHiVPynif46PZ1xapgH0Z2aVj2M8qUpUiVElIwwVi6bYLrjfiMvLEFwx4_2MmL3abejYjU.eYJU3uXxMU2gHkO5AfufUJuzw3BLGPLkQw--", "site_full": "www.briefreport.co.uk", "site": "briefreport.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.newsrt.co.uk/feed.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BriefReport.co.uk", "title": "Bridget Phillipson MP: Improvements must be made in patient care", "title_full": "Bridget Phillipson MP: Improvements must be made in patient care", "published": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i.briefreport.co.uk/upload/news/large/17/49/Spo_image.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ca24ac9408ee08743b63cb75aec7f7c00b34119", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9cVsry0F0PBOo_IAfIocV2w0TXE3YLzGuw7WHiVPynif46PZ1xapgH0Z2aVj2M8qUpUiVElIwwVi6bYLrjfiMvLEFwx4_2MmL3abejYjU.eYJU3uXxMU2gHkO5AfufUJuzw3BLGPLkQw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "Bridget Phillipson MP: Improvements must be made in patient care", "text": "Bridget Phillipson MP: Improvements must be made in patient care \nOver the last two years, I\u2019ve worked as a member of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to hold the government to account on how taxpayers\u2019 money is spent across a range of areas, from schools to hospitals, and security to social care.

It has been the place of many celebrations over the last 10 years: from my graduation dinner to celebratory drinks when it was confirmed that we were going to be opening Le Pointu with the guys almost two years ago. I love to think about just how many peoples\u2019 special memories this place must be home to. \nFor years, the moment they put up their Christmas lights and stuck that oversized bow on the front of the building, the whole of Lausanne knew it was Christmas time. You may be pleased to hear that they have done away with the bow and the reindeer this year (I know, I know it is probably for the best, although I really hate to admit it), but that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s any less Christmassy. \nHowever hard our lovely little town tries to get us in the Christmas spirit, year after year, the run up to Christmas is mental. Until we shut down our computers and take time off for Christmas, I feel like we just keep focusing on ticking things off the list and wrapping projects up. \nThis year I have taken on a lot of work for the months of November and December and it has meant many a sleepless night writing lists and lists of lists of all the things I have to get done by the end of the year. \nLast week, Clive and I spent an evening after a very tough week at the CBE Spa as a little treat and it was lovely. It sort of reminded me that things will just get done and that I will get through my lists, but that taking time out is so important. \nI was treated to a deep tissue massage at the spa which was absolutely out of this world, and just what I needed before a weekend of cooking for hundreds of people at Le Pointu . We then just hung out in the jacuzzi and spa for a couple of hours. \nAfter the spa, we wrapped up warm and headed outside the Palace for a hot drink and an indulgent truffle fondue at La for\u00eat du Palace . \nThe Palace have decorated the whole of the outside space with fairy lights and the team have a small selection of hot food and drinks that some straight out from their little chalet. \nThe fondue was divine and just what we needed before heading to the B\u00f4 No\u00ebl Christmas market for drinks with friends. \nI really want to make sure that over the next two weeks (not even!!) before Christmas, I\u2019m being productive but also taking time out to enjoy the festivities of my very favourite time of the year. \nIf you\u2019re looking to treat yourself, here are a few things I have enjoyed or am looking forward to this season: \nAt The Lausanne Palace Take some time out of a busy weekend for Afternoon Tea with a glass of champagne in hand or wrap up warm and share a truffle fondue at La for\u00eat du Palace with friends \nAt The Beau-Rivage Palace : take your little ones (or simply go yourself if like me, you\u2019re a five year old at heart) to toast marshmallows on the open fire and make sure to stop by the Places We Love Christmas Market on 10th December where you\u2019ll get to know all sort of high end artisanal brands from Western Switzerland and perhaps find a last minute Christmas gift or two! \nI hope you aren\u2019t too stressed out and are taking time to relax from time to time!

Nujaba, mostly made up of Iraqis, has about 10,000 fighters, according to Reuters data. Being a part of the Iran-backed Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), the group is considered to be one of the most important militias in Iraq. In November, Ted Poe from the US House of Representatives proposed imposing \u201c terrorism-related sanctions\u201d on Nujaba. The text of the document says Nujaba is \u201can affiliated faction\u201d of the US-designated foreign terrorist organization Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, which also fights with the PMF. Nujaba\u2019s leader Akram al-Kaabi was earlier designated by the Department of the Treasury \u201cfor threatening the peace and stability of Iraq.\u201d The bill claims Kaabi took part in \u201cmultiple mortar and rocket attacks \u201d on the Green Zone in Baghdad in 2008. Click to expand... Sorry guys, you are too late. Americans themselves take care of that. Country: Location: Very unrealistic. Al-Abadi, who invited the US back to Iraq, will not agree with such actions. Most of the PMU is following the orders of Al-Abadi. If they step out of line he will actively deal with them as Iraq cannot afford to do otherwise. Without US air support, Daesh would still be around in Iraq. Iraq and Iraqis need to rebuilt the country, turn inwards and solve their own challenges before engaging in hazardous actions that will harm them. They have suffered enough. This is why Iraq is opening up to their Arab brothers and neighboring Arab countries officially and when it comes to private firms. Many landmark deals are signed between Saudi Arabian companies and Iraqi ones, businessmen from both countries and the two governments. Same story with other Arab countries. This is most welcome news and a new page in the unbreakable relationship must be turned. Pressure is better used more wisely and in a more calculated fashion but it requires Muslim states to speak with one tongue.

Although convoluted, the bbc likes to pretend it is not official saud and qatari policy to fund these groups so as to avoid awkward questions when the west sell them another billions dollars worth of weapons.

Add to wishlist, play later.\nI mean, this seems overly optimistic about my financial situation and ability to upgrade my PC.\nNot overly. I mean, how long do computers usually last you? Because I think 6 years has been the longest a computer has lasted me. And then you kinda gotta scrounge or knock over a convenience store or rob a bank or something to get a new one.\nAnd at that point, the game's what, 20 bucks? I mean, unless it's Activision, then it's what, 50 bucks?\nIf you two want to post some specs in the PC Build Thread, we can give you some ideas. While technology marches ever forward, relatively recent components have aged quite well. For example, the i7 2600 from 2011 is only just now bottlenecking recent games. The GPUs are doing *that much* of the heavy lifting. And in regards to GPUs, you can get a GTX 1050 for right around $100 US (or less, if you hunt for sales) that will run most games on moderate settings.\nAlso, despite the fact many people approach their PCs like a console (i.e. replace it whole cloth), certain components age quite well. For example, the PSU I bought for my first major build in 2007 is powering my current rig (i5 4th gen; GTX 1080 that I bought after saving up birthday and Christmas gift cards) without a hiccup.\nCaveat: prices are shitty right now because RAM is currently a significant portion of a build budget (but this is expected to fix itself within the next year), and there are new gens of both Intel and AMD CPUs with high demand.\nGenerally, I treat my PC as a console because I need it to be portable, so I get the larger laptops, the 17.3-inch ones, usually. Big enough for a full keyboard, but compact enough to pop into a case and take somewhere, with a screen big enough to see mostly what I'm doing, most of the time.\nEventually I'd be interested in a desktop, I'm sure, but only if it's super portable, which then, why have a desktop PC?\nThough I also don't know the first thing about building a computer, and find even the notion of it daunting in the extreme.\nIt\u2019s really not that bad. You set a budget, pick a cpu, then play match the numbers/hardware sockets until you use up your budget. And omg it\u2019s so fun to put a new pc together. Most of the installing driver pains are a thing of the past... mostly. Now it\u2019s just figuring out how to get windows 10 on a clean disk if you did the free upgrade.\nLaptops are definitely great for portability but being able to upgrade a single part or small subset of parts to improve performance is always great.

Almost in direct opposition to ARK.\nLaptops can usually take at least some limited upgrades. CPUs, usually not. RAM and storage, usually but not always, but bigger form factors are more likely to let you, especially 17\" gaming laptops. When it comes to GPUs, some models will let you, older ones at least. I don't know of any current ones that can, I think they've all gone soldered now. Your machine's relative age may well be a plus point here.\nThe GPU on my old one (the one with the AMD 6990M) was on a small daughterboard - I forget the name of the form factor, but it has one, it's standardised at least to a point - and it had an edge connector like any other card. Just unscrew a single screw and the whole thing could be pulled right out. (I actually had to do that once when the laptop stopped recognising it; it just needed reseating for some weird reason.) I know for a fact there was a 780M board that could fit into that machine, although it apparently took some serious fiddling with hacked drivers or something to get it to work because that laptop wasn't expecting such a then-new card so it wasn't officially supported, so I didn't attempt it. Yours already having a GTX 7xx series GPU would probably be perfectly fine, probably wouldn't even need to fiddle with drivers (I may of course be utterly wrong on that last point). If, to reiterate, it's not soldered in.\nThere's a laptops thread over in the Tech subforum where people far more knowledgeable than I might be able to help. Of course there's the PC build thread as well but that tends to be more about desktops for obvious reasons.\nSteam: JazzMX5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://steamcommunity.com/id/jazzmx5", "http://i.imgur.com/ABqjEVo.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:24.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48bcb322d9a7cc8dccc72197ae71d85342bddc54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl84_CVYRfttwAZIZZmM.cRBLhzaylCNGhe4GQj2GnLjCDT97g12Sx6IUqJl24zDeNaHQTRVcSo_Y", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "Put your fate in the hands of [Steam]! 19", "title_full": "Put your fate in the hands of [Steam]! - Page 19 \u2014 Penny Arcade", "published": "2017-12-06T13:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/8DDBNVR065TV.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8253, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a608003a82477dba933e7190104ff5e6a17ff380", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl84_CVYRfttwAZIZZmM.cRBLhzaylCNGhe4GQj2GnLjCDT97g12Sx6IUqJl24zDeNRiggZ6wkxjNogEEviVPOGM-", "ord_in_thread": 27, "author": "Jazz", "published": "2017-12-07T07:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Steel Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Steel Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Man, I wish I could just, like, put my computer's specs into Steam so it would stop recommending games that I cannot run at all.\nEspecially since they all look so good. Add to wishlist, play later.\nI mean, this seems overly optimistic about my financial situation and ability to upgrade my PC.\nNot overly. I mean, how long do computers usually last you? Because I think 6 years has been the longest a computer has lasted me. And then you kinda gotta scrounge or knock over a convenience store or rob a bank or something to get a new one.\nAnd at that point, the game's what, 20 bucks? I mean, unless it's Activision, then it's what, 50 bucks?\nIf you two want to post some specs in the PC Build Thread, we can give you some ideas. While technology marches ever forward, relatively recent components have aged quite well. For example, the i7 2600 from 2011 is only just now bottlenecking recent games. The GPUs are doing *that much* of the heavy lifting. And in regards to GPUs, you can get a GTX 1050 for right around $100 US (or less, if you hunt for sales) that will run most games on moderate settings.\nAlso, despite the fact many people approach their PCs like a console (i.e. replace it whole cloth), certain components age quite well. For example, the PSU I bought for my first major build in 2007 is powering my current rig (i5 4th gen; GTX 1080 that I bought after saving up birthday and Christmas gift cards) without a hiccup.\nCaveat: prices are shitty right now because RAM is currently a significant portion of a build budget (but this is expected to fix itself within the next year), and there are new gens of both Intel and AMD CPUs with high demand.\nGenerally, I treat my PC as a console because I need it to be portable, so I get the larger laptops, the 17.3-inch ones, usually. Big enough for a full keyboard, but compact enough to pop into a case and take somewhere, with a screen big enough to see mostly what I'm doing, most of the time.\nEventually I'd be interested in a desktop, I'm sure, but only if it's super portable, which then, why have a desktop PC?\nThough I also don't know the first thing about building a computer, and find even the notion of it daunting in the extreme.\nIt\u2019s really not that bad. You set a budget, pick a cpu, then play match the numbers/hardware sockets until you use up your budget. And omg it\u2019s so fun to put a new pc together. Most of the installing driver pains are a thing of the past... mostly. Now it\u2019s just figuring out how to get windows 10 on a clean disk if you did the free upgrade.\nLaptops are definitely great for portability but being able to upgrade a single part or small subset of parts to improve performance is always great. Plus no bloatware!\nHow fun it is really depends on how good you are with your hands. Sometimes snaking wires into parts of the case to get them out of the way of fans and whatnot makes me glad I'm as dextrous as I am as someone with fatter fingers would pinch or cut something.\nIt's not hard IMO and akin to putting together a larger LEGO set or a Gundam model but some people can find that tough. And wire management and the connectors between the motherboard and case buttons/LEDs can be a bit bewildering for a first time builder.\nI'd peg it as an afternoon into evening project for most people.\nI would like to have a punt at building a PC one of these days. I've owned a fair few desktop systems and done basic upgrades to several of them, mostly RAM, HDDs etc although I did upgrade the CPU in my old 486 from an SX-25 to a DX2-66 (awesome!) but that's all.\nBefore I built my first PC, I'd done some upgrades of disc drives, hard drives, and graphics cards. The only really new thing about a whole system is the aforementioned wire management (power supplies have A LOT of wires) and the wires that connect the motherboard to the case itself. Motherboards and fans aren't really much different from drives, they just have more screws and things to plug in.\nA friend of mine in the States recently bought a new PC, desktop. He got it built for him by a local-to-him place, and when I saw pictures of it I just grinned; the thing is in the most nondescript, boring looking tower I can imagine, not even minimalist chic, but it's the real deal inside. Coffee Lake CPU, 1080, etc, but it looks like it was bought at an office clearance sale. It's a sleeper. It was a deliberate choice. I have to say, I like his style. \"She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid\", and all that. Now he just needs to make a \"few special modifications [him]self\" and we can truly call it the Falcon.\nI've told him he should find an old 3.5\" floppy drive to put in it just to make it look even less like a modern gaming PC. He made a point of putting a DVD drive in it, despite knowing he'll probably never use it.\nJazz on December 6\nSteam: JazzMX5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/752/nKRW43NRIDT4K.jpg", "http://steamcommunity.com/id/jazzmx5", "http://i.imgur.com/ABqjEVo.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:24.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eac3d325ac80d0b4f820affbde63813580db8a54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5rUY47JSFNcuWn9r_c5QsxzRnvJZuWuSMI4OCwpFkzWhvGcXHQfr2RMgOo8bDs.Hdo5kO6fPYvhj47qrAdG05ztNmLn7fWyv.HjAZG2PecfPIS5j3eahWfWBfCm6NraktT7dDE.sjG.E2dxkJyxG.vemvi4IKUbU-", "site_full": "defence.pk", "site": "defence.pk", "site_section": "http://defence.pk/forums/-/index.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Pakistan Defence", "title": "Why anti-corruption drive in Saudi Arabia spells bad news for Bangladesh's Khaleda Zia", "title_full": "Why anti-corruption drive in Saudi Arabia spells bad news for Bangladesh's Khaleda Zia", "published": "2017-12-07T10:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "PK", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://smedia2.intoday.in/dailyo/1.0.19/user//201610/arun_100716025427.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23494, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eac3d325ac80d0b4f820affbde63813580db8a54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5rUY47JSFNcuWn9r_c5QsxzRnvJZuWuSMI4OCwpFkzWhvGcXHQfr2RMgOo8bDs.Hdo5kO6fPYvhj47qrAdG05ztNmLn7fWyv.HjAZG2PecfPIS5j3eahWfWBfCm6NraktT7dDE.sjG.E2dxkJyxG.vemvi4IKUbU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "khakhi_chaddi (invalid@example.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "Why anti-corruption drive in Saudi Arabia spells bad news for Bangladesh's Khaleda Zia", "text": "Why anti-corruption drive in Saudi Arabia spells bad news for Bangladesh's Khaleda Zia The previous BNP government encouraged religious extremist forces against India. SHANTANU MUKHARJI Khaleda Zia's possible complicity in money-laundering , corruption and bribery are definitely going to cast a shadow on her political prospects in the near future. According to the Saudi authorities, Khaleda Zia and her sons had an investment of around $12 billion in malls and other infrastructural projects in Saudi Arabia with the money amassed through bribery and extortion. Besides Khaleda, there are 19 others names. Prominent among them are Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. Yet, from the Indian point of view, it's the charges against Khaleda Zia that merit a special examination because of the direct political implications for India. As investigations are underway, more facts have surfaced about huge investments by the BNP chief's late son Arafat alias Koko, who died in January 2015. Koko allegedly made enormous investments in Saudi Arabia - all from ill-gotten wealth. He was also wanted in Bangladesh for multiple charges of corruption. Similarly, his brother Tareq Rahman, now in hiding in England, invested several millions of dollars in many foreign destinations with a large chunk of sum in Saudi Arabia and other West Asian countries. Earlier, there were allegations, many supported by evidence, that Tareq had nefarious dealings, including money-laundering and large investments, with the underworld dons, detrimental to Indian security interests. Image: Reuters photo These underworld mafia are wanted in India, but Tareq, inspired by Pakistani machinations, developed a nexus with them to pinprick India to remain politically active apparently by destabilising Indian security interests. This was particularly conspicuous during the BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) rule dominating the Bangladesh polity from 2001-2006. The BNP and Jamaat partnership was aimed at hitting India below the belt and JeI inroads into Saudi Arabia was a hard reality which not only saw a spiralling growth of Islamic fundamentalism in Bangladesh, but also witnessed abetment of terror and patronage to numerous terror and religious extremist forces making Bangladesh a country on way to becoming fanatic and anti-India. In other words, investments into Saudi Arabia and the UAE by the Khaleda Zia regime was essentially designed to foment terror inside India and by implication, terror groups in India got a boost, both psychological and financial. It's worth recalling that it's the BNP-JeI regime which facilitated Indian insurgent groups finding refuge on the Bangladeshi soil. First, from 1991 to 1996 during its first stint and subsequently again in the second from 2001 to 2006. Indian insurgent groups, the ULFA, NSCN (I-M), PLA and other Manipuri outfits found a safe haven in Bangladesh, thanks to the state-sponsored backing as the government and the ruling coalition were following a Pakistani-Saudi diktat of needling India and keeping it on toes. Significantly, ULFA strongman Paresh Baruah was living in Dhaka under different aliases with the uninhibited backing of the then Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI). On numerous occasions, Indian intelligence officers confronted their Bangladeshi counterparts with photos and other incriminating evidence showing existence of the Indian insurgents' training camps and pin-pointed whereabouts of Paresh Baruah. However, each time Bangladesh was on a denial mode. Tareq Rahman, according to experts, was part of this blueprint in order to cause problems for India. These investments in Saudi Arabia, possibly yielded returns to fund terror and extremism in India, including money-laundering. Now, that crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is on an aggressive tirade to root out corruption from Saudi Arabia by already arresting 11 princes and several erstwhile ministers, his fresh move to investigate through banks, financial institutions and other channels to reach at the bottom of money-laundering, is a welcome move. In light of the above, it is incumbent upon the Indian authorities, especially the intelligence agencies, to fish out from their archives all the inputs available linked to investments of Khaleda and Tareq in underworld activities in West Asia and share them appropriately with the Saudi authorities. Such a gesture will show India in good light collaborating with Saudis to fight corruption, winning enormous goodwill. Any Indian move in this direction will also strengthen Sheikh Hasina in her ongoing measures to delve into details of Khaleda and Tareq investments on all offshore assets. On September 13, Hasina disclosed about her plans to unearth such money-laundering ventures. Also, any Indian professional aid will help nail Khaleda Zia and her prospects of making a political comeback. It will also help Hasina, thus forging more closer and warmer ties with India. The international media, on the other hand, has gone on an offensive propaganda blitz exposing Khaleda Zia and her sons' involvement in these nefarious deals. Most recently, Arab-based TV channel Global Intelligence Network (GIN) along with a Canadian channel went overboard in naming Khaleda Zia and others for their involvement in these scams. It's time, therefore, for Hasina to strike operationally as it will then \"neutralise\" Khaleda as the former's principal adversary. As far as India is concerned, Khaleda Zia will have no or very little chances of political survival and without her, India can hope to breathe easy without having to worry much about security. With media and public opinion against Khaleda Zia, India can turn the current crisis in BNP to its advantage.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:24.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b7f47c192f9072603e21cc425141e23ce618c980", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Udh3ggjlyIDvsfocBMjCEbcxeYykST_cqXQT4HiMiUxUlojLhIa1jYTjATtbOWjiQ3tUOUVAF0KvPft49iJbzHJ", "site_full": "db-tek.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://db-tek.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "DB-TECH", "title": "Google Alert - Microsoft", "title_full": "Google Alert - Microsoft", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b7f47c192f9072603e21cc425141e23ce618c980", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Udh3ggjlyIDvsfocBMjCEbcxeYykST_cqXQT4HiMiUxUlojLhIa1jYTjATtbOWjiQ3tUOUVAF0KvPft49iJbzHJ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Db Tech (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - Microsoft", "text": "Microsoft As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS Microsoft expanding locally; avoids traffic, housing requirements The Daily Post Microsoft's plans to expand its Mountain View outpost by 128,000 square feet over the next year will not be accompanied by any employee housing or traffic mitigation measures in the already-squeezed North Bayshore area, city leaders told the Post. \"The project is zoning-compliant, so we didn't impose ...

Without your consent! Click to expand... Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2017 is the new bomb that may be dropped on commoners by the Modi government. What is this bill all about and how is it going to affect you? In June 2017, the Central government approved the FRDI Bill which is intended to frame new rules for banks that are failing. It has created panic among savings account holders. According to the Bill, if a bank is failing, may be allowed to use depositors' money to stay afloat. What this means is that the bank can reduce its liability of paying its depositors, that is you, by either locking your money for a longer time or asking you to take a hit on your deposits. Currently, your deposit in the bank is insured up to a specified limit.According to the 1961 Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, up to Rs 1 lakh of your money deposited in a bank is insured if a bank were to fail. In practice, however, the Reserve Bank has ensured that this never happens. Failing, or weak banks, have been merged or allowed to be taken over by healthier banks including their liabilities. But the proposed banking reforms bill will change that. That, some say, will give government banks, private banks and insurance agencies more power over your money. FYI | What is a bail-in? The Bill provides for \"bail-in\" powers to banks. A rescuing body known as Resolution Corporation has been proposed under the Bill which can use your money in case the bank sinks.This is different from a traditional bailout in which government's money helps bank tide over the crisis. In case of a bail-in, it is the bank's own deposits (that is your money) that is used to rescue the bank or reduce its liabilities. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? When you deposit money in a bank or invest in fixed deposits, you trust the bank with keeping your money safe, forever. Even a remote possibility of you having to lose it all or even part of it for no fault of yours is disturbing. We take you through 10 steps which will help you understand the Bill: TAKE A LOOK: Under Section 52 of the FRDI Bill, the rescue body can cancel even the Rs 1 lakh insurance that you get under the current law. In this case, a bank can even declare that they don't owe you any money at all. The same Section provides an option to the rescue body to modify a bank's liability. For example, if you deposit a certain amount of money for a certain period of time as savings (say, 5 or 10 years), the bank can keep the money in a locked-in period (in a FD) and change the time period without consulting you. According to the bill, the bank may be exempted to fulfill its promises to depositors in extreme cases. This means you lose all your money. This can happen in case of an economic downturn, when banks (who provide money to large corporations who are unable to repay the amount) ask for a bail-in option. The bank may turn your savings into a fixed deposit without asking you and that too at a lower interest rate and you cannot even challenge it, unless, you challenge the law. This is the first time that a Bill of this sort has been proposed in India. However, it has happened before in a few countries. A Deccan Chronicle report said a bail-in provision was used in Bank of Cyprus in 2013 which led to a loss of money of half of its depositors who were uninsured (the people who had deposited money over a certain limit). It is going to challenge the rights of a commoner as ideally, the government should look for money held by big corporations in case of a bail-in but, that won't be the case once this Bill is passed. It would not be an exaggeration to say that if this Bill is passed in the Parliament, the depositors' rights may go down the drain, that is if the bank is going down the drain.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:24.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39696c880d40836b5d9f430dd123dc69f3d88ebd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpSSxC1ut8GrAjIuh_GvifmjFqsYnDYQhbp.VHXDFzZYMb.TSlV6j7jV0ANva.bE3YX4xu3PTC2D1wHRxz4peAuOYyk9rN13JiZy7Cnfl2vdeAJzRpsTaveM", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "http://www.hotukdeals.com/rss/hot", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "HotUKDeals", "title": "133\u00b0 - More than 200 half price gifts deals for Him, Her & Kids in tesco online & instore", "title_full": "133\u00b0 - More than 200 half price gifts deals for Him, Her & Kids in tesco online & instore", "published": "2017-12-07T10:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2849326_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "39696c880d40836b5d9f430dd123dc69f3d88ebd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpSSxC1ut8GrAjIuh_GvifmjFqsYnDYQhbp.VHXDFzZYMb.TSlV6j7jV0ANva.bE3YX4xu3PTC2D1wHRxz4peAuOYyk9rN13JiZy7Cnfl2vdeAJzRpsTaveM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "133\u00b0 - More than 200 half price gifts deals for Him, Her & Kids in tesco online & instore", "text": "Expires on 25/12/2017 Found 7th Dec 200+ half price gift deals at tesco online and instore ranging from under \u00a32 to \u00a325\nFor Example\nLynx Duo Africa Gift Set HALF PRICE - Was \u00a35.24 Then \u00a33.50 Now \u00a32.62 Lynx Black Duo Gift Set H HALF PRICE - Was \u00a35.24 Then \u00a33.50 Now \u00a32.62 Adidas Pure Game 2 Piece Gift Set HALF PRICE - Was \u00a34.50 Then \u00a33.00 Now \u00a32.25 David Beckham Homme Body Spray And Shower Gel Gift Set HALF PRICE - Was \u00a36.00 Then \u00a34.00 Now \u00a33.00 L\u2019Oreal Men Expert Complete Expert Gift Set H HALF PRICE - Was \u00a311.24 Then \u00a37.50 Now \u00a35.62 Adidas Pure Game 3 Piece Gift Set HALF PRICE - Was \u00a36.00 Then \u00a34.00 Now \u00a33.00 Bulldog Skincare Kit For Men HALF PRICE - Was \u00a311.24 Then \u00a37.50 Now \u00a35.62 Yardley London Hand Cream Duo Gift Set Tin HALF PRICE - Was \u00a35.24 Then \u00a33.50 Now \u00a32.62 Baylis And Harding Mens Citrus Lime And Mint Box HALF PRICE - Was \u00a320.00 Then \u00a313.25 Now \u00a310.00 Beauty&The Beast Enchanted Rose Eau De Toilette Trio Giftset HALF PRICE - Was \u00a310.00 Then \u00a36.50 Now \u00a35.00", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:24.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f03818914a62d121ae37d9b322fcc21fa950c49c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRLywjOOLoe1IWqjF83nxfLNGFem.5JvC.60DrMZWFUIiTZkKN9qqVA0Fq1MIOL.SY53j.xM__lpg--", "site_full": "screenrant.com", "site": "screenrant.com", "site_section": "https://screenrant.com/", "site_categories": ["movies", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Screen Rant: Movie News, Movie Reviews, Movie Trailers, TV News", "title": "Venom Movie's New Logo Possibly Revealed | Screen Rant", "title_full": "Venom Movie's New Logo Possibly Revealed | Screen Rant", "published": "2017-12-07T01:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.975, "main_image": "https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tom-Hardy-Venom.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2771, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d33934ab522cd9971ec0544db95e13be3062524f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRLywjOOLoe1IWqjF83nxfLNGFem.5JvC.60DrMZWFUIiTZkKN9qqVA0Fq1MIOL.SYvCEsu7bdcXA5KmJ_7Dovx", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Xap", "published": "2017-12-07T14:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\"we are venom\" has nothing to do with carnage....its Venoms most famous line.

It is a universal language. Exploring what types you may like is valuable. If you enjoy listening to a country blues singer songwriter gulf shores will have many to hear. Look into the options by looking online or in a local directory. You will enjoy a live version of the music or ad studio recording. If the recording is live, try to get a good seat near the front. You can see more that way. If you sit in the back, try to lean against the wall so you can feel the vibrations. Vibration is what music is all about. The rhythm is so important in a song that it would have no backbone without it. See how different the vibrations are from any recording artist as opposed to another. When you watch musicians, look at the different ways that they do things. You could learn from this. One plays an instrument or sings one way. Another does it another way. Be open to how they do this. You can expand your listening playlist if you are willing to see things differently in each musician. Listening to the same ones is understandable, but it can put you in a rut if you do this year after year. Songwriters are everywhere so if you live in gulf shores or anywhere else, you ate surely going to find them. They usually spend a lot of time indoors creating their craft and then out somewhere performing it. If you do not live in gulf shores, look for venues offering love performances no matter where you live. You could take out the whole family and gave a good time. Other genres may also be represented in gulf shores besides country or blues. Rock, pop, or classical may have some songwriters exploring those genres. Folk songs may also be in the works of being created and performed. You can expand your listening repertoire by listening to all of them. Supporting your local artist is also a nice thing to do. It helps them get the support and encouragement they need to keep on writing. Music is not easy to write. It takes patience and forward thinking. The artist needs to think about what people want to hear. You could write about love, pain, sorrow, grief, relationships, friends, or romance. You can also write about physical places and why they are meaningful. The melody and words need to go together with the drum beat. They need to go together harmoniously and then you add the instruments. Putting them together is not very hard when you have the idea for the song in your heart and soul. Meditation helps you feel vibrations in the universe. It gets you in touch with many things that are healthy to have awareness of. Awareness is everything in life. Without awareness, you can become ignorant which is not good. Avoid that if you can.

This is because, being an occasion that happens only once in your life, making even the slightest mistake can cost a lot during the big day. For instance, you should ensure that you create vivid memories about this day. One of the ideal ways to create these memories is by making sure that you have the best photos. And remember, having the right photos will require you to have professional wedding photography Carmel CA with experience and expertise in photo shooting. The first mistake you should avoid is not getting to know your photographer before you hire him or her. When hiring a photographer, it is just like hiring one more guest in your occasion. The only difference is that the photographer will be taking photos. It is therefore important to have some time to meet your photographer first, and if you cannot meet home, take time to have a lengthy conversation over the phone with him or her. The other mistake is selecting your photographer based on price only. Basically, it is obvious you need to get what you pay for in life. Cheap photographers will mean low quality pictures most times. Although this is not obvious, in most cases you get what you pay for. Professional photographers will in most cases not fear to charge much, since they know that their services are worth that much. In case you know of a family member who have a nice camera and takes nice photos, you should never make the mistake of asking him or her to take photos during your big day. You need to make sure that you hire professionals who you can get into contract with. A contract ensures that both you and your photographer are committed to what they need to do during this day. One of the greatest challenges many photographers face is dealing with clients who do not know what they want. Basically, reputable photographers aim at ensuring that their clients are satisfied with the level of services that they offer them. The only way the photographers can know what the clients want is when the client tells the client exactly what they expect. Ensure that you do not wait until few weeks to the big day to book your photographers. Booking your photographers early enough is very important. This will give you ample time to interview several photographers before choosing the best. One of the things you should make sure that you include in your contract is the time you expect the experts to arrive to your occasion and the time you expect the expert to leave the occasion. In weddings, time is of paramount importance. You cannot afford to have the photographer come to your occasion late. You also need to make sure that you are on time. You can get the best photographers through referrals from people who have hired before. You may also search the photographers online. Ensure that you interview the photographers before hiring.

No change in text.)\nBy Jamie McGeever\nLONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The dark clouds of stagnant wages, widening inequality and chronic productivity across much of the Western world are shrouding one of the most remarkable and easily forgotten facts of the year - the world economy is booming.\nThe value of all goods and services produced globally this year will be around $80 trillion, which is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent next year, possibly even nudging 4 percent for the first time since 2011.\nAnnual global growth of 4 percent or higher was in fact fairly common in the pre-crisis years. In the 11 years to 2007 that level was reached in seven, with three of those over 5 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund.\nGrowth of 4 percent next year would mean the creation of almost $3 trillion - the equivalent to the annual output of Britain, the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy - that has to be put to work.\nThat\u2019s almost $3 trillion, over and above the near $80 trillion of wealth already being produced, for consumers to spend, investors to buy financial market assets, and businesses to expand, invest and hire.\nIt\u2019s a huge sum, and dwarfs the large but diminishing stimulus being provided by central banks. Policymakers are increasingly confident that world growth is now self-sustaining, hence their gradual withdrawal from the monetary stage.\n\u201cThe global economy is in the midst of a mini-boom that started in mid-2016,\u201d according to economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. They expect \u201csolid\u201d 3.8 percent global growth next year, up from 3.7 percent this year, with most major economies growing at or above potential.\nTheir counterparts at Barclays are even more bullish, anticipating that the \u201cself-enforcing economic cycle\u201d will deliver 4.0 percent global growth next year.\nGood news, right?\nREALITY V PERCEPTION The trouble is for an increasing number of people, even those in countries where growth is strong and unemployment has rarely been lower, it doesn\u2019t feel like good news.\nPeople are in work, as record levels of employment in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and elsewhere show, but they don\u2019t feel rich, confident or secure. Wages are stagnant.\nUnemployment in the United States is 4.1 percent, down from a crisis-high of 10 percent in 2009. Annual wage growth in that time has averaged 2.2 percent and has never topped 3 percent, compared with a pre-crisis average well over 3 percent.\nWages in the euro zone are rising at almost half that rate, and at 1.4 percent currently have rarely grown more slowly. Wages rose an average 2.3 percent a year pre-crisis and just 1.7 percent since, even as the unemployment rate has plunged from its 2013 peak.\nThanks to a mix of low wage growth and a surge in inflation since the 2016 Brexit referendum, workers in Britain are mired in the longest fall in living standards since the Second World War.\nPeople are still feeling the effects of the deep austerity and spending cuts many Western governments pushed through after the 2008 crash in an attempt to repair their shattered public finances.\nThose at the lower end of the income and wealth scale have been hit particularly hard. While they may have jobs, many work on part-time, short-term or zero-hours contracts. Poverty levels among the \u201cworking poor\u201d are rising.\nNot unrelated, by many measures wealth inequality is widening. According to a Credit Suisse annual report, wealth inequality has \u201ctrended upwards\u201d in recent years, propelled in part by the rising share of financial assets.\nThe richest 1 percent of the world\u2019s population now owns half of its wealth, up from 43 percent in 2008. There\u2019s no sign of that trend receding. Even in developing economies, where wealth creation is strongest.\nEmerging market economies are expected to expand by 5 percent next year, according to BAML, creating millions of jobs and increasing the spending power of billions of people. The world\u2019s poorest countries are getting richer.\nSome 230 million people around the world are set to move up to \u201cmiddle class\u201d status over the next five years, with two in five of those in China alone, according to Credit Suisse.\nYet, again, it doesn\u2019t feel like it for many people.\nThere\u2019s been a rapid increase in so-called payday loans in China over the past year and a proliferation in the number of companies providing them, especially over the internet. This is partly due to loose government rules in the past, which authorities are now trying to address.\nBeijing is taking steps to reduce corporate and financial risks by tightening credit restrictions and clamping down on borrowing. Its ability to implement these reforms without causing too much damage to growth next year will be tested.\nWhile BAML economists pencil in 5 percent growth across emerging markets next year, they note that large swathes of EM - Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and India - will all grow below potential.\nReporting by Jamie McGeever\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mcgeever", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jamie mcgeever", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "baml", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "credit suisse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcgeever reuters staff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of america merrill lynch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barclays", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "em - mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:27.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "04031cd11a9c9e2acfe2d52f18648eef15a39f18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1BbTbF5MdHpYoNaciVCybxqlt2uJtkfrJZHydWP.pl8IbJ.MUUOoiqbVY5B_vvCfmsPPXsUcLCPNYALzTcB7s1KLpOI7_dVOmH8ouQ0tfqQ--", "site_full": "servidoresjt.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://servidoresjt.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Feliz Anivers\u00e1rio!!!

Nonetheless, you can never have good music recorded from the wrong studios. So, it is wise that you know how to select the best place to have your music recorded. The tips below, therefore, will enable you to make the right choice of the reggae studio Clearwater Bay . Serious producers ensure they have good machines. This is because balancing and mixing music calls for one to have high standard machines. Thus, be sure to visit them and observe the type of equipment that they have. Also, check whether or not they have instrument if you want them to play them manually. The producers should have excellent communication skills. Note that the producer can either motivate or discourage the musicians. Good producers will never discourage the musician. Instead, they will give constructive criticism so that the singer can improve in the area where they ought to improve. It is thus wise to talk with the producer so that you can know their communication skills. The environment also is a very important thing that you should not overlook. You cannot produce your music in a place where there is noise. Music should be recorded in a silent place to avoid unnecessary sounds. Studios in this place are situated in areas where there is no noise. However, it is sensible to do some research first. Experienced producers are preferable than those who are new in the industry. Experience is essential in any profession. This is because experience tells you that the person knows what they are supposed to do. To know the experience of the individual you can check whether or not they have produced songs for renowned musicians in the past. Another thing you should note is that just like musicians, producers too like particular genres of music. This is determined by their preference and also, the areas where they find easy for them. So, the last thing you should do is select the wrong producer for the wrong type of music. Go to a place where they are specialized in producing the genre of music that you want. Consider the price. Just like other services, you are likely to get what you pay for. Unfortunately, many people go for cheap services, which is a big mistake. You ought to be aware that those who promise you services at a low price will use low quality equipment and therefore you should not expect quality music from such studios Though there are criteria that will enable you to find and choose a topnotch producer, you must be free with them. That is why you should do things the way you like. Before going to search for the studios, you must have something that you like in a specialist, and they should guide you so that you do not regret later or blame someone for misleading you.

Agencies | Published: December 7, 2017 2:50 pm Tags: Opioids Painkillers Sleep Sleep disorders Sleep loss \nIf you are regularly in the habit of popping up over-the-counter painkillers , beware, you may be at double the risk of becoming obese as well as have poor sleep, a study has revealed. Over the past 10 years, there has been a large increase in the prescription of medications such as gabapentinoids such as gabapentin, pregabilin and opiates, for chronic pain management including migraine, diabetic neuropathy and chronic lower back pain. The findings showed that people on opiates and cardio-metabolic drugs reported 95 per cent rates of obesity, 82 per cent \u201cvery high\u201d waist circumference and 63 per cent hypertension, as opposed to those on cardio-metabolic drugs only. These chronic pain medications should be prescribed for shorter periods of time to limit serious health complications, the researchers suggested. \n\u201cWe already know that opiates are dependency-forming but this study also found patients taking opiates have the worst health. Obesity rates are much higher and the patients reported sleeping poorly,\u201d said lead author Sophie Cassidy, research associate at the Newcastle University. Opioids act as a sedative which makes patients less active and they have been shown to alter taste perception with a craving for sugar and sweet foods. Opioids are also known to worsen snoring and untreated sleep apnea , as well as causing problems with nocturnal hypertension . \u201cThese results add further weight to calls for these chronic pain medications to be prescribed for shorter periods,\u201d Cassidy added. Read here should YOU stop taking painkillers if you do not have pain? \nFor the study, published in the journal PLOS ONE , the team assessed the inter-relationship between metabolic and cardiovascular disease in more than 133,000 participants from the UK. Body mass index, waist circumference and blood pressure were compared between those taking painkillers for chronic, non-cancer pain and cardio-metabolic drugs, compared to those prescribed cardio-metabolic treatment only. Opioids are recognised as being among the most dangerous prescription painkillers because they are addictive which can lead to them being abused. Patients can require continuous use of the drugs to feel normal and avoid symptoms of withdrawal.

In fact, professional hockey isn't his 'day job'. So, when not honing his skills as a goalkeeper on the field, Clemons is busy inside a laboratory, developing nanoparticle drug delivery systems for better treatment of various diseases, especially cancer.\nBut wait, that's just not it. Clemons is also a qualified marriage celebrant, motivational speaker and owns a business selling 'flap hats'. And he has done all of that before turning 30.\nALSO READ: Mandeep Singh, a jovial striker living his dream\nScience is a subject that came naturally to Clemons, who grew up on a farm and kept his parents busy with questions about the way things worked and why they worked in that manner. But as a teenager, he had other interests too and field hockey was at the top of the pile. He wasn't into books and preferred running with a hockey stick on the grass, hitting goals.\nWhen he turned 16, Clemons came across nanotechnology while sifting through the pages of Job Guide, which fortunately his mother was more than happy to read to him. It was a new field and possibly with limited career opportunities but Clemons was hooked and as it turned out, he ended up as a Research Scientist at the University of Western Australia .\nALSO READ: Enrique Gonzalez has Dutch imprint on his game\nHow does a full-time hockey player happen to be a scientist?\n\"I have always been interested in science. I grew up in a farm and always asked my parents how things work and wondering why things happen as they do. I have always been intrigued by that and that's probably why I got into science,\" Clemons tells TOI Sports on the sidelines of the 2017 Hockey World League Final.\nALSO READ: Wasteful Australia settle for 2-2 draw against England\nThe University of Western Australia describes Clemons as \"a key member of the BioNano research team\" and lists multifunctional nanoparticle synthesis, therapeutic delivery, disease treatment, wound healing and chemistry education research as his key researches. In 2015, he was one of 13 Australians selected to attend the prestigious annual Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings where Nobel Laureates and other scientists exchange ideas.\nCurrently, the 30-year-old is working on developing nanoparticles for the delivery of drugs which leave severe side effects. \"My research now focusses on the delivery of drugs to try and reduce the side effects of different therapeutics,\" says Clemons. \"So, to think about cancer treatment, for example - it has some very bad side effects. Your immune system is damaged, you can lose your hair, it's nauseous. And we are looking at ways to deliver that drug inside a nanoparticle and target it to the cancer cells. That's how we want to reduce the side effects and actually have better outcomes for patients.\"\nThe conversation steadily moves to his other passion, hockey - which happens to be his first love. Clemons was inspired by his older brother to play the sport. Interestingly, he started out as a field player and eventually became a goalkeeper as the prospect of becoming a hero was alluring.\n\"I grew up in a small country town called Bunbury in Western Australia. My older brother played hockey and I followed in his footsteps. What was interesting is I sort of fell into goalkeeping. I started as a field player and just liked the opportunity to be in the goals and maybe change the game, become the hero by saving or become the villain by letting one in. I like that pressure and the opportunity to shine,\" Clemons recounts.\nHe feels the game has changed quite a bit since he picked up the hockey stick as a kid. \"The game moves along very quickly now. The importance of penalty corner has come along a lot as well now with the drag-flick being so lethal. The game has sped up in general. The overheads (shots) becoming common nature, back-stick passing being common across all countries. That's what makes it (hockey) such an enticing product for live and viewing audience as well,\" says Clemons.\nIt's not Clemons' first time in India for a hockey competition. He was here when Australia triumphed in Raipur two years ago, and has played in the Hockey India League (HIL). Clemons feels that the tournament's rule to award two points for a field goal and one for a penalty corner has made the game more interesting. He suggests it should be implemented at the international level too.\n\"I really like playing in the HIL where you have two goals for a field goal and one for penalty corner. The reason why I like this is because if you are only leading by one goal late in the game, there's a chance to go for two points and win the game, instead of just trying to draw it. It has brought in some element of surprise,\" he says.\nGoalkeeping in hockey is one of the toughest jobs, requiring you to be courageous enough to face a hard plastic ball racing towards you at over 120 km/hr. But for Clemons, that's not the most daring trait of a custodian. \"The biggest thing for me is that I stay calm so that I can let my training takeover and play to my abilities\" he says about his mindset during a game. \"I think the bravest thing about goalkeeping is not worrying about the shots coming at you but to make the right decisions. Sometimes we have to come out and tackle or stay back at the goal - when to move or not to. Being brave enough to make those decisions in the tight spots during games is what makes it as courageous maybe.\"\nThe Australian team is going through a transitional phase. After a disappointing performance at the Rio Olympics, they are determined to re-establish themselves at the top of the pile of men's hockey. \"After the Rio Olympics, we had a few retirements. We are in a new group with a new coach. There's a lot excitement. We are the world No 2 so we are not very far from the top. We are here to play the quarter-finals and try to win the world league and then we have the world cup next year here. The group that we have now can be expected to do that,\" says Clemons.\nWhen he is not playing hockey or making it a better world to live for everyone in a lab in Perth, Clemons volunteers to teach students about the role science plays in the betterment of the world.

Smartcool\u2019s proprietary control algorithm technology has delivered proven energy efficiencies and savings to some of the world\u2019s best known brands over many years including McDonalds, Burger King, Dell Computers, Tesco, General Electric, Hilton, Radisson, Mercedes Benz, Jaguar Motorcars, United Utilities, Telefonica, Emcor, and SSE. Commenting on the new product, CEO of Smartcool, Mr Ted Konyi, disclosed that, \u201cThe company has built a pedigree of delivering meaningful energy savings at over 30,000 installations around the world, in some of the most challenging environmental conditions, to large commercial and industrial clients. \u201cWe now feel the time is right to continue to expand our mission of bringing energy savings, environmental responsibility and carbon emission reductions to our planet by entering the largest and most exciting sector \u2013 the residential market.\u201d \u201cThe residential market in the U.S. alone is massive, with about 100 million residences with A/C and heat pump systems,\u201d Mr Konyi continued. Meanwhile, Mr Don Iannucci has been appointed VP Business Development \u2013 Residential, and will lead the division that will introduce our new ECOhome product to the residential market. Mr Iannucci\u2019s career encompasses being a founder and senior executive of companies involved in data mining and information management software, telephony, Internet, cable, on- demand television, investment banking, and the consolidation of companies involved in providing heavy civil construction and oilfield services. Don\u2019s marketing experience includes his co-founding of Novus Communications which built a fibre optic network of over 40,000 route miles \u2014 providing carrier transport, video and high-speed Internet services and marketing those services to business and residential customers. Don was central to the company\u2019s marketing and acquisition activities and to several rounds of private equity and debt financing. Don has worked for some of the largest marketing and communications companies in Canada (Baker Lovick/BBDO, Cossette & BCP) where he was responsible for overseeing the development of strategic marketing campaigns for some of Canada\u2019s largest advertisers and marketers. \u201cThis is a marketing guy\u2019s dream \u2013 the time has never been better to market a product like the ECOhome. With electricity costs on the rise, green initiatives on everyone\u2019s minds, and ever warming temperatures, the residential homeowner will welcome the ability to save up to 40% on their air conditioning costs,\u201d the appointee said. Don continues, \u201cI expect our campaigns \u2013 initially targeting homeowners in the Sunbelt States such as Florida, Texas, California, Nevada, Arizona, etc., (approximately 37 million homes with A/C) to be very well received. \u201cWe plan to focus on the residential market with a direct-to- consumer approach using digital and television media to target our message of significantly saving money and reducing carbon emissions.\u201d Post Views: 37 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dipo olowookere", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iannucci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smartcool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ted konyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don iannucci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "konyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cossette", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "business post nigeria smartcool thrills residential air conditioning market", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaguar motorcars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smartcool systems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emcor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "telefonica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radisson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united utilities", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcdonalds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general electric", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novus communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes benz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dell computers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baker lovick/bbdo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burger king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hilton", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smartcool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sunbelt states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:29.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f71e435bc4e0a9b09de3c59bd1c36ead1a96991", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UfA8OdXHP_UbvHepHdP8pdgiOrh9IL9DaOGFHRtqaarrAFmwVuHngePwksqHwdtGdaWlrozF5hQzbouN.b2zVs4", "site_full": "damplans.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://damplans.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Boat PLans Information", "title": "rowing sailing boat plans", "title_full": "rowing sailing boat plans", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/owu1P6xqU4utkXopProkHnb06-8fO1JGDNmIB_bebl1PhmsJJpncL1jsMl5eNlb6MZ1YWvKq-U1rnEafNAVae6tLyRgzad9hRfRPw35SwkXrN7oEnZvWk2LuOAF64DaDzF28C2bQlfE0pDggbg4mTpM7G27llWu_OvcplDiA=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6f71e435bc4e0a9b09de3c59bd1c36ead1a96991", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UfA8OdXHP_UbvHepHdP8pdgiOrh9IL9DaOGFHRtqaarrAFmwVuHngePwksqHwdtGdaWlrozF5hQzbouN.b2zVs4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dampung (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "rowing sailing boat plans", "text": "Posted on 1:18 AM by dampung rowing sailing boat plans Our skerry\u2122 is that rare boat combining excellent rowing and sailing qualities into one attractive craft. this is the perfect boat in which to mount an expedition.
