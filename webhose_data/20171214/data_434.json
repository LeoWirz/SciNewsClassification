And what better time, in my limited world view, than Christmas. \nChristmas.   \u201cBe careful, Dan.\u201d   I heard that a lot.   And I know people are well-meaning.   A year ago some lunatic drove a vehicle into a Christmas market and killed who knows how many people.   But I refuse, absolutely refuse, to give in to fears.   Maybe it will happen again.   Maybe it will happen in Nuremburg.   Maybe in Mexico City.   I could get killed on the way home from the airport when I return home.   No.   I won\u2019t give in. \nFrom all I\u2019d read about Berlin in the 1930\u2019s, I expected some wild town, with crazy things happening all around me.   What I found, instead, was a sedate city, brand new since the 1960\u2019s and rather, well\u2026boring.   I should not be harsh.   The city was essentially a pile of rubble at the end of WW 2.   What it was, however, was a very walkable city.   Once I oriented myself I realized that just about everything was on a straight-line axis.   Fortunately, the weather was fine and not as cold as Riga or Vilnius, so my feet brought me just about everywhere.   One day I clocked 27,000 steps on my pedometer and the next day I just could not replicate the march from the day before.   I\u2019d walked from Alexanderplatz to Charlottenburg\u2014a distance of maybe 6 or 7 miles.   My quest for hitting every Christmas market in the city knew no bounds.   But my exhaustion did, and on day three I just collapsed and was back in my room by 5:00 pm.    There are limits to what the tourist body can do. \nOn my last day there I headed to Potstam.   It was time to the leave the city and this seemed a good destination.   It was also personal, as my sister lives in Potstam, NY, not that the two have anything in common.   Oh, such perfection.   I found my way to the first Christmas market, a much tamer affair than those in Berlin, and just as I began walking it started to snow\u2014Light, mysterious, and delicate.   A cool, dry fragrance was released into the air.   It snowed just enough to say it was snowing.   Snowing!   At a German Christmas market.   I was ecstatic.   My secondary goal in Potstam was San Soucci gardens, a massive park very close to the center.   That strange chemistry of snow and nostalgia took possession.   For a time, I was on Rand Hill, more than forty years ago, on the first full day of winter\u2014a days of cold and dark and snow\u2014cross country skiing into the darkening woods.   It was twilight and it snowed the entire time I was walking in this park, which felt more like a forest than anything else.   \n\nWhen I returned to the Christmas market I\u2019d been at a few hours earlier I walked through the cold, snow-filled street.   An hour later I was back on the train to Berlin.   It was an absolutely perfect day.

(AP) \u2014 A white former South Carolina officer was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Thursday for fatally shooting an unarmed black motorist in the back in 2015, wrapping up a case that became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement.\nAttorneys for ex-North Charleston Officer Michael Slager said he shot 50-year-old Walter Scott in self-defense after the two fought and Scott grabbed Slager's stun gun. They said race didn't play a role in the shooting and Slager never had any \"racial animus\" toward minorities.\nStill, Slager pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott's civil rights. As part of the plea agreement reached in May, prosecutors dropped state murder charges. A year ago, a state judge declared a mistrial when jurors deadlocked in that case.\nNow Playing: The sentencing hearing for the form South Carolina police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black man in 2015 begins Monday. Josh King has the story (@abridgeotland).\nMedia: Veuer \"This is a tragedy that shouldn't have happened,\" U.S. District Judge David Norton said.\nA bystander recorded the shooting on a cellphone, and it was shared around the world, setting off protests across the U.S. as demonstrators said it was another egregious example of police officers mistreating African-Americans.\nScott's family testified before the sentence was handed down and said they had forgiven Slager.\nRelated Stories The Latest: Ex-cop's attorney asks for minimum sentence Son of slain black man wants life in prison for ex-officer Evidence a little different at ex-officer's sentencing \"I'm not angry at you, Michael. Michael, I forgive you, and Michael, I do pray for you now and for your family, because we've gone through a traumatic time,\" said Scott's brother Anthony.\nThe shooting angered local African-Americans who complained for years that North Charleston police harassed blacks, pulling them over or questioning them unnecessarily as they cracked down on crime. But after the shooting, the Scott family successfully pleaded for calm, asking everyone to let the justice system run its course.\nTwo months after the shooting, a young white man killed nine black church members in a racially motivated attacked during a Bible study in Charleston. The family members of those victims struck a similar forgiveness tone after that attack.\nBefore the sentence was handed down, the judge had to decide whether the shooting amounted to second-degree murder or manslaughter. Norton found that it was murder.\n\"No matter what sentence I give, neither the Scott family nor the Slager family is going to think that it's right,\" the judge said.\nThe bystander's video started after the struggle between Slager and Scott and showed Scott running away and the officer firing eight times. Scott was hit in the back five times.\nAfter the shooting, Slager picked up his stun gun and placed it next to Scott. Slager contends he was securing the weapon. Prosecutors think he put it there to bolster his self-defense story.\nAn emotional Slager told the Scott family that he was grateful for their forgiveness.\n\"This tragic event that occurred in seconds has changed the lives of everyone involved,\" he said. \"With my actions that day, Walter Scott is no longer with his family, and I am responsible for that.\"\nThe judge also found that Slager, 36, obstructed justice when he made statements to state police after the shooting.\nA pre-sentencing report for Slager found that he committed manslaughter and recommended 10 to nearly 13 years in prison. But the judge was not bound by that review.\nIf Slager had faced another state trial and been convicted of murder, he could have been sentenced to anywhere from 30 years to life in prison.\nConvictions in police officer shootings are uncommon in the U.S. and prison time is even rarer.\nSouth Carolina has been aggressive in charging white officers who shoot unarmed black people. Four have pleaded guilty in state or federal court in the past six years. But only Slager and former state trooper Sean Groubert, who shot a man as he tried to get his wallet during a seat belt violation check, will have been sent to prison. Groubert was sentenced to five years behind bars.\n___\nKinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Its VFD refused to run and would go into overcurrent alarm before delivering any voltage to the motor. I confirmed I had 3 legs of power, all good. Wanting to eliminate the motor as the problem I megged it and read infinity GOHMS to ground. Resistance readings between phases were equal at .9 ohms. Another tech was there who also had a megger on his truck. We repeated the test with his gear and got all the same readings. This was a motor that had been in service, but we checked the make-up of its leads anyway, all were correct. So we bypassed the VFD and wired the motor across the line. I turned power on as the other tech observed the motor in the other room... he said it instantly popped loudly and lightning came out of it.\nSo what happened? Did we miss some steps in evaluating the motor? The short took out a leg of power in a non re-settable current limiter in the breaker, we've since replaced that. We obviously need a new motor, but I don't really want to go further without understanding what went wrong.\nThanks.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:07.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c81fe1c10b68d103da6d6a748a0895f08f216a39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pCoxWmXjUMLkuvaNMdlPO23_skA29lzoo", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/gif/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/gif/ -

You do your best to ignore it, and her assertiveness has gotten your heart beating, you might even could go for another round maybe, as you draw her entirely on top of you now, arms around and feeling her up. You haven't separated so to speak, since your previous romp, so things are already in position to get back to work, if you will.\nBefore you really get much a chance to get back into the rhythm of things though, along with the unpleasant sensation you start to feel a pressure farther and farther back in your mouth. Her tongue as it was, mingling with yours but now starting to creep back. The struggle to breathe becomes real as you open your eyes to prop her up and at least tell her to slow down, but find your whole face near enough covered by something soft and squishy and wet, and wrapping around your head. In alarm you try to pull back all the more and actually have to struggle quite a bit till finally you feel the grip loosening on your head and the wetness covering it starting to peel back. This strength though, you get the disturbing feeling that it's not by your effort that you're being let go, but by choice from the other.\nFinally you pull your face free and gasp for air, fresh air not tainted by the smell and taste, you you're still getting it a bit off the residue still coating your head. You look to see what kind of kinky toy Fayne must have pulled out for this, but instead are met by the sight of... something ghastly. A body for sure similar enough to yours but a strange color of skin and a fair bit bigger or at least longer than yours, as to be pretty much covering you rather than Fayne daintily laying atop you.

Ikechukwu Maximus Ugwuoke. \n\nThe writ for summary judgment filed at the Enugu State High Court in Suit No E/767/2017, borders on what Ugwuoke claimed was deliberate refusal, failure and neglect of the doctors to keep to terms of their agreement with his law firm. \n\n\nHe claimed in the suit that he was at the moment handling over 11 cases involving the association. \nThe suit has the said lawyer as plaintiff carrying on legal practice in the name and style of El-Maximus Ugwuoke & Co, Hakuna Matata Chambers. \nDefendants in the suit include the National Association of Resident Doctors, NARD, sued through Dr. Ugochukwu Chinaka and Dr. O.V Nnadi, the current President and Secretary of the Association as the 1st and 2nd Defendants respectively, while Dr. Onyebueze John Ugochukwu and Dr. Aneke Emmanuel, the Immediate Past President and Secretary of the Association were listed as the 3rd and 4th defendants, respectively. \nIn the said suit obtained by DAILY POST, the lawyer is seeking an Order of Court compelling the Defendants to pay him the sum of N18, 450,000 (Eighteen Million Four hundred and Fifty thousand naira) only, \u201cbeing the outstanding legal fee which the defendants are owing the Plaintiff\u2019s law firm for the 11 cases they were briefed to handle for the Defendants pursuant to clause 5(ii) the memorandum of understanding between the said Law firm and the Association.\u201d \n\nUgwuoke told journalists that he had discharged his obligation under clause 5 (ii) of the said MOU which entitles his firm to the fees. \nAccording to him, \u201cUnder Clause 5 (ii) of our MOU, the association is under obligation to pay us our fees upon filing of their cases or entering of defence for them as the case may be. \n\u201cWe have fulfilled that requirement and had written series of demand letters to the Association notifying them of our intention to file action against them, but the association has neither replied any of our letters nor deemed it proper to even communicate us in any manner. \n\u201cWe even wrote a formal complaint to Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) as the umbrella body of Doctors in Nigeria over the same issue. The last communication we had from our clients, National Association of Resident Doctors was during the regime of their immediate past exco, the current excos are either indifferent to our course or they have just chosen in their wisdom or lack of it to ignore our demands in a most despicable manner.\u201d \n\nThe said Lawyer who recounted his efforts and sacrifices to the success and peace the association is enjoying today in so many areas stated that the association has been very unfair and inconsiderate to him and his legal team by abdicating their financial obligation to them. \n\u201cIt is unprofessional for us to beg for our legal fees,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthe ethics of our profession forbid it, that is why we always reach a fee agreement with clients from the onset, and agreement are meant to be obeyed.\u201d \nThe lawyer said he doesn\u2019t care if the Association debriefed him or not as his fees were well secured under the MOU. \nHe stated that because of his fiduciary relationship with the association, he didn\u2019t yet want to file any claim for damages against the Association for now but warned that \u201cif the association continues to delay in making good their payment to them before the end of this month, they shall in addition to this suit, file a claim of N100, 000,000 general and exemplary damages against the Association.\u201d \nWhen contacted, the first NARD President, Chinaka denied knowledge of the suit, even as he declined to make further comments until he was served. \nOn his part, his predecessor, Onyebueze said he was aware of the suit, explaining that before he handed over, he had put a payment plan on ground for the settlement of the legal fees. \nThe court is yet to fix date for the hearing of the matter.
