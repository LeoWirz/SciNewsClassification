a very simple Automate flow with only 4 blocks (including the Flow beginning block). Most if not all Android launchers support multiple screens for you to organize your apps and widgets into different screen as needed. One of the screens is your Home screen, which normally is where you put your mostly accessed apps and widgets. When you are at the launcher screen without any opened foreground app, you can always go back to the Home screen by pressing your phone's Home soft key or Home button. If most of the time, when you unlock your phone and start using it, you want to be at the Home screen regardless of which launcher screen you were at when your phone went to sleep and locked itself, this is exactly what this Automate flow will do. This flow will wait until you unlock the phone, and check if you are at the launcher screen (meaning, no app is opened at the foreground). If yes, it will emulate pressing the Home button so that you will go to the Home screen automatically. If you were running an app at the foreground (such as Whatsapp, browser, email, Facebook, etc.) when the screen was last locked, the flow will do nothing and you will return to the app screen after unlock. In order for this flow to work properly, you need to set the correct launcher app of your phone in the \"Is foreground app\" block, because different Android phone vendor might provide their own launcher app to the phone. In addition, Android system also allows you to install and use 3rd party launcher app such as Nova launcher , Apex launcher , TSF launcher , etc. You can tap on the \"Pick activity...\" button as shown above to select the launcher app you use in your phone. The setting in the above screen is for Samsung TouchWiz launcher. For HTC phones, set the Package to \"com.htc.launcher\" and leave the Activity Class as empty field. What if you never set any screen lock to your phone? In that case, you just need to change the \"When device unlocked\" block to \"When screen is on\" block.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "htc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:39.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "02b9a4710b51ebfb0519faceaaca6b02fa07e459", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wuM0lGBJFLORNqcVNOaZawt11dU3Y3JJd0vkUGX4mCmSbfcIXmtec", "site_full": "whitewolf.wikia.com", "site": "wikia.com", "site_section": "http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?feed=atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "White Wolf  - Recent changes [en]", "title": "Olympians", "title_full": "Olympians", "published": "2017-12-07T05:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 114, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "02b9a4710b51ebfb0519faceaaca6b02fa07e459", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wuM0lGBJFLORNqcVNOaZawt11dU3Y3JJd0vkUGX4mCmSbfcIXmtec", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bro David", "published": "2017-12-07T05:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Olympians", "text": "Retrieved from \" http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/Olympians?oldid=162973 \" Ad blocker interference detected!

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

This time, however, the elections in this constituency could get exciting with Chief Minister Vijay Rupani facing a challenger in Congress' Indranil Rajyaguru, the sitting MLA from Rajkot-East and the richest candidate in Gujarat election. \nMr Rajguru -- who has declared assets of R s. 141 crore, in comparison to the Chief Minister's 7.4 crore -- left his Rajkot East seat to contest against the chief minister. \"I have money and I can help people,\" said the legislator, whom the locals have dubbed \" dhankuber \" -- roughly an equivalent of King Midas.Vajubhai Vala, incumbent Governor of Karnataka, had won the seat seven times for the BJP - from 1985 to 2012. Mr Vala vacated the seat for Narendra Modi in 2002 after the latter was then nominated as the chief minister. Later, when Mr Modi moved to Maninagar constituency, Mr Vala continued his undefeated run till 2012. After Mr Vala was shifted to Karnataka, Vijay Rupani won the bypoll from the seat in 2014.To rework the caste combination in party's favour, the Congress has fielded Mr Rajyaguru.Mr Rupani has to surmount the angry Patidars and the trading community, which is smarting under the impact of demonetisation and rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).Rajkot West is the largest constituency in the Saurashtra region. Out of 3.15 lakh voters in the constituency which goes to poll on December 9, the number of Kadva and Leuva Patidars is the highest at 62,000, followed by Brahmins, Lohana and Jain communities.\nDubbed \"CM seat\" by many, Rajkot West has given Gujarat three chief ministers - Keshubhai Patel, Vijay Rupani and Narendra Modi, who went on to become the Prime Minister. PM Modi had contested his first elections from this seat in 2001.The Congress is trying to direct the anger among Patidars who are angry over lack of reservation in education and government jobs.The quota agitation and Hardik Patel joining hands with Congress may dent the BJP's base among the Patidars, who till now were considered as the foundation of the BJP's support base in Gujarat.Mr Rajyaguru believes that he has won the \"initial battle\" against Mr Rupani by keeping him busy in the constituency since the poll schedule was announced.\"I wanted to keep the chief minister busy in Rajkot-West constituency and morally I have won the initial battle as the chief minister has to visit his constituency more than once in a week,\" Mr Rajyaguru was quoted as saying.Mr Rupani, however, remains unfazed and is confident of his victory.\"I will win the seat easily,\"Mr Rupani had told PTI in an interview recently, citing the work done by him in his constituency, especially bringing the Narmada river water to Rajkot.\"As the CM, he has done well and because of his tireless efforts, Rajkot could get the Narmada water in less than five years of the project announced by then chief minister Narendra Modiji,\" BJP's Saurashtra and Kutch spokesperson Raju Dhruv said.The 182-member Gujarat Assembly will go to the polls in two phases -- on December 9 and 14 -- and the counting of votes will be taken up on December 18. \n(With Inputs From PTI)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vijay rupani", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rajkot west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hardik patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajguru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patidars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajyaguru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mr vala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keshubhai patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modiji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lohana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leuva patidars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajyaguru.mr rupani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raju dhruv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajkot-west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajkot west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saurashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maninagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karnataka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narmada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kadva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kutch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajkot east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajkot-east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king midas.vajubhai vala", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:39.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a22943cd89d77affd471ffd5268ac344cc144ea8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRT8mhACjDa0cQAlCeiB89KjkuDjncAcbFw1c1nw0CuTl5KGRJpkoyugw63DDFAUW_tqy9HbJ_9LkSEtAmWkpvyRKGeS.dQajT0nEIFEjhu2l1e5GjDjasNLr7Of0ejjmqo7_umJ_x.1w--", "site_full": "www.ndtv.com", "site": "ndtv.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/NDTV-LatestNews", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NDTV News  -  Special", "title": "Latest SBI Fixed Deposit (FD) Rates.

At the time, the decision to take bitcoin was positioned as a way to serve emerging markets where payment options like credit cards may not be widely available. \nNow, as of Dec. 6, the company will no longer accept payments in the cryptocurrency due to a mixture of high fees and volatility in the price of bitcoin. Specifically, the company pointed to elevated payment costs in recent months for its customers, who can use the Steam platform to purchase and play a variety of games. \nThe company explained: \n\"For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of bitcoin itself drops dramatically.\" \nThe post outlined how, in some cases, customers would send funds only to come up short due to the U.S. dollar conversion. When asked to send an additional transaction to cover the difference, that user would then be hit with another fee. \nAs a result, the bitcoin payment option has become \"untenable\" for Steam, with the company promising to \"continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees.\" \nAt the same time, Steam suggested that it could move to accept the cryptocurrency in the future. \n\"We may re-evaluate whether bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date,\" the post explained. \nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitPay.

I\u2019m always a fan of doing that with food. A big thanks to Bob\u2019s Red Mill for sponsoring this post so we can share one of our favorite holiday cookie recipes with you. This recipe for Cranberry Almond Shortbread Cookies is always a hit when we make it and we always include these on our holiday cookie plate that we share with family and friends. \nWe are fully in holiday baking mode around my house. My kitchen counter has been covered in flour more often lately than it has been clean. My kids love to bake and there\u2019s no way we can ever eat all the things they make so it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to share some of the goodies with family and friends. \nThe holiday season is so busy and cheerful that it can be easy for us to forget that it isn\u2019t the happiest time of year for everyone. For people who are grieving, alone, or struggling with something else, the holidays can be a rough time of year. \nOne of the best ways to help someone we love feel better is to find a way to connect with them. If you know someone who is struggling, packing up some of your favorite cookies and taking them over to say hi is a great way to reconnect. I\u2019ve heard that connection is the best way to fight depression, so it seems especially fitting during the holiday season when we naturally want to connect with each other anyway. \nIf you are feeling down, baking for others has been shown to improve your mood and uplift you even more than the person you are gifting your treats to, so the benefits really go both ways. \nThese Cranberry Almond Shortbread Cookies totally feel like Christmas to me. We always include them on our neighbor cookie plates and they are fun to enjoy with a cup of hot chocolate or herbal tea at the end of the night. \nWe use Bob\u2019s Red Mill Organic Flour in these.

It happened more than 100 miles from where they lived but the escape was countrywide news.\n\n   They were not easily scared, otherwise they never had bought this house in the middle of nowhere. They fell in love with it as soon as they saw the photo in the window of the estate agency. It was not the romantic cottage they always had in mind. It was a mid sixties bungalow with at the time of the build fashionable glass cubes next to the black metal front door. The bungalow was plastered and painted white which meant maintenance surrounded by so many trees but not an obstacle for them. They wanted the house.\n\n   They decorated it to their own taste and modern standards and felt very much at home. Both had a job in town and commuted; every day they looked forward going home.\n   Within 6 years, they were blesses with two children; a boy John and a girl Susan. The children loved the big garden where they had so many toys to play with. Like their parents, they were always outdoors. They all adapted the country life and looked healthy and happy. So happy and careless that they never worried about the news of the escape two weeks ago.\n\n   The most dreadful day of their lives started as usual. The mother was up early to cook breakfast, to wash, dress and feed the children. The father waited till the bathroom was empty and got ready for a new day at the office.\n   Like all 5 days of the week, everyone was in a hurry by the time they had to drive to the village and to town. Leaving John at school and taking Susan to Kindergarten was the mother's job; she started an hour later at her office than the father. \n   A lot of calling and 'hurry up's', running up and down the stairs for forgotten dolls, handbags and clothes. A normal tumultuous young household which all parents will recognize. Therefore non of the members of this happy family saw the man running through the woods and the garden, hiding behind every tree before he moved on. A man who wasn't from this neighbourhood and who did not want to be seen...\n\n   Hiding in the closet under the slope attic, the parents did their very best to keep the children as quiet as possible. Fortunately they were tired after their playful day at school but soon, the parents knew from experience, they were hungry and asking for food. How on earth could they keep them quiet?\nIt would not take long before this so called Hide and Seek game was getting boring for them. But for now they leaned in the arms of their parents and tried hard to play the game the best they could.\n   Above their heads, the parents looked each other in the eyes, just visible by the little light that shone through the small hole in the wall, and saw pure anxiety; they feared for the lives of their children and their own.\nThe father took the hand of his wife, very carefully not to alarm the man in the house. He noticed that her hand also shook and her fingers were cold as ice. She squeezed his' softly to encourage him but both knew that courage was not their strongest emotion right now.\n\n   It was amazing how their eyes got used to the little light and how well they could hear in the darkness. All their senses were sharpened. The stillness in the house was louder than their own heartbeat or the breathing of the children.\nThey knew he was there, the occasional shuffle they heard, told them he was still downstairs and they prayed he did not go upstairs but left the house instead.\n   Suddenly there was a loud bang and all four of them were instantly very alert. John whispered: \u201cAre they going to find us Mummy?\u201d but Mummy pressed her fingers against his lips and said: \u201cssshhhh\u201d. John obeyed.\n\n   The silence after the loud bang was even worse than before; it told the parents he was indeed still in the house. And their car was parked in the driveway so they did not have the illusion the man thought there was nobody at home.\nThey wished they had gone outside instead of sneaking upstairs. But it was the fear of being seen by the man who stood there, staring at the house.\nAnd for the very first time since they moved here, they wished they had locked the doors behind them.\n   It took a while before they heard a soft shuffle and the recognisable noise of the door to the hall; they never came round to oil the hinges. Half way the noise stopped as if the man listened for a reaction somewhere from the house. Then the door was pushed open and footsteps moved to the kitchen.\n\n   Holding their breath they hoped the man was going to leave the house through the kitchen door and they almost forgot to breath to listen his footsteps. But again there was only silence. A cold threatening silence that slowly walked down their spine and back to nest in their brains. To take over every other emotion and only leaving pure anxiety. \n   They did not know that the fear tightened their muscles until Susan moved in her mothers arms, complaining that Mummy hurt her. And then that she was hungry and when the game ended. And who was the person in the house searching for them?\n   The mother whispered it was someone with very good ears who loved games so they needed to be extremely quiet! John still thought it was exiting and smiled with his eyes wide open which. But in the spares light from the hole his eyes looked very big and scary. She only saw what could happen if the man found them in their hiding place. If he only left the house but he knew, she felt that so clearly, that there was a family and that he could smell their fear. She new by instinct that he was going to wait as long as needed. At the moment John said he needed to go to the loo they heard the sound of the tap; the man filled the water kettle. Never had they thought that this so familiar and homely sound was so extremely frightening!\n   The parents looked at each other, knowing an escape was impossible; the man made himself at home. Where they were so very afraid, he sat there smiling with a cup of tea. Waiting.... as a lion for his prey \n\nPhoto: @wpunkt_epunkt (Instagram)    When you ever visit their house in the middle of no where, you will see that the once so white facade is now green and grimy. The driveway is overgrown with shrubs and the tracks of many police cars are buried under thick layers of brown leaves as if the trees wanted to cover the gruesome things that happened here years before. \n\n   The black door is wide open and the wind and rain turned the hallway into a muddy place. There are no witnesses any more. No footsteps of the family that lived here, nor those of the serial killer. They and the car have never been seen again.\n\n   Only the hasty left personal belongings like an open bag, a torn apart doll, shoes and a coat, might give a clue to what happened and why the house became unsellable. Why nobody wants to live amongst the horror of the past. \n\nWord of thanks : the photo of @wpunkt_epunkt (Instagram) inspired me to write this story and I was given permission to use the photo as an illustration for which I am very grateful.

Why is Google rolling out Chrome updates over time? android , android news , Ghacks #android #androidnews\nWhenever the Chrome team releases a new version of the web browser to the stable channel, it highlights that the release will be rolled over time. \nYesterday's release of Chrome 63 Stable for the desktop for instance does so in the first paragraph on the Chrome Releases blog. \nThe Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 63 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks. \nI asked myself for a long time why Google decides to roll out these releases over time. While I don't really mind if the release does not include security fixes, I do mind a staged roll out of a release if it does include security patches. \nA staged roll out means, basically, that some Chrome installations won't be protected against attacks that target the patched vulnerabilities in the browser. \nThe update to Chrome 63 for the desktop has one critical vulnerability for instance, and five that are rated as high. This particular update fixes 37 security vulnerabilities according to Google's Chrome team. \nAccess to reports about the vulnerabilities is limited for most of them, but Google does list information about each vulnerability reported to the company by third-party researchers. This helps attackers, as Google reveals the component that is affected usually in the description. \nGoogle Chrome is set to update automatically, but users can load chrome://settings/help at any time to run a manual check for updates. \nGoogle does not prevent the installation of updates on desktop machines. This is not the case on Android where application updates may not be available for days or even weeks even if you go to the Google Play Store listing and hit the install button there, or check for updates manually. A better way \nSecurity updates should be made available to all Chrome installations immediately. A system similarly to Windows Updates might work in regards to making the update available. Microsoft releases security updates only on the second Tuesday of every month, but makes them available to all systems with automatic updates enabled right away. \nTip : Google changed the design of the chrome://flags page in the release, and also that of the Bookmarks Manager. You can restore the old design of the bookmarks manager for now by setting the preference chrome://flags/#enable-md-bookmarks to disabled, and restarting Chrome afterwards. Closing Words \nSecurity updates should be made available to all users in my opinion. While you do need the right infrastructure for that to ensure that updates are delivered to anyone right away, but Google should not have any issues with that. \nI don't know why Google rolls out updates over time though; it could really be because it wants to reduce the load that updates cause by distributing these updates over days or weeks. \nNow You: Why do you think that Chrome updates are not made available right away? \nGhacks needs you.

How many times he will tender apology. A responsible person, who is going to be named next Congress president, should not make such mistakes,\" BJP MLA told ANI here.The Congress vice president on Tuesday posted a tweet wherein he wrongly calculated the percentage change in prices of certain commodities.Rahul highlighted the difference in rates of commodities between 2014 and 2017, in a bid to directly blame the prime minister for the price rise of essential items like cooking gas, vegetables and fuel. However, all the rates were inflated by 100 points.Later, Rahul tendered an apology for his mistake and tweeted \"unlike Narendrabhai, I am human.

Trump says he wants to \u2018stop crime\u2019 but he\u2019s backing an accused child molester.\" By Rebecca Shapiro 2.5k 53 Seth Meyers called out President Donald Trump on Wednesday night for using the phrase \u201claw and order\u201d to target minority groups and his personal enemies.\n\u201cSo Trump says he\u2019s \u2018tough on crime\u2019 when he thinks those crimes have been committed by immigrants, refugees, African-Americans or his political opponents, but not when they\u2019ve been committed by the people closest to him,\u201d the \u201cLate Night\u201d host said.\nMeyers then contrasted clips of Trump on the campaign trail claiming immigrants and refugees were responsible for increased crime rates in the U.S., with the president\u2019s response to former adviser Michael Flynn pleading guilty to lying to the FBI. Meyers also highlighted Trump\u2019s endorsement of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore , who has been accused of preying upon teenage girls when he was more than a decade older.\n\u201cThink about that,\u201d Meyers added. \u201cTrump says he wants to \u2018stop crime\u2019 but he\u2019s backing an accused child molester ... which tells you that when he uses the word \u2018crime,\u2019 that\u2019s not really what he means.\u201d\nWatch the full segment in the video above.\nRELATED...

I was annoyed but also bemused to hear this announcement yesterday because it is in its own way fake news: the idea that an educational gap has to be filled and filled by this organisation.\nFor decades Media Studies has been pilloried as a soft subject, the \u2018mickey mouse\u2019 of academia, denigrated by the likes of the Daily Mail [always ironic as a key representative of why we all but especially young people need to have the critical faculty to analyse the bias and outright lying of such media organisations] and rejected by some universities as an \u2018appropriate\u2019 subject for admission purposes.\nI\u2019m not going to detail the importance of Media Studies by looking at curriculum content over the years. The obvious \u2018fake\u2019 news about Media Studies throughout the history of its denigration was a focus on TV study and especially soap operas and similar. What this purposefully ignored was the critical analysis element to that study \u2013 perceived as accessible and pertinent to a young audience \u2013 and it is this critical structure that is a skill applicable to all study and life in general. Of course, soap operas are unlikely to be applicable to a youth/school audience today: it is social media and the way social media has been used as the major vehicle for the dissemination of fake news, and disseminated for a whole range of dangerous and unacceptable reasons.\nAnd it is for these reasons that Media Studies should be a core, compulsory subject, supported by the expertise of a news organisation like the BBC who should, one would hope, be able to analyse its own examples of bias as evidence of the pervasiveness of such.\nMy opening picture of Donald Trump and the headline with a question mark is one simple example of how easy it is to manipulate: had there been no question mark and so making the comment a declarative we are already in the world of trying to control message and meaning.\nNot that he isn\u2019t, by the way.

This comes a day after Congress leader and senior lawyer Kapil Sibal asked the top court for a July, 2019 date for the next hearing of the long-standing Ayodhya matter, citing political ramifications owing to the general elections in 2019.\"The character of Rahul Gandhi and Congress has once again been revealed in front of the people. On one hand, he is visiting all the temples in Gujarat and trying to misguide the Hindus and on the other hand another, a Congress leader is trying to extend the hearing date of the Ayodhya dispute hearing,\" Adityanath told ANI.\"This proves that his visit to temple is nothing else other than hypocrisy,\" he added.The Supreme Court yesterday deferred hearing in the case for February 8, 2018.Following this, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Chief Amit Shah, in a press briefing, took a potshot at the Congress Party and its vice president, Rahul Gandhi, for adopting 'double standard' in the matter.The Congress Party then furthered the war of words and said the BJP was raking up non-issues just to garner votes.The Babri Masjid was built by Mughal emperor Babur in Ayodhya in 1528.The Hindus, however, claim that a Ram temple that originally stood there was demolished to construct the mosque. Citing this, Hindu zealots demolished the mosque on December 06, 1992, triggering communal riots in various parts of the country.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rahul gandhi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "yogi adityanath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adityanath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kapil sibal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babur", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bharatiya janata party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uttar pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ayodhya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mughal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:44.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a90c53d30a4c6a045bafd4a30c0489337315c6b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UeRTJ5HANnIjNnOmvUrvG3l_eSG92xhJ7U5GhPGyOTPy6JqEDpaG8lhuxeNG1q3nAzQsm7f1QMUdOmHfz.OwWFxgtLjFMgIRcYpsMl4RHueSiKB0Cs_CyWw", "site_full": "downloadsoftwaresupdate.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://downloadsoftwaresupdate.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Download Software Update", "title": "Samsung Galaxy Firmware Download Free", "title_full": "Samsung Galaxy Firmware Download Free", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Dz1tOTvwNPgJnHwfxjH4DzDs9ukR3bluW9XBXJWP8fITVVNqgckFPmmD_8tOu-r9ukYlXex0SRlfEIgYgxYJwWjFqa3pHRlKUu66wc5CQ_HCnSLBJ5hOiE5x-d17DOMhfJOuQEZIXaOZfCcUmEccWza5rSYVZVpHYpAZwNEAvyeU2TKAViCEWG5Y2dTwrDMo=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a90c53d30a4c6a045bafd4a30c0489337315c6b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UeRTJ5HANnIjNnOmvUrvG3l_eSG92xhJ7U5GhPGyOTPy6JqEDpaG8lhuxeNG1q3nAzQsm7f1QMUdOmHfz.OwWFxgtLjFMgIRcYpsMl4RHueSiKB0Cs_CyWw", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "engkun sayidin (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Samsung Galaxy Firmware Download Free", "text": "Samsung Galaxy Firmware Download Free samsung galaxy firmware download free Samsung galaxy firmware free download. z-push zimbra backend this project provides a zimbra backend for the z-push open source activesync implementation....

Mummy please can I stir the contents of what you\u2019re cooking ? Can I get a piece of meat ? No more will I hear you say : mummy my sleep mode is not activated yet , when I say : Chimnonso go to sleep right now ! No one to ask me : mummy how come am getting pimples on my face and you don\u2019t have ?

Therefore, its mining activities there are illegal. The Ministry stands by the Stop Work Order issued to the BUA Group and signed by the Permanent Secretary, dated 17 th October 2017. The letter was issued after thorough investigation confirmed that the BUA Group was indeed engaging in illegal mining of marble/limestone at a mine pit located on Geographical Coordinates N07 0 21\u2019 47.4\u201d E006 0 26\u2019 51.8\u2019, while the Run-of-Mine (ROM) is stockpiled at an area with geographical coordinates N07 0 21\u2019 48.4\u201d; E006 0 26\u201937.2\u201d Clarification provided by the Mining Cadastre Office shows that the coordinates of the Mine pit and ROM stockpile area fall wholly within the area of mining Lease No 2541ML belonging to Messrs Dangote Industries Limited. The Ministry had earlier in 2015 issued a Stop Work Order on this same disputed site but the BUA Group disregarded the order and went ahead with its illegal mining activities, under heavy cover of armed soldiers, policemen and men of the Civil Defence Corps. The Management of BUA also resisted the enforcement of the latest Stop Work Order issued on October 17 th , 2017 using a combination of armed militia, soldiers and policemen to obstruct the team from the ministry in effecting the Stop Work Order. While BUA Group in its publication admitted the fact that a suit over the ownership of the site was pending in a court of competent jurisdiction, the Group, however continued with its illegal mining activities on the site, which in itself is subjudice to both the court and the Mining Act 2007, which guides mining activities in the country. While the Ministry restates its commitment to promoting local and global investments in the Nigerian mining sector, it has always maintained that due process must be followed, especially in line with the provisions of the Minerals and Mining Act 2007. This, we shall not compromise. \nSigned:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kayode fayemi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "da", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "buhari", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "muhammadu buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed yabagi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bua group", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dangote group bua group", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bua cement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dangote cement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geographical coordinates n07", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "messrs dangote industries limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "civil defence corps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comment  bua group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bellanaija.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bua group abdulsamad rabiu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mining cadastre office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stop work order", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ngote group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dangote group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of mines and steel development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steel development", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "okpella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kogi state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edo state", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:44.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "291bf330fea9f2f4d88df9beab6d6cccdfa81725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7UijQ.Mfm6_lNccIo_wjbUkdrk_B5gc0ombbx53kDP76x9C.ruJX5T0iB5IgCwU1jra3.l.uFTIrVpuRAS.Ik4wmEWjU4oPNW__GSN8goCHaebkr_BfuK", "site_full": "www.golfwrx.com", "site": "golfwrx.com", "site_section": "http://www.golfwrx.com/forums/forum/22-tour-and-pre-release-equipment/", "site_categories": ["golf", "sports"], "section_title": "Tour and Pre-Release Equipment - GolfWRX", "title": "Can you still pay to go to the Kingdom in Carlsbad?

It is a novel about a girl who commits suicide and leaves behind thirteen tapes explaining her reasons for doing it. The tapes are to be passed along by each of the thirteen people on the tapes until they have all listened to them. If you are receiving the tapes you are one of the reasons.\nAt times when reading Hannah\u2019s reasons you think \u2018Is that it?\u2019 but she does say there\u2019s more going on than just these thirteen stories, things she can\u2019t bring herself to talk about and therefore deal with. And I suppose lots of little incidents can add up over time until a person feels overwhelmed. The book shows us how a build up of little comments and small incidents can haunt you. The book gives us stark reminders that we should take more care of how we treat those around us.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what goes on in anyone\u2019s life but your own. And when you mess with one part of a person\u2019s life you\u2019re not messing with just that part. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t be that precise and selective. When you mess with one part of a person\u2019s life, you\u2019re messing with their entire life. Everything\u2026affects everything.\u201d \nThere are so many points where Hannah reaches for help but people don\u2019t see or realise. It is quite frustrating reading at times. The sad fact is that all the incidents in this novel are stuff that happens all too often in high school \u2013 kids can be really, really mean.\nThe ending. I didn\u2019t feel let down exactly but I wanted to know more. Though I\u2019m not exactly sure how this could have been done. For example, I wanted to see Bryce get his comeuppance, etc. But this would probably have taken away from the main story.\nThe chapter when Hannah goes to Mr Porter was frustrating. His response didn\u2019t seem appropriate.\nDid he do enough? I would say no. Was his suggestion of moving on the correct way to deal with it? Again, I would say no. Hannah was being very cryptic and not giving full or direct answers so I suppose there may not have been much more that he could have done. He could have tried harder to get more out of her. I was just a bit disappointed and angry that a high school guidance teacher was telling a young girl her only option was to just move on and forget about it when talking about sexual assault.\nI watched the television series after reading the novel. It was very different \u2013 much darker and more graphic. You see a lot more of Hannah\u2019s parents then you do in the novel and there is more back story to the other characters who receive the tapes. It is still worth the watch even if it makes uncomfortable viewing at times.\nI would definitely recommend this book to anyone. Although it is a young adult novel I think it would appeal to adults too. The subject matter in this book is so important and needs to be talked about more.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jay asher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hannah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryce", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:44.024+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15119317, "moreResultsAvailable": 15119217, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512639404024&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 600}
