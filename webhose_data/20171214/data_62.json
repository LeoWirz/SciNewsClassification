These innovative solutions enhance people\u2019s lives with light everywhere that lighting is important, indoors and outdoors: at home, in offices and factories, schools and playgrounds, theatres and shops. The company\u2019s Hungarian manufacturing site in Tamasi is rapidly expanding as the source in EMEA (Europe, Middle East & Africa) of physical products and connected systems for a huge variety of lighting projects. Systems that can change people\u2019s daily experience in effective, safer, and life-enhancing ways. \nThe fact is, light is fundamental to life . Philips Lighting delivers energy-efficient LED lighting solutions that improve people\u2019s well-being and productivity, developing systems that are powered by connected infrastructures and enabled by IoT technology. \nAt the edge of the future \nOne example of the inspiring impact of Philips Lighting\u2019s ground-breaking approach to lighting projects is The Edge, a multi-tenant office building in Amsterdam\u2019s thriving Zuidas business district. The connected lighting system in the 15-floor, 40,000-square meter building uses around 6,500 connected LED luminaires, integrated sensors, lighting management software and Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) technology. Low power consumption enabled by LED lighting combined with PoE cables sending both power and data to the luminaires meant lower installation and construction costs, since no separate power cabling was needed. The Edge office building in Amsterdam \nThe result was built-in energy savings for The Edge, right from the beginning. \u201cWe see our office as raising the bar in terms of data analysis, delivering completely new insights into office space usage,\u201d says Erik Ubels, CIO of Deloitte. \u201cIt shows how we can reduce CO 2 emissions from buildings and create a more sustainable world.\u201d \nThe system delivered by Philips Lighting allows employees to personalise lighting and temperatures at their workspaces using a specially-designed smartphone app. The connected luminaires share operations data using Envision lighting management software, allowing facility managers to analyse energy consumption patterns. Integrated sensors provide anonymous data on room occupancy, temperature and humidity. Building managers then use this data to maximise energy efficiency through the precise delivery of heating, cooling, and cleaning resources. \nEmployees at the Deloitte offices appreciate the flexibility and increased comfort the system can provide, even in open-plan offices. They can control the lighting at their desks at will, and adjust lighting and temperature in meeting rooms to suit individual preferences. \nThe connected lighting system at The Edge was the first, fully-realised system of its kind in the world, and is just one example of how Philips Lighting is leading the way in supporting sustainable practices and human-centric working environments. \nSmart solutions = Integrating light and data \nThe basis of connected lighting systems is the integration of uniquely identified luminaires into the IT network of a building, monument, or entire city. Fitted with sensors, each luminaire is a source of information about occupancy, activity patterns, temperature, humidity, and daylight levels. Wireless communication incorporated in the lighting systems allows the delivery of location-based services and information through mobile apps. Lighting management software then allows operators to monitor and manage lighting systems in real time, such as the CityTouch system for public outdoor spaces. \n\u201cThe landscape in lighting is changing radically \u2013 and Philips Lighting is the game changer! Where there is light, there are potential data points, each one unique, secure, contactable and connectable. Big Data analytics allow the development of apps for anything you want. We believe we can shape many new value spaces.\u201d \nSanjeev Kumar, R&D Manager, Mobile & Big Data Analytics \nA special team of engineers at Philips Lighting\u2019s Hungarian site develops and creates systems to meet widely varying needs. The LED luminaires can be customised for specific uses in retail outlets, offices, homes, theatres and entertainment centers, horticultural installations, schools, sports facilities and municipal installations. In fact, anywhere that customers want to achieve the cost-efficiency and flexibility provided by LED lighting. This year, Tamasi has also added a Fast Track Development Centre for the design and manufacture of any lighting system requested by customers, entirely from scratch. Smart Cities \u2013 connected public lighting \nBeyond illumination \nGiven the unusual degree of flexibility, innovation, energy and cost-saving efficiency provided by connected lighting, students at universities around the world are hugely interested in extending the boundaries of possible applications. Connected light takes flight \n\nCollaboration between Philips Lighting and a team of top students at the University of Eindhoven identified three potential applications in healthcare, involving indoor drones for hospitals to deliver data to precise locations using LED lighting systems. The team has successfully demonstrated a game using light systems connected with drones to entertain young patients in children\u2019s wards. They foresee other practical applications for hospital logistics and the monitoring of patients. \nLED lighting goes beyond illumination, only because of the low temperature of luminaires compared to conventional lighting, but also their durability and flexibility. Since the lower wattage of LED fixtures gives a higher lumen output than incandescent lamps, they save energy and are also brighter. As the University of Eindhoven developments (see above) suggest, the full potential for imaginative applications has by no means yet been fully explored. \nAn illuminated future \nFast-paced innovation and customer-specific delivery of effective lighting systems is only possible in a radically different working environment, where ambitious and highly-motivated people engage in developing ever-new applications. In the Tamasi factory and Budapest offices of Philips Lighting, talented engineers, project managers and supply chain specialists develop new solutions responding to the real needs of customers. \nThe company culture within Philips Lighting is one of friendly openness and flexibility. It\u2019s a dynamic, challenging environment, where the focus is on cooperative entrepreneurship where engineers can drive their own careers, continually learning and growing as individuals. Few employers of global stature offer such a unique balance of personal satisfaction and professional growth potential, in the exciting context of what is coming to be seen as \u2018The Next Big Thing\u2019 in today\u2019s IoT world. Philips Lighting is not only revolutionary within the lighting industry, but in the daily life of many people worldwide. \nWant to know more about career opportunities in today\u2019s revolutionary lighting industry? \nDiscover more at www.philips.com/careershungary ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sanjeev kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "attila danko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tamasi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik ubels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deloitte", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "philips lighting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mobile & big data analytics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deloitte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of eindhoven", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "budapest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east & africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hungary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tamasi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:26.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "562d62d83a0490cf7aaebf2944f2e5e4b7c88008", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_zQ3emj6oqFkM4nZF1cvQzb", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Jesus is Lord", "title_full": "/x/ - Jesus is Lord - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T07:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 62, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aacbd92c7be129f89762caba84e1ed494cacdf39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_zQ3emj6oqFkATOoyGVGgy4GPAyLp._XL4-", "ord_in_thread": 29, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T11:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>20000553\nOnly evil there exists is only because of free will.

The Redmi 5 Plus is priced starting at CNY 999 (Rs. 9,800 approx.) for the 3GB RAM/32GB storage variant and CNY 1299 (Rs. 12,700 approx.) for the 4GB RAM/64GB storage option and will be available in the same colours as the Redmi 5. \nBoth the devices run Android 7.0 Nougat with Xiaomi\u2019s custom MIUI 9 on top. Xiaomi Redmi 5 \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 5 has a 5.7-inch 1440 x 720 px display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. \nUnder the hood, the Redmi 5 has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 chipset, a 1.8GHz octa-core processor, Adreno 506 GPU, 2GB or 3GB of RAM, 16GB or 32GB of onboard storage which will be expandable via microSD card. There is a fingerprint sensor placed at the back of the phone just below the camera. \nPowering the device is a 3300 mAh battery which, Xioami claims has a standby time of up to 12 days. The battery is charged via a micro USB slot which means no fast charging. There is a 3.5mm headphone jack placed next to the charging port as well. \nThe Redmi 5 has a 12MP camera at the back with 1.25-micron pixel size. The camera records 1080P videos at 30fps. To the front of the device is a 5MP camera with Beautify 3.0, which is Xiaomi\u2019s software for enhanced selfies. Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus \nThe bigger sibling of the two is the Redmi 5 Plus. It has a 5.99-inch display with a 2160 x 1080px resolution which again, translated to an 18:9 aspect ratio. Similar to the Redmi 5, its display also has rounded corners. \nUnder the hood, the Redmi 5 Plus has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chipset, 2.0GHz octa-core processor, Adreno 506 GPU, 3GB or 4GB of RAM, and 32GB or 64GB of onboard storage which will be expandable via microSD card. The fingerprint sensor sits at the back of the device which has become a Redmi signature irrespective of thin or thick bezels. \nThe Redmi 5 Plus is powered by a massive 4000 mAh battery which, according to Xiaomi, has a standby time of up to 17 days. The device has a micro USB port for charging and data syncing along with a 3.5mm headphone jack. \nJust like the Redmi 5, the Redmi 5 Plus has a 12MP primary camera and a 5MP secondary camera with beautify 3.0 software. \nThere is no word on the availability in the global market.

India should assure Russian companies that it will buy their India-made spares and not go for cheaper purchase from a third country to address its armed forces long grievance of delays in procuring critical defence equipment from Moscow, a top Russian official has said. Viktor N Kladov, director for international cooperation and regional policy, Rostec , a state-owned Russian defence and industrial group, said Russia has chalked out a strategy to build technical service centres in India dedicated for specific equipment. \"India has bought a lot of Soviet and Russian made defence equipment and a bulk of these equipment requires modernisation, upgrade and repair and this can be done in the country (India). \"The way to address this problem is to set up facilities with our partners. We also need assurance from the Indian side that their products will be used by the end user,\" Kaldov told PTI here. It has been a long-standing grievance of the Indian armed forces that supply of critical spares and equipment from Russia takes a long-time, affecting maintenance of military systems procured from Moscow. Terming it a \"complicated issue\", Kaldov said Rostec was cooperating with Indian defence ministry to address the problem and manufacturing company Russian Helicopters plans to create service in India on the principle of \"one window\", which will simplify and accelerate the work in this direction. \"This is a pilot project and India is the first country where it is being implemented. India is interested in the implementation of this project, as it is operating the largest fleet of Russian helicopters,\" he said. Russia has been a major supplier of military platforms to India. Kladov said Rostec companies were interested in increasing the efficiency of after-sales service and simplifying the procedures for supply of spare parts to India. \"About a year ago, the Government of Russia decided to grant the right to a number of major Russian defence industry companies to directly conduct after-sales service, repair and modernisation of previously delivered military hardware. \"Now Russian Helicopters, United Engine Corporation, Techmash, Schwabe and High-Precision Weapons can directly interact with Indian customers on these issues,\" he said. Kaldov noted that the very sophisticated defence equipment needed to be addressed in a specific workshop and licensed parts and spares should be used and technology of repair should be controlled by the manufacturer and the chief designer of the products. \"This is an issue which is both sided. And our rule is to provide life time support for the equipment. Sometimes the end user becomes opportunistic and its looking to buy spares elsewhere to make it cheaper. So they are outsourced in other countries,\" he said. Kaldov said he had pointed out the concerns of the Russian companies regarding production of spares in India in his recent meeting with an Indian minister. He said the company was offered a space to set up a facility to produce components, spares for electronics, machinery, engines and helicopters in Maharashtra. Kaldov said Indian officials have told them that Russian manufacturers to participate in international tender exercise if they want to sell their products to the Indian armed forces. \"We will set up facilities and this can only be done if the Indian government assures that the Russian products will be purchased,\" he said. Speaking on the issue of India inching closer to the US and Israel in terms of defence deals and procurement, Kladov said he did not see it as a threat, but as a challenge for Russia as the market is becoming more competitive. \"We don't see it as a threat rather as a challenge. It gives us thrust to do better and be more innovative and proactive. We don't fear competition. Let's look at the broader picture, its industrial cooperation, strategic trust which gives us a cutting edge,\" he said. Calling the relationship between India and Russia a \"privileged strategic partnership\", Kladov said it meant \"we trust our Indian partners with most sensitive defence inventions and achievements\". \"America has many competitive products to offer. It's for Indian government to choose. It's up for the Indian government to build up balances. I can only speak on behalf of the Russian side. We are firm friends and strategic partners of the Indian republic,\" he said. 0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kaldov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kladov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rostec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schwabe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viktor n kladov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "techmash", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "economic times", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russian helicopters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united engine corporation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maharashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:27.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "11373367fcf978d2e98148dcea44c6606f0b99ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6xAOsTe.MBB3pVyrISdNh8lHhkFXhylafMGi7ZOavSyOnA_hAyo7hXD55l.F.TdcVStTSqbvF3f9", "site_full": "community.wemo.com", "site": "wemo.com", "site_section": "http://community.wemothat.com/aitfb44354/rss/Community?interaction.style=review&feeds.replies=true", "site_categories": ["home_and_garden", "home_repair"], "section_title": "rss.livelink.posts-in-node", "title": "Re: Off After X Minutes", "title_full": "Re: Off After X Minutes", "published": "2017-12-06T23:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "11373367fcf978d2e98148dcea44c6606f0b99ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6xAOsTe.MBB3pVyrISdNh8lHhkFXhylafMGi7ZOavSyOnA_hAyo7hXD55l.F.TdcVStTSqbvF3f9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "balanchine", "published": "2017-12-06T23:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "Re: Off After X Minutes", "text": "Off After X Minutes by Koalacomms on \u200e07-09-2014 07:35 PM One thing I'd love to see is a rule whereby I can switch the WeMo on and have it switch off automatically after a set time.The supplied rules don't allow for this.To explain further - An additional rule which has no specific \"on\" time and can be set to turn \"off\" after a given interval, say 30 minutes.I do hope you will consider adding this functionality in a future update.Thank you", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:27.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "562d62d83a0490cf7aaebf2944f2e5e4b7c88008", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_zQ3emj6oqFkM4nZF1cvQzb", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Jesus is Lord", "title_full": "/x/ - Jesus is Lord - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T07:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 62, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe7bedd560b5cb0b117b2cdec50b06e1618db476", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_zQ3emj6oqFkATOoyGVGgy4u0twgAXjxuI-", "ord_in_thread": 31, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T11:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>20000903\nI have trouble giving him pride, i think he always glorified the father.

A new variant of Android 8.1 Oreo OS optimised for smartphones with 1GB of RAM or less. Two of the most prominent chipmakers in the smartphone industry, MediaTek and Qualcomm have now voiced their support for Android Go. \nMediaTek, in a statement, said that it will be an SoC partner for bringing Android Go Oreo edition to smartphone makers and will offer support on Android devices with 512MB to 1GB of RAM. \nMediaTek Inc. today announced that it is a System-on-Chip (SoC) partner for providing Google\u2019s Android\u2122 Oreo (Go edition) software to smartphone makers, and after a deep collaboration with Google, MediaTek\u2019s MT6739, MT6737, and MT6580 SoCs, among others, now have board support packages available to run Android Oreo (Go edition). \nQualcomm has also announced that it will be working closely with Google to offer an optimised experience on smartphones with a memory of 1GB or less. \nWe are excited to implement Android Oreo (Go edition) within the Qualcomm Snapdragon mobile platform family as it will enable consumers around the world to experience a more robust operating system for lower cost smartphones. \nThis allows greater consumer flexibility as mobile users in emerging regions such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa gain access to a wider variety of Android smartphones with a more modern operating system. \nGoogle has claimed that Android Go\u2019s Oreo edition will be a variant of Android Oreo that a manufacturer can just set by ticking off a configuration flag. What this basically does is that it sets up the phone to use the \u201cGo\u201d versions of a handful of Google apps such as the main Google app, Google Assistant, Google Maps, Gmail, and others. Google claims that the smaller apps and slimmer OS can as much as halve the amount of storage that\u2019s taken up by default on a new phone running default OS. \nIndia is expected to be one of the first few countries to get Android Go Oreo edition thanks to its large budget smartphone segment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "oreo edition google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google maps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qualcomm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mediatek inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mediatek", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:28.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "562d62d83a0490cf7aaebf2944f2e5e4b7c88008", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_zQ3emj6oqFkM4nZF1cvQzb", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Jesus is Lord", "title_full": "/x/ - Jesus is Lord - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T07:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 62, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d974e1011b8d2b831d15fdcec68bcb766864eab2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_zQ3emj6oqFkATOoyGVGgy47dcBrN2M3Yc-", "ord_in_thread": 34, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T11:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>20000899\nYup, they need that personal relationship stuff", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:28.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "562d62d83a0490cf7aaebf2944f2e5e4b7c88008", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_zQ3emj6oqFkM4nZF1cvQzb", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Jesus is Lord", "title_full": "/x/ - Jesus is Lord - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T07:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 62, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "46ec6c319b133cb1d9a5d94d92d49deeb391222e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_zQ3emj6oqFkATOoyGVGgy4g1eqagkIduk-", "ord_in_thread": 37, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>20000928\nDo not be afraid to praise Jesus.\nMatthew 3:17\nAnd a voice from heaven said, \"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\"\n>>20000932\nOnly God is worthy of worship.

Credit: US Government \nUNITED NATIONS, Dec 7 2017 (IPS) - The Pacific islands have long remained victims of nuclear crimes \u2013 but the perpetrators, three of the world\u2019s major powers with permanent seats in the UN Security Council, never paid for their deadly sins. \nThe testing grounds in the Pacific, included the Marshall Islands (Bikini and Enewetak), and also Johnston Atoll and Christmas Islands in Kiribati. \nThe so-called \u201cPacific Proving Grounds\u201d, which included the Marshall Islands and a few others on the Pacific Ocean, was the site of US nuclear testing between 1946 and 1962. \nFrance tested its weapons on Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls in French Polynesia, with French naval vessels clashing with Greenpeace anti-nuclear campaigners. \nThe United Kingdom, along with the US, conducted several nuclear tests in and around Kiribati in the late 1950s. But the islanders were not evacuated exposing them to radiation from the blasts. \nAll of these tests, which left behind environmental hazards and radioactive waste, came to an inglorious end \u2013 or so it seems. But the nuclear nightmares over the Pacific continue to linger on. \nAccording to the London Guardian, the Marshall Islands Nuclear Claims Tribunal awarded more than $2.0 billion in personal injury and land damage claims arising from the nuclear tests, but stopped paying after a compensation fund was exhausted. \nAfter 67 tests, US nuclear experiments in the Marshall Islands ended in 1958. But in a 2012 report, UN Special Rapporteur Calin Georgescu, said \u201cnear-irreversible environmental contamination\u201d had led to the loss of livelihoods and many people continued to experience \u201cindefinite displacement\u201d. \nAnd a projected sea-level rise, triggered by climate change, is threatening to unearth the radioactive waste and spill it into the high seas. \nAccording to two researchers, Barbara Rose Johnston and Brooke Takala Abraham, U.S. medical scientists traveled to the Marshall Islands, for nearly four decades, in order to document degenerating health and conduct related experiments, \u201call without informed consent.\u201d \nAll told, 1,156 men, women, and children were enrolled in studies exploring the acute and late effects of radiation. \nAmong the findings of this research: radiation exposure generated changes in red blood cell production and subsequent anemia; metabolic and related disorders; musculoskeletal degeneration; cataracts; cancers and leukemia; and significant impact on fertility as evidenced by miscarriages, congenital defects, and infertility. \n\u201cTheir experiences also demonstrate how chronic and acute radiogenic exposure compromises immunity, creating population-wide vulnerability to infectious and non-communicable disease\u201d, Johnston and Abraham wrote. \nBob Rigg, a former senior editor with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and ex-chair of the New Zealand National Consultative Committee on Disarmament, told IPS: \u201cIt is impossible to make sweeping generalisations about the entire Pacific region, which is both vast and diverse\u201d. \nBut US attention, he pointed out, was focused in particular on Micronesia, which includes most of the islands bitterly fought over in the latter years of World War II. \n\u201cThe US wields disproportionate influence over this sub-region, where most of its 1,054 nuclear tests were conducted,\u201d he added. \nThe US bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, said Rigg, can be defined as the first example of US nuclear testing, given that a principal motive for both attacks was to facilitate large-scale research into the effects of nuclear weapons on living human beings, a subject which was a closed book even to the world\u2019s leading nuclear scientists at the time. \nAs soon as the war ended, he said, \u201cthe US hastened to establish political control over a number of strategically important islands forming an \u201cisland chain\u201d in the Pacific \u2013 a chain of US military and political influence cementing US control of major trade routes, while also enables it to contain the growing power and influence of Communist China.\u201d \nIronically enough, the US island chain has something in common with China\u2019s South China Sea outposts which today draw the ire of the US, he added. \nRobert Alvarez, an Associate Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington D.C. and an Adjunct Professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced Strategic International Studies, told IPS that three major international conferences\u2014in Oslo, Mexico City, and Vienna\u2014 focused on the humanitarian effects of nuclear weapons, and on establishing a new international legal instrument that would outlaw nuclear weapons. \nThe humanitarian initiative and the Marshall Islands lawsuits\u2014including one in US federal courts and the other with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague \u2014 received a chilly, some might say hostile reception from the nuclear weapons states, for an understandable reason, he pointed out. \nThe nuclear weapons countries are engaged in costly modernization efforts that all but guarantee the continued existence of nuclear weapons for decades, and perhaps beyond. The Marshalls lawsuits and the humanitarian initiative both seek to make the nuclear states seriously negotiate toward nuclear disarmament, he noted. \nIn an article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists back in May 2015, Alvarez said the damage did not end with nuclear testing. \nIn the 1960s, islands of the Enewetak Atoll were stripped of topsoil and used for explosive crater experiments, to see how US missile silos would hold up to enemy missiles. \nAnd in October 1968, the US Navy conducted a biological warfare experiment in which Staphylococcal enterotoxin B, a virulent bacterium, was released over the Enewetak Atoll from fighter aircraft. \n\u201cThe pathogen proved to be harmful to experimental animals over a 1,500 square mile area. Since the late 1950s, the Kwajalein Atoll and lagoon have served as an anti-ballistic missile launch site for testing against possible missile attacks,\u201d he noted. \nNearly every US intercontinental ballistic missile was test fired at Kwajalein. Now home to the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, the $4 billion US Air Force complex on Kwajalein is considered a key strategic asset for anti-ballistic missile testing, military space projects, and intelligence gathering, wrote Alvarez, who was also a Senior Professional Staff member for the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, where he conducted an investigation into the conduct of the U.S. nuclear weapons program in the Marshall Islands. \nRigg told IPS Truman had no qualms about bombing Japan and seizing control of several Micronesian Islands where America\u2019s many subsequent nuclear tests could be conducted. Indigenous populations were frequently marginalised, displaced, and impoverished. \nTraditional ways of living, cultivating food and eating were frequently replaced within one generation with a barbarised version of US consumer culture. The key operational assumption was that Pacific Islanders represented an inferior culture which, in the patronising words of one US scientist, at least had more in common with civilised westerners than laboratory mice, he said. \n\u201cLike the Japanese, Pacific Islanders were viewed through the prism of mainstream US racism. The example of Rongelap Island, which was seriously affected by fallout from the huge Castle Bravo test, is perhaps most instructive.\u201d \nWhen the islanders repeatedly lobbied for permission to return to their home, said Rigg, the US Atomic Energy Commission declared it safe for re-habitation, with US scientists privately noting that \u201cthe habitation of these people on the island will afford most valuable ecological radiation data on human beings.\u201d \nAs a major environmental polluter, he argued, the US contributes to global warming which disproportionately affects many small Pacific Island states whose highest point is in some cases just a couple of metres above sea level. \n\u201cSuch islands are also acutely vulnerable to the climate change-induced violent storms which increasingly inflict massive destruction on both vegetation and homes. As many of these islands are desperately poor there is all too often no money to rebuild infrastructure and homes, with more than 95% of damaged buildings being uninsured.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s America First policy has already produced a 30% cut in State Department funding which will dramatically curtail expenditure on Pacific islands which are not part of the militarised US island chain. Australia abjectly proclaims that it is \u201cjoined at the hip\u201d with the US, slavishly following in the wake of Uncle Sam in all things, Rigg said. \n\u201cFortunately, there is one small ray of hope: New Zealand has just elected a new Labour Government which is signalling its willingness to adopt innovative approaches to political problem-solving, including in the region.\u201d \nThe new Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, he pointed out, has already signalled her government\u2019s willingness to view Pacific Islanders fleeing their submerged islands as refugees. At present Australia\u2019s immigration policies exclude such \u201cenvironmental refugees.\u201d \nThis New Zealand initiative could eventually necessitate the re-negotiation of the UN Convention on Refugees, to accommodate a new category of environmental refugees, he added. \nIn the words of a recent report to a congressional committee, even before the election of Trump, the US had pursued a \u201cpolicy of benign neglect towards the South Pacific nations. \n\u201cToo often have we relied on Australia and New Zealand to determine what US policy should be in the region.\u201d If this was true before Trump, it will be doubly true now.\u201d \nPossibly with at least some support from New Zealand, Pacific Island states will have to continue to seek political support from outside their region, as recently, when Fiji and Germany jointly hosted the November meeting of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP23) in Bonn. \nThe elevation of Fiji to this prominent role reveals that, in the complete absence of support from both Trump\u2019s US and Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s Australia, there is a heartening emerging international awareness of the extent to which the very existence of some Pacific Island states is already under threat from climate change, he noted. \n\u201cBut words must be backed up by large quantities of hard cash, without which some small Pacific Island states will undoubtedly go under.\u201d \nThis article is part of a series about the activists and communities of the Pacific who are responding to the effects of climate change. Leaders from climate and social justice movements from around the world are currently meeting in Suva, Fiji, through 8 December for International Civil Society Week . \nThe writer can be contacted at", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abraham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwajalein atoll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald reagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacinda ardern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob rigg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calin georgescu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbara rose johnston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert alvarez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooke takala abraham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rigg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnston atoll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "truman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alvarez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "enewetak atoll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump\u2019s america first", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. senate committee on governmental affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us air force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us atomic energy commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international civil society week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific islanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un convention on refugees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international court of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us government  united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenpeace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshall islands nuclear claims tribunal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand national consultative committee on disarmament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johns hopkins school of advanced strategic international studies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute for policy studies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "marshall islan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "micronesian islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwajalein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kiribati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshall islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vienna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enewetak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south china sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oslo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific region", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rongelap island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the hague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london guardian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "micronesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hiroshima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nagasaki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:28.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "562d62d83a0490cf7aaebf2944f2e5e4b7c88008", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_zQ3emj6oqFkM4nZF1cvQzb", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ -

From what I've read of Marcion, the founder of gnosticism, he denied that Jesus came in the flesh. This is a central tenet for Christianity. He also maintained that the God of the Jews, YWHW, was the Demiurge that created the evil physical universe, and that's why he was so wrathful in the OT, but in the NT Jesus came to \"enlighten\" humanity about the false material world and gain \"gnosis\" or knowledge of the Source.\nSome texts to keep in mind:\n1 John 4\n2This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.\n1 Corinthians 15:12-19\n12But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 14And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. 15More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. 16For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. 17And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. 18Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. 19If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.\nThe disciples believed the following:\nChrist came in the flesh, died for humanity's sins on the Cross, and was resurrected bodily.

Wednesday, December 06, 2017 Jerusalem In the fevered imaginations of their supporters on the Left, the palestinians are an \"oppressed\" people who would want nothing more than a peaceful existence with Israel. The harsh reality is rather different. It's a short history of a violent, virulently anti-Semitic people who have consistently avoided any concessions that might lead to peace (you know, little things like accepting Israel's right to exist). Over the past five decades, palestinian leaders have created a fictional history in which they had a state (untrue) and their lands were stolen from them (equally untrue). During that time they have regularly attacked Israeli civilians with everything from kitchen knives, to bus bombs, to rockets (targeted at elementary schools). They have tunneled under the Israeli border to attack and murder civilians. They have on a number of occasions walked away from peace agreements that would have allowed them to govern themselves, and when they were unilaterally given Gaza, they turned it into into a terror haven and a center for human rights abuses. Leftists tell us that the original violent Intifada on the late 1980s and the sequel in 2000 were all due to the palestinians' \"frustration\" over their lack of statehood. In actuality, it was frustration over their inability to destroy Israel as a country and achieve their fevered fantasies of murdering as many Jews as possible. And now at long last, the Trump Administration has announced that the United States will move its embassy to the Israeli capital of Jerusalem. The mere suggestion that this will happen has given the Left the vapors. With one voice they cry: \"Violence will erupt. The Muslim world will be outraged. The peace process (as if) will be destroyed forever.\" It is likely that all of those things will happen, but it's not like there has been no violence in the region or that the Muslim street doesn't already hate the Jews in their midst, or the peace process isn't a sham because the palestinians will only accept \"peace\" if Israel disappears. For 50 years, the palestinians have perpetrated terror, violence, and murder against Israel. And now, we are warned not to do the right thing and move our embassy to the Israeli capital because the palestinians will perpetrate more terror, violence, and murder. We are, according to those who argue against the move, required to perpetrate the fiction that Israel will give up or share its capital because that's what the palestinians want. After 50 years of terror, violence, and murder, it might not be a bad idea to let the palestinians know that we no longer care what they want. At least until they accept Israeli's right to exist, until they stop committing human rights abuses, until they stop teaching anti-Semitism in kindergarten, until they until they walk away from terror, violence, and murder, they do not deserve a state and should not get one. And if moving an embassy to Jerusalem foments even more terror, violence, and murder, it provides still more solid evidence of exactly who the palestinians really are. And then, of course, there's the small matter of thousands of years of history. David Harsanyi comments: Jerusalem, after all, is not some concocted modern capital. The place itself is the affirmation of the Jewish claim on Israel. Consequently, the coming protests over Trump\u2019s move are not merely about a city, they are about challenging the right of Israel to exist \u2014 a self-destructive position that most Palestinians still embrace. This isn\u2019t new. There has been a destructive effort within the Muslim world \u2014 although it has been taken up by others, including the United Nations \u2014 to deny the religious and historic connection between the city and the Jews. Moving the embassy, even if it entails nothing more than hanging a sign on a new building, is a pushback against attack on an ally. That is, if you still view Israel as a close ally. Most do. Over the past 30 years, in fact, politicians keep telling voters that an undivided Jerusalem is the capital of Israel then doing nothing about it once they\u2019re elected \u2014 and not some of them, but virtually all of them. It's time we stop the fiction that Jerusalem is somehow in play. It isn't, and kudos to Donald Trump for making that clear. UPDATE: Roger Simon writes: The president's decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to be announced Wednesday is already sending the usual suspects into a tizzy. The famous Arab Street, we are told, will be erupting. The despicable fascist that runs Turkey has warned of imminent disaster. And the president of France is doing what the French usually do vis-a-vis the Jews -- well, not quite that bad. But the real question is how the Palestinians themselves will react once the dust has settled. Will they continue decades of self-destructive violent protests that have led many of us to believe they never had an interest in a two-state solution in the first place, that it was all posturing for handouts? Or will they grow up and realize the time has come to negotiate to a conclusion and accept the responsibility of their own state and the adult compromises that would naturally entail? Heh. Not.

Twitter 0   \nLast week the website MormonLeaks published a series of \u201cleaked documents\u201d allegedly outlining enrollment guidelines for Brigham Young University in which male applicants were given preference over females. BYU previously gave advantage to male candidates in order to raise male student enrollment. Photo courtesy of www.sltrib.com \nThe documents appeared to show that male applicants were given a one point preference on their scores during the applicant consideration process between the years of 2013 and 2015. East coast residents and first generation college students also appeared to be given preference. \nAccording to the Salt Lake Tribune , BYU spokeswoman Carri Jenkins \u201cdeclined to comment on the authenticity of the documents,\u201d but confirmed that gender had once been \u201ca determining factor in student enrollment.\u201d \nJenkins said, \u201cBYU is constantly revising and updating its admission process. For instance, in the spring of 2015, BYU stopped giving any additional weighting for gender.\u201d \nBecause BYU is a private school, such practices are completely legal. Two potential reasons behind the temporary preference for male applicants could be the drop in male attendance following the LDS church\u2019s age change for young male missionaries, and the growing gap between male and female college students nationwide. \nAccording to the Salt Lake Tribune , \u201cNationwide, women outnumber men on college and university campuses and make up the majority of enrollment applicants. That trend is expected to grow over the next decade, according to forecasts by the National Center for Education Statistics.\u201d \nWhatever the reason behind the two-year-long practice, BYU no longer gives a one point preference to male applicants seeking to enter the college. The gender of any Snow College students considering transferring to BYU will not affect their chances of acceptance.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carri jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "byu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national center for education statistics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snow college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salt lake tribune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brigham young university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:31.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a3920782f2e8f835330f0d4500d5ec978c667721", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSLTcPpnhmDHl4fRk6KlQX1vjOdp3_.aORDVYENlDS7RWJ0iGHrI9F5dk2tirpq21Ant_ZU6PxshQ--", "site_full": "www.ournewjobs.com", "site": "ournewjobs.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "", "title": "Financial Adviser at ARM Life Plc", "title_full": "Financial Adviser at ARM Life Plc", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.027, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a3920782f2e8f835330f0d4500d5ec978c667721", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSLTcPpnhmDHl4fRk6KlQX1vjOdp3_.aORDVYENlDS7RWJ0iGHrI9F5dk2tirpq21Ant_ZU6PxshQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Financial Adviser at ARM Life Plc", "text": "Home / 2017 JOBS / Financial Adviser at ARM Life Plc Financial Adviser at ARM Life Plc OurnewJobs 2 mins ago 2017 JOBS , 2018 JOBS , AFRICAN JOBS , GRADUATE JOBS , NIGERIA JOBS , OND JOBS Leave a comment 0 Views Job Description To market an insurance products like flexible saving account, flexible education account/investment, mortgage, memorial and retirement income and retirement savings to the needy, whereby the successful candidate will be entitle to double incomes, with less work hours.

The down side is the shower curtain stinks which makes the whole room smelly. We also found the thermostat only goes down to 66F which makes the room stuffy.

We did a great job of staying at an eight-point lead and taming them down and stalemating it.\" \nJimmy Butler and Jeff Teague each scored 19 points for the Timberwolves (15-11), who placed six players in double figures. Andrew Wiggins and Taj Gibson had 16 apiece, and Jamal Crawford finished with 11 points. \n\"They kept coming, and because of the way they can score, you are always concerned,\" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. \"Just finding a way to win was probably the most important thing.\" \nLos Angeles dropped its fourth straight game despite an impressive performance by DeAndre Jordan, who had 18 points and 21 rebounds. Lou Williams and Austin Rivers each scored 23 points for the Clippers (8-15). \n\"It's very difficult,\" Rivers said. \"It's frustrating. Nobody likes to lose. We're losing a lot of games.\" \nDanilo Gallinari returned for Los Angeles and scored seven points on 2-for-13 shooting. Gallinari had been sidelined since Nov. 5 due to a glute injury. \nTIP-INS \nTimberwolves: F Nemanja Bjelica remained out with a sprained left foot. He has missed eight straight games. ... Wednesday marked Crawford's first game back at Staples Center since leaving the Clippers. Said Crawford: \"You see these people every day for five years. It's just weird. Some of those relationships will last a lifetime.\" \nClippers: G Milos Teodosic (plantar fascia) remained out, but coach Doc Rivers said he is close to returning. \nGALLINARI RETURN \nGallinari had only two rebounds and no assists in 26 minutes. \n\"I wanted to be better,\" he said. \"I didn't expect to shoot the ball that bad. I was expecting to be better already, but I wasn't. I'll be better next game.\" \nUP NEXT \nTimberwolves: Open a five-game homestand Sunday night against Dallas.

This is the view of Mzwanele Manyi, the new owner of The New Age,Picture: TNA \nA REMARKABLE story of survival. This is the view of Mzwanele Manyi, the new owner of The New Age, on the paper marking its seventh anniversary this week. \nManyi, the chairperson of Afrotone Media Holdings, described the survival of The New Age as a \u201cphenomenal\u201d story of perseverance and the disrupting of a century-old print media industry. \nHe said the paper was launched under difficult circumstances and given no chance of survival by its competitors. \u201cThe paper was launched into an industry which was operating almost as a cartel. Apart from its commercial threat to other daily newspapers, its positioning as a critical but strongly pro-South Africa paper also raised the hackles of the mainly opposition press.\u201d Manyi said The New Age would by next year be the only remaining paper launched in the new millennium in South Africa. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenal achievement. We have big plans to expand its footprint under Afrotone Media Holdings\u2019 management and to make it the leading national daily newspaper in the country in order to achieve much needed media diversity,\u201d he said. Editor Ricky Naidoo said the paper had a unique footprint in most of the country\u2019s nine provinces. \n\u201cWe now produce six editions daily, covering news events in the Free State, Western Cape, KwaZulu Natal, North West and Northern Cape with the Gauteng edition serving as the national edition. \u201cIn-depth provincial coverage is the paper\u2019s real niche and which sets it apart from any other daily newspaper. The provincial editions have been hailed for their coverage of developmental issues across the country,\u201d said Naidoo. \nHe said, however, \u201cthe onslaught\u201d against the paper has continued seven years down the line. \u201cThe fact that we are now celebrating our seventh anniversary is testimony to the resilience, passion and commitment of our staff, ensuring that we play our own role in transforming the country and the media landscape. As we prepare for another year, we remain undeterred in our mission to continue telling the South African story without fear or favour,\u201d Naidoo said. \n-NTOMBI NKOSI ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "manyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ricky naidoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mzwanele manyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ntombi nkosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naidoo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kwazulu natal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afrotone media holdings", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pro-south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gauteng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern cape", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western cape", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:33.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "929877450d38638fdf80b435820004d667010c92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XYMElmOfZIpg.zB_zq.VobPY4NyKuZfYufSQRcTZBnfuTxZr1IY5Qss3tS0XM6TA-", "site_full": "www.facepunch.com", "site": "facepunch.com", "site_section": "http://www.facepunch.com/forumdisplay.php?f=51", "site_categories": ["entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Sponsored Spambots", "title": "Watch a new trailer for Polygod, a 'minimalist rogue-like FPS' coming next year", "title_full": "Watch a new trailer for Polygod, a 'minimalist rogue-like FPS' coming next year", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.021, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 25788, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "929877450d38638fdf80b435820004d667010c92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XYMElmOfZIpg.zB_zq.VobPY4NyKuZfYufSQRcTZBnfuTxZr1IY5Qss3tS0XM6TA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PCGamer", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Watch a new trailer for Polygod, a 'minimalist rogue-like FPS' coming next year", "text": "http://www.pcgamer.com/watch-a-new-trailer-for-polygod-a-minimalist-rogue-like-fps-coming-next-year", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.pcgamer.com/watch-a-new-trailer-for-polygod-a-minimalist-rogue-like-fps-coming-next-year"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:34.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e406d67c6e21b3cfa114c8d7d1da959b07e0ab0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8J4wR_eOEp.dOvX3gUn2FDyYewjEtSTtB5AZET2aUg8dFiLiAyy37ESgrmul1UfJKuT9DEAQm5zu4hKKCy2DJ1d29fQOovrGM-", "site_full": "www.mpyakali.com", "site": "mpyakali.com", "site_section": "http://www.mpyakali.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "MpyaKali", "title": "New AUDIO | Stellina x foby -

Your grilled toastie wasn\u2019t complete without the creamy goodness filling, your macaroni bland without its cheesy soulmate. Originating in the British countryside town of Cheddar where dairies still uphold the country\u2019s 800-year-old tradition, cheddar has pretty much stayed the same since our childhood. But not anymore!\nFor the first time this summer, Fairview Cheese Company is proud to introduce their brand-new cheddar range, which consists of four delectable flavours including Garlic and Rosemary, Dried Red Onion, Bobotie and Tomato and Chili. Packaged in single skin-pack portions, these cheddars are a great new choice to use in everything from appetizers and breads to casseroles or simply lunchtime snacks.\nThe philosophy behind these new cheeses is to break new ground in the cheddar market. Charles Back, owner of Fairview Wine and Cheese, explains:\n\u201cWhy do more of the same? At Fairview, we have the privilege to play around and try different things. My team and I wanted to make cheddar exciting again \u2013 to liven up your lunchbox and explore an entire new way of enjoying a family favourite cheese. I think we\u2019ve achieved this!\u201d\nMeanwhile, back at the cheesery, Head Cheesemaker Louis Lourens has been testing the market to ensure cheese fans are ready to welcome this game changer:\n\u201cWe have been using our very own wine and cheese tasting room to gain feedback and input from guests and cheese fans. Suffice to say, the response has been super. Made using 100% Jersey cow\u2019s milk, the new flavour addition is a welcome sensation that will fall in line comfortably on a trendy cheese platter.\u201d\nWith four new flavours and beautiful, hand-illustrated labels, their delightful inside no doubt matches their creative outside. Inspired by South Africa\u2019s cultural cuisine, the colourful packaging depicts a vibrant taste-filled adventure from the multi-coloured houses of the Bo-Kaap, to the yogi-centric and nature-loving hikers as well as the dreamers and thinkers who float on the clouds above.\n\u201cThe inspiration behind the packaging was to create something unusual and different to what is currently on the shelves for cheese\u201c, says Victoria Peter, owner of her creative studio Jane Says in Cape Town. \u201cWe wanted to be playful with these designs \u2013 reflecting Fairview and owner Charles Back\u2019s character. The flavours are unusual too, hence we came up with quirky stories to showcase the range of cheddar. The illustration style is fresh, modern and colourful\u201d.\nOne last thing we\u2019ll never let you forget \u2013 armed with the right information, wine and cheese are amazing pairings, enhancing the flavours of both. The best wine to pair with our cheddar cheeses are hearty ones \u2013 think Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Tempranillo and Sangiovese.

At that time, a lot of people brought out their biases and claimed that \"this sort of bug is what you get by running open source software\".\nIn reality, the fix was out hours after the bug being reported since in open source software, anyone with the technical know-how can contribute a fix, unlike when almost the same sort of bug hits macOS and only the Apple employees that made the bug in the first place can make a fix for it and it takes a lot of time and they even screw up the update so it un-installs itself in certain cases.\nThe Linux story was a large news story even if it was fixed within hours, but this Apple story has generally not got the same attention. It seems like the tech press loves to hate Linux, but hates to use the same level of critical thought when dealing with companies like Apple and Microsoft.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:34.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c0260a69cc5ff0eb871804434ec123cf1341d7f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jclO0PAYH6Vc3E1_8P0w2wC69zzzVih2bvNoPHq_rmywPFgTMDTNtcl2lCfOvxBmVTQezBwYbvtv2m3dlWdS_u0ZReAkcEG_mHiBNxpgeQ2Ww--", "site_full": "chineduayoka.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://chineduayoka.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Chinedu Ayoka's Blog", "title": ": Near North Korea\u2019s Border, a Chinese Paper Offers Tips on Nuclear Fallout", "title_full": ": Near North Korea\u2019s Border, a Chinese Paper Offers Tips on Nuclear Fallout", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c0260a69cc5ff0eb871804434ec123cf1341d7f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jclO0PAYH6Vc3E1_8P0w2wC69zzzVih2bvNoPHq_rmywPFgTMDTNtcl2lCfOvxBmVTQezBwYbvtv2m3dlWdS_u0ZReAkcEG_mHiBNxpgeQ2Ww--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Chinedu Ayoka (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "title": ": Near North Korea\u2019s Border, a Chinese Paper Offers Tips on Nuclear Fallout", "text": "\nNear North Korea's Border, a Chinese Paper Offers Tips on Nuclear Fallout \nBy KEITH BRADSHER\n\nThe main official newspaper for a province abutting North Korea listed ways to limit radiation exposure, with cartoon illustrations.\n\nPublished in World on December 6, 2017 at 01:00AM\nRead more on The New York Times Shared Via Chinedu Ayoka's Blog: Thank you for reading!: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "keith bradsher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinedu ayoka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "border", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:34.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72ebd9283a942362652f5a1f49360d6bec31d8c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIkCpWipn6bYPbgtdqMIU7xOOQ1qG.3QKqgsiL8w4hd4l8xZdFArEmbzIih02LZAuSvkO7WD7ukwW", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=201", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.
