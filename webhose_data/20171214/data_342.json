The AIMPLB, a leading plaintiff in the case that is also bearing the cost of litigation, also said that Sibal's plea was right as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would try to cash in on the Ram Temple issue in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.The matter was heard by the Supreme Court yesterday.\"During the course of arguments, a stand was taken by the counsels representing the Muslim parties on the instruction of their respective clients, stating that it was not the right time to take up the matter for final hearing,\" a press release of the AIMPLB read.The press release further read that considering the sensitivity attached to the issue and different media reports, the board is compelled to clarify its stand.\"The board also clarifies that different statements from different leaders for constructing the Ram Temple and indicating the dates and place etc. are unfortunate,\" the release stated.The board also condemned the same as the case is sub judice in court and expects political statements not to be made by parties, it added.Sibal had, yesterday, requested for the next hearing in the case to be held only in July 2019 after the completion of the next Lok Sabha polls, citing political ramifications.Earlier in the day, the Sunni Waqf Board dissociated itself from Sibal, who had been representing the case in the Supreme Court in connection with the long-standing Ayodhya matter.Speaking to ANI, Haji Mehboob, Sunni Waqf Board said, \"Yes, Kapil Sibal is our lawyer, but he is also related to a political party. His statement in the court yesterday was wrong. We want a solution to the issue at the earliest. We have got nothing to do with his statement.\"The Supreme Court yesterday deferred hearing in the case for February 8, 2018.Following this, BJP Chief Amit Shah, in a press briefing, took a potshot at the Congress Party and its vice president, Rahul Gandhi, for adopting 'double standard' in the matter.The Congress Party then furthered the war of words and said the BJP was raking up non-issues just to garner votes.The Babri Masjid was built by Mughal emperor Babur in Ayodhya in 1528.The Hindus, however, claim that a Ram temple that originally stood there was demolished to construct the mosque. Citing this, Hindu zealots demolished the mosque on December 06, 1992, triggering communal riots in various parts of the country.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sibal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rahul gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haji mehboob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maulana wali rehmani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kapil sibal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babur", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aimplb", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bharatiya janata party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "all india muslim personal law board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sunni waqf board", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayodhya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mughal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "109506b292ae13a4f8dbab7333e36b6d96860f93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT2gRCVWMQr_M555OGpg4G0khndlinLTQ4pCqM7aAA4qcbNhGWuii5n8X2waGZ0Glg-", "site_full": "www.lightnovel.cn", "site": "lightnovel.cn", "site_section": "https://www.lightnovel.cn/forum-141-6.html", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "comic_books"], "section_title": "LK\u6f2b\u753b\u53d1\u5e03\u533a|\u3013\u8d44\u6e90\u4ea4\u6d41\u3013|\u8f7b\u4e4b\u56fd\u5ea6-\u8f7b\u5c0f\u8bf4 - Powered by Discuz!", "title": "[\u8fde\u8f7d][\u56db\u86cb\u5f00\u8352\u7ec4][\u6fd1\u6237\u5185\u6d77][\u7b2c0\u8bdd][2017.12.03]|\u8f7b\u4e4b\u56fd\u5ea6-", "title_full": "[\u8fde\u8f7d][\u56db\u86cb\u5f00\u8352\u7ec4][\u6fd1\u6237\u5185\u6d77][\u7b2c0\u8bdd][2017.12.03]|\u8f7b\u4e4b\u56fd\u5ea6-\u8f7b\u5c0f\u8bf4 - Powered by Discuz!", "published": "2017-12-03T13:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.133, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 30710, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "109506b292ae13a4f8dbab7333e36b6d96860f93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT2gRCVWMQr_M555OGpg4G0khndlinLTQ4pCqM7aAA4qcbNhGWuii5n8X2waGZ0Glg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\u54b2\u592a", "published": "2017-12-03T13:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "[\u8fde\u8f7d][\u56db\u86cb\u5f00\u8352\u7ec4][\u6fd1\u6237\u5185\u6d77][\u7b2c0\u8bdd][2017.12.03]|\u8f7b\u4e4b\u56fd\u5ea6-", "text": "\u8fd9\u8868\u60c5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:01.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0dd7fa60a26fc90f4c5b34e57d7dce50f3ceeaab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYC0LVt_uHgOI8PTEt4cBzpj", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp;

In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the Senators expressed support for language included in the House-passed Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations bill that effectively delays the ELD mandate for one-year to allow the industry to work with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to address the strict Hours-of-Service rules that transporters must abide by.\nUSCA Transportation Committee Chairman Steve Hilker issued the following statement: \n\u201cWe applaud each and every Senator who signed-onto this letter for showing their support of small business owners in rural and agricultural America. A vast majority of livestock haulers are both the owner and operator of their business and this upcoming regulation will disproportionately affect our ability to do business efficiently and affordably. \nGiven that we are hauling a living, breathing commodity, the comfort and welfare of our cargo is of the utmost concern to livestock haulers. Once loaded onto the truck, these animals must get to their destination as quickly and safely as possible. An ELD would only serve to increase the number of stops included on a trip, extending the overall time that the cattle are on the trailer and adding additional stress during an already difficult experience in that animal\u2019s life. We appreciate Congress\u2019 recognition of our need for additional flexibility within this mandate and look forward to working with FMCSA on viable solutions.\u201d Thank you to the following Senators for their support!

That's why they're fighting his action in court. \nTrump also said that because of his decision, \"families will hike and hunt on land they have known for generations, and they will preserve it for generations to come. Cattle will graze along the open range. Sweeping landscapes will inspire young Americans to dream beyond the horizon.\" \nBut hiking, hunting and cattle-grazing are already allowed on the lands that make up the two national monuments he is targeting in Utah: Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. If the loss of protection spurs energy development, people may see mines on a sweeping landscape where they are now forbidden. \nA look at his statement in Salt Lake City on Monday about his plan to reduce Bears Ears by 85 percent and Grand Staircase-Escalante by nearly half: \nTRUMP: \"As many of you know, past administrations have severely abused the purpose, spirit and intent of a century-old law known as the Antiquities Act. This law requires that only the smallest necessary area be set aside for special protection as national monuments.\" +2 \nPresident Donald Trump holds up a signed proclamation to shrink the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante national monuments at the Utah State Capitol Monday, Dec. 4, 2017, in Salt Lake City. Trump traveled to Salt Lake City to announce plans to shrink two sprawling national monuments in Utah in a move that will delight the state's GOP politicians and many rural residents who see the lands as prime examples of federal overreach, but will enrage tribes and environmentalist groups who vow to immediately sue to preserve the monuments. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) Rick Bowmer \nTHE FACTS: That's not exactly what Teddy Roosevelt's 1906 preservation law says. It states, in essence, that the federal government should not bite off more than it can chew when a president designates an area for protection. It doesn't demand that such land be kept to a minimum. Such protected land \"shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected,\" it says. \nTRUMP: \n\u2014\"We have seen how this tragic federal overreach prevents many Native Americans from having their rightful voice over the sacred land where they practice their most important ancestral and religious traditions.\" \n\u2014\"Here, and in other affected sites, we have seen harmful and unnecessary restrictions on hunting, ranching and responsible economic development. We have seen grazing restrictions prevent ranching families from passing their businesses and beloved heritage on to the children, the children that they love. We've seen many rural families stopped from enjoying their outdoor activities, and the fact that they've done it all their lives made no difference to the bureaucrats in Washington.\" \nTHE FACTS: Native rights are generally enshrined on national monument lands, not terminated. So are other public uses of the land. What's most at stake is new mining, logging or commercial development. \nOf the two Utah monuments, Grand Staircase is the primary prospect for potential mining because of past interest in a large coal reserve on the lands. Worries about Bears Ears are mainly about disturbing Native American artifacts and general disrespect for land considered sacred by multiple tribes. +2 \nFILE - This July 15, 2016, file photo, shows the \"Moonhouse\" in McLoyd Canyon which is part of Bears Ears National Monument, near Blanding, Utah. President Donald Trump's rare move to shrink two large national monuments in Utah triggered another round of outrage among Native American leaders who vowed to unite and take the fight to court to preserve protections for lands they consider sacred. Trump decided to reduce Bears Ears \u2014 created last December by President Barack Obama \u2014 by about 85 percent and Grand Staircase-Escalante \u2014 designated in 1996 by President Bill Clinton \u2014 by nearly half. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) Rick Bowmer \nTrump's point about \"responsible economic development\" goes to the heart of the actual debate over whether Washington is imposing unreasonable restrictions in monument lands. And ranchers bristle under what they consider heavy-handed rules for grazing on these lands. \nBut the notion that rural families can't enjoy the beauty of a national monument is unsupported. \nWhen President Barack Obama designated Bears Ears a year ago, for example, current uses of the land were maintained, tribal access among them. It was \"closed to new extractive uses such as mining and oil and gas development.\" Among the activities or installations allowed: \"traditional collection of plants and firewood, off-highway vehicle recreation, hunting and fishing, legal grazing, military training operations, and utility corridors.\" \nFive tribes lobbied Obama to declare Bears Ears a national monument to preserve lands that are home to ancient cliff dwellings and an estimated 100,000 archaeological sites. Native Americans visit the area to perform ceremonies, collect herbs and wood for medicinal and spiritual purposes, and do healing rituals. The tribes filed a suit Monday night challenging Trump's action. \nA coalition of environment groups filed the first of several expected lawsuits challenging Trump's move on Grand Staircase-Escalante, established by Bill Clinton when he was president. \nThe groups say Trump's decision endangers a \"Dinosaur Shangri-la\" full of fossils. Some dinosaur fossils sit on a plateau that is home to one of the country's largest known coal reserves, which could now be open to mining. \n___ \nMcCombs reported from Salt Lake City.

For decades, Hollywood has melded these two purposes into one as it attempts to divert the public while also providing it with the types of historical and sociopolitical content that will keep it informed. Steven Spielberg built his reputation as an entertainer, but The Post marks his most striking political commentary since Schindler\u2019s List . \nAs Vietnam dragged on, Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) took it upon himself to sneak out reams of paper from Pentagon archives detailing a study conducted on the efficacy and longterm viability of the conflict in Vienam. After the New York Times is blocked from publishing further content from the Pentagon Papers, The Washington Post steps in, beginning a showdown between the U.S. government and the press. The resultant ruling helped codify into law the position of a free press and its obligation to hold the government accountable. \nScreenwriters Liz Hannah and Josh Singer skillfully wade through the minutiae of the decision and the events leading up to it. They focus not on the Supreme Court case, but a Washington Post on the cusp of entering the U.S. Stock Exchange. Kay Graham (Meryl Streep) must weigh the paper\u2019s financial future with the heavy responsibilities of the press. \nStreep has seldom been better than as Graham, a cautious woman who must not only navigate the hazardous waters of duty versus profit, but also the politely hostile patriarchal structures of the worlds of business and politics. Streep has delivered myriad mannered performances over the years, each with a surfeit of competence and confidence. As Kay Graham, Streep dials back her forceful and assertive personality and infuses Graham with uncertainty and trepidation. Her dialogue is delivered with the apprehension of a woman unaccustomed to having to stand up to others, unsure of whether what she decides is ultimately right for her family\u2019s legacy or for the people whose employment depends upon her. \nTom Hanks plays her managing editor Ben Bradlee with the surety and conviction he has frequently brought to his roles. It\u2019s a persona that has served him well over the years, blended here with a hard-nosed edge as the incorruptible Bradlee. His certitude helps diminish Kay\u2019s reticence and gives her just the inspiration she needs to make her own decisions without the influence of those who are too cautious. \nFor all his experience with grand epics and broadly engaging features, Spielberg is often at his best when he lets uncomplicated scenes unfold simply, allowing our emotional investment in the events of the film to wash over us. He is one of the most astute filmmakers working today and while it would be easy to dismiss him as a purveyor of bold entertainment, he\u2019s often at his absolute best when he\u2019s pushing the audience in new directions, both mentally and emotionally. The Post features a number of straightforward segments that feature undercurrents of raw emotional power and that\u2019s one of the reasons the film feels so fresh in spite of its 40-year-old setting. \nPolitical dramas have been a staple of cinema for decades, reaching a pinnacle that began with the likes of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and peaking in the 1970s with films like All the President\u2019s Men , a look at the major Post story that followed the Pentagon Papers. Since then, Hollywood seems to have devoted fewer resources to these types of films, leaving it up to major talents to keep them afloat. Spielberg\u2019s late-career focus on historical documents has made for some thrilling entertainment, but few have been as pressing and important at this juncture in the United States\u2019 history than The Post . \nFor any student of journalism or newspaper publishing, The Post is also a richly detailed exploration of the subject. Delving not only into the Herculean behind-the-scenes efforts to protect their right to publish, the film also presents numerous fascinating details that firmly establish setting while documenting the myriad duties, responsibilities, and editorial minutiae that go into the producing of a paper of The Post \u2018s size and reputation. \nWhen almost daily attacks on the press have begun to erode public support of and faith in the institution of journalism, a film like this becomes incredibly important to enshrine into the public consciousness a case where the government\u2019s own malfeasance led to suffering and hurt for many citizens. It was a situation where the press enabled the nation to understand the dangerous precedent set by a government willing to protect itself over its populace by limiting and attacking the very institution that was established to act as a check and balance on political power, to hold the government accountable for its actions. The Post drives home the necessity of such institutions. \n\u201cOnly a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell.\u201d That was the opening statement of Justice Hugo Black, the man who wrote the majority opinion for the Supreme Court in New York Times Co. v. United States. These words hold great philosophical, ethical, and moral power. They confirm to the public that the government in no way should be more important than the governed. \nThe Post puts forward an important story, one of surprising significance in our current political climate, with deftness, skill, and the utmost respect for the the institution of The Washington Post and all other publications that have succeeded because one newspaper stood up to the government and won. Spoiler Discussion \nThere are two scenes late in the film whose emotional importance require segregation from my formal review. Both scenes, if not prefaced by a spoiler warning, could ruin certain aspects of the film. Each carries a certain affecting presence that seeing for the first time would be diminished by forewarning. My recommendation is that you see the film first before returning to this section of the review. Any impact they have on you will be lessened if you proceed further. \nThe first scene is also the last. In All the President\u2019s Men , we are shown the burglary at the Watergate office complex. As Spielberg\u2019s film concludes, we are given a fairly similar version of the events. That scene is the perfect codicil to the film, establishing that the Pentagon Papers were just the beginning of what the Post would eventually uncover. At first, the resonance of the scene made me desirous of a follow-up film from Spielberg on the Watergate scandal. After some reflection, the scene also acts like a segue into that prior film\u2019s story. Either path would be an interesting one, though if it were referencing the Alan J. Pakula political masterpiece, it might have been advisable to reference it. \nThe second scene is one of quiet power. One of the undercurrents of this story is the struggle of women to compete in male-centered environments. This is referenced subtly at several moments in the film, but two stand out in a significant way. One is where an intern for opposing counsel speaks for a moment with Kay Graham encouraging her and thanking her. The other is the scene I am more specifically referencing. As the New York Times\u2019 lawyers speak to the assembled crowd, Kay, Ben, and others descend the steps of the courthouse through a narrow opening in the throng. Along this route, several women stand, quietly saluting the significance of the achievement Kay Graham has just made. It\u2019s a simple, elegant segment that resonates long after the film is over.

country's leadership and people.\"\nSpeaking at a meeting with the media covering the 38th GCC summit that concluded on Tuesday, the minister said that none of the GCC countries imposed preconditions to participate in the summit, especially with regard to the current crisis with Qatar.\nWhen asked by Asharq Al-Awsat about the crisis and Kuwait's mediation, Sheikh Mohammad said the mediation derives its credibility from the impartiality of the mediator, adding: \"our role as mediator requires us to be neutral in this crisis.\" He indicated that Kuwait's role is very important and vital and it will continue its efforts to reach a solution.\nWith regard to the Yemen crisis, the Kuwaiti minister said all GCC delegations agreed in the closed session on the importance of maintaining stability and unity of Yemen, adding that they all support efforts of political solution to this crisis.\nDuring the meeting, the minister also addressed foreign challenges, including Iran's interventions in the region, calling on Iran to abide by international law and good-neighborliness with its Gulf region.\n\"We are keen to avoid any issue that could create a disagreement between GCC states, but the issue of foreign interventions is not a controversial issue,\" he concluded.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

I still have a couple of nominees on this list that I\u2019m not sold on, so there\u2019s still room to adjust, but things are looking more solid now. Peter J. Patrick: The critics are giving out their awards, the Golden Globe nominations are almost upon us. Things are getting serious. Tripp Burton: (no commentary provided) Thomas LaTourette: It is strange that at this late date, few frontrunners have emerged in any category. With the changes in the Academy membership, it may be even harder to predict how they will vote now. The Post , Phantom Thread , and The Greatest Showman remain mysteries and it is difficult to guess not knowing how they will be received. I added The Post to a number of categories, as I feel the tale of a paper standing up to the government may resonate in the present political climate. Sadly, I removed Hugh Jackman and Ben Mendelsohn from my list as they seem to be losing traction, though I had gamely kept them on until this set. Many categories still feel fluid, so will see what we learn in the upcoming month and if they start to settle into neat groupings of fives.

And some things that if they are changed, especially with agriculture and certain areas of manufacturing, we could be looking at a lot of damage being done to our economy.\u201d \nFischer says she was glad to be one of the small group of senators who outlined to the Administration the benefits of NAFTA to Nebraska and the nation\u2019s economy. \nFischer also applauded President Trump for his announcement that recognizes Jerusalem, not Tel Aviv, as the capital of Israel. \nFischer told KNEB News the move was long overdue as part of American policy. Fischer explained, \u201cIt\u2019s been recognized for thousands of years that this is the capital of Israel. With regards to moving the embassy there, I think it is going to take some time to make sure the building constructed there is secure and meets the needs of our country.\u201d \u00a9 2017 Nebraska Rural Radio Association.

Ushering a whole new era for Xiaomi's aggressively-priced and pleasantly affordable lineup, the two new devices aim to bring the flashy new trend of tall displays to the masses. Granted, the two devices never step into Mi Mix 2-levels of streamlined bezel-less design. We've already seen what the two phones look like , with the rear on either one literally unchanged from what we saw on the Redmi Note 4 and a front that allows Xiaomi to do away with physical navigation buttons for the first time in its affordable lineups. Software buttons are in as the tall 2:1 displays simply leave no space for capacitive navigation buttons at the bottom. The Redmi 5 comes with a 5.7\" HD+ screen that boasts a resolution of 720 by 1440 pixels and has a Snapdragon 450 chipset ticking alongside a 3,300mAh battery, which should provide an admirable battery life. This one could be paired with either 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage or 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The former will cost $120 (799 yuan) while the better-spec'd version will be going for $135 (899 yuan) in China. The beefier Redmi 5 Plus has a 5.99\" Full HD+ display that boasts a resolution of 1080 by 2160 pixels and has the more-than-capable Snapdragon 625 chipset that will be drawing power form a 4,000mAh battery and will easily last you 2 days of intensive usage. The phone will be available with 3GB of RAM/32GB of storage that will go for $150 (999 yuan) and a top version with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage foir $195 (1,299 yuan).

I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that this runs small. I found it ran true to the size chart.I am typically a size 2 in pants and a 4 or 6 in a dress or jacket/ blazer. My measurements are 37-27-37 and I wear a 36C bra. I ordered a 6 because of the bust and was concerned it would be too tight. However, it fits perfectly, but would say someone who wears an A or a B cup would find it a little big. If a D cup, would probably still be OK if overall not broader than the 37 measurement but would likely show more cleavage. I think a 38 might be pushing it and anything under 35 without a bigger cup size would be too big.The waist is a little snug when zipping it. But once zipped all the way up and adjusted to lay properly, it fit perfectly. In fact, it looks just like the picture on me and it really shows the curves making my waist look really tiny. I do plan to lose about 5 pounds (128 now and 5\u20197\u2033) which would bring my waist down to a 26 or 26 1/2 which would make sure that the zipper doesn\u2019t pull at all, since I don\u2019t have any wiggle room in the waist. The hips definitely are fine and an inch up or down at 36 or 38 would still work fine.I\u2019m not planning to wear this until September when we go to the Caribbean, but didn\u2019t want to take the chance of it not being available because I absolutely love it. The leopard print is the softest satin. The black isn\u2019t quite as soft or shiny, but still beautiful with some sheen which actually makes the leopard stand out even more. And the rhinestones at the waist are gorgeous.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "tidebuy evening dress reviews  customer reviews", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:04.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a42d829ff81928f4cbae41d6f76d0c5805b56fcb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc6AEto4TXQCFz6RpxlKmvCR", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/v/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/v/ - Video Games - 4chan", "title": ">the more effort you put in getting an ending the", "title_full": "/v/ - >the more effort you put in getting an ending the - Video Games - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T01:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 358, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "450e1d277e9eada5103d6979738acc154d00937b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc6AEto4TXQCFylT7hVY2QGLhprUXHaXsNc-", "ord_in_thread": 278, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T09:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>399229295\nHow long would it take for the babby hunter great one to become an adult?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:04.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a42d829ff81928f4cbae41d6f76d0c5805b56fcb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc6AEto4TXQCFz6RpxlKmvCR", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/v/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/v/ - Video Games - 4chan", "title": ">the more effort you put in getting an ending the", "title_full": "/v/ - >the more effort you put in getting an ending the - Video Games - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T01:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 358, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "62332b0d6c0f50c9295889298a6c3b9f2490c741", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc6AEto4TXQCFylT7hVY2QGLg65b6wyXoWA-", "ord_in_thread": 280, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T09:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I wish From would make an action rpg with a lighter setting again.
