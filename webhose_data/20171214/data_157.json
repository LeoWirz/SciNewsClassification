Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order.

Owing to Cyclone Ockhi , the city recorded the highest-ever December rainfall on Tuesday, in just 12 hours . Rainfall during 8.30am-8.30pm at the IMD's Santacruz observatory was 36mm , which beat the previous record of 31.4mm, recorded on December 12, 1967. As Ockhi came close to the city on Tuesday, it brought in a day full of rains and gusty winds, leading to a steep drop in temperatures. The maximum temperatures recorded at both the Santacruz and Colaba observatories were 10 degrees lower than on Monday. As a result, at several places, noon-time unusually was much cooler than dawn. Also, there was barely a two-degree difference between maximum and minimum temperatures at most places. Ockhi's threat had prompted the government to keep schools shut, which lead to an easing of school-time traffic. For adults, it was business as usual, barring minor absenteeism, though organizations had issued advisories to employees. While rainfall was moderate, rumour mongers were busy creating panic with fake news on the sea link and various roads, prompting the BMC to tweet: \"Please don't create panic.\" In fact, no transport disruption was reported from anywhere in the city. The trains ran, as did the buses and cars. The BMC also had to make special arrangements in municipal and private schools in Dadar and Parel to shelter about 20,000 followers of Dr BR Ambedkar who thronged Chaityabhoomi in large numbers for Ambedkar's death anniversary, observed on December 6. As many as 1.5 lakh followers are known to have already visited the site, with 6 lakh expected on Wednesday. Three persons were injured on Tuesday as a pandal at Shivaji Park fell on them. Meanwhile, all 2,606 boats and other vessels off the state's coast since Saturday have been accounted for, and no fishermen are missing. Passenger boat services, suspended because of Ockhi, are likely to resume on Wednesday. Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, scientist and head of the cyclone warning division at IMD, said that till Tuesday noon cyclone Ockhi was 230km west southwest of Mumbai. \"In the evening it was closest to Mumbai (around 100km) and moved north-northeastwards and weakened gradually.

He has complex needs and requires help with most things and from the online descriptors he should get enhanced rate for both categories but I am a little nervous as I've read so many accounts of obviously disabled people having to appeal. However, the DWP have recently sent their (very nice) lady out to go through the forms to make me his appointee - does this bode well? I wondered if that means they go through cases and the ones that they assume will transition to PIP receive a visit. Or would someone have been sent out regardless? Just wondering if I can take any reassurance from the visit Originally posted by LocoLoco \u201d Do you mean does becoming his appointee give him an advantage ofbeing awarded PIP? If so then no, it doens't mean anything. Becoming his appointee simply means that you will now be able to make calls to DWP on his behalf, control his money by having any future payments made to your bank account, sign any letters for him, and be responsible for reporting any changes of any benefits he recieves, you'll also be able to speak on his behalf during any face 2 face assessments he may need. Those that have an appointee go through the same procedure as anyone else. Most people have an assessment for PIP, it's rare to have a paper based decision. You'll need evidence to support his claim too. Have you started his PIP application yet?

There are at least six active wildfires burning in Southern California right now. That's nearly the total of all large December wildfires from 2000 to 2015 , according to Cal Fire statistics . The map below shows active fires as of noon, Dec. 6. If you look at the statistics below, they show a mere seven California fires that burned more than 300 acres when totaling December numbers from 2000 to 2015. The second lowest months were January and February with 11 such wildfires. July had the most fires between 2000 and 2015 with a total of 313. Of the seven fires in December from 2000 to 2015, four were in Southern California and two were in Ventura County. The total acres burned in those seven fires was 21,090. The fire burning right now in Ventura County, called the Thomas fire , is estimated to have already burned 65,000 acres - almost three times the acreage of the other December fires. The previous largest fire in December was the Shekell fire in Ventura which burned 13,600 acres in 2006. Even before the start of this week's fires, this year was going down as the most destructive wildfire season in California history , state officials said. From Jan. 1 to Dec. 3, there were 6,762 fires that destroyed 505,391 acres. That's 43 percent more events for the same time period last year, when 244,297 acres were destroyed, according to Cal Fire. \"Fuel. Ignition. Meteorology. Each component of the formula are off the charts this year,\" said Bill Patzert, a climatologist for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"When all three elements in the equation are supersized, you're set up for apocalyptic conditions.\" California is not alone in feeling the pain. In the U.S. Forest Service's 2017 briefing to Congress in October the agency said that the fire season was the most costly across the nation. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said, \"As wildfire costs exceed $2 billion, I appreciate those in Congress who recognize this funding issue and are working to make a permanent fix that allows us to manage our forests preemptively. While we can't stop these wildfires, we know we can be prepared in a much better way.\" Wildfire suppression for the Forest Service costs for the fiscal year exceeded $2 billion, making it the most expensive year on record.

The Thomas fire has burned at least 90,000 acres. The Creek fire has burned at least 12,600 acres and the Rye fire destroyed at least 7,000 acres. The Skirball fire covered 475 acres as of Wednesday evening. So far the Thomas fire has destroyed at least 150 structures and the Creek fire has destroyed at least 30 structures. More than 1,800 firefighters have battled the erratic Thomas fire, which is just 5% contained, according to the latest update by Cal Fire. The Creek fire is also 5% contained and the Skirball fire is 10% contained. Little Mountain Fire is now 100% contained.

It\u2019s a great, inspiring and motivating thread we start each day to discuss what Old Style things we\u2019re going to do today or what we\u2019ve achieved already. Everyone\u2019s welcome, please do come in, put your feet up (although check the fence hasn\u2019t just been painted first!) and join us for an Old Style natter. The more the merrier! As this is the Old Style Board, it would be appreciated if posts could include some Old Style content. Please be aware that many people may have small screens, or SLOW internet connections, so please don\u2019t post large pictures, or clip art \u2013 links are preferred. When you make a post, if you feel like giving it a title, that will help others that don\u2019t have the time to read everything skim through the thread quickly but if not it's not a problem. Please do not start a new daily thread before you go to bed at night because this often leaves things confusing with two daily threads live at the same time. The idea is that a member would start each new daily thread after they get up in the morning. Morning everyone Hugs to those that want/need one x Happy birthday to those with a birthday x DH up and gone to work stupid early, DS1 now getting ready for work and DS2 still in his pit, will wake him shortly. Dinner last night was chicken in country sauce, mash, carrots, peas, LO cauli/broc cheese and yorkshires - all eaten and enjoyed, although I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, and they just shrunk, so will make sure I only use chicken breast next time. Tonight I'm not sure what we'll be eating, but will organise that later. Yesterday work wasn't too bad in the morning, but then became very busy in the afternoon, as I do a different job on Weds afternoons, and there's not enough staff, but the time does pass quickly. I'm now on days' off, so will crack on with the \"to do\" list. I'll be heading to town first thing to visit the bank and building society, then home to crack on.

Metropolitan Opera via AP) Soprano Nadine Sierra is making her mark at a young age By MIKE SILVERMAN Associated Press December 06, 2017 09:49 AM UPDATED December 06, 2017 09:50 AM NEW YORK \nShe made history of sorts at age 20 by becoming the youngest singer ever to win the Metropolitan Opera's vocal competition. Now, at the age of 29, Nadine Sierra is on the brink of stardom. \nIt's been a dizzying rise for the Florida-born soprano, who started voice lessons at age 6, began performing in opera as a teen and made her Met debut as Gilda in Verdi's \"Rigoletto\" in 2015. \nReturn engagements have followed at the Met, including a Live in HD broadcast of Mozart's \"Idomeneo\" and an upcoming run as Susanna in \"The Marriage of Figaro.\" She's in demand in Venice, Milan, Paris and Berlin, and she is featured in a recording of \"Rigoletto\" starring Dmitri Hvorostovsky that was released shortly before the Russian baritone's death. \nTo cap it off, she won this year's Richard Tucker Award, worth $50,000 and a chance to headline a gala concert at Carnegie Hall on Sunday, Dec. 10, to be broadcast live on WQXR radio and streamed on its website.

Of her Met debut, George Loomis wrote in Opera magazine that her \"limpid tone and delicate phrasing proved ideal for the naive, sheltered girl, as did her lithe, slightly fragile appearance.\" \nThe \"promising young artist\" tag became attached to Sierra's name the moment she was named one of four winners in the Met's National Council Audition finals in 2009. But soon she longed to shed it. \n\"I've always wanted to be seen as more than just a young, promising singer \u2014 even when I was,\" Sierra said in an interview. \"A lot of young singers get into this trap. They're treated as young artists for a really long time before they're taken seriously as professionals.\" \nHer answer to that problem? \"I guess my strategy has been to sing roles that are really hard to sing and sing the (expletive) out of them.\" \nGilda was one such role, and she sang it \"over and over\" until the Met decided she was ready. \n\"I didn't want to go into the Met singing small roles and covering,\" she said. \"I wanted a real debut.\" \nAs ambitious as she is, Sierra is a big believer in the importance of saying \"no\" to roles that she might be right for five or 10 years down the road but which don't suit her lyric soprano sound right now. Mimi in Puccini's \"La Boheme\" is one such role, and the title role of Massenet's \"Manon\" turned out to be another. \nShe was engaged two years ago to sing the latter role in San Francisco this fall but said when she took a closer look at the score, \"I honestly didn't think I could do it justice. It's heavier than anything I've really gone up against.\" \n\"I didn't want to get into the theater and sing it my way and have somebody tell me, 'You know we can't hear you, can you give us a little bit more?'\" she said. \"And have that pressure to give more sound and feel like I'm pushing.\" \nBut Mimi and Manon are likely in her future, as is Violetta in Verdi's \"La Traviata.\" She'll try out Violetta's first-act coloratura aria at the gala, where she becomes the latest in a parade of American singers like Renee Fleming, Deborah Voigt, Joyce DiDonato and Christine Goerke to be honored with the Tucker prize. \nBarry Tucker said the panel of judges who choose each year's winner are looking for someone on the cusp of stardom. For him there's no question Sierra fits that description. \n\"She's ready to blast off,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ilia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nadine sierra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mike silverman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "verdi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puccini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitri hvorostovsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deborah voigt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mozart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barry tucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "violetta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massenet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine goerke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard tucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renee fleming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joyce didonato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mimi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george loomis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susanna", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "metropolitan opera", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "south park magazine", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "carnegie hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sierra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wqxr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metropolitan opera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sierra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venice", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:46.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5260bb758b57bd219ce40f43c9ed47353fba69c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_DRNYNHvKGwBXjWTOM6I0DqkaNuiAPwQKZ.ZT2PbVjXF7Sr6HW1sj", "site_full": "www.55188.com", "site": "55188.com", "site_section": "http://www.55188.com/forum-8-2.html", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "\u0104\u017e\u0161\u00c9\u0118\u0110\u0118\u013e\u0150\u02dd\u0110\u0139\u010e\u02d8\u02dd\u0165\u00c1\u00f7\u00c7\u0159\u0104\u017c -

The president also directed processes commence to formally move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. World leaders including the EU and Arab countries had cautioned against the move saying it could further worsen the crisis in the Middle East. The Arab League has announced an emergency meeting for  Saturday  on the matter while Turkey has threatened such move could affect its relationship with Israel. Israel and Palestine both claim Jerusalem as capitals with many world leaders suggesting only after a resolution of the crisis between the two countries should be status of Jerusalem be resolved. By his pronouncement  on Wednesday , the U.S. becomes the first country in the world to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \u201cToday we finally acknowledge the obvious, that Jerusalem is Israel\u2019s capital,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a live broadcast. Despite a U.S. law of over two decades mandating he recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, previous American leaders have pushed back at implementing the law for fear of its impact on the peace talks between Israel and Palestine. Recognising Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital \u201cis also the right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump said the new U.S. embassy to be built in Jerusalem will be a \u201cmagnificent tribute to peace.\u201d He said the recent decisions do not take the U.S. away from its commitment to a two-state solution \u201cif agreed to by both sides,\u201d in reference to the Israelis and the Palestinians. \u201cWe want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis, a great deal for the Palestinians,\u201d he said; adding that the \u201cU.S. remains committed to peace agreement acceptable to both sides.\u201d In a prompt response to Mr. Trump\u2019s statement, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said the UN remained committed to the two-state solution with Jerusalem as the capital of both Israel and Palestine. \u201cThere is no alternative to the two state solution. There is no Plan B,\u201d Mr. Guterres said. In his reaction, Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu commended Mr. Trump calling it a historic landmark. He, like Mr. Trump, said the decision would not affect all persons right to worship in the holy places in Jerusalem. \u201cWe are profoundly grateful to the president (Trump) for his courageous and just decision,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said.

Vv.14-25 Paul gave a brief history from Abraham to John the Baptist who proclaimed the coming of the Messiah, Jesus.\nPaul was very direct with his brethren and those who fear God by saying \u201cthe message of salvation has been sent.\u201d Paul did not bring a message of deliverance from Rome, but a message of deliverance from sin. Paul had identified the Savior in v.23 \u201c God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus\u201d. However, the leaders and people in Jerusalem did not recognize Jesus as the Son of God nor did they recognize the prophecies about Him that they heard read every Sabbath day.\nTherefore they fulfilled them by condemning Jesus, tried Him in a series of illegal trials. They found no evidence against Him but found Him guilty of blasphemy based on His testimony that He was the Son of God. It was illegal under Jewish law to convict a person by his testimony alone, but they ask Pilate to execute Jesus by crucifixion for treason against Rome. B On Passover day C they crucified Jesus D and the Romans guards certified that He was dead. Before sundown His friends buried Him in the borrowed tomb of a believer who was a rich member of the Sanhedrin.\nHave you ever considered the question \u201cWho Killed Jesus?\u201d There is enough evidence to indict the whole human race, including you and me, Satan and God the Father. E \nDoes it surprise you that those who knew the prophecies of the Messiah were the ones who handed Him over to Pilate for execution?

The development of the system began in 2015 and is now in the developmental phase, and is scheduled to go live by May 2019. All major Dutch banks have decided to contribute towards its development. Once implemented, the new instant payment system will enable individuals to transfer funds within five seconds with no amount limit. - To benefit from a growing preference for alternative payments, banks and payment service providers are launching new solutions. In August 2017, de Volksbank introduced its mobile wallet allowing users to make NFC-based mobile payments at POS terminals. The wallet, which is managed by G+D Mobile Security, supports both Visa and Mastercard debit cards issued by the bank. Previously, ABN Amro had launched its digital ABN wallet in November 2016. This was followed by the launch of Seqr by Swedish mobile payment (m-payment) solution provider Seamless in March, and the ING mobile wallet by ING Bank. - Migration towards contactless is expected to be the next trend in the Netherlands. According to the Dutch Payments Association, the number of contactless payments in 2016 increased by almost five times to 630 million payments, compared to 135 million in 2015. In December 2016, 24% of all debit card payments were contactless. In addition, the acceptance of contactless cards is well-developed with two thirds of all payment terminals in the Netherlands enabled for contactless payment, compared with one third in 2015. All terminals are required to be equipped for contactless payments by 2020. To capitalize on the increasing acceptance of contactless technology, Rabobank in collaboration with mobile network operator KPN announced an NFC-enabled m-payment option in January 2016. \nKey points to buy \n- Make strategic business decisions, using top-level historic and forecast market data, related to the Dutch cards and payments industry and each market within it. - Understand the key market trends and growth opportunities in the Dutch cards and payments industry. - Assess the competitive dynamics in the Dutch cards and payments industry. - Gain insights into marketing strategies used for various card types in the Netherlands. - Gain insights into key regulations governing the Dutch cards and payments industry. \nTable of Contents", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mas", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ing bank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "abn amro", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mastercard", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rabobank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dutch payments association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g+d mobile security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "globaldata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dutch payment association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kpn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volksbank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands  pune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maharashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:46.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3fa0151f871fd4a5f76d3dee1bbf6b7f59c236e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7uI68rqpB3Ly2x2JbwLqa42nJvKF3MTE59VkchO3OXgaP1F1Lny.dRr3zbx_WVDVPX2tt_GLM6BHkuHne_oeGF1hnLwa.UQ2w-", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "2018 \u2013 Pre-orders, rumours, hopes dream and aspirations", "title_full": "2018 \u2013 Pre-orders, rumours, hopes dream and aspirations | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-11-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/80/80811.jpg?1511637799", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3fa0151f871fd4a5f76d3dee1bbf6b7f59c236e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7uI68rqpB3Ly2x2JbwLqa42nJvKF3MTE59VkchO3OXgaP1F1Lny.dRr3zbx_WVDVPX2tt_GLM6BHkuHne_oeGF1hnLwa.UQ2w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kiss73", "published": "2017-11-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "2018 \u2013 Pre-orders, rumours, hopes dream and aspirations", "text": "2018 \u2013 Pre-orders, rumours, hopes dream and aspirations\nSo the music magazines have all done their \u201cbest of 2017\u201d lists, and to be honest, unless the announcement has already been made, I suspect we already know what\u2019s coming out (or not) in the remainder of 2017\nSo\u2026\u2026onto 2018 then\u2026\u2026I\u2019m curious what folks are expecting in 2018.\nPre-orders already placed, rumours, hopes dreams and aspirations \u2026..stick them all on\u2026..maybe you\u2019ve heard something other don\u2019t know about.\nPre-orders\nSo far for 2018 I\u2019ve pre ordered the following for January/February\nSwarbrick & Wilson \u2013 Kailyard Tales (12th January)\nWhitesnake \u2013 The Purple Tour (19th January)\nStarcrawler \u2013 Starcrawler (19th January)\nW.A.S.P \u2013 The Crimson Idol \u2013 Re-idolised (2nd February)\nRumours\nJethro Tull have already mentioned that there will be a bunch of releases for their 50th Anniversary.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott barbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament approves same-sex marriage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images members of parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the sydney morning herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "federation square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images  australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:47.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0b8b0b8105b18c97a38410a6fcb454d7f32440d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9zMuu7yP7.9kahUylEgmYLQ5beCnD9SoFdgLb3MnwmSNYeOLhEJikDfUM6LhBJ4f9H9yrYoWtpl7.Jh12LT952US5A5OJOCws-", "site_full": "www.nigerianeye.com", "site": "nigerianeye.com", "site_section": "http://www.nigerianeye.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News Today.

Information gathered from the area which is about 100 kilometres from Calabar indicated that Fulani herders in their scores invaded farmlands in the community, Tuesday night from Arochukwu axis of Abia State, leading to a violent confrontation between them and the local population. A source who refused to be quoted stated that the invading Fulani who entered the community with their cattle, opened gun fire on the locals who made to prevent the grazing animals from destroying their farms. Sources from the community said following the ensuing clash, many casualties have been recorded, but could not provide the exact number of the dead or the injured. However, they stated that many families, numbering about 200 have been displaced due to the fighting which was said to be ongoing as of yesterday afternoon.\u201cThe problem commenced last night at about 9p.m. when the community people noticed that Fulani men had invaded their farmlands with cows, and were destroying their crops. When they went to chase the Fulani away from their farms the owners of the cows shot at them. As I am talking to you, there is still fighting going on with the youths, young men of the community. Women and children have all left to the neighbouring communities. There are some casualties, and our community has been invaded by the Fulani herdsmen and their cows,\u201d a source from the community said. Another source claimed that after the fighting ensued, some men in military uniform have been sighted in the community, allegedly lending some support to the Fulani herdsmen. However, the information could not be verified by THISDAY. The police authorities in the state have confirmed the clash, but said no death was recorded on both sides. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Irene Ugbo, said a strong police contingent hadbeen deployed to restore normalcy to the area. Ugbo said, so far, no casualty has been reported to the police, and that the latest information from their men on ground indicates that the situation has been brought to normal.

'Hit him like he's a running back'", "text": "comment \nEDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. -- The career high Cam Newton posted the last time he faced the Minnesota Vikings defense is one he\u2019d probably like to forget. \nSix Vikings sacked the former MVP a total of eight times in that September 2016 game. Three came from Everson Griffen , while Danielle Hunter , Linval Joseph , Brian Robison , Anthony Barr and Harrison Smith each got a piece of Newton in the Vikings' 22-10 win. Everson Griffen had three sacks on Cam Newton the last time the Vikings played the Panthers. Scott W. Grau/Icon Sportswire \nTwo seasons prior, in 2014, the Vikings sacked Newton six times. He posted his second-lowest completion percentage of that season (51.4) in a demoralizing loss to Minnesota in which the Vikings returned two blocked punts for touchdowns. \nAnd now on Sunday, at a time when the 2010 Heisman Trophy winner is beginning to look like his old self, Newton runs into the No. 2 defense in the NFL as his Carolina Panthers host the Vikings. The Panthers have won four of their last five games, with Newton going 80-of-146 passing for 896 yards, seven touchdowns and one interception. \nThe designed runs installed in Carolina\u2019s offense are Newton\u2019s bread and butter. His scrambling and ability to pick up yards on broken plays have led to his 515 rushing yards, which ranks him second on the team behind running back Jonathan Stewart \nThe Vikings have faced other mobile quarterbacks this season, but the 6-foot-5, 245-pounder poses a different challenge. Newton keeps defenders on their toes because the Panthers\u2019 system hinges on unpredictability. Mixing in some well-timed runs when teams might be expecting the opposite has played a big role in his success. \n\u201cHe is a very, very talented athlete,\u201d Mike Zimmer said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a few different things with him now. He\u2019s got a very strong arm. Competitive. They\u2019re good on third downs. They use him a lot in the running game so it makes it difficult.\u201d \nYet despite the league-wide notion that Newton is hard to bring down, the Vikings have done it far more often than others. Preparing for a quarterback they know is going to keep the ball and run with it puts them on alert. NFL Playoff Machine \nNFL Playoff Machine \n\u201cYou have to be disciplined in your gaps,\u201d Everson Griffen said. \u201cYou have to get off, escape the block and, when he runs by design, you have to hit him like he\u2019s a running back and not like he\u2019s a quarterback, because he\u2019s not protected then. \n\u201cHe\u2019s a big guy. You just hit him.\u201d \nThe pressure Minnesota will put on Newton is pivotal. The quarterback has struggled when being forced to make quick throws. That\u2019s what the Saints did against Newton last week, resulting in a win over the Panthers that put New Orleans in control in the NFC South for now. \nAgainst a traditional four-man pass rush, Newton was 13-of-15 passing with two touchdowns. Against the blitz, he finished 4-of-12 for 35 yards. New Orleans went from sending a blitz on 23 percent of snaps in the first half to 66 percent in the second half in Week 13, according to ESPN Stats and Information. \nThe Vikings don\u2019t utilize a ton of blitz packages but will likely get creative in the way they send in pressure to keep Newton at bay. \n\u201cWith a quarterback like that, he\u2019s going to try to extend the play,\u201d Andrew Sendejo said. \u201cSometimes you can force him into bad decisions, bad throws. It\u2019s kind of the same thing every week: Have to stop the run, get them behind schedule, get them in third-and-long.\u201d \nIt\u2019s what worked for the Vikings in their 14-9 win over the Falcons last week. Minnesota didn\u2019t register a sack in Week 13, and it didn\u2019t need to with the pressure it was able to get on Matt Ryan in other ways, which forced him to make quick throws. \nIt showed up most on third down, where Ryan averaged 2.19 seconds from snap to release, which is much quicker than his 2.48-second season average. That was his third-fastest release time on third down this season, which resulted in the NFL\u2019s best third-down offense converting on just one of 10 attempts. \n\u201cIf they\u2019re getting the ball out quick, they\u2019re 1-for-10, that means they\u2019re not throwing the ball downfield, they\u2019re not giving us a chance to get a sack,\u201d Griffen said. \u201cWe hit him, we affected him. If we go up against any team in the league and they\u2019re 1-for-10 on third down, we\u2019re going to win the game.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vikings", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "cam newton", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "harrison smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott w. grau/icon sportswire  two", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian robison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony barr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danielle hunter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew sendejo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linval joseph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike zimmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "everson griffen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "griffen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vikings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl playoff machine  nfl playoff machine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panthers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saints", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "falcons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carolina panthers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espn stats and information", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new orleans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cam newton", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:47.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3fa0151f871fd4a5f76d3dee1bbf6b7f59c236e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7uI68rqpB3Ly2x2JbwLqa42nJvKF3MTE59VkchO3OXgaP1F1Lny.dRr3zbx_WVDVPX2tt_GLM6BHkuHne_oeGF1hnLwa.UQ2w-", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "2018 \u2013 Pre-orders, rumours, hopes dream and aspirations", "title_full": "2018 \u2013 Pre-orders, rumours, hopes dream and aspirations | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-11-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/80/80811.jpg?1511637799", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8555de00484284477de79b910b8d13202c4b77c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7uI68rqpB3Ly2x2JbwLqa42nJvKF3MTE59VkchO3OXgaP1F1Lny.dRr3zbx_WVDVPX2tt_GLM6BHkuHne_oeGFLD9SjskzVHJJIwB9mwL1cg--", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "Rosskolnikov", "published": "2017-11-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Kiss73 said: \u2191 Don't want to be a fun sponge but think the new track might just be for a new compilation coming out in February to commemorate their 40th anniversary.\nToto- 40 Trips Around the Sun\nGreat new track though and 2 other new ones on it as well.

It started innocently Tuesday morning when I saw on facebook (bad habit of mine, to check facebook early in the morning while my mind is fresh) when someone checked in as safe due to the St. Thomas Fire as a late night fire had spread through the city of Ventura. , I checked instinctively to make sure my parents' home in Camarillo was OK (I was, we got lucky), then almost as quickly dismissed it as just another fire, but then those concerns get reignited later that morning when there were reports of another fire near the 118, then early this morning (Wednesday) there was footage of fires burning near the Getty Center and making the I-405 seem like barbecue pit, that's when it really hit home. Fires are apparently especially dangerous this time due to the strong Santa Ana winds and have shut down even major highways, making it very scary for humans, but especially deadly for homes. Gotta imagine the houses, if they could speak, would be lamenting that the humans and animals get to just get up and run out but the houses themselves are sitting ducks for the spreading fire. Lots of lessons to be learned from this round of fire disasters, the big one being: 1.) Check for fire insurance when buying a home (as well as earthquake insurance, other natural disaster insurance), but also 2.) fires are no joke. People are losing their homes and everything they ever owned, and it could have been my home or my parents' home that got caught in the damage, or me that woke up to our neighborhood being burned down and having to quickly grab everything and take video while we hurriedly rushed out to escape the disaster. Stats: 96 square miles! More than 50,000 Ventura County residents were evacuated from 15,000 homes. But what really stuck out was the Getty Center indicating that it was keeping its priceless art in the museum despite the fires, indicating that the fires had spread close to its walls. It really looks like a scene straight out of an end-of-world armageddon movie where chaos reigns in city centers and everything we thought was safe is torn apart. I've lived through a lot of natural disasters of various varieties growing in Chicago (blizzards, excessive heat, tornados, flash floods, etc.) but never really got caught in anything serious, in fact I've only benefited from them through school closings like snow days, where everyone gets excited about having a special day and it seems more like a holiday, but as an adult these disasters seem much more ominous and capable of causing massive damage, and it's humbling knowing one cannot control their own fate, that these things can happen without warning and that we're right in the way of these natural disasters.

Do you feel that all you know about it is that it\u2019s made of grapes? When you want to learn all you can about wine, this article has a great deal of information for you. Read on to learn about the great world of wine.\nSimply because a bottle of wine is more expensive than another does not mean that it is necessarily better. You don\u2019t have to buy the most expensive bottles of wine that you find. Try wine at all different price levels. You may like something better that is less expensive than what you usually buy.\n\nDo not spend your money on full cases of wine if you are not sure you like it. It is best to purchase an experimental bottle, or even better, taste the wine before you purchase it. You should consider buying full cases of win if you know you will easily be able to serve it when you have company.\nIf you are venturing into trying new wines, it is better to get an experimental bottle over a whole case. Given the wide variety of wines and styles out there, single educational bottles are a great idea whenever drinking something new for the first time. If you like the taste, move up to a half-case.\n\nIf you are planning to cook with wine, examine your recipe closely. If it calls for dry white wine, this means that the recipe will not work well with a wine that is sweet. Look for a wine that states that it is dry, and you will avoid ruining a potentially fantastic dish.\nDon\u2019t let the opinions of others determine what wine you prefer. Only you can decide if a wine is one that you enjoy. This is the rule you should live by. Your palate is different from anybody else\u2019s. The upshot here is that if your friends don\u2019t like your favorite, you can save more for yourself!\nThe longer you keep the white wine in the fridge, the more the coldness will affect both its smell and taste. Therefore, it is best to only chill wine for several hours prior to serving. This will maximize the taste and enjoyment that you will receive from each bottle you drink.\nA good tip if you\u2019re interested in learning more about wine is to go to as many wine tastings as you can. Wine tastings are great because they allow you to try out all kinds of wine which will help you figure out what you like and what you don\u2019t like.\nThe method of keeping a nice Spanish wine fresh changes depending on the type of wine. One of the longer lasting Spanish wines is Rioja. Store the bottle in a cook, dark place until you are ready to enjoy it.\nTake https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2017/11/new-book-aims-to-be-gold-standard-for-italian-wine/ on any wine that you try out. You aren\u2019t going to really know what you are doing at first. However, over time, you will start noticing specific trends in your notes and reactions. You might even see that your reaction to particular wine\u2019s changes as you drink more of them.\nRead up on wine during your free time. The more that you learn about wine, the better you will be at picking new wines to add to your collection. There is a lot to know, so spend time learning when you can if you want to become a true wine connoisseur.\nTry purchasing different wines to find ones that you enjoy. Don\u2019t drink the same old wine day after day; you\u2019ll get bored. Partake of many regions and flavors. It is quite possible you will save a few dollars as well.\nA good tip when purchasing wine at the supermarket is to know how to pick out the right wine. In the wine aisle, you\u2019ll often find a lot of huge jugs of wine. This type of wine isn\u2019t very good so you\u2019ll want to cross all of those off your list.\nWhen buying wine, the year it was produced is not necessarily the most important factor. While http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/rocflavors/2017/08/24/irondequoit-spot-known-delicious-italian-food/593439001/ of a region can change the taste of a wine, most of the largest wine-producing regions have fairly consistent temperatures. This means that a bottle produced in California in 2005 and a bottle from 2007, for example, should taste pretty similar.\nAlways smell your wine before you taste it. One reason is that it could be spoiled, which can be easily identified by smelling it, which could save you from getting sick. Additionally, you can also learn a lot about the wine from its aroma, and if you stick with this habit you will begin to identify how over time.\nLook for bottles of wine that have a screwcap rather than a cork. Since cork has imperfections in it, it may affect the taste of the wine. While this doesn\u2019t happen often, it is a possibility. Screwcaps are becoming more popular and are less likely to affect the wine in any way.\nSake is an often overlooked type of wine that warrants further investigation. Sake originated in Japan and is labeled as a rice wine. Rice wine goes well with a variety of foods, including appetizers, entrees and desserts. Give your Japanese dishes a hearty boost by adding sake as the beverage of choice.\nNow that you know a little more about how to incorporate wine into your life, it\u2019s time to get started. Perhaps you want to select the right wine on your next date, or maybe you want to start your own wine collection. Now you should have a good idea as to how to go about doing that.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rioja", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:48.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "30c150ad5540fe679388533817cb3a154f964d0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsK4NWGnaXtQwSiwqyuOAXqz8i8QPlYMoawOoWCz1Uie_JnLOSPvq7mbMt5_XcL38m0P8AYpfKIDY1YASeUpZI3BkSNNv72noWAPSLfh.0Dzz8", "site_full": "community.klipsch.com", "site": "klipsch.com", "site_section": "https://community.klipsch.com/index.php?/forum/63-garage-sale/", "site_categories": ["home_and_garden", "home_theater"], "section_title": "Garage Sale - The Klipsch Audio Community", "title": "Carver AV-505 Five Channel Amplifier $250", "title_full": "Carver AV-505 Five Channel Amplifier $250 - Garage Sale - The Klipsch Audio Community", "published": "2017-11-30T08:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d032464ae8dfda9cf864d40c36f9f4bbd17a4215", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsK4NWGnaXtQwSiwqyuOAXqz8i8QPlYMoawOoWCz1Uie_JnLOSPvq7mbMt5_XcL38m0P8AYpfKIDY1YASeUpZI3BkSNNv72noWAAM9ChfujX5kZTuCOE3v8D8-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "japosey", "published": "2017-12-02T08:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "These are nice amps.

A simple way to do this would be to license MacOS for a few workstation-class machines, since a Mac is basically a UEFI PC with a few specific bits of hardware.\nAnd this is largely what drives Hackinstosh these days, but Apple is never going down that route. With the original Apples being cloned (you used to be able to fly to Hong Kong and catch a train out to Shim Sha Tsui in Kowloon and pick up a beautiful Apple clone and accessories and spend a few days and fly back (from Sydney) for not a lot more than buying a genuine Apple) they learned their lesson in their mind and decided they were a hardware company, and they still are (just more consumer hardware these days, but some signs of some return to pro support in some areas).\nThere are some fantastic Hackintosh systems out there, but they are all in breach of the EULA for OS X / Mac OS, so that really should mean no photog (with a reliance on protection of IP) should be using one out of principle in addition to the genuine legal issue.\nApple do lots of things right (most things, really), but at the top end their approach of \"we know best\" that works for consumers isn't really right for pro users in many cases (in some it is). Some more flexibility there would help.\nThe other thing, regarding fixing products and so on, is to look at local consumer protection laws. Given the higher value of their products I know, for example, that in Australia they've been smacked down for refusing to cover things under warranty because it was outside of their stated (express) warranty, but within what the law considers a reasonable time for them to have to cover given the price points. They've adjusted things to avoid further unwanted attention from the authorities.

The Republican-led House passed a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \nThe House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines \u2013 a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. \nOn a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep.

The money raised will then be used to establish individual Community Loan Funds, tailored to suit the needs of any particular community. \nWith its first Community Partner \u2013 Scotland\u2019s Social Enterprise Networks \u2013 SCF is today issuing a Community Bond Prospectus to establish a bespoke Social Enterprise Community Loan Fund. \nThis new loan fund will make micro, unsecured and affordable finance available to social enterprises that provide goods and services to communities \u2013 often in situations of market failure, where the private sector doesn\u2019t exist because providing goods or services would not be profitable. Such social enterprises \u2013 which can be a lifeline to regeneration communities and those in remote rural areas \u2013 are increasingly unable to obtain the finance they need from mainstream banks and other lending institutions. \n\u201cPurchasing Community Bonds is about making an investment in your local community. Becoming a Community Investor shows your support for your community and encourages regeneration, local job creation, vibrant local facilities and a diverse economy,\u201d said Pauline Hinchion. \nSCF Ltd is looking for other communities that might be interested in establishing a Community Loan Fund. \nFor more details, contact SCF on 07934 690429 or email [email protected] .
