His work is in our memories and will always stay with us.\" \nBelgian radio stations played his songs during the morning rush hour, and the news immediately hit the top of the country's main news sites. In the Brussels subway system, his top hits were played over intercoms in a special tribute as many thousands milled about to get to work. \n___ \n11 a.m. \nThe woman credited with launching the career of Johnny Hallyday, the French rock star who has died, says that she knew that he was special but never thought he would become a national icon. \nLine Renaud, a singer and national figure in her own right, said after the announcement of his death early Tuesday that \"with Johnny, it was a revolution.\" \nShe told TV Channel CNews by phone that \"I never realized the immensity of his career because this type of career didn't exist here.\" \nRenaud, referred to as Johnny's \"godmother,\" said she last saw him at a dinner she gave with guests that included the Macrons, but didn't specify if Emmanuel Macron was already president. Photos on Twitter show Macron and wife Brigitte with the two, dated last year, before his election. \n___ \n9:10 a.m. \nPolice have installed barricades outside the home of French rock icon Johnny Hallyday as fans gathered to mourn his death. \nPolice vans arrived before dawn Wednesday at the home in the Paris suburb of Marnes-la-Coquette, near Versailles. \nFans came soon after, bundled against the December cold to pay tribute and share memories of France's biggest rock star. \nTributes poured in from the French president's office to North America after the overnight news of his death. Hallyday, often dubbed the French Elvis, died after battling lung cancer. \n___ \n4:15 a.m. \nJohnny Hallyday, France's biggest rock star for more than half a century and an icon who packed sports stadiums and all but lit up the Eiffel Tower with his pumping pelvis and high-voltage tunes, has died. He was 74. \nPresident Emmanuel Macron announced his death in a statement early Wednesday, saying \"he brought a part of America into our national pantheon.\" Macron's office said the president spoke with Hallyday's family but did not provide details about where the rocker died or the circumstances. \nHallyday had had lung cancer and repeated health scares in recent years that dominated national news, yet he continued performing as recently as this summer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hallyday", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jean-claude juncker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renaud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elvis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juncker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny hallyday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles michel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brigitte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "line renaud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macrons", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tv channel cnews", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marnes-la-coquette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "versailles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eiffel tower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:49.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac3ed70e04124e8d9ca5cf9f1f95bd9921ea7a8b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ23xYPDKrNXmEc1dnhS54A5EiFfsIDxaGe0ShbiBxX9MDvsyhMmevVtHqlRXH_Hi.HqsB7m2WEjBHijCDNx.opLnQFWCpCsKlWPoWcO7Dd3g-", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools/N-5yc1vZcb51/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Quickie Microfiber 14 in. x 14 in.

Apparently, searching for vintage or unique materials cannot be found in any conspicuous places alone. This is why people have to go to extra lengths to find the right source which could fulfill their needs and wants.\n\nHowever, the greatest challenge which bidders face is the competitions. Attending good AZ live auction could be overwhelming. Apart from the ineluctable competition, first time bidders usually encounter multiple setbacks that make their encounter far from nice and remarkable. Should you wish to make your auction experience commendable and exciting, we have presented some handy tips and sound advice below which could prove useful someday.\n\nArrive ahead of time. Being early provides you the edge since you would see the auctioned goods and learn some trivia and facts concerning them. Also, your likelihood of receiving the best items will maximize since you could examine every bidder and consult some ideas concerning them. Be present an hour before scheduled date to achieve the ideal benefits.\n\nBring a trustworthy and well verse appraiser. An appraiser can help you identify the correct prices of items that are sure to give profits. Such professional likewise knows the tricks of the trade while finding out the pieces which could yield impressive results. But its highly important to know whether you are dealing with a legitimate appraiser and not someone who just pretends to be one.\n\nRegister. To have the privileges and access that are given to the bidders, make sure to register your name. Once you arrive on a place, immediately scan the place and find a registration booth and follow all procedures as well. Should you are uncertain or curious concerning something, do not be afraid to speak and even relay all your thoughts.\n\nFollow every rule and regulation. Policies are created to guarantee the safety of both the materials auctioned and the ones involved on the process. Unable to adhere to everything could leave a negative effect on the entire auction experience. You must, at all cost, avoid doing the bad activities otherwise you would be prompted to get out of place or not bid.\n\nKnow your financial capacities. Not every bidder has financial capabilities. This is one smart reason why it completely matters to set a border between your capacity and limits. Learn exactly the correct amount you can afford without making use of your bank accounts. Set your priorities properly to ensure that the decisions to make would not turn out bad.\n\nAvoid being an impulse buyer. Impulsiveness can bring you nowhere. It would only stir desperate measures and frustration. Even if want to get your hands on every auctioned material, its nearly impossible to have them all unless you are the richest person.\n\nBe aware of the delivery matters.

Credit: Nephron/Wikipedia \nModern birth control pills that are lower in estrogen have fewer side effects than past oral contraceptives. But a large Danish study suggests that, like older pills, they still modestly raise the risk of breast cancer, especially with long-term use. \nResearchers found a similar breast cancer risk with the progestin-only intrauterine device, and they couldn't rule out a risk for other hormonal contraceptives like the patch and the implant. \nBut the overall increased risk was small, amounting to one extra case of breast cancer among 7,700 women using such contraceptives per year. Experts who reviewed the research say women should balance the news against known benefits of the pill - including lowering the risk of other cancers. \n\"Hormonal contraception should still be perceived as a safe and effective option for family planning,\" said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital, who was not involved in the research. \nWomen in their 40s may want to consider non-hormonal IUDs, getting their tubes tied or talking with their partners about vasectomy, Manson said. \nStudies of older birth control pills have shown \"a net cancer benefit\" because of lowered risk of cancer of the colon, uterus and ovaries despite a raised breast cancer risk , said Mia Gaudet, a breast cancer epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society. \nThere was optimism that newer, low-dose contraceptives would lower the breast cancer risk, but these results have dashed those hopes, said Gaudet, who wasn't involved in the research. \nAbout 140 million women use some type of hormonal contraception , including about 16 million in the United States. \nResearchers analyzed health records of 1.8 million women, ages 15 to 49, in Denmark where a national health care system allows linking up large databases of prescription histories, cancer diagnoses and other information. \nResults were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine . Novo Nordisk Foundation funded the research, but played no role in designing the study. The foundation has ties to the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, which primarily makes diabetes drugs and does not make contraceptives. \nCurrent and recent use of hormonal contraceptives was associated with a 20 percent increased risk of breast cancer. Risk increased with longer use, from a 9 percent increase in risk with less than a year of contraceptive use to a 38 percent increase after more than 10 years of use. \nDigging further, the researchers found no differences among types of birth control pills. Because of fewer users, the results for the patch, vaginal ring, implant and progestin shot were less clear, but the analysis didn't rule out an increased breast cancer risk for those methods. \n\"No type of hormone contraceptive is risk-free unfortunately,\" said lead author Lina Morch of Copenhagen University Hospital. \nResearchers accounted for education, childbirth and family history of breast cancer, but they weren't able to adjust for several other known cancer risk factors such as alcohol use and limited physical activity, or protective factors such as breast-feeding. \nWomen with a family history of breast cancer may want to ask their doctors about other contraceptives, said Dr. Roshni Rao, a breast surgeon at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. \n\"Oral contraceptives are like any other medication,\" Rao said. \"There are risks and there are benefits. If you have a reason to be taking them, it's perfectly reasonable to do so.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roshni rao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mia gaudet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joann manson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lina morch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaudet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nephron/wikipedia  modern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novo nordisk foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novo nordisk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "copenhagen university hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york-presbyterian/columbia university medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brigham and women's hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england journal of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:49.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac3ed70e04124e8d9ca5cf9f1f95bd9921ea7a8b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ23xYPDKrNXmEc1dnhS54A5EiFfsIDxaGe0ShbiBxX9MDvsyhMmevVtHqlRXH_Hi.HqsB7m2WEjBHijCDNx.opLnQFWCpCsKlWPoWcO7Dd3g-", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools/N-5yc1vZcb51/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Quickie Microfiber 14 in. x 14 in.

Never miss a local story. Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access. SUBSCRIBE NOW \nIn a time when hip-hop artists heavily sample instrumentals, the four-piece band has attracted a number of rappers and hip-hop artists. They've collaborated with Tyler, the Creator and with Kendrick Lamar on a track in his critically acclaimed album \"DAMN.\" They've even worked alongside legends like Ghostface Killah from Wu-Tang Clan. \nThe band first became noticed for its instrumental covers of hip-hop music. In its fourth album, titled \" IV,\" you can hear some of those influences with the simple melodies and drums that highlight the rhythm and beat. \nWhile you may find BADBADNOTGOOD albums in the jazz or hip-hop section of a record store, Hansen is weary of identifying as either. \nIn working and collaborating with artists in the studio, Hansen says the band can change and fluctuate their style to complement whomever they're working with, which may be why so many artists have been drawn to working with them. \n\"We're really malleable, like if we're in the studio with Mick Jenkins, we can play any influence he's bringing, we can play around with that,\" Hansen says. \nBADBADNOTGOOD's music becomes a complementary way of propelling the voice and perspectives of the artists the band works with or who sample the band's tracks. \nTake for example, \"Lavender.\" The synth bass is heavy, reminiscent of old-school gangster rap. Perhaps that's why Snoop Dogg recently sampled it for his controversial single of the same name that takes on police brutality and President Donald Trump; the video of the song features Snoop Dogg firing a toy gun at a clown that looks strikingly similar to Trump. \n\"It's interesting for us because we didn't intend for the song to turn out like that, but we're obviously thrilled that Snoop Dogg wanted to do something with it,\" Hansen said. \nHansen says that while their music changes as different artists they work with influence it, they still want their music to express their personal sound. \n\"We are very humbled people by nature and we don't like to take credit for much, we just really like making music.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "agatha pacheco", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "hansen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mick jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew tavares", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander sowinski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snoop dogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kendrick lamar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chester hansen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leland whitty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "seattle times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:50.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cfcec0f03284f301cca82090904c370c85e2d634", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSIeS.yljpYCBwCUobNzWqOXc2Oe5TNoUAN0tFlaYl9UP_KME8zP1kSlwoKqpTFLns3fNQgfQrePwDBELE77lYMsbZxTaP8EMmQs.usPthdhqHSu4fn8ITr.71bjMlj_mD71o1FDPTq8O0Lgo5qmq4.", "site_full": "cooperativesocietysoftware.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://cooperativesocietysoftware.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Foremost Nidhi Software Development company in India \u2013 Credit Cooperative Society Software", "title": "Foremost Nidhi Software Development company in India", "title_full": "Foremost Nidhi Software Development company in India", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cfcec0f03284f301cca82090904c370c85e2d634", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSIeS.yljpYCBwCUobNzWqOXc2Oe5TNoUAN0tFlaYl9UP_KME8zP1kSlwoKqpTFLns3fNQgfQrePwDBELE77lYMsbZxTaP8EMmQs.usPthdhqHSu4fn8ITr.71bjMlj_mD71o1FDPTq8O0Lgo5qmq4.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Society Software", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "Foremost Nidhi Software Development company in India", "text": "Cyrus Technoedge Solutions Private Limited is the No.1 Software company from Jaipur and develop Nidhi Software , We are expert who already developed this software which is running successfully in many organizations.\n\nWe can refer it as a Mini Banking Software.

But when it comes to getting a drug candidate through clinical trials and FDA review, time is also money. Faster approval means drug companies can begin profiting more quickly from their discoveries. And that may (or may not, according to whom you talk to) result in lower drug prices. \nIn a Research Letter published Tuesday in the journal JAMA , a trio of health economists from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston set out to test whether and how four FDA programs shortened the length time it took for proposed prescription drugs to get from their earliest clinical trials to market approval. \nOf 174 drugs and biologic therapies approved between January 2012 and December 2016, 105 (or 60 percent) traversed the FDA evaluation process with one of four designations aimed at speeding the path to approval. The 69 candidate medications that had no such hurry-up designations took between 6.5 and 10 years to proceed from the start of human trials to FDA approval, with a midpoint of eight years. \nCandidate medications evaluated under one of the four accelerated programs took between 5.1 and 10.1 years to cover the same ground, with a midpoint of 7.1 years. \nThose faster speeds were largely attributable to two programs. \nOne, instituted in 2012, compresses clinical trials, dedicates FDA personnel to provide advice, and streamlines the FDA evaluation process for experimental drugs that may provide \"breakthrough\" therapy for a disease. Half of the drug candidates that got the breakthrough designation sprinted from the start of human clinical trials to FDA approval in 4.8 years or less, compared with a median start-to-finish time of eight years for drug candidates with no expedited designation. \nThe second, a 1997 \"fast track\" program, offers similar but less extensive benefits to speed drug development and evaluation time. For drug candidates that were designated for fast-tracking, the program carved about a year off the median drug development time. \nTwo 1992 programs designed to speed the FDA's review of drug candidates did not shorten the time it took for a drug to get from the start of human clinical trials to approval, the study found. One was the Accelerated Approval program, which allows the FDA to consider clinical trials that measure a drug's indirect effects on disease. The other was the Priority Review program , which limits the time period in which the FDA evaluates a candidate drug for approval. \nUC San Francisco health economist Dr. Adams Dudley said the new research underscores that when it comes to shortening drug-development times, one key factor appears to make a difference: intensive attention from FDA evaluators. And providing that takes a commitment to staffing an agency whose budget is currently clouded in uncertainty. \nThe Trump administration has proposed to slash FDA funding by $854 million in 2018, but recoup that loss with revenues from drug and medical device makers who pay fees to have their products evaluated. That proposal has hit head winds in Congress. \nThe likely result: With growing backlogs of generic and new drugs to be evaluated, the FDA may see personnel cuts, not an expansion. \n\"We've constantly cut the budget and reduced personnel costs at FDA, and this research suggests it might help to get more people there,\" said Dudley, who directs UCSF's Center for Healthcare Value. \nIf giving drug candidates a speedier path through the FDA is a priority, staffing the agency for the more labor intensive task will have to come first, said Dudley. \n\"It's just a choice we make as a society,\" Dudley added. \"Is it worth it to hire people who are good at testing drugs and deciding whether they work, or is it something we don't want to pay for?\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dudley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adams dudley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "issa healy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott gottlieb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fda", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucsf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brigham and women's hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for healthcare value", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles times credit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "research letter", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uc san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:51.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8780061d19441bb2a8a9b9df7b7351971b9a0672", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8z1mfU6OeBgfU43pF4_c9lrHu3sPV9jOt5sarxtyQWakvSvDPBRsWMvdAMA98xryZDZpUPj9_q_07uswipbHI", "site_full": "www.untangle.com", "site": "untangle.com", "site_section": "https://www.untangle.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Untangle", "title": "Manufacturing Group Ends Malware Woes with Untangle; Easily Manages 8 Locations with Command Center", "title_full": "Manufacturing Group Ends Malware Woes with Untangle; Easily Manages 8 Locations with Command Center", "published": "2017-12-05T18:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 79864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8780061d19441bb2a8a9b9df7b7351971b9a0672", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8z1mfU6OeBgfU43pF4_c9lrHu3sPV9jOt5sarxtyQWakvSvDPBRsWMvdAMA98xryZDZpUPj9_q_07uswipbHI", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "pcortis@mtmalta.com", "published": "2017-12-05T18:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Manufacturing Group Ends Malware Woes with Untangle; Easily Manages 8 Locations with Command Center", "text": "Manufacturing Group Ends Malware Woes with Untangle; Easily Manages 8 Locations with Command Center Customer-At-A-Glance North American Stamping Group, L.L.C. Location: Portland, Tennessee Size: Over 350 devices across 8 locations Challenges Previous solution not effective at blocking threats No separate guest Wi-Fi network No management view of network traffic bottlenecks Solutions Network protected from viruses, malware and other threats Control access to websites and applications Separate guest Wi-Fi network Easily manage and push policies across all locations Background \nThe North American Stamping Group, L.L.C. (NASG) is a metal manufacturing company that supplies the automotive industry with medium-to-high-volume, stamped-metal components and welded assemblies. Based in Portland, Tennessee, NASG has 8 locations spread across the United States, Canada and Mexico. Ken Stoner is the Corporate IT Manager and oversees all things IT-related for over 700 machines across the 8 locations. \nThe biggest issue Stoner faced was that their current firewall/router was not proactive in protecting the network. An employee happened to click on an email with a Trickbot URL that lead to every Windows machine being infected. Stoner was only aware of the attack after it had occurred, forcing the IT team to drop everything to remediate the issue. Having no guest Wi-Fi network also started becoming a major headache for Stoner. Customers connecting their mobile devices to the network would quickly max out the number of available IP addresses, causing problems for employees trying to work. These problems led to Stoner searching for a new network security solution. Technology Solution \nStoner was referred to Untangle by a partner who had seen the benefits of the Untangle solution to other organizations. Untangle\u2019s free trial of NG Firewall allowed Stoner to quickly realize how simple the installation and configuration process was. Stoner is very strict when it comes to network access control and only allows half of the company\u2019s 700 machines to connect. \u201cNG Firewall\u2019s flexibility to restrict and allow access by location, department, and users is a huge asset for my team. We can ensure no one is accessing inappropriate or malicious sites,\u201d said Stoner. After the recent Trickbot attack, blocking threats, viruses and malware is a top concern for Stoner. \u201cWe utilize the Firewall, Virus Blocker, Ad Blocker and Web Filter applications to proactively block threats,\u201d said Stoner. \u201cScoutIQ, Untangle\u2019s cloud-based threat intelligence platform, adds another layer of security, especially against emerging threats. I feel confident knowing Untangle is working in the background to effectively protect the network.\u201d \nNG Firewall\u2019s flexibility to restrict and allow access by location, department, and users is a huge asset for my team. Ken Stoner, NASG \nCreating a separate guest network was another requirement for NASG, as the constant stream of customers and guests joining the network continually created problems for employees trying to get their jobs done. \u201cOne of the biggest benefits of Untangle was setting up a separate Wi-Fi for guests. By forcing all mobile devices and guests to use a separate network, I can ensure we never run out of IP addresses,\u201d said Stoner. \u201cCreating a segmented network also gives us an additional layer of security, since those BYOD devices are effectively quarantined.\u201d NASG also utilizes the Directory Connector application to track who logs in where, as well as the IPsec VPN application to connect the remote locations. \nTo seamlessly manage the remote networks at the 8 different locations, Stoner relies on Untangle\u2019s Command Center, a cloud-based centralized management solution. With Command Center, NG Firewall policies can be created on one appliance, then cloned and pushed across other appliances, no matter their locations. \u201cBeing able to push policies to the other appliances that are located hundreds of miles away is a huge resource- and time-saver for the IT team,\u201d said Stoner. Command Center also provides global alerts for all NG Firewall deployments. \u201cIf an appliance goes offline or a threat is hitting one of our sites, I get alerted right away and can take immediate action.\u201d \nNG Firewall has provided Stoner with complete visibility into and control over each of the networks at NASG. When Stoner turned to Untangle for help, he found that their US-based technical support team was ready to assist. \u201cSupport is excellent, everyone I\u2019ve talked to is knowledgeable not just about the product, but network configurations and have always been able to provide me with an answer,\u201d said Stoner. \nBeing able to use Command Center to push policies to the other appliances that are located hundreds of miles away is a huge resource- and time-saver.

Police chief vows organised crime fight will go on \nThe head of Police Scotland\u2019s organised crime and counter terrorism unit welcomed the outcome of yesterday\u2019s case. \nDetective Chief Superintendent Gerry McLean said it had \u201cremoved men who were responsible for bringing fear and misery to communities\u201d from the streets. \nHe added: \u201cThe nine men were involved in the most serious criminal activity, including firearms, drug dealing and extreme violence. \n\u201cWe welcome that they have been brought to justice and admitted their involvement in the face of a wealth of evidence. \n\u201cI want to reassure people that we will continue to disrupt anyone involved in serious organised crime, shutting down their illegal businesses and locking up those responsible. \n\u201cI want to pay tribute to the officers, whose professionalism and tireless efforts helped bring these nine dangerous men to justice.\u201d \nThe legal procedure \u2013 believed to be a first for a Scottish high court \u2013 is designed to tackle the country\u2019s organised criminal gangs. \nThe original indictment listed alleged crimes in several locations \u2013 including Glasgow and West Lothian \u2013 as well as the north of England. \nIt had claimed that Fitzsimmons was involved in the January 2017 shooting of Monaghan but prosecutors accepted his not guilty plea. \nIt was further claimed Docherty and McArdle had tried to kill Robert Kelbie in Newbridge, Edinburgh in September last year. \nBut Docherty instead pled guilty to an amended charge of firing the weapon at a property to the danger of others. \nProsecutors did not give further facts of the crimes the gang pled guilty to.

The gang pled guilty at a series of pre-trial hearings at the High Court in Glasgow (Image: Daily Record) \nNo details on any criminal past for the nine was given during the hearings. \nBut Fitzsimmons was jailed for 12 years in 2008 for smuggling weapons. \nThe former army lance corporal was involved in the theft of army ammunitions and explosives to sell to gangsters. \nWe revealed earlier this year that he bombarded his cousin with love letters and begged her to have his baby while serving his sentence. He also warned the woman not to be in a relationships when he was released. \nSecurity had been ramped up at the court in preparation for a trial. \nArmed officers patrolled the building while anyone wanting to hear proceedings had to go through an airport-style scanner. \nA police helicopter could regularly be heard circling as the nine accused were brought in convoy from prison.

Home Entertainment; and Walmart online service Vudu were inducted into the Hall of Fame. Fox innovation Lab was honored with the Innovation Award, and Eric Berger, EVP of digital for Sony Pictures Television Networks, and GM of Crackle, picked up the Deloitte Media & Entertainment Leadership Award. \n\u201cYou know sometimes the good guys finish first, and I\u2019m thrilled that this is happening to Jim,\u201d said Ron Sanders, president of Warner Bros. worldwide home entertainment distribution, who presented the award to Wuthrich. \n\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of superhero that we love having at Warner Bros. and that we need for this industry,\u201d added Sanders, teeing up a parody of heroes from Justice League with Wuthrich\u2019s face imposed on them. \n\u201cNow you know why I\u2019m on the other side of the camera,\u201d Wuthrich quipped in accepting the award and hailing Sanders as a mentor. \n\u201cI\u2019m humbled by those who\u2019ve come before,\u201d Wuthrich said, noting past winners including Warren Lieberfarb, \u201cthe father of DVD.\u201d \n\u201cWhen I first came to this business all those years ago, I thought I\u2019d be here two years and leave, but now I\u2019ve been here 19 years, and I love this business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has it all \u2014 technology, entertainment \u2014 and it\u2019s ever-changing. And the stories we deliver inspire, help people connect and bring joy, and that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d \nChris Meledandri, producer and CEO of Illumination Entertainment, which created the \u201cDespicable Me\u201d franchise, among other family content, accepted his award by thanking Universal Studios and its home entertainment team and plugging the fact that Dec. 5 was the physical street date for Despicable Me 3 . \n\u201cIn volatile times like these, when it\u2019s easy to lose one\u2019s way, I find it very humbling to remind myself about the power that we all have to positively affect people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \nHe related the story of Peter, a young boy fighting liver cancer, whose mom wrote the producer to tell him how much the boy liked the \u201cDespicable Me\u201d movies and how they made him smile. She asked that a minion be named after her son. \n\u201cIn Despicable Me 3 , the minion Peter made his debut,\u201d Meledandri said. \n\u201cIt is vital for us to never lose sight of the potential of our films to spread joy, humor and hope, even when people are going through unimaginable hardships,\u201d he said. \nIn presenting the award to the Fox innovation Lab, Amy Jo Smith, president of DEG: The Digital Entertainment Group and past Hall of Fame honoree, hailed the \u201cbrain trust\u201d at Fox that created it in 2014, including Mike Dunn, Hanno Basse and Danny Kaye. \n\u201cThe Lab has really had a real impact on stretching the boundaries of bringing content to movie lovers,\u201d she said, noting its work on virtual reality and high dynamic range, among other technologies. \nDanny Kaye, EVP and managing director of the Lab, said it was created \u201cto help us redefine the next-generation premium consumer entertainment experience.\u201d \nHe and Basse accepted the award on behalf of the studio, with representatives of Lab partners Samsung and Ericsson. \nJanice Marinelli, president of Disney/ABC home Entertainment and television distribution, hailed Hall of Fame inductee Vudu, a key player in the cloud-based digital locker service Movies Anywhere. \n\u201cAt Disney, we like to partner with forward-looking retailers, partners who share our commitment to excellence,\u201d Marinelli said. \u201cVudu is a terrific example of that type of partner.\u201d \nJeremy Verba, VP and GM of Vudu, video games and media at Walmart.com, accepted the award, saying, \u201cInnovation is a team sport, we like to say at Vudu. It takes great partners. We have those in our studio partners. We appreciate the trust that you put in us and that you ask of us.\u201d \n\u201cAll of us here share a common vision for a world to be entertained without boundaries,\u201d Berger said in accepting the Deloitte Media & Entertainment Leadership Award. \u201cIt\u2019s a time of real change in the landscape and to achieve that vision requires a dual focus on innovation, both in terms of storytelling and technology.\u201d \nLeadership requires the \u201cfacility to embrace change as a constant variable\u201d and finding out \u201chow to reinvent order from chaos,\u201d he said.

It was the first album made by the band without founder member Carlos Per?n, and with his departure the remaining duo of Boris Blank and Dieter Meier began to move away from experimental electronic sounds towards a more commercial synthpop and cinematic soundtrack style. As well as becoming the first album ever by a Swiss group to top the Swiss album chart, it was the band's breakthrough album internationally, helped by the success of the song \"Oh Yeah\", which gained the band worldwide attention the following year after it was prominently featured in the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off and then a year later in The Secret of My Success.

The company expects domestic e-commerce revenue to grow 40% in fiscal 2019. \nWhen first incorporated Oct. 31, 1969, Walmart\u2019s legal name was Wal-Mart.

The company has been using the current Walmart logo since 2008. \nThe company opened its first international location in Mexico City in 1991 and launched Walmart.com in 2000. Walmart will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange (WMT) and should be referenced simply as Walmart, according to McMillon. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to invest in and strengthen our stores around the world and expand our ecommerce capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cAs time goes on, customers will increasingly just think of and see one Walmart.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erik gruenwedel  walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug mcmillon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcmillon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walmart inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal-mart stores, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal-mart stores", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal-mart", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bentonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walmart.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:51.038+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c0fd0b9e7a7ffd297456b8f0561bcf4f69043fe6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvwpiU4d7xaizICxiNKIU2RyyTd6moXmcYPt_ujVu8Qr2wqTuZ89aRzTeJOWuBBiccs-", "site_full": "forums.warframe.com", "site": "warframe.com", "site_section": "https://forums.warframe.com/forum/36-general-discussion/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "General Discussion -

She always ends up feeling too fragile against anything that doubles her, which is kind of a lot.\nMy first build on her was TA3/QR, which worked pretty well for destroying sword lords and the occasional Tharja. It made her weaker against Julia/Deirdre, but they were going to OHKO her regardless of TA3.\nNowadays, with Falchion units no longer the most popular reds, Nowi/Ninian don't need to carry TA3, and instead can be more generalized as anti-range due to the breath upgrades. Without TA3 and with the addition of DD3/6 and some RES spurs, Nowi can actually survive a hit from an unmerged Julia/Deirdre, then kill them on the counter thanks to QR3 and Lightning Breath hitting their paper-thin DEF (this is incredibly risky, obviously).\nProbably safer to build up a Fae as a generalized mage tank.

It made her weaker against Julia/Deirdre, but they were going to OHKO her regardless of TA3.\nNowadays, with Falchion units no longer the most popular reds, Nowi/Ninian don't need to carry TA3, and instead can be more generalized as anti-range due to the breath upgrades. Without TA3 and with the addition of DD3/6 and some RES spurs, Nowi can actually survive a hit from an unmerged Julia/Deirdre, then kill them on the counter thanks to QR3 and Lightning Breath hitting their paper-thin DEF (this is incredibly risky, obviously).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:52.050+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "71b09a4100b229a814536646898598dd7a9633d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrkvIihAjYHZrxZT4Awn8P20BM7zfvinpBaMblbt24jJedPoLYT0AjoehjvBm_w4LlPOYtG9w9dQ6GsD9IsADjk", "site_full": "gall.dcinside.com", "site": "dcinside.com", "site_section": "http://gall.dcinside.com/list.php?id=idolmaster&page=6", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "\uc544\uc774\ub3cc\ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130 \uac24\ub7ec\ub9ac", "title": "\uadf9\uacfc\uadf9\uc774\ub124..", "title_full": "\uadf9\uacfc\uadf9\uc774\ub124.. -

The international community, however, has never recognised Israel\u2019s claims to all of Jerusalem. \nSheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar\u2019s foreign minister said Trump\u2019s decision was a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for all who seek peace and \u201ca dangerous escalation\u201d. \nThe status of Jerusalem is one of the most contentious issues in the conflict and has historically been relegated to final status negotiations. \nPalestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and Israelis insisting that the city is its \u201cunified\u201d and indivisible capital. \nEmmanuel Macron, French president, said on Twitter that Paris \u201cdoesn\u2019t approve of the decision\u201d and \u201csupports the two-state solution, Israel and Palestine, living in peace and security, with Jerusalem as the capital of the two states\u201d. \nMeanwhile, Pakistan said it \u201cnoted with grave concern\u201d the US decision, which alters \u201cthe legal and historical status of the city\u201d. \n\u201cSuch a step would constitute a clear violation of international law and UN Security Council resolutions,\u201d the Pakistani prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said \u201cprotecting the current status of Jerusalem is very important and it is important that the Islamic world act as one\u201d. \nJeremy Corbyn , leader of UK\u2019s Labour party, called Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem is \u201ca reckless threat to peace\u201d. \n\u201cThe British Government must condemn this dangerous act and work for a just and viable settlement of the conflict,\u201d he said in a post on Twitter. \nTunisian labour union UGTT said the decision was a \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d and called for mass protests, while Trita Parsi , president of the National Iranian American Council , described it as the \u201cmother of all dumb moves\u201d. \nThe reaction was markedly different from Israeli leaders, however, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said it was \u201ca historic day\u201d for the country. \nJerusalem \u201chas been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years,\u201d he said in a statement. \n\u201cJerusalem has been the focus of our hopes, our dreams, our prayers for three millennia. Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years.\u201d \nReuven Rivlin, Israel\u2019s president, also welcomed Trump\u2019s announcement, saying \u201cthere is no more fitting or beautiful gift, as we approach 70 years of the State of Israel\u2019s independence\u201d. \nHe added: \u201cThe recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and the relocation of all embassies to the city, is a landmark in the recognition of the right of the Jewish people to our land.\u201d \nBut Raed Jarrar, Amnesty International USA\u2019s Middle East advocacy director, said no \u201ccountry in the world recognises Israel\u2019s annexation of East Jerusalem, making the decision to confer US recognition deeply troubling\u201d. \n\u201cNot only does this decision contribute to undermining the international rule of law, it also shows a total disregard for mass human rights violations that Palestinians are facing as a result of Israel\u2019s annexation policies.\u201d \n-News24", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald tru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy corbyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michel aoun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad al-momani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed bin abdulrahman al thani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuven rivlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trita parsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raed jarrar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national iranian american council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ugtt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amnesty international usa\u2019s middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lebanon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:53.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68a97d6fa984a1317f1f8bd977958f467f43a915", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl0nn_8rifHituh7Q96dCoHAxq3CWrjWUuIC8jBkes2gkGXEqebBZCj4PReesnOup_qZwBjCP_3vExt7IO9Kl90fspZl5uJRHx7DlsUSZyR5zIs0N31p80sdZNRa4DuUqqw--", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[Fire Emblem: Heroes] Another Voting Gauntlet that a Waifu (Tharja) will probably win 55", "title_full": "[Fire Emblem: Heroes] Another Voting Gauntlet that a Waifu (Tharja) will probably win -
