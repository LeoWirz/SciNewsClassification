Nobody saw the cutdown carbine secreted in his clothing.\nAt 4.20 pm on Tuesday he walked into the fifth-floor glass doors of the Telecom Employees Credit Co-operative, spoke with a male friend briefly, suddenly pulled a .30 M1 carbine from his clothes and started firing.\nHis friend ducked behind a counter. But a teller, 19-year-old Judith Morris, was caught by surprise and cut down. A fellow worker hit the alarm button and somewhere across town a light flashed in the Wormald system warning that something untoward was happening in the Telecom co-op. Judy Morris was the first to die in Frank Vitkovic's murderous run through three floors of the Australia Post headquarters.\nAdvertisement Police are still piecing together his killing spree but most of the 1000 people in the building when Vitkovic started firing did not know what was happening when the mad rampage began.\nThe sound of a few gunshots could have been confused with a backfiring car, but, by the time the gunman caught the lift to Australia Post's philatelic security section on the 12th floor the salvo of shots that followed left people in no doubt that something dreadful was occurring at 191 Queen Street.\nVitkovic burst through the security doors, wounded a man and a woman, then turned his gun on a young woman sitting behind her desk. He paused. Then he moved the barrel to the left and killed two other women, Julie Faye McBean, 20, and Nancy Avigone, 18. A man in the only corner office on the open-plan 12th floor, Warren David Spencer, 29, also died.\nVitkovic ran down the stairs to the 11th floor, firing indiscriminately, and charged into the computer training centre where Michael Francis McGuire, 38, was near the coffee machine preparing to end the day's work and go home for his son's fifth birthday party. He was shot at point-blank range.\nAs Mr McGuire fell in a pool of blood, other bullets ripped through the panelling behind him, one gouging a big chunk of plaster from the wall surrounding the lift well.\nWhat workers next door, separated by simple office partitioning, were thinking as the carbine roared can only be guessed, but Vitkovic was soon among them firing, wounding some and advancing on Marianne Jacoba Van Ewyk, 38, Catherine Mary Dowling, 28, and Rodney Gerard Brown, 32, sitting at their desks in the corner of the office.\nAbout 15 people were working in the finance and management section when Vitkovic entered. A few had already \"flexed off\" or gone home early in anticipation of the traffic jam caused by the rail strike.\nThis is one of the more high-powered offices in the Victorian headquarters of Australia Post. It is the place where short-term money market investments are made, where men and women staff tend to be highly qualified professionals who use computers the way most people use pens. A close-knit office, they were to go to the Empress of China Restaurant for the Christmas luncheon on 22 December.\nThe carbine roared. The two women and the man fell. Three other people were wounded.\nThe acting assistant manager of the section (who has asked not to be named) came out of his office next to the killing corner and grabbed Vitkovic from behind. There was a struggle. One of the wounded women, Rosemary Spiteri, 25, grabbed the rifle and hid it in a refrigerator.\nThe killer and the assistant manager continued to struggle over the bloody bodies. In the melee, a rubber plant was wrenched roughly and as the killer smashed through the shadow-glass window 40 metres above Queen Street, cutting himself deeply, shards of darkened glass mingled with blood-splattered leases on the narrow parapet.\nThe pair fought.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d. \nFor further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator.

MA\u2019s may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock. Many traders will use moving averages for different periods of time in conjunction with other indicators to help gauge future stock price action.

When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J.

at the March for Life in Washington in 2016 (CNS) 'Love saves lives' is the theme of the 2018 march \nMarch for Life organisers have announced a tentative group of speakers, a theme and other details for a conference and expo on January 18 and the march and rally in Washington the following day. \n\u201cLove saves Lives\u201d is the theme of the 2018 march, said Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, adding that the group also wants to focus on the sacrifice involved with bringing life into the world but also in the interactions with one another. \nOne of the speakers who will talk about that during the event is Pam Tebow, mother of former American football player Tim Tebow, said Mancini. \n\u201cHer story for choosing life for Timmy is beautiful,\u201d Mancini said. Tebow\u2019s doctors told her she had to have an abortion to save her own life, but she refused and delivered a healthy boy. \nAnother person who will share her story is Kelly Rosati, a March for Life board member, who has adopted four children previously in foster care, Mancini said. \nShe said the organization also wants to provide a focus for the work done by pregnancy centres and maternity homes that help women who find themselves in an unplanned pregnancy. \n\u201cThose homes are totally about providing resources for women facing unexpected pregnancies and they\u2019re often given a bad rap,\u201d she said. \nA day before the rally and march the March for Life organization will host a conference and an expo, as well as a session with instructions on how to track legislators\u2019 votes and provide \u201ctools to lobby.\u201d \nBecause the National Park Service has a refurbishing project that makes it too expensive to be on the grounds of the Washington Monument, the noon march, the main event on January 19, will begin instead on the National Mall between Madison Drive and Jefferson Drive in Washington she said, and then will proceed down Constitution Avenue. The march will head toward the U.S. Capitol and then proceed outside the Supreme Court of the United States. \nCongressmen Dan Lipinksi, an Illinois Democrat, and Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, have confirmed their attendance, Mancini said. \n\u201cThe March for Life is nonpartisan, or bipartisan, we\u2019re also nonsectarian, we always try to get people from both sides of the political aisle to speak at the March for Life,\u201d she said, adding that it\u2019s not always an easy task. \nThe annual event marks the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 decision in Roe v Wade and its companion case, Doe v Bolton, that legalized abortion. \nThe March for Life also has invited White House officials to speak, she said, but gave no indication of whether they would attend. Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the event last year. \nThe organization has a full list of events at http://marchforlife.org/mfl-2018/rally-march-info .

Cricket - India v Australia - India Team's Practice Session - Indore, India \u2013 September 23, 2017 \u2013 India's captain Virat Kohli waits for his turn to bat in the nets. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi Three months after subjecting Sri Lanka to a 9-0 whitewash across all formats, Virat Kohli\u2019s men prevailed 1-0 in the latest round of a duel between the neighbours to seal their record-equalling ninth consecutive test series win. Three of those triumphs have come against an unsettled and inexperienced Sri Lankan side in the throes of a tricky transition period following the retirements of batting stalwarts Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara in 2015. India\u2019s six other series wins in this period includes home triumphs against South Africa, New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia, as well as a victory over West Indies in the Caribbean. While it makes financial sense for Sri Lanka to play India, the game\u2019s economic engine, the home board (BCCI) said the latest series, an underwhelming prospect for fans, was unavoidable as it had to honour its commitment to the calendar. \u201cThe back-to-back series resulted from what had been committed in the past in the current FTP (Future Tours Programme),\u201d BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary told reporters on the sidelines of the third and final test in Delhi. \u201cThe observation of the captain of the team will be a substantial basis of further discussions on FTP.\u201d Indian captains seldom talk about scheduling issues but Kohli has expressed concerns that the frequency of certain contests might result in plenty of empty seats in the stands. \u201cIt definitely has to be taken into consideration because you don\u2019t want fans going away from the game or not watching,\u201d Kohli said ahead of the back-to-back series against Sri Lanka, who have managed only one win in the last nine tests against their neighbours. \u201cWe have to find a balance between how to engage the fans and, at the same time, keep players fresh, keep cricket exciting and have very competitive going throughout the year.\u201d India also played five one-dayers in Sri Lanka this year, against an opponent containing many regulars in the Indian Premier League (IPL). \u201cThis analysis has to be done over a period of time, by asking fans who watch the game,\u201d Kohli said. \u201dFor someone watching the game, it is very different than someone playing the game. For us, there is no room for saying that I don\u2019t want to play this game. \u201cI don\u2019t know if too much cricket is being played, or (it\u2018s) repetition of the same series... That point will definitely be discussed (with the Indian board) in future.\u201d Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; Editing by John O'Brien", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mahela jayawardene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amitabh choudhary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virat kohli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john o'brien", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amlan chakraborty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumar sangakkara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kohli", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "australia - india team", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bcci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sri lanka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west indies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:06.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "43290b4b1b60efb0ccee8267a592450d7d80932b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmkSf8YBfQgKAh6KqPz388LwfLgcES9ZMbZVPe8SfdRAboFrwu9nbQBtNaxaOrJL1WB.EfwUorUgQbJiEKWXqgzhzPgsJFvgMCY-", "site_full": "recruitmentagenciesinnigeria.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://recruitmentagenciesinnigeria.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Revruitment Agencies in Nigeria.

This time, the Japanese sources deal with one particular member of Apple's expected 2018 family, the rumored \"budget\" model with a 6.1\" display . It is apparently prepped as Apple's silver bullet for getting away from over-reliance on Korean suppliers (read: Samsung), as not only is it supposed to come with an LCD, instead of OLED display panel, but now Nikkei is also reporting that it will sport a metal body, instead of glass. Thus, Apple will be able to offer cheaper model, still with Face ID on board , but with a cheaper and easier to make aluminum alloy unibody, which can be offered in many more colors than the current all-glass iPhones. The iPhone 9, as it might be named, is expected to land starting at Apple's traditional $649 price tag at the base memory config. If Apple's foray into glass bodies taught us something this year, it is that the rumored upcoming metal iPhone is likely to be more durable than the eventual 5.85\" iPhone Xs and 6.46\" Xs Plus, or whatever Apple calls its next models with OLED displays.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:06.060+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "855e4043e07fb782068301af3c232eece4a6a189", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gT.AZYqr_NjcK_MeaG5zvVQ-", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/16785814/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Transmogrification - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "Question about transmog looting", "title_full": "Question about transmog looting - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T13:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.052, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "855e4043e07fb782068301af3c232eece4a6a189", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gT.AZYqr_NjcK_MeaG5zvVQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cennaria", "published": "2017-12-07T13:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Question about transmog looting", "text": "I can't seem to find an answer for this question about transmog.

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

Uganda's military says it has begun withdrawing dozens of its troops from peacekeeping duty in Somalia. \nLt. Col. Deo Akiiki, deputy spokesman for the Ugandan military, said Thursday that 281 troops will leave Somalia by Dec. 31. \nAkiiki said that under an agreement between the African Union and the U.N.

More than 80 units participated. T&D CORRESPONDENT G.W. HALL \nThe always energetic and musically talented South Carolina State University Marching 101 once again wowed the crowd at the 2017 Holly Hill Christmas Festival Parade. T&D CORRESPONDENT G.W. HALL Save \nHOLLY HILL -- Plenty of holiday spirit and spring-like weather came together to make Holly Hill\u2019s 2017 Holiday Festival and Parade an unforgettable experience for local residents and guests alike. \n\u201cWe had another beautiful turnout,\u201d Holly Hill Mayor William Johnson said. \u201cIt amazed me how many people stood on the side to watch (the parade) come through.\u201d \nIn all, more than 80 units participated in the parade \u2013 nearly two dozen more than participated the year before. These units included floats entered by a range of local churches, organizations and businesses. Beauty queens and government officials also took part. \nThe South Carolina State University Marching 101 band got the biggest response from the people who lined the parade route. Briner Christian Church took home the Best All Around Parade Entry award with its large, festive float. \nIn addition, the Lake Marion High School Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps won the Best School Entry trophy. New Galilee Christian received top honors for the Best Church Entry, while the Providence Volunteer Fire Department captured the trophy for Best Organization Entry. Belmont Luxury Home Care took top honors as the Best Business Entry. The trophy for Most Like Christmas went to Holly Hill First Pentecostal Church. \nArea public safety organizations turned out in force as well. In addition to the Holly Hill Police Department and the Orangeburg County Sheriff\u2019s Office, sister departments from Eutawville, Harleyville, Ridgeville and other communities around the region were well represented and provided valuable assistance in staging the event. \n\u201cWe actually had more police vehicles this year than we had intersections to cover,\u201d Holly Hill Police Chief Josh Detter said. \u201cIt takes a lot vehicles to block off all the roads along the parade route, and we look forward to returning the favor at other holiday events in our area.\u201d \nSimilarly, Eutawville, Providence, Vance and other nearby communities sent fire engines to represent their departments. Orangeburg County Public Safety made its presence felt as well. The flashing lights and sirens of the emergency vehicles added a sound-and-light show element to the festivities. \nVisitors enjoyed a variety of Christmas Festival activities on Friday and Saturday. For example, adventurous youngsters challenged the rock-climbing tower, with those who made it all the way to the top getting to ring the bell to announce their achievement to the world. Youngsters also cavorted through inflatable \u201cbounce houses\u201d that lined one side of the street across from the railroad depot. \nAttendees enjoyed plenty of musical entertainment during the festival. DJ Freddie Bozard provided pre-recorded music from 3 to 6 p.m. on Friday. The Glorymen and Tiffany then took the stage at 6 p.m. to perform live gospel music. Parade organizers had a fire pit set up, too, although mild temperatures limited the need for the warmth it provided. \nAnother special treat took place at 6:30 p.m. on Friday, when festival organizers presented the Live Nativity Scene. The nativity scene featured members of local church congregations portraying famous figures from the story of the birth of Jesus. \nIn addition to the Saturday morning parade, the second day of the festival featured most of the same activities. Live music with Just Whalin\u2019 began when the parade ended and continued until 3 p.m. There was also an ice carving demonstration presented by ICE AGE ICE SCULPTURES. \nVendors set up inside the Holly Hill Depot, providing festival goers with welcome opportunities to get some holiday shopping done early. Top-selling items included holiday decorations, leather goods, jewelry and sports team spirit gear. \n\u201cAll the vendors I went by (to visit during the festival) had a great time,\u201d said Johnson, who also served as the parade\u2019s grand marshal. \u201cThey made money, and are looking forward to coming back. So the festival was a great success.\u201d \nContact the writer: .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "holly hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g.w. hall save  holly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tiffany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh detter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whalin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dj freddie bozard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "briner christian church", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "holly hill police department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake marion high school junior reserve officer training corps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holly hill first pentecostal church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orangeburg county sheriff\u2019s office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "providence volunteer fire department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orangeburg county public safety", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "briner christian church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belmont luxury home care", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "providence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holly hill depot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harleyville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eutawville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ridgeville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:09.071+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f076bb62c383b2dbf2e9f36a25a568364ba2bc99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCp_dzoiSQ9xKRhFVEsUF.w.bKRfpGdm2omnprvCWU2iJ_cf0pyTT4SWKbbNLQjcKjmFYQ2lDHLErlMDN09XmyL5", "site_full": "basschat.co.uk", "site": "basschat.co.uk", "site_section": "http://basschat.co.uk/forum/5-amps-and-cabs/", "site_categories": ["guitar", "health", "adult", "herbs_for_health", "hobbies_and_interests", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Amps and Cabs - Basschat", "title": "TC Electronic K Series Cabs 2 x 12", "title_full": "TC Electronic K Series Cabs 2 x 12 - Amps and Cabs - Basschat", "published": "2017-12-06T15:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.basschat.co.uk/uploads/monthly_2017_11/BC.jpg.f6de5bf395552db2a06984814fa3beac.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "371f5064ba343da77aa0e45d14c6baf56387967b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCp_dzoiSQ9xKRhFVEsUF.w.bKRfpGdm2omnprvCWU2iJ_cf0pyTT4SWKbbNLQjcKjmFYQ2lDHLErhkCjhGrZxBL7dBaWrfvyao-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "40hz", "published": "2017-12-07T02:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Not quite the k212's but I use 2 k210's.
