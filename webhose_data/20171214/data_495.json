The suspension of services implies that the Mukuba Express Train that was due to run from New Kapiri Mposhi to Dar es Salaam on Tuesday 5 December 2017 will not do so. Similarly, the Kilimanjaro Ordinary Train that is currently running southbound from Dar es Salaam to New Kapiri Mposhi, will not proceed beyond Mbeya Station in Tanzania.

Translate Wednesday, December 6, 2017 Prayer in Troubled Times Almost a year ago we were fervently praying for my daughter in law as she was undergoing chemotherapy. We were praying for her healing and for the protection of her child she was carrying from the effects of the chemo. The child was born March and is healthy. As I mentioned a few days ago my daughter in law succumbed to the cancer just before Thanksgiving . John 6:26 \u2013 27 ( here @ Bible Gateway ) challenged my prayer for her during that time. I was fervently praying for healing, for protection. As I considered and prayed through John 6:26 \u2013 27, it occurred to me that asking the Lord for what He can do for us in surviving or overcoming the world is in a real sense asking Him for bread that perishes. Health, healing, earthly prosperity all perish. Regardless of whether a person is healed or not they will eventually die. Whatever prosperity I am able to accumulate will remain here after I go home to be with the Lord. What does not perish is life from Him, knowledge of Him, and the righteousness that He has given us as a result of being in His presence. Had the Lord healed my daughter in law, at some point she would still have died. Her daughter, though protected from the effects of the chemotherapy, will, at some point in time, as with all of us, also die. It became clear working through this that what I needed to pray for my daughter in law was that Christ would be magnified and glorified through her life. That He would be exalted in and through her life, however long it was to be. In fact that is what happened. Her battle, her attitude through that battle, had an enormous impact on the doctors and nurses that cared for her at MD Anderson this past year. Her life, her struggle, radiated her dependence on Him. That dependence gave her a strength and attitude that drew in those who cared for her. On the day she left to come back to Tulsa. The staff on the floor came to her room as a group and told her how much she meant to them. It is that result, the magnification and glorification of our Lord that we should seek. That is the bread that does not perish. The impact of our dependence on the Lord draws others to Him. That is the fruit that remains.

Close the shutters on the back landing. I\u2019ll get the front. Hurry. There\u2019s a storm coming.\u201d Calanthe Durand felt the small hairs on the back of her neck rise and shivers run down her spine. A big storm was on its way, probably a hurricane. Energy and fear poured through her like the pounding rain and flooding that accompanied high winds. Closing the house to the storm was imperative. Cali took a moment to smile. She\u2019d heard Sam grunt. He didn\u2019t talk much, but she wouldn\u2019t have survived the war or these last two years without Sam and his daughter Daisy. Both sides, the North and the South, had occupied their home. Daisy and Sam were family, the only family she had. She\u2019d do whatever was necessary to protect them. Even with emancipation, life wasn\u2019t easy for blacks in the south. \u201cI\u2019ve got them, Miss Cali.\u201d Daisy rushed past her and out the door. Wind whipped her hair and tugged at her dress. Branches torn from trees landed on the porch. Cali followed, the storm swirling around her, her hair beating against her face. Her breath was ragged, and fast as her heart thundered. She pushed and tugged at her skirt, trying to detangle the fabric from her legs. \u201cGet inside!\u201d The tempest raging around them swallowed her voice. \u201cNot until we\u2019re finished here.\u201d Daisy fastened a shutter before moving on to the next one. They worked together to protect the windows from the storm on the raised porch which stood five feet off the ground as wind howled around the eaves. A steady rain poured from the black sky, and lightning slashed the darkness. Cali pushed dripping strands of hair that had slipped from her chignon away from her face. \u201cI\u2019ll light the candles. It could get dark here pretty fast.\u201d \u201cHorses and livestock are safe for now.\u201d Sam stepped beside her. \u201cHope it\u2019s not a big one.\u201d \u201cHello up there. Hello, bonjour, anyone home?\u201d Hearing the voice from below, Cali left the protection of the house to lean over the porch railing. Below her a man stood, with cupped hands to his mouth and a dead gator slung over one shoulder a quiver filled with arrows on the other. \u201cHello. Can I get shelter from the hurricane?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know if it\u2019s a hurricane.\u201d Terrified of unknown men, Cali didn\u2019t want to do the charitable thing. She pursed her lips, thinking, but all that came to surface was memories of troops commandeering her home. Good lord but she\u2019d had to hollow out a bedpost to hide her jewelry. The soldiers had taken everything they could see. Sometimes she felt as if the war had ripped her soul from her body. \u201cMaybe not a hurricane. Could be just a bad storm, but I don\u2019t want to be on the swamp right now. The water\u2019s rising.\u201d A loud roar and a thunderclap followed his pause. Behind him an old Cyprus tree crashed to the ground, uprooted by the wind. \u201cYou can take shelter in the stable.\u201d Cali watched his back stiffen, while she swallowed hard, but she wasn\u2019t about to back down. The stable was good enough for some wandering man who she owed nothing. Besides, there was a tack room with a bed. No one slept there anymore, but she kept it clean and the moss in the mattress was fresh. Daisy had rolled it out two days ago. Yet a small niggling in the back of her head kept telling her this wasn\u2019t a traveling man but one of means. He was a man she should treat as a gentleman. She\u2019d been taught better but the war had changed all that and the lessons she learned were not served to her with a silver spoon. \u201cMuch obliged.\u201d He nodded before turning toward the barn. His natural swagger and broad shoulders sent a different kind of sensation through her. Warmth swept inside, swirling within and heating her frozen heart. For a moment he looked back, a strange expression on his well-chiseled face. Boots and Blades C.L. Kraemer High Desert, Central Oregon Killian stared at the rise of rock from the desert floor. The emerging sun tricked the sky into revealing pink and blue streamers across the horizon exposing the severe lines of craggy mountains. Pine trees scented the air, and the slightest hint of sage tickled his nose. \u201cWhere are they disappearing to? They\u2019re much too young to be running away.\u201d \u201cMaster Killian?\u201d The young man turned his blue gray eyes from the mountain to answer. \u201cYes, Ms. Luna. What can I do for you?\u201d \u201cAre you sitting out here at this early hour worrying about the young ones?\u201d Luna\u2019s black hair was braided down her back and she sported a shawl bright with her clan\u2019s colors. She handed the young man a steaming cup of coffee. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind black. I\u2019ve yet to milk the goat.\u201d Killian flashed her a seldom seen smile. \u201cMs. Luna, you make the best coffee in the desert. Black is fine.\u201d Taking up a spot next to him on the porch, she turned her attention to the mountains admiring the soft colors of rose and tan springing to life in the morning sun. \u201cWhat is it that haunts you so?\u201d \u201cThe illogicality of it all.\u201d \u201cAye, I figured that. It is indeed illogical. The children are too responsible to leave unannounced, yet they are snatched from their beds in the middle of the night with no clues.\u201d Killian sipped the wicked black brew and allowed the liquid to spike his taste buds. The brilliant light of a new day was caressing the landscape and warming the air. \u201cThe kinders disappearing are not inclined to run off. They are the eldest and most reliable. These missings make no sense. They don\u2019t happen in the same area or at the same time. They\u2019re completely arbitrary and being so\u2014random\u2014has given me pause to find a method. If I were to discover a pattern, the recovery would be simpler.\u201d Luna watched the anguish distort his handsome young face. His blue eyes clouded to a dark grey when he spoke of the missing children, and his normally full mouth stretched to a tight slash across his face. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to sound cruel, but none of these are young ones of your own family. Why take their absence to heart?\u201d Killian relaxed his scowl a bit, and a smile began to touch his lips. \u201cBecause it is they who will be the leaders of our clans in but a few short years. I had hoped to retire my sword someday to warm my boots by a fire. Having a mate and young ones around isn\u2019t such a bad idea.\u201d He automatically sipped his dark brew. It would indeed be nice to warm my feet by a fire with a mate and children. The problem being I\u2019ve found no person who makes me think in such terms. \u201cWell, I must admit, Master Killian, I never would have thought you to be the settling type.\u201d She picked up his cup, returning from the kitchen minutes later with fresh coffee in the container. \u201cNeither had I, Ms. Luna, neither had I, however, aside from our missing young ones, there has been no conflict between the clans, nor have the Others tried to interfere in our affairs in a very long time. It is a good thing for many but for me, what good is a warrior without a war?\u201d Luna could only agree with his forlorn assessment; what good, indeed, was a warrior without a war? \u201cMaybe a solution will arrive in the near future. You never know.\u201d Killian shrugged his shoulders. Who knew indeed? Christmas Pawsibilities Genie Gabriel \u201cSo where is this alien craft?\u201d Fletcher had never completely trusted Commander Viktor Atrocitor. Since he had taken command of GIG two years ago, the atmosphere at the agency had become cold and suspicious, like the man himself. He seemed carved from six and a half feet of granite, blocky and scowling. \u201cIt has disappeared.\u201d Fletcher knew this statement would draw Atrocitor\u2019s ire and disdain, but what was the use of denying the obvious? \u201cFool! Can you do nothing right?\u201d Atrocitor turned to the GIG agents waiting at a wary distance. \u201cSearch the neighborhood. Someone must have seen something or is hiding them.\u201d While Atrocitor berated Fletcher, other GIG agents spread throughout the neighborhood, offending pretty much everyone by demanding they stay in their houses while their property was overrun and searched. After two hours of fruitless searching, Commander Atrocitor called a halt. \u201cIf you want to save your career and this town, you will bring me these aliens within twenty-four hours.\u201d As Fletcher watched the caravan of GIG vehicles disappear down the road out of Watermark, he felt like a six-year-old kid again. Bullied and humiliated for his belief that beings from distant galaxies simply wanted to explore and build alliances. They weren\u2019t like aliens in movies who wanted to destroy humanity. That\u2019s why Fletcher started working at Geeks in Green. He thought he found other humans like himself who believed alliances with aliens could benefit everyone. Now he was starting to believe the rumors about Commander Atrocitor being heartless and determined to eliminate aliens were true. How could he know for sure? His thoughts were interrupted when Agnes staggered out the back door toward the barn. \u201cWho\u2019s disturbing my goats?\u201d With her hair disheveled and her clothes askew, she did indeed look as if she had spent a raucous night of partying\u2014the after-effects of being zapped by a ray gun. Laycee and Fletcher followed Agnes into the barn, where the spacecraft was once again visible. Now the hatch was open, with guards standing on either side pointing ray guns at Agnes, Laycee and Fletcher. \u201cHoly extraterrestrial!\u201d With a sizzle of purple, one of the alien guards fired his gun and Fletcher crumpled to the ground. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Ryan hustled out of the spacecraft. \u201cHe is of GIG,\u201d one of the guards stated. \u201cHe is a danger to our Queen.\u201d \u201cIs he dead?\u201d Ryan knelt over Fletcher\u2019s inert body. \u201cSimply stunned. We will revive him when the danger to our Queen is gone.\u201d The two guards loaded Fletcher onto a transport board, which levitated and moved inside the spacecraft. \u201cYour mouth isn\u2019t moving but I can hear your words.\u201d Laycee\u2019s shocked whisper matched the stunned expression in her eyes. \u201cOur Canine Queen is birthing and is not to be disturbed.\u201d This time the alien\u2019s mouth moved as he spoke, and he looked like any other human except for a twinkle of star light in his eyes. \u201cWeren\u2019t you getting milk for the royal puppies?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Ryan refocused his attention on this task, determined to ignore Laycee\u2019s presence. What was she doing here anyway? \u201cAgnes, do you have milk from your goats?\u201d \u201cMy goats don\u2019t much like to be milked.\u201d \u201cSurely it can\u2019t be that difficult,\u201d Ryan said. Agnes lifted an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to try. I\u2019ll get a clean bucket.\u201d Determined to get milk for the Queen\u2019s puppies, Ryan began stalking one of the goats. \u201cI think it should be a female,\u201d Laycee said. Ryan felt like a first grader again. \u201cI knew that.\u201d Laycee coughed behind her hand to cover her laughter. \u201cThere\u2019s a girl goat on top of the space ship.\u201d Ryan looked up the curved, smooth surface. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s another girl somewhere easier to reach.\u201d He stepped around the space ship and over the boards broken when the craft crashed through the roof. \u201cThere\u2019s a girl! Help me get her into a stall.\u201d \u201cUm-kay.\u201d While Ryan circled around the nanny goat one way, Laycee closed in on her from the other side. The little goat narrowed her eyes at the humans and, when they were within a couple feet of her, she let out a bleat and ran between Ryan\u2019s legs. Startled, he stumbled and dropped to one knee. \u201cWatch out!\u201d Laycee\u2019s shout made Ryan turn in time to see an irritated male goat charging toward him.

Currently in the works for publication is a commuter book featuring a motorcycle poker run, Joker\u2019s Wild, and the third in the dragon series, Dragons Among the Ice. Genie Gabriel Fur against my face and the soft smell of a dog curled protectively around me existed before my first memories of this life. So began my journey of being more in tune with animals than with people. I went through the expected motions of marriage, kids, divorce, and career, but usually out of step with most of the human population. This proved to be an advantage in developing an independence and a curiosity about things most people don\u2019t even consider. A minor health issue led to energy healing and becoming a master level Reiki practitioner. Working at the local animal shelter flipped on the switch to communicating with animals. Each dog I adopted showed miraculous changes most people couldn\u2019t believe. As a writer, I explored the mysteries of why people behave as they do, and also became fascinated by science, especially quantum physics. But perhaps my favorite way of writing stories is to ask the question, \u201c What if?\u201d and dive into those imagined worlds\u2014surrounded by my beloved furbabies, of course!

Mohammed, on Wednesday dispelled rumours that the pump price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) will be increased.\n\nHe gave this explanation while addressing state house correspondents at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), which was presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nHe said that the Minister of Petroleum (State), Ibe Kachikwu, would have been at the briefing but had to go for an urgent meeting in order to resolve the petroleum scarcity in the country.\n\n\u201dGovernment has no intention at all to increase the pump price of PMS; the minister has assured the council that there is enough products for the next one month even to end of January,\u2019\u2019 the minister stated.\n\n\nAccording to him, there is usually more demand for petrol product during the yuletide which explains the scarcity of the product during the period.\n\nMohammed said that the council had given a marching order to the petroleum minister (State) that the fuel crisis in the country should not last beyond the weekend.\n\nHe said that the minister had given assurance to ensure that the problem was contained.\n\nOn digitization, the minister said that the migration from analogue was on course.\n\nHe said that the digital switch over (DSO) platform in Ilorin would soon be inaugurated while those in Kaduna, Osogbo and Enugu were also ready for inauguration.\n\n\u201dWe hope that in the next couple of weeks we are going to inaugurate these DSOs.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that in the next few weeks we will inaugurate one DSO in one state in each of the regions of the country,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMohammed observed that there were challenges the country was working on especially the issue of set up boxes as the government was not in a position to subsidise 40 million set-up boxes.\n\n\u201dWe are looking at bringing down the cost of the boxes at the same time not lowering the quality of those boxes.\n\n\u201cI think the set up manufacturers are working very hard to bring the cost from 40 dollars to 20 dollars  and we are also working with the governors and local government chairmen to see how we can collaborate.\n\n\u201cThey can buy more boxes while we use our technology to ensure efficient payment of television licenses,\u2019\u2019 the minister said.\n\nCredit: NAN", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

But is this possible? \nAir Force General John Hyten, commander of Strategic Command, told the Halifax International Security Forum Nov. 18, that an order from the president to launch nuclear weapons can be refused if that order is determined to be illegal. In the face of an unlawful order, Gen. Hyten said, he would tell Trump he couldn\u2019t carry it out. \u201cIf it\u2019s illegal, guess what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d Hyten asked the gathering. \u201cI\u2019m going to say, \u2018Mr. President, that\u2019s illegal.\u2019\u201d \nFour days earlier, retired Gen. Robert Kehler, who previously held Gen. Hyten\u2019s top job at Strategic Command, testified likewise to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying that nuclear war commanders could \u201cignore any unlawful order by the president to launch a nuclear strike.\u201d \nGenerals Hyten and Kehler both said in their unprecedented public comments that the legal principles of \u201cmilitary necessity,\u201d \u201cdiscriminate destruction,\u201d and \u201cproportionality\u201d all apply to decisions about nuclear attacks. Senator Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, asked Gen. Kehler if he meant that Strategic Command could disobey a president\u2019s ordering a nuclear attack. \u201cYes,\u201d Kehler said. \nThat military officers \u201ccould\u201d disobey, or \u201ccan\u201d refuse unlawful orders are actually understatements in this context. US military service manuals explicitly require military personal to refuse illegal orders. As everyone sworn-in to the service is taught, disobeying illegal orders is mandatory; following them is a crime worthy of court martial. As CNN reported: \u201cUnder US military law, troops are obligated to not obey an unlawful order. If they received such an order, they could resign or force Trump to fire them.\u201d The point was made during last year\u2019s presidential campaign, when Trump promised to unlawfully torture prisoners, kill the families of suspected militants, and bomb civilians. CNN reported then that \u201cPentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook noted on [Nov. 17, 2016] that all US troops have an obligation not to follow illegal orders.\u201d \nCertain Weapons Effects Always Unlawful \nBut more importantly, there is a deep and startling absurdity and a shocking ignorance in these public nuclear war conversations. Any use of nuclear weapons would be indiscriminate and illegal by definition. Only the uninitiated, uninformed or willfully blind can still imagine that today\u2019s nuclear weapons could be used \u201cproportionately\u201d to produce more military good than evil. The uncontrollable, unlimited, and unfathomable magnitude of nuclear weapons effects have been established as unlawful in countless text books, law journals, government studies and independent analyses. \nThe use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances would be illegal because international covenants, treaties, and protocols forbid indiscriminate destruction, attacks that are disproportionate to a military objective, and weapons\u2019 effects that \u201ctreacherously wound,\u201d harm neutral states, or do long-term damage to the environment. \nIn her book Thermonuclear Monarchy Professor Elaine Scarry of Harvard reminds us that as long ago as 1995, Sweden, Iran and Egypt argued before the International Court of Justice that since nuclear weapons cause disproportionate suffering, they are prohibited by the 1868 Declaration of St. Petersburg and the Geneva Protocols of 1925, 1949, and 1977. The Republic of the Marshall Islands argued that using nuclear weapons would violate the 1907 Hague Conventions prohibiting weapons with effects that cross into neutral states. Both North Korea and India, neither of which possessed nuclear weapons in 1995, wrote to the World Court insisting that it judge them unlawful. India argued that any use of nuclear weapons, including the mere possession of them, is illegal under the Charter of the United Nations and international \u201crules of proportionality.\u201d \nCharles Moxley, in his 813-page study Nuclear Weapons & International Law, puts this list of treaty violations in perspective: \u201cNuclear weapons are not illegal just because they violate these laws of war, as exhaustively proven in this volume. They are illegal because they cause widespread and indiscriminate destruction without promoting the purpose of war: resolving conflict \u2026 They are not weapons but only wanton machines of symmetric destruction.\u201d \nPhysical Effects: \u201cComplete ruin\u201d \nWhat the generals and the congressional bureaucrats fail to grasp in their fantasies of legal nuclear attacks, is the vastness of the difference between conventional and nuclear weapons, and that the latter cannot be used in war without slaughtering hundreds of thousands of civilians\u2014that is, without committing war crimes. Some uncomfortable background information might be necessary. \nMoxley\u2019s Nuclear Weapons & International Law reports that, \u201cA nuclear detonation generates temperatures of 100 million degrees while a dynamite explosive about 3000 degrees.\u201d What this unimaginable heat does to cities is explained by Lynn Eden in her book Whole World on Fire. \u201cMass fire and extensive fire damage would occur in almost every circumstance in which nuclear weapons were detonated in a suburban or urban area. \u2026damage from mass fire would extend two to five times farther than blast damage.\u201d \nIn 1977, the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 653-page book The Effects of Nuclear Weapons notes with understatement, \u201cpersons in buildings or tunnels close to ground zero may be burned by hot gases and dust entering the structure\u2026\u201d In its lengthy consideration of radiation effects, taken from the US Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission, the FEMA study says in part, \u201cAmong them, apart from genetic effects, are the formation of cataracts, nonspecific life shortening, leukemia, other forms of malignant disease, and retarded development of children in utero at the time of the exposure.\u201d As Ann Fagan Ginger reported in her book Nuclear Weapons are Illegal, \u201cThey continue to maim and kill long after they explode in a test or in a war.\u201d \nA mass fire or \u201cfirestorm\u201d Eden writes, is \u201cthe simultaneous combustion of many fires over a large area, which causes a great volume of air to heat, rise, and suck in large amounts of fresh air at hurricane speeds from the periphery,\u201d Eden notes. \u201cWithin ten minutes after the cataclysmic events associated with the detonation, a mass of buoyantly rising fire-heated air would signal the start of a second and distinctly different event\u2014the development of a mass fire of gigantic scale and ferocity. This fire would quickly increase in intensity. In a fraction of an hour it would generate ground winds of hurricane force with average air temperatures well above the boiling point of water (212\u00b0F, 100\u00b0C). This would produce a lethal environment over a vast contiguous area.\u201d \nEden\u2019s research is worth quoting at length. \u201cThe first mass fire in history was created by allied incendiary raids at Hamburg on the night of July 27-28, 1943. Within 20 minutes, two of three buildings within an area of 4.5 square miles were on fire. In three to six hours, this fire so completely burned out an area of more than 5 square miles that the area was referred to by damage analysts as the \u2018Dead City.\u2019 Well-documented accounts describe wind speeds of hurricane force within the city. Air temperatures were calculated to be between four and five hundred degrees Fahrenheit, hundreds of degrees above the temperature of boiling water. [Up to] 100,000 people were killed in the attack. A mass fire resulting from a modern nuclear weapon could be expected to burn out an urban or suburban area of considerably larger size in a similarly brief time.\u201d \nLegal scholar George Delf\u2019s Humanizing Hell! The Law V. Nuclear Weapons is concise, bold, and direct. \u201c[A]rmed forces are committed by military, domestic and international law not to attack non-combatants. Any government which adopts a defense policy implying such an attack is therefore inciting its own forces to commit war crimes on a gigantic and suicidal scale.\u201d More articles by: John Laforge John LaForge is a Co-director of Nukewatch, a peace and environmental justice group in Wisconsin, and edits its newsletter.

This vote was never going to pass, it was purely symbolic and a waste of time, I do believe the president will be impeached, but I do not believe that will happen before Mueller's investigation concludes, and honestly I am not sure I want it to happen earlier.\n\nSee, I want him to suffer, I want him to know things are coming to a head and all of his secrets are getting out, I want him to see his allies and family fall or turn on him one by one, his support to erode and for him to finally be left alone in the White House and dragged out to face the consequences of his actions. I know I won't get all of that, but I feel like half of it wouldn't be too greedy of me. It is also too much to hope that he ever realizes what he did wrong and why people hate him, so I will take this version of justice instead.\n\nFor that to happen though everything needs to be pulled out into the light by a party that has no political affiliation. Which means letting Mueller run his investigation, it also means not wearing out the public with random impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe thing is that right now a pretty small fraction of the American public is even thinking about impeachment, a serious push in the House to impeach, one that actually caused lengthy debate or had a competitive vote, would put the subject right at the forefront of the public conscious, talking heads will go on about the relative merits of the process or the evidence, or lack thereof, involved, and then it will pass. Then a short while later the serious impeachment proceedings might begin, with actual evidence and and FBI investigation to make public, and the populace won't care because in their mind they already went over all of this and now the president is just being picked on. It would be ludicrously easy to exonerate him in the court of public opinion no matter the evidence against him. Better to make it a big deal when there actually is a chance of something happening.\n\nThe party leadership was not wrong to try and quash this attempt, bu like I said, the complaints against the party are not wrong either. Compared to, just as an example, me, the party is about as far right as the GOP is to the Democrats right now, and even after a few election cycles with an organization that sort of has its shit together, the DNC a far too unhealthy interest in balancing attracting the left wing and tacking to the center, which pretty much scares everyone away. They are the only organization we have to offset the GOP so they still get the support of those of us who want to slide the countries descent into madness, but to say they represent the will of the people is incorrect at best, they represent big money as always, just, most of that money benefits from being perceived as nice while the GOP donors gave up even trying long ago.\n\nI know the party adopted a very liberal platform last convention, and that is encouraging indeed, but in practice they haven't really shown a ton of interest in pursuing that platform either, making it increasingly clear that it was just another ploy.\n\nNot saying we should dump them, not without a clear other option on the national scene, but they can't really be the long term solution either, not in their current form, the only problem is we have to survive the short term first.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mueller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dnc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:43.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ffb1ea0c0d8abbc5561f7d7d56b167cc152400d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wWZgYCvjxbU52DckWtWH2GfftAdzllSKTdpAOtuUnSwa3XYtdiiZCl9x8sMabMwk-", "site_full": "www.bizrate.com", "site": "bizrate.com", "site_section": "http://www.bizrate.com/automotive-parts/ratings_guide/listing__start--351.html", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "shopping"], "section_title": "Automotive Parts Store Reviews and Ratings at BizRate", "title": "FRSport.com", "title_full": "FRSport.com Reviews and Store Ratings | Bizrate", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.035, "main_image": "http://s2.cnnx.io/s2static/us/br/03377324/br2/images/smiley/smiley_outstanding_200x200.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2215, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a05be3035833f98df3d141fd19f18ff0f823687", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wWZgYCvjxbU52DckWtWH2GfftAdzllSKTdpAOtuUnSwa3XYtdiiZClSaekRqclaA1Bf7LxSTNvw--", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "G35Guy", "published": "2017-11-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Awesome experience and specially having the option on picking up the item yourself", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:43.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "148638176bc5a69bf2e6128e49e840b866372f73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRG24bvQ6JHJhxsXggNy2Fe7_OBzSCJDi7taZ7Yu7GP6G7oMHdNh_HrlZ5o8mAP_QugARC0mCIxQpBZrvB3bmIDCa62N1vRNv0-", "site_full": "kalamazoo.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://kalamazoo.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist kalamazoo | for sale search", "title": "ARIZONA men's jeans (Portage, MI) $10", "title_full": "ARIZONA men's jeans (Portage, MI) $10", "published": "2017-12-07T10:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_jKMqeitD1f2_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "148638176bc5a69bf2e6128e49e840b866372f73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRG24bvQ6JHJhxsXggNy2Fe7_OBzSCJDi7taZ7Yu7GP6G7oMHdNh_HrlZ5o8mAP_QugARC0mCIxQpBZrvB3bmIDCa62N1vRNv0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "ARIZONA men's jeans (Portage, MI) $10", "text": "model name / number: original boot cut size / dimensions: 33 x 30 QR Code Link to This Post ARIZONA men's jeans ~ $10 each pair \u2022 33 x 30 original boot cut Comes from a smoke free and pet free home.   meet, so, the jeans can be checked over and tried on, if need be.
