There is a lot of excitement. \n\u201cIf we do badly, the entire national team will have to disappear. It\u2019s going to be very difficult for anyone to continue because we have already been here for a number of years. \n\u201cI never went over the previous finals. What I have are memories. \n\u201cWe were worthy of winning them because, without having played well, we had the clearest [chances] \u2013 both in the World Cup and the Copas America. \n\u201cI would have to review them to see what we did wrong so we don\u2019t repeat them. I think we deserved to win two, at least.\u201d \nMessi also thinks Juventus striker Gonzalo Higuain, should be recalled to the Argentina squad. \nHiguain was left out of Jorge Sampaoli\u2019s squad for Argentina\u2019s final two World Cup qualifiers against Peru and Ecuador in October, but the Barcelona star feels the Juventus striker is still important to the national team. \n\u201cHe is suffering for the national team, but he must be in it,\u201d Messi stated. \n\u201cFor me, he is one of the best number nines in the world. He demonstrates this every weekend at Juventus, but does not play the same with Argentina. \n\u201cThe critics make him suffer, we have spoken about it many times. \n\u201cI believe that this period without the national team did him good. We spoke about it through messages, it was a good thing that he had this period of absence. But he must be in the squad.\u201d \nHiguain has scored nine goals and bagged three assists in 13 Serie A starts for Juventus who are in third place in the table, two points behind leaders Inter Milan.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lionel messi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "messi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ballon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gonzalo higuain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "higuain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jorge sampaoli", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "juventus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "copas america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inter milan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la albiceleste", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecuador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iceland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "copa america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "croatia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:10.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72c21348432777fdafd96b7803c44507d134cd6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB63JtGqLJhdLWAdumgEZcNzBA4UnM1.mv9CUZfnhAob_ZL8dgeoi2o29Xs_7Klordul99LZdPqV929YU_RTG8oLK3C9f0zhrLw-", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "Listenin' to Classical Music and Conversation | Page 569", "title_full": "Listenin' to Classical Music and Conversation | Page 569 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T01:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/24/24203.jpg?1487825654", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78bb36533cfdf5a9b390341679ba46d0f5cd0463", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB63JtGqLJhdLWAdumgEZcNzBA4UnM1.mv9CUZfnhAob_ZL8dgeoi2o29Xs_7Klordul99LZdPqV929YU_RTG8oLkUDi18Vacn0QiEiO35JRNQ--", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "fluffskul", "published": "2017-12-06T16:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "First listen to \" The Island Of St. Hylarion - Music Of Cyprus 1413-1422 \" performed by Ensemble Project Ars Nova on New Albion Records.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51LQ6k8MmgL.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:10.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7bf874f33a8306414db333eed5fa45a49adad4f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XYMElmOfZIpg.zB_zq.VobPY4NyKuZfYufSQRcTZBnRRh5k7gha.3XDBT9aEWrmU-", "site_full": "www.facepunch.com", "site": "facepunch.com", "site_section": "http://www.facepunch.com/forumdisplay.php?f=51", "site_categories": ["entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Sponsored Spambots", "title": "Valve announces the return of Portal via Bridge Constructor", "title_full": "Valve announces the return of Portal via Bridge Constructor", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 25788, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "057b54fc22a87f32ddbb365b8c2f8faf539d3980", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XYMElmOfZIpg.zB_zq.VobPY4NyKuZfYufSQRcTZBnRRh5k7gha.3VQ92A1xluHJprAo0vfYRmUOrLcS_KnPd", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Omali", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Mastermind of42 posted: Honestly, I like the idea of Valve loaning out IPs.\nIt'd be great if there were a game based on the half-life universe that plays similarly to the base game but made by a different company.\nThink games like Blue Shift, which was made by Gearbox in 2001, but more open to licensing.

I got a most of my collection that way.\nAround 3 years ago when vinyl really got \"cool\" all of a sudden I wasn't finding ANYTHING in the used bins any more. I had previously collected rock and other 'pop' genres.

Do you agree? It \u2019 s so refreshing to see awards given to names like Zerodegrees Microbrewery & Restaurant that recognise exactly what they do - inn ovation, quality and atmosphere! \nOn Thursday 16th November 2017 , two passionate chefs from Zerodegrees Microbrewery Restaurant - Kani Naim and Daniele Boccardi competed and won in The PAPA Awards in collaboration with SIBA (Society of Independent Brewers), after having won the regionals. Starting in 2000, Zerodegrees were out on the streets convincing people to taste fresh brewed beer, look at the craft beer scene now! They are very proud and still just as passionate, as you can see with the food and beer pairing they offer. \n(Photo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/615949/Fennel__Sausage_and_Pumpkin_Pizza.jpg ) \nThe 28th Annual PAPA Awards have recognised and awarded the best in the Italian Food Industry. Zerodegrees innovated a unique style of pizza making to put them on the forefront of pizzerias, that complimented their beers so well. This made them a perfect candidate for this competition. SIBA\u2019s association with this award highlighted their prominence as it perfectly represented their niche market, marrying fresh craft beer and wood fired pizza. \nWe are pleased to announce that Zerodegrees managed to pick up four awards! They reflect the core of what the restaurant is all about - authentic Italian food with a creative Zerodegrees twist. Independent Pizza Restaurant Gold Award Winner \nThis is an award to be proud of as the judging criteria included restaurants that set a standard for others to follow. As Zerodegrees are pioneers of the beer and pizza industry in the UK, clearly they\u2019re setting the bar as reflected through their excellent customer service, heritage, premium products and bustling atmosphere. \nPAPA - The Sam Browne Foods \u201d Pizza Chef of the Year Winner \u201d \nIt was clear to see that the Zerodegrees brand values sat comfortably with the ethos of this award, this recently introduced pizza at Zerodegrees has become a massive hit! \nPAPA - Euro Pizza Products \u201d Pizza Chef of the Year Winner \u201d \nDaniele was given creative freedom to make his very own signature dish. His lesser traditional styled pizza won the judges hearts. As part of their Creative Team at Zerodegrees, they are constantly coming up with new takes on the traditional Italian Pizza and also ways to enhance the new modern palette with unusual choices that really work together. PAPA - Keck Short Cut \u201d Pasta Chef of the Year Winner \u201d Kani Naim from Zerodegrees with Smoking Hake Trevelli Pasta \nTheir skills from Pizzas are also reflected in their Pasta dishes at Zerodegrees along with their theatre styled dining experience with an open kitchen and a working brewery.

The 1994 and 1998 World Cup star, speaks about the Super Eagles\u2019 prospect at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. He also offers advice on how the young and talented Nigeria players show play at the big stage. Excerpts\u2026 Sports Planet: Victor Ikpeba, 1997 African Footballer of the Year and 1996 Olympic gold medalist, thank you for talking to us. Ikpeba : Thank you very much, it\u2019s a pleasure. Were you surprised that Nigeria was grouped alongside Argentina again at next year\u2019s World Cup in Russia? I\u2019m not surprised because it\u2019s becoming like a marriage made in heaven, constantly being grouped with Argentina at the World Cup. In the six World Cup appearances we have qualified for, this is the fifth time Nigeria would be in the same group with Argentina and didn\u2019t get the better of them in the last four outings. But when you compare the pedigree of Argentina \u2013 two times World Cup winners, one of the giants of world football that have also produced best players in world football in Diego Mardona, Lionel Messi and so on, we have never had it easy against them apart from the 1996 Olympic Games final in Athens. They are always a very difficult team to break down, but in football anything can happen. They are the favourites to top the group, no doubt; we should not get carried away because we defeated them in a friendly match recently. Though it is good for pride, but World Cup is a different ball game. I think on paper, this is a group that we have to work hard and qualify because we can\u2019t take Croatia and Iceland lightly. If you look at the players Croatia have; Luka Modric, Mario Mandzukic, Ivan Rakitic; there are a lot of good players in their squad, especially in the middle of the park and in the attack. Iceland on the other hand is unknown territory and difficult. They topped their group in the qualifiers, so they\u2019ve come of age. I could remember about 28 years back when I travelled to Europe, Iceland were the whipping boys of European football. They have really done well to get to that level they are now. People should be proud that countries that have not been given a chance before are now progressing. It is a tough call and our boys have to be ready; they have to show a lot determination, a lot of pride to get out of that group. We\u2019re sure you would also be particularly impressed with Gernot Rohr\u2019s qualifying campaign, remaining unbeaten. How key do you think he (Rohr) will be to a successful World Cup campaign for the Super Eagles? Rohr is very important. To me, he has done well to qualify from Africa. Now, we are going to face the world. It\u2019s a different style of football, a different atmosphere. For the coaching side, this is the very first big thing that will happen to Genormt Rohr, for his CV \u2013 to qualify Nigeria for the World Cup. I think it\u2019s going to be a learning process for him. He is very experienced. He is knowledgeable in the game. He has a youthful squad mixed with experienced players which is a little bit of advantage. But the young players should not get carried away because it is going to be a different experience for them and I think that is where man management of the players comes to play. Talking about man management, the NFF recently announced that they have settled all bonus issues with the team and also extended Gernot Rohr\u2019s contract by another two years. CAF is also going to give them 500,000 US Dollars to support them. It seems that everything is on course for the Super Eagles to have a good World Cup campaign? I think everything has been done as it should be. We have suffered a lot when it comes to bonuses in the past. We didn\u2019t have much of that in 1994, but we had a lot of that in 1998 and 2014. We pray that things like that should not happen again. We don\u2019t see that happening to South American teams and European teams, so Africans also have to learn from them too. When you have an agreement you have to stick to that agreement. It is very bad sometimes when you don\u2019t even have an agreement before you go to the World Cup. So I think they have done well in that aspect, it is now left for the players to go there and shine. Nobody is condemning them to win the World Cup. They just need to have a decent World Cup. Quarter-finals will be great for Nigeria, and anything can happen. They can get to the semi-finals. Gernot Rohr Nobody gave the Nigerian Olympics team of 1996 any chance that they would be Olympic gold medalists. So they should have the belief, but it\u2019s going to be tough. Every World Cup is always a surprise, but the favourites are always there. They know that the African teams have come of age, so whenever they want to play an African team they are always very business-like. They know the quality of players we have. I think NFF have done well in that aspect, that is the role they can play, to make sure the players don\u2019t have any problems. Now, nobody can complain because of bonus again and I think a lot of knowledgeable people are in the NFF now. And kudos to CAF for sending money to all federations that have qualified for the World CupI I hope that they use the money judiciously and wisely for what the money is meant for. Apart from that, I think the boys are raring to go, and I\u2019m sure they can\u2019t wait for the World Cup to begin. You\u2019ve been to the World Cup twice. You are also an Olympic gold medalist. Some of these players will be going to their first world cup. What advice will you give them not to be overwhelmed by the big stage? They should just go out there and do the right things; they should not be nervous. Even some of the players are playing in best leagues in the world and the World Cup is not different especially when you know the level of the World Cup and the Champions League. The Champions League is like a mini World Cup because you play against some of the best players in the world. So I don\u2019t think the players can be carried away by the magnitude of the occasion. But I think players tend to be nervous because it is part of football and that is where man management by the coach has to come in, talking to the players to have the belief and not to be nervous. But on this big occasion, you still see players being nervous, players making mistakes, this happens in big games like the World Cup. So, all I can say now is that we Nigerians should support the team. We should pray that we get to the quarter-finals. And I say best of luck to the players and especially to the coach. He has done a very wonderful job. I think he deserveed the extension of his contract with the Super Eagles. It is not good to destroy a winning team like we usually do here. Continuity is very key especially with these young generation of players we have. And to the young players, do not get carried away, listen to your experienced teammates and don\u2019t try to be selfish. Play collectively, support one another and team unity helps a lot when it comes to the magnitude of a tournament like the World Cup. So, I say best of luck to them.

Clear blue skies and an almost harsh bright white sunlight that bakes everything it touches. Where to base yourself North Perth\u200a\u2014\u200aa neighbourhood well-served by cafes and restaurants and within walking distance of the city centre. Leederville \u2013 great cinema and good bars and restaurants. Fremantle \u2013 known for its markets and dock-side lifestyle. Central \u2013 Perth\u2019s central business district has all the shops you could want, plus some great bars and restaurants. The city has the Swan River running through it and there is development underway to make the most of this riverside precinct. Which beaches to go to North Cottesloe \u2013 probably the favourite with locals, endless white sand and solid waves. City Beach \u2013 a bit easier to get to and favoured by a younger crowd. Where to eat Long Chim\u200a\u2014\u200aPerth: Chef David Thompson is renowned as a passionate advocate of Thai cuisine, and in his restaurant Long Chim he celebrates the flavours and traditional dishes of Thailand by elevating them to something spectacular. We were there for a family dinner, which the sharing-style dishes suited perfectly. Our starters included crunchy prawns; beef skewers; and dried prawns wrapped in betel leaves. Our mains included calamari, green chicken curry, a rich beef curry, and lamb ribs. While there is a relaxed, unfussy style to this restaurant this is still very much high-end cooking, with high-end prices to match. If you were being picky, the serving sizes are a touch on the small side (considering the price you\u2019re paying), but this is almost compensated for by the depth and complexity of flavour. Without doubt this was one of the best Thai meals I\u2019ve ever eaten. Little Creatures\u200a\u2014\u200aFremantle: If you\u2019re visiting Perth, then you will want to spend at least one day exploring the docklands precinct of Fremantle. One of the most popular spots for lunch is the Little Creatures brewery. This is a massive complex where they brew the beer and also serve a great selection of food. We shared pizzas and slurped down mussels in a spicy tomato broth. Foam\u200a\u2014\u200aLeederville: Leederville is a cool neighbourhood in Perth, renowned for its bars, cafes, restaurants, and a cinema. One of the best cafes we found was Foam. We called in one day for a mid-week breakfast\u200a\u2014\u200asimple poached eggs and bacon, but you couldn\u2019t ask for a better breakfast. The Aviary: The Nest is the rooftop bar of The Aviary. A popular spot with locals catching up for drinks while on a night out. Dress-code seemed to be dress-to-impress, which for women was obviously the shortest, tightest skirt you could find. A great spot to enjoy a warm evening in Perth. Where to stay in Perth Baileys Serviced Apartments \u2013 a good, central location and all the convenience of having your own apartment. Mount Bay Waters Apartment \u2013 putting you right in the city centre, this gives you the ideal base to explore everything. Como The Treasury \u2013 a high-end hotel in a heritage building with a city centre location. Visiting Margaret River The wine region of Margaret River\u200a is a three hour drive south of Perth. It\u2019s in this area you also find fantastic beaches including Smith\u2019s Beach\u200a\u2014\u200aa vast expanse of bright white sand, sparsely populated with a few swimmers, surfers, and sunbathers, while young surf-lifesavers keep a relaxed eye on proceedings. You need a car to explore this area effectively. It\u2019s along the coastal Caves Road, that links the towns of Dunsborough and Margaret River, where you find most of the wineries.Favourite wineries include: Vasse Felix which has an excellent Shiraz; and Cape Mentelle where not only are the wines really good but it\u2019s the perfect spot to grab a light lunch to eat out under the gum trees. Cheeky Monkey brewery is a good spot for lunch\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially if you have young kids who need to run around. Where to stay in Margaret River Abbey Beach : Busselton: Resort-style accommodation, relaxed and casual, with a couple of pools and direct access to the beach\u200a\u2014\u200aperfect for a family holiday. Smiths Beach Resort : Located right on the iconic stretch of sand \u2013 you\u2019ll have no excuse not to go surfing before breakfast. Empire Spa Retreat : Just near the small town of Yallingup, this puts you in the heart of both the best beaches and the best wineries.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david thompson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "long chim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leederville", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vasse felix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "busselton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north cottesloe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret river the wine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret river abbey beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cape mentelle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leederville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fremantle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dunsborough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yallingup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swan river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north perth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount bay waters apartment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caves road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perth baileys", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:11.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b7a065c2fd6d152d51072953b6368075165c163", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UehkYgudwl_4zgUr_Sct11_mVL2LuZiXQv3zdnf8x6DBzr9V3m3hggUtLMo3V78BIJU370VxQxT6W1Dpl.d5NGNHCLhgDiAOfh1SJ4wnRfq2yUauqTTk5aO_UR1tEb4ZRo-", "site_full": "davidcjarboe.darkchocolateblog.com", "site": "darkchocolateblog.com", "site_section": "http://davidcjarboe.darkchocolateblog.com/feed/atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Live Healthy and Wealthy", "title": "Fishers Xophoria For Improved Skin Texture", "title_full": "Fishers Xophoria For Improved Skin Texture", "published": "2017-12-07T02:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b7a065c2fd6d152d51072953b6368075165c163", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UehkYgudwl_4zgUr_Sct11_mVL2LuZiXQv3zdnf8x6DBzr9V3m3hggUtLMo3V78BIJU370VxQxT6W1Dpl.d5NGNHCLhgDiAOfh1SJ4wnRfq2yUauqTTk5aO_UR1tEb4ZRo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "livershot", "published": "2017-12-07T02:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Fishers Xophoria For Improved Skin Texture", "text": "Live Healthy and Wealthy MLM and Healthy Chocolate   \u00bb Fishers Xophoria For Improved Skin Texture \nToday\u2019s Indianapolis Xophoria component is Vegetable Oil, which is used as a carrier for one of the raw materials.

According to the Desert Sun, the march began at the Sonora Stage and made its way to the Chiaozza Garden. The crowd was speckled with hand-drawn signage, including the words \u201cScience is real\u201d and \u201cevidence over ignorance.\u201d \nJoe DeGeorge, the band\u2019s saxophonist and synth player, explained the group\u2019s reasoning for spearheading Coachella\u2019s iteration of the Science March. \nAll over the country, people are marching for science, and we\u2019re doing our march here at Coachella. It\u2019s not just about marching for a fact-based ideology; it\u2019s about power and how the institution and structure that runs this country really value private wealth and capital above things like our health, our environment. We are marching because we value those things and we have to shout in this capitalist structure to make our values heard. \nCoachella attendees joined hundreds of organized marches across the nation in the name of science and governmental responsibility.

We thoroughly cleaned the area and gently picked away all the leftover dead skin. 8) March 6 \u2013 present: The skin surface has remained clear of the basal cell. For now I am still continuing to apply the baking soda and coconut oil EVERY DAY, along with apple cider vinegar soaked cotton pads that I place over the area to reach the basal cell root. My mother will be scheduling regular followups with her doctor, as well as another biopsy. The Method I Used Raw organic coconut oil (the brand I used was Artisana) Aluminum-free baking soda (I purchased it at a holistic health food store A shot glass, to effectively stir the mixture within Something to stir the mixture with; I used the narrow handle of a small metal spoon Polysporin Triple 3 Antibiotics, or any other antibiotic ointment to apply at night I stirred one part baking soda and one part coconut oil in a shot glass until it became a malleable paste that was easy to apply. It helped to apply a bit of warmth to melt the coconut oil faster, so I let the shot glass run under hot water for a bit. Using the handle of the spoon that I stirred with, I applied the mixture to the affected area. I DID NOT RUB IT IN. Instead I gently slathered the area with the paste and let it remain there for as long as possible. Then I applied a shower cap to keep the treatment in place. I aimed for three applications a day for the first week, and two for the second week moving forward, and made sure to properly clean the affected area before each application. \nA basal cell has roots that reach much deeper into the skin than it appears \u2014 it is not just on the surface \u2014 and so I learned that it is important to continue using the treatment even when the skin has fully patched up. What We All Learned From This Experience Looking back at the start of this whole experience, I realize that I was just as skeptical as most people with regards to a successful treatment that costs only a few dollars, not to mention one that is sitting in my kitchen pantry! I completely understand why a simple solution like baking soda and coconut oil would be cast aside in favour of a more \u2018sophisticated\u2019 treatment. While I am by no means completely against mainstream or allopathic medicine, it is my opinion that we have been heavily conditioned by the medical industry to believe that we have absolutely no power over our own physical and mental health, and that the solutions and cures to our ailments lie far beyond our reach; that only a large sum of money can buy a cure. I can\u2019t stress enough that this is simply untrue. Throughout my mother\u2019s healing, my whole family had experienced firsthand how effective an alternative treatment can be. Not only is it effective, but it is affordable, safe, and free of side effects. Needless to say, my family\u2019s opinion on mainstream/allopathic medicine has shifted significantly. My hope is that people who are going through a similar experience can come to understand that the power is in their hands to heal themselves. No one is going to spoon-feed us the truth about how we can heal using simple and affordable methods \u2014 especially not the medical industry. We must do our own research and reclaim our healing power. ****UPDATE July 5, 2014**** Hi everyone! I just wanted to update you all on what has been happening with my mother and the basal cell. As my article states and the pictures show, the entire skin surface did clear up by the beginning of March. \nSometime in April I accompanied my mother on a visit to her doctor in order to relay the details of this whole experience to her, and I brought pictures which documented the process. The doctor was very impressed at the response of the basal cell to the coconut oil and baking soda. But, to be safe, she referred my mother to a dermatologist (another one this time, who is apparently very good) for a more thorough assessment and biopsy. This appointment is scheduled for mid-July. \nWe stopped using the treatment in April \u2014 partly because we got extremely busy planning for a big trip in May, and partly because we were curious to see what would happen if we just left the affected area alone, without any treatment. The area stayed clear until the first week of June. \nAt the beginning of June we noticed the small lesion returning, in its usual place. We were on vacation at the time and waited until we returned to resume treatment. Toward the end of June we started applying the baking soda and coconut oil, with a cotton pad soaked in organic apple cider vinegar placed on top. Within only a day the skin started to clear up again. The scabbing fell away on the first day and within two days the area had patched itself up. We are continuing to use the treatment. \nIt is evident that the treatment is working on a surface level. The cancer seems to respond by shrinking away and clearing up. But basal cells have roots under the surface of the skin. We are trying to ascertain at this point whether the treatment will eventually eradicate the root of the basal cell if we keep using it, even when the skin surface is completely clear. \nAnother thing I must note, which I\u2019m trying to get my mother to understand, is that the process of healing cancer is holistic, meaning it is not just a silver bullet solution that heals it (in this case a topical application). It is an amalgamation of different healing modalities which work to keep the body, mind, and spirit in a vibration that cancer can\u2019t thrive in. This includes a healthy diet and lifestyle, the elimination of toxins from the body, a positive mindset, and the integration of other healing practices such as reiki, acupuncture, and yoga/meditation. \nI have been hearing from other people\u2019s personal experiences that taking certain vitamins and supplements was very helpful in combating their skin cancer, in conjunction with a topical application. It makes sense, since proper nutrition allows the body to heal itself. We are going to look into this for my mother. \nI will once again make an update to this article upon receiving further information and results. \nThank you to everyone for your contribution and sharing your experiences. It\u2019s nice to get a broad spectrum of perspectives on the matter. \nBlessings, namaste, and much love, Kyneret While this worked for me, it may not work for everyone.

They are developed by packaging a small set of courses that allows students to develop expertise within a focused area of study, addressing identified market and workforce development needs. \nThe DSU certificates will prepare students with entry-level skills and experience that may lead to careers as computer scientists, software engineers, programmers, security specialists, and other computing professionals. Each of the certificates also will stack seamlessly toward completion of associate and bachelor\u2019s degree programs in these fields. DSU officials said the new offerings will target students who may not be ready to commit to a full bachelor\u2019s degree program, as well as non-traditional students looking for new workforce skills that are increasingly in high demand. Each of the new certificates consist of 12 credit hours of study and will be available starting next fall.

learn more Although good science should always be reviewed, using this label as a form of credibility can be dangerous, causing people to dismiss new information and research instantaneously if it doesn\u2019t have it, particularly when that information counters long-held beliefs ingrained into human consciousness via mass marketing, education, and more. Unfortunately, it\u2019s becoming increasingly apparent that we are being lied to about the products and medicines we use on a daily basis. If you\u2019re one who commonly points to the \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d label, then you should know that there are many researchers and insiders who have been creating awareness about the problem with this label for years. Who Says So? And From What Fields? Climate Science Many people have spoken up against the corporatization and politicization of science. For example, Professor Lennart Bengtsson, a Swedish climatologist and former director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, has voiced his concern that some scientists are, according to an interview given to the Daily Mail , \u201cmixing up their scientific role with that of climate activist.\u201d He claims that there are multiple indicators for how \u201cscience is gradually being influenced by political views.\u201d ( source ) Professor Joanna D. Haigh, a British physicist, professor of atmospheric physics at Imperial College London, co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change, and former president of the Royal Meteorological Society, has also spoken up about the politicization of climate science. ( source ) The Australian prime minister\u2019s chief business advisor has done the same, and so have other politicians, like Senator James Inhofe, chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. You can read more about that story here . Unfortunately, the mainstream vilifies such people, and to great effect. Below is an excellent snippet of a lecture given by Richard Lindzen , one of the world\u2019s top experts in the field and lead author of \u201cPhysical Climate Processes and Feedbacks,\u201d Chapter 7 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Third Assessment Report on climate change. He knows that all climate science we receive is IPCC United Nations science. One of the scientists mentioned on the senator\u2019s list, in this video, he talks about the politics of climate science and the manipulation of data \u2014 something that plagues all fields of science today. Medical Science/Health Science/Food In the case of medicine, a lot of information has emerged showing just how much corruption really goes on. The Editors-in-Chiefs of several major medical journals have been quite blunt, with perhaps one of the best examples coming from Dr. Richard Horton, the current Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet , who says, \u201cThe case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue.\u201d ( source ) \nDr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime Editor-in-Chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ), also considered one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals in the world, alongside The Lancet, has said that \u201cit is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.\u201d ( source ) John Ioannidis, an epidemiologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine, published an article titled \u201c Why Most Published Research Findings Are False , \u201d which subsequently became the most widely accessed article in the history of the Public Library of Science (PLoS). ( source ) \nHere is another great quote: \n\u201cThe medical profession is being bought by the pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of the practice of medicine, but also in terms of teaching and research. The academic institutions of this country are allowing themselves to be the paid agents of the pharmaceutical industry. I think it\u2019s disgraceful.\u201d \u2013 Arnold Seymour Relman (1923-2014), Harvard professor of medicine and former Editor-in-Chief of The New England Medical Journal ( source ) \nAs you can see, this has been a problem for quite some time. A Couple of Examples: GMOs One of the best examples of political influence over scientific publication comes from an episode involving Genetically Modified Maize. Monsanto published a study a few years ago which purported to demonstrate the effects of GMO maize on rats over a 90 day period. They reported no ill effects on the rodents from this diet. Given the fact that there are no long term studies examining the health risks associated with GMOs, independent researchers then decided to conduct the same study, with one difference: Their study lasted over a year rather than a mere three months. Researchers found instances of severe liver and kidney damage, as well as hormonal disturbances, alongside the development of large tumours and mortality among the treatment groups . The study was published in November of 2012, in the Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology, and then instantly retracted. After hundreds of scientists condemned the retraction, the U.S. did not publish it. The study was then re-published in multiple peer-reviewed scientific journals (in Europe last year [2014]), like Environmental Sciences Europe . This is why it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that so many countries in Europe have banned the growing of genetically modified crops . Many also have bans and/or severe restrictions on importing GM products, citing health and environmental concerns. \nThis fact was also made clear by WikiLeaks documents: \nResistance to the advent of genetically modified foods has been pronounced across Europe. The continent features some of the strictest regulations governing the use and cultivation of GMO products, and public skepticism about biotech goods is quite high \u2013 a fact not lost on American diplomats. In a lengthy report dating from late 2007 , a cable issued by the State Department outlined its \u201cBiotechnology Outreach Strategy, \u2018which, among other things, recognized the European Union\u2019s \u2018negative views on biology\u2019 and committed as a national priority to limiting them (O7STATE160639). Initial attention paid to the State Department\u2019s part in pushing industrial manufactures on its allies obscured the even bigger role it played in assuring a place for genetically modified agricultural products (GMOs) in a region that largely wanted nothing to do with them. The American campaign promoting biotech products was a worldwide effort. In all, some 1,000 documents from the Cablegate cache address this effort, a significant number of which originate in Europe. U.S. diplomats on the continent gave considerable attention to insuring the interests of American biotech firms in Europe \u2013 Whether through \u201ceducation\u201d programs, government lobbying, or outright coercion \u2013 as well as stripping down European Union regulations designed to act as a bugger against them. Available cables published by WikiLeaks suggest that the United States invests considerable time, effort, and expense in its operations on behalf of the American biotech firms. Keep Evolving Your Consciousness \nRead more about it from The WikiLeaks Files: The World According To U.S. Empire . In 1996, Steven M. Druker, being a public interest attorney and the Executive Director of the Alliance For Bio-Integrity, initiated a lawsuit in 1998 that forced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to divulge its files on genetically engineered foods. He\u2019s recently published a book on the lawsuit that provides details of his experience. He has also released the documents on his website , showing the significant hazards of genetically engineering foods and the flaws in the FDA\u2019s policy. It\u2019s called Altered Genes, Twisted Truth: How the Venture to Genetically Engineer Our Food Has Subverted Science, Corrupted Government, and Systematically Deceived the Public. Pharmaceutical Drugs There are a number of examples to choose from here, but antidepressants make the top of the list. Irving Kirsch, a lecturer in medicine at Harvard Medical School, published a study pointing out how \u201canalyses of the published data and the unpublished data that were hidden by drug companies reveals that most (if not all) of the benefits are due to the placebo effect.\u201d ( source ) Another study published in the British Medical Journal by researchers at the Nordic Cochrane Center in Copenhagen showed that pharmaceutical companies were not disclosing all information regarding the results of their drug trials. Researchers looked at documents from 70 different double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) and found that the full extent of serious harm in clinical study reports went unreported. \nTamang Sharma, a PhD student at Cochrane and lead author of the study, said: \u201cWe found that a lot of the appendices were often only available upon request to the authorities, and the authorities had never requested them. I\u2019m actually kind of scared about how bad the actual situation would be if we had the complete data.\u201d ( source ) Another co-author of the study, Dr. Peter Gotzsche, who co-founded the Cochrane Collaboration (the world\u2019s foremost body in assessing medical evidence), found in a separate analysis that 100,000 people in the United States die each year from the side effects of correctly used prescription drugs, noting that \u201cit\u2019s remarkable that nobody raises an eyebrow when we kill so many of our own citizens with drugs.\u201d He has published many papers arguing that our use of antidepressants is causing more harm than good, and taking into consideration the recent leaks regarding these drugs, it seems he is correct. \nBelow is a brief video of him elaborating on this problem: Vaccines Vaccines are getting more attention now than ever before. In fact, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Chairman of the World Mercury Project (WMP) , recently announced a $100,000 challenge aimed at putting an end to the inclusion of mercury, a neurotoxin that is 100 times more poisonous than lead, in vaccines administered in the U.S and globally. It\u2019s offered to anybody, including journalists and scientists, who can provide a study showing that it is safe to inject mercury into babies. This will be difficult, as hundreds of studies (that were also present at the press conference in print form) show it is absolutely unsafe, and can significantly increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders. You can read more about this here . Multiple cases of vaccine fraud have been uncovered, but this is something you might not know given the fact that the mainstream media completely ignores these facts, and vaccines are heavily marketed. For example, Lucija Tomljenovic, who has a PhD in biochemistry and is a senior postdoctoral fellow in UBC\u2019s Faculty of Medicine, as well as a medical investigator, uncovered documents that reveal vaccine manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and health authorities have known about multiple dangers associated with vaccines but chose to withhold them from the public. ( source ) But perhaps one of the biggest revelations in medical history, also unfortunately ignored by mainstream media, came only a couple of years ago and is still making noise, as it should. Dr. William Thompson, a longtime senior CDC scientist, published some of the most commonly cited pro-vaccine studies, which showed that there was absolutely no link between the MMR vaccine and autism ( Thompson, et al. 2007, Price, et al. 2010 , Destefano, et al. 2004 ). However, Dr. Thompson recently admitted that it was \u201c the lowest point\u201d in his career when he \u201cwent along with that paper.\u201d He went on to say that he and the other authors \u201cdidn\u2019t report significant findings\u201d and that he is \u201c completely ashamed\u201d of what he did. He was \u201c complicit and went along with this,\u201d and regrets that he has \u201c been a part of the problem.\u201d ( source )( source )( source ) A study with revised information and no data omitted was published by Dr. Brian Hooker (a contact of Dr. Thompson) in the peer reviewed journal Translational Neurodegeneration, and it found a 340% increased risk of autism in African American boys receiving the Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The study has since been retracted, around the same time this controversy arose. You can read the full study here , although, unsurprisingly, it has since been retracted. Thompson\u2019s attorneys, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Bryan Smith of Morgan & Morgan, also released a statement from Dr. Thompson, which mentioned Hooker: \u201c I have had many discussions with Dr. Brian Hooker over the last 10 months regarding studies the CDC has carried out regarding vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes including autism spectrum disorders. I share his belief that CDC decision-making and analyses should be transparent.\u201d ( source ) he had to invoke whistleblower protection and turned extensive agency files over to Congress. He said that, for the past decade, his superiors have pressured him and his fellow scientists to lie and manipulate data to conceal a causal link between vaccines and brain injuries, including autism. Final Thoughts As you can see, scientific fraud is a big problem across the board, and this article has only provided a few examples. The problem is not just with GMOs and vaccines \u2014 it affects cosmetics, food, cleaning supplies, and so much more. How have so many products, which cause so much harm, been approved by the agencies that are tasked to protect us? There are so many books on this topic, but they don\u2019t get the attention they deserve, since the major mainstream media shareholders are identical to those of the entire health industry. Why would they bash their own products on their own national television networks? The power of corporate America has taken over almost every aspect of our lives. If you\u2019re wondering what we can do about it, well, I believe the first step is awareness. There is still a plethora of information that the general public is completely unaware of, but if we backtrack to a decade ago, information that used to be considered a conspiracy is now simply fact. A great example is the corporate takeover of science, as discussed in this article, but another one could be the Snowden Leaks on mass surveillance, or 9/11. Studies are now being published by physicists and engineers regarding that event. Awareness makes it harder for the elite to manipulate us. Once we become aware of something, we can stop it. For example, look at Genetically Modified Foods and the pesticides that go with them. As soon as the masses became aware of their dangers, they began to change their shopping habits. Now, most countries around the world have completely banned these foods. It\u2019s difficult to accept that there are unseen powers, motivated by their own greed and lust for power, that are doing us harm disguised as good. It is only when we become aware of how we are being harmed and change our shopping habits \u2014 hurting their bottom line \u2014 that they change their tactics. On the other hand, it\u2019s encouraging to know that once we do come together for a common goal, anything can be accomplished, and we actually do have the potential and power to change our world. \n

Resident tuition rate for first-time freshmen and new transfers from Colorado and Montana attending Black Hills State University. Resident tuition rate for high-achieving first-time freshmen and new transfers from Colorado attending SDSM&T. The rate applies to qualifying students with a minimum of a 27 ACT score and a 3.5 grade point average. \n\nAt the USD School of Law, the regents approved offering the equivalent of resident tuition rates to high-achieving law school students with a LSAT examination score of 155 or higher. \n\nAs approved, the new rates apply beginning with the 2018-19 academic year.

USD is the only public university in South Dakota authorized to deliver a bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice. It currently offers it in a face-to-face instructional format at the Vermillion campus and at University Center in Sioux Falls. \n\nUSD officials point to 281 online-only students taking criminal justice courses last year as evidence of demand for the fully online degree program. \n\nUSD also received approval to offer a new undergraduate certificate in healthcare analytics, focused on the systematic use of data to improve quality of healthcare delivery and to reduce costs. The 12 credit-hour certificate is aimed at health sciences majors who want to enhance their credentials with specialized knowledge in analytical methods. \n\nCertificate programs usually require fewer credit hours to complete than a minor.
