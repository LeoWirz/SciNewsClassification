If no one wants to come here then restricting numbers won't matter or make any difference, right?\nSo what are you complaining about?\nOh by the way, if the UK is such a dump why have Facebook, Google and Amazon chosen to go ahead with expansion plans in London?\nNicola Mendelsohn, vice-president of Facebook's European operations, said: \"Today's announcements show that Facebook is more committed than ever to the UK and in supporting the growth of the country's innovative startups.\n\"The UK's flourishing entrepreneurial ecosystem and international reputation for engineering excellence makes it one of the best places in the world to build a tech company. And we've built our company here - this country has been a huge part of Facebook's story over the past decade, and I look forward to continuing our work.\"\nFacebook's bet on London comes after Amazon opened a new HQ in the capital this summer, where it said it would double the number of R'n'D staff to 900.

SUPERSEAL STADIUM - HAMILTON . Hamilton's David Templeton is awarded the Ladbrokes Premiership Player of the Month award for November, with manager Martin Canning winning the manager's award. 0 comments \nHamilton boss Martin Canning today hailed the impact of the recovering David Templeton - but knows the Accies will have done their job if the winger moves on to bigger things. \nCanning and Templeton won the Ladbrokes Premiership manager and player of the month awards as the Accies illuminated November with a string of impressive performances which included a league win over Rangers at Ibrox for the first time since 1926. \nThe tentative resurgence of injury-plagued Templeton has been a heart-warming tale with the 28-year-old scoring in that win over his former club Rangers and and getting on the scoresheet as Accies managed a draw with Aberdeen . \nWhile his comeback is being ushered in with a degree of caution due to the demoralising injury set-backs he has suffered in recent years, Canning is simply delighted that Hamilton\u2019s willingness to take a chance on the fleet-footed winger is reaping some rewards. \nHopefully, it\u2019s onwards and upwards for both Hamilton and Templeton and Canning is well aware that sustained performances could have potential suitors sniffing around the Superseal Stadium again. \nHe said: \u201cHe\u2019d been at a few places and there weren\u2019t many willing to take a chance and he\u2019s now producing the form we believed he could if we could get him up to speed. \n\u201cHe can be the difference in games and he\u2019s now completed 90 minutes back-to-back and that\u2019s the first time he\u2019s done that for us. \n\u201cDavid will get better the more he plays. He\u2019s getting his fitness up and his sharpness is getting better but there\u2019s more to come and that\u2019s good for us. When Tony Andreu started banging in goals we found it difficult to hold on to him and that\u2019s the same with any player who is shining. \n\u201cEvery club in this league would expect a player to move on if that is the case but that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t try to keep him here. \n\u201cThat is going to be our first priority to keep him here as long as we can but that will be down to the powers that be and Temps to have a chat and see if we can keep him. \n\u201cHe definitely adds to us but if he continues to do well and others are interested then that\u2019s part of the game. His deal is up in the summer so we\u2019ll see how that one goes but it goes without saying we want to keep him. \n\"You might be a player on a downturn or someone who\u2019s not doing as well as you\u2019d like to be. But you know you\u2019ve got the talent and we give people the chance to go back to where they were and allow them to showcase themselves and move on again. Whether it\u2019s young guys coming through the system or guys who haven\u2019t had the luck in their favour, we\u2019re able to give them that break.That\u2019s part of our recruitment process.\u201d \nHamilton will look to build on their recent form against St Johnstone this weekend. \n\u201cPeople talk about the curse of the monthly manager award but I don\u2019t expect that to be the case,\u201d said Canning, who is well aware of the tradition that usually sees the manager of the month lose his first game after getting the award. \n\u201cIbrox was the highlight of the month. It was such a big thing to win there. It was a special moment but thankfully the boys have kicked on. The important thing was that it wasn\u2019t followed by poor performances and that hasn\u2019t happened.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "templeton", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "nick rodger golf", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "hamilton", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "david templeton", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "martin canning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony andreu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ibrox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st johnstone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "templeton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ladbrokes premiership", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rangers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:43.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ab5e58ac294bc521b8a1c6546d51b62348d0d139", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSzXGjJekgbLjttUnYupKS7sd570tS.YYuw5Q6owk1z6dpQsRgcg8SpLW3DrYH4JKw-", "site_full": "forum-en.msi.com", "site": "msi.com", "site_section": "https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?board=168.0", "site_categories": ["computer_reviews", "tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Technical Discussions (MSI Notebook Technical Assistance ONLY!)", "title": "Keeping the Laptop Clean?", "title_full": "Keeping the Laptop Clean?", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4043, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ab5e58ac294bc521b8a1c6546d51b62348d0d139", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSzXGjJekgbLjttUnYupKS7sd570tS.YYuw5Q6owk1z6dpQsRgcg8SpLW3DrYH4JKw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "OrionMagnus", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Keeping the Laptop Clean?", "text": "I just got the MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US 15.6\" and I love the laptop so far, but I just have a question.

But its a disappointment when held up in comparison with albums like \u2018The Suburbs\u2019 and \u2018Neon Bible\u2019.

With this very popular trend, these procedures are being done everywhere, and all kind of people are willing to do them. While the procedures are pretty common, they aren\u2019t without risks. This article will discuss some of the pros and cons of plastic surgery, and questions to ask when trying to find a reputable plastic surgeon.\nBefore you have a procedure done, make sure you thoroughly look into the said procedure. Many people are excited, and they rush into certain procedures. Their basic research fuels their desires. They forget to make sure that they respect the importance of such a decision, by not thoroughly research the opportunity.\n\nAnyone considering cosmetic surgery of any type should be sure to conduct sufficient research. To find the most skilled doctors in their area. By asking the right questions about experience levels and educational background, it is possible to ensure that you have selected the best possible professional for your specific needs, and concerns.\nYou should ask your surgeon what would happen if you were not satisfied with the results. If something went wrong during the procedure. Your surgeon should be honest with you. Let you know that you can file a claim for malpractice. If your surgeon is not honest on this topic, you should go to another clinic.\n\nIf you are considering having cosmetic surgery, you should look at any alternatives before going under the knife. Sometimes, you may find something else that is less expensive and just as effective. Often times topical creams, dermatological laser treatments, or other at-home methods work just as well as surgical procedures.\nBefore you have a procedure done, make sure you thoroughly look into the said procedure. Many people are excited, and they rush into certain procedures. Their basic research fuels their desires. They forget to make sure that they respect the importance of such a decision, by not thoroughly research the opportunity.\nTo ensure you get a good surgeon, ask where your surgeon has hospital privileges. Many surgeons practice from outpatient clinics instead of hospitals. Hospital privileges can still help potential patients determine the surgeon\u2019s credentials. Hospitals will do background checks against the surgeon\u2019s certifications, and malpractice history. Surgeons without hospital privileges need to have a good explanation for this lack.\nYou should go to a different cosmetic surgeon to compare different prices and solutions. Do find more information to make sure all the surgeons you go to are trustworthy. Comparing different surgeons is the best way to find the best prices and get a better idea of who is honest with you.\nFollow all of your surgeon\u2019s orders after you surgery. The last thing you need is for something to go wrong, because you neglected to follow your surgeon\u2019s orders. This is where a lot of people fail, and mess up their surgery, by not following the rules. All it\u2019s going to take is a little patience, and it can change you for life.\nWhat questions should you ask? You need to get a lot of answers before you decide to have surgery. It\u2019s extremely important to ensure any potential surgeon is board certified. Also, request pictures of their previous patients. Talk to the surgeon about how the procedure works, what recovery is like and any medications you may need to take.\nTalk to your doctor about complications and risks. Make sure you understand everyone. It can be easy to be so excited that you do not consider risks or complications to your plastic surgery, but you have to know that they exist. Listen to your doctor and determine how you can avoid both.\nFind a surgeon you trust. One of the most essential elements of any successful cosmetic surgery procedure is a good surgeon. Make sure you get a chance to really talk with the doctor, before you commit to any surgery. Check online review sites, even talk with former patients if you can.\nWhen people consider having plastic surgery done, they should be aware of what else is going on. If they are experiencing stress from any life changing events, they should reconsider having the surgery at that time. If they finally find that they have found a peaceful point in their life and still want the procedure, then they can work towards having it done.\nPlastic surgery is not to be used to treat depression, or any other mental health disorders. You may get a boost of self-esteem, but if you had an underlying problem with depression, this is not going to heal that. Source Webpage of a professional before, and after you have the procedure done. You\u2019ll be able to deal with the changes in a positive manner.\nPlan so that your life is not overly demanding for the two weeks immediately after your surgery. When you consider plastic surgery, it is not as simple as taking a day off, and then going right back to work. Factor in recovery time. Also as having someone available to help you if, you need assistance for a few days.\nPrior to your plastic surgery procedure, there are many things you can do make your recovery process easier. Fill up the car with gas, water your plants, clean the house, do your grocery shopping, wash your laundry. Also, have plenty of easy-to-prepare meals, and snacks on hand. Taking care of all of these things in the days preceding your surgery, can make your recovery a whole lot more comfortable.\nMake sure your surgeon is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. Any doctor who has received their M.D. can legally perform plastic surgery. Unfortunately, cosmetic and reconstructive surgery is a very small portion of a general medicine degree. Board certified surgeons are doctors who have completed a residency in plastic surgery. They have passed several examinations to prove proficiency.\nStart making the changes to change yourself for the better. Cosmetic surgery is continuing to advance, and you too can reap the benefits. Make sure that you capitalize on all that you have around you, so that you can just be truly happy with yourself for the rest of your life.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "american board of plastic surgery", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:45.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d36028cfed3886a02f445754b10482a30360bb13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED8ul_93cQ73rYhzlzy_b7b7vVUSa5E.3_Ao5OnVPZPAJDgREbjXBgLi2FfMbR_KJZosKI233m3qNSKSKwIjI1mAtJu04cF_WP7nbzjxn.qxJV7CtTdAkeQszct.RRkJp_QF3I6KYvwnY7I1yBjW07Nd", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/business/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Business links", "title": "(9829267) Does corporate America really need a tax cut?

CONTINUED \nMY NOTE:  \nLast April, after this man's conviction, my daughter, Dana Rohr, decided to stand up for this man. \nFor awhile, she stood alone. \nI don't know what initially prompted her to stand up for him. She hardly knew him. And what's more, Dana had already moved on to a new life in the states. \nYet, she put that life on hold, came back to Guam, and took risks speaking up for him in the media and drawing attention to his case. \nAdditionally, she started a blog which led to over a thousand signatures of support for Quinton's case to be appealed and raised thousands of dollars. \nAfter reviewing pages of evidence, I became convinced that Quinton was wrongly accused and wrongly convicted. And I decided to support Dana in her effort. \nThere is no doubt that it was in large part through Dana's efforts when no one else stood up for him, that Quinton has not yet been imprisoned and is free to return to his home in Ohio for the holidays.\n\nIn the weeks that I worked with Dana on Quinton's case, I came to know Quinton, and I believe he can be counted on to serve his time if that's what it ultimately comes to. \n\nSailor has 952 supporters in campaign for retrial Another fight for justice \nThe fact is that Quinton (and he responsibly acknowledges this) engaged in dangerous behavior. And while I am convinced that he did NOT commit the crime he has been convicted of, he now understands the price of \"a good time\" - a price I myself learned many years ago, but that my now deceased brother had to pay for - albeit a decade later.\n\nBut also, Quinton just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time in our current cultural history: a time which marks a man guilty because he is a man...and the \"woman\" was the \"husband\" of another woman.  \nI'll save the lecture for another time. I just wanted to say I am proud of my daughter, Dana Rohr, for standing up despite the cost, and when no one else would. \n\nI like to think, that in some small way - or at least in this regard, she takes after her old man. \nEnjoy your Christmas, Quinton Bezon.

If bank open at 10 am, he is coming at 10.30am and then he will speak to his collegeue after that he will enter into counter service and he will collect the form then he will give the cash, what he think about the customers we are standing for such long time he coolly coming at 10.30 am and then he start to collect the cheque or form in 10.50 am and then he will shout us like slaves so we have to be keep calm to collect our cash. This way you stasifiy the customers wish.

Contest Runs Now through November 3 and 4, 2018; online nominations accepted through August 31, 2018. \nUSA \u2013 6 Dec, 2017 \u2013 A Global Leader in Bodybuilding and Fitness Contests, The World Fitness Federation (WFF) and Female Fitness Legend Lauren Powers (INSTAGRAM @officiallaurenpowers ) has teamed up with the online supplement marketing group RIPPEDIENCE (INSTAGRAM @rippedience ) to promote the first ever posing and influence ability contest online. The contest allows NPC, IFBB, and even first time competitors who have never stepped on stage to compete in a no politics competition for what is being labeled the first ever \u201ctrue World\u2019s Championship\u201d in the Fitness industry. This contest is not about being the most muscular. Judging will be according to the full package and not about carrying development or definition to an extreme; emphasis is on retaining a \u201cfit look\u201d and low body fat levels, overall symmetry and an overall well shaped look for both males and females. The online community will get to vote on their favorite competitor\u2019s look as well as their creativity, charisma, marketability, image quality and overall influence ability. The entire online community gets to vote on all their favorites without limitation, except those limits imposed by Instagram likes and comments of course. \nWinners will be announced monthly until the final in November 2018.This is more than just a contest it is also a scouting event for Supplement manufacturers to find the next face of their supplement product and to find between 10 and 100 people to represent the USA in the World\u2019s Fitness Championship. The online community drives a large portion of the voting at 40% giving the online public a large amount of power in selecting what they feel \u201cfitness\u201d should look like for both men and women. The overall winner may be driving away in a Bentley GT Coupe. \u201cA prize that no other bodybuilding or fitness show has given away to date. Usually you only walk away with a trophy if you\u2019re lucky and maybe some free supplements, but in this contest it will be no politics, a chance to drive away in a Bentley, exposure to be scouted by supplement companies for a potential modeling contract, and an opportunity to represent the good old US of A against other countries in a fitness show. Every contestant that competes is a winner by gaining added exposure to build up your follower base on Instagram.\u201d Says Lauren Powers. \nRIPPEDIENCE wants to help those who spend their time living a healthy lifestyle and motivating others to do the same. Now through August 31, 2018, visitors to RIPPEDIENCE\u2019s online website and Instagram community (@RIPPEDIENCE and @RIPPEDEVENTS ) can nominate their favorite contestant by liking their Instagram post @RIPPEDEVENTS and posting meaningful comments. Every like and comment helps advance a contestant forward. \nAll Entries will be sorted into the following four (4) categories based on each contestant\u2019s gender; age is not a limiting or contributing factor. You can be 18 or 80, go ahead and show off your stuff. \nWOMEN & MEN ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":
