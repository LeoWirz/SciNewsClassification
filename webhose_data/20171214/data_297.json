An aerial image of the oak tree at the Scout Association\u2019s Gilwell Park in Chingford (Woodland Trust/PA) \nFirst founded in 1907, the Scouts grew into the biggest co-educational youth movement in the country, now boasting more than 400,000 members. \nBeccy Speight, Woodland Trust chief executive, said: \u201cOur competition aims to highlight and celebrate our country\u2019s remarkable trees, and to ultimately ensure they are given the recognition and protection they deserve. \n\u201cThe passion shown by the people who nominated trees, and the way the public get behind them in the voting process shows how much of an inspiration trees are to people.\u201d \nGilwell Oak will also receive a \u00a31,000 tree care award as part of its prize. \nWinners of the title in other parts of the UK were the Erskine House Tree in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the Big Tree is Kirkwall, Scotland, and The Hollow Tree in Gnoll Country Park, Wales. \nVoting for the European Tree of the Year will open in February 2018, the Woodland Trust said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gilwell oak", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "beccy speight", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert bayden powell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grylls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dick turpin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gilwell oak", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "woodland trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollow tree", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "essex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scout association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament oak", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woodland trust/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woodland trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirkwall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gnoll country park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belfast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nottinghamshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chingford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilwell park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:32.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c9e77b9df804c9582b800cec9cdc6225cfeabc00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOo8phhHQimYknNB3g0NfE7aAdq9HQgnqX.SEpZPEAfX7cA.CpQ12PddUtfGw0LR0.mZFzjvAPCSxtrYTAQ1tVqhMyKU7.hVgQ1kM4UtMmB66A--", "site_full": "straightrazorplace.com", "site": "straightrazorplace.com", "site_section": "http://straightrazorplace.com/", "site_categories": ["mens_health", "health"], "section_title": "Straight Razor Place - Welcome", "title": "Hello from July10newbie", "title_full": "Hello from July10newbie", "published": "2017-12-03T09:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c9e77b9df804c9582b800cec9cdc6225cfeabc00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOo8phhHQimYknNB3g0NfE7aAdq9HQgnqX.SEpZPEAfX7cA.CpQ12PddUtfGw0LR0.mZFzjvAPCSxtrYTAQ1tVqhMyKU7.hVgQ1kM4UtMmB66A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "july10newbie", "published": "2017-12-03T09:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hello from July10newbie", "text": "Hello,\nI found this site back in July 2010 and registered.

Sounds like you are off to a great start!!\nRegarding the Ad... Not a lot of positive to be found, in general, about Gold Dollars as they often require extra work to get them shaving right and for a NIB Razor that is a margin call for most. However, the Ad does list \"Professionally Honed and Sharpened\" as well as \"Shave Ready Razor\"... Also, the razor in the picture at least appears to have work done at the heel and toe which is consistent with what you often have to do in order to get a Gold Dollar shave ready. I can't vouch for the quality of the work as the only true test is a Shave Test... But, if I had to guess for $50, I'd say the one in the picture has been worked properly. Buyer beware, though.\nBest of luck...

Capsules tend to be seasonal, and this article focuses on a fall/winter shoe capsule, but the same principles would apply for any season. \nLet\u2019s get started! Step 1: understand the basic categories of footwear \nBuilding a shoe capsule wardrobe is fairly straightforward. First, understand the basic categories of footwear and determine which represent how you dress. As you build out your shoe capsule, you\u2019ll ignore categories that don\u2019t correspond to your lifestyle. \nProfessional. These are shoes for work, whether you\u2019re a lawyer who needs a collection of pumps or a police officer who depends on heavy-duty loafers. \nCasual. Between businesswear and beachwear lies your casual wardrobe. Beyond that, you define what casual means to you \u2014 and select your casual shoes accordingly. \nLeisure. Capri leggings with a tunic-length hoodie, anyone? Not to be confused with casual, leisure clothing delivers maximum comfort \u2014 but not at the expense of head-to- toe style. \nDressy. These are the shoes that add sparkle to your wardrobe, sometimes literally! They make appearances for special occasions, such as a romantic anniversary dinner or holiday party. \nSpecial purpose. This \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d category includes all footwear that meets specific, non-fashion needs. We\u2019re talking fitness shoes, gardening boots, house slippers, and the like. Throw in a couple pairs of flip-flops here if you must. Don\u2019t count these in your shoe total. \nVionic wedge \u2013 Clark mary jane heels \u2013 Aerosoles ankle booties \u2013 Oxford heels \u2013 Aerosoles Lace-up oxfords \u2013 Aerosoles Classic pumps \u2013 Aerosoles stacked-heel boots Step 2: Establish a shoe capsule framework \nOnce you identify the categories of shoes you wear, it\u2019s time to determine how many pairs to include in each. Remember, this is a capsule wardrobe, so the goal is to pare down and simplify. Aim for 10 pairs total. \nYou want your final shoe capsule to correspond, proportionately, to how you dress. Do you spend most of any given week in professional attire? If so, you\u2019ll typically want professional shoes to comprise half of your shoe capsule, or 5 pairs. \nDivide the remaining 5 pairs among the remaining categories as you find appropriate \u2014 for example: 3 casual, 1 leisure, and 1 dressy. So: 5 + 3 + 1 +1 = 10 total. \nThe formula is a starting point; it won\u2019t work for everyone. For example, if you really only need a few pairs of work shoes and love to express your style through fun weekend wear, then by all means go for a mix that emphasizes casual options. \nAnd, even if you sport athleisure attire 90 percent of the time, you might not want 9 out of 10 pairs of your shoes to be leisure shoes. \nLifestride calf boots \u2013 Aerosoles penny loafer \u2013 Soda fringed bootie \u2013 Ninewest oxford \u2013 Lifestride slip-on flats \u2013 Vionic trim bootie Step 3: Make your shoe selections \nNow, the fun part! Select the shoes that will fill out each category, considering the following tips as you go. Remember, capsule wardrobe pieces need not be plain! Whether clothing or shoes, if you acquire highly versatile pieces you love, mixing and matching will come easily. \nThe images that accompany this article provide suggestions by category. Aim for a variety of styles that meet your practical needs and your style preferences (not just one or the other). Those are the shoes that will go the extra mile in a shoe capsule wardrobe. Select some shoes that work in more than one category, such as classic pumps or loafers that could double as professional and casual wear. Think about wearing a pair of sneakers with a skirt, or a pair of dressy pumps with jeans and a blouse. Emphasize solid, neutral colors that complement your capsule wardrobe \u2014 black, gray, navy, brown, tan \u2014 but be sure to include a few bold colors, classic prints (such as leopard or polka dots), and metallics that reflect your style, as long as they can be worn in versatile ways. While you might be able to get away with a few pairs of uncomfortable shoes in a typical shoe wardrobe, such is not the case with the shoe capsule, where every pair should be a workhorse. Avoid pointy-toed styles, heel heights outside your comfort zone, and the temptation to buy that pair on sale that doesn\u2019t quite fit. \nLifestride trappy heels \u2013 Cole Haan classic pumps \u2013 Aerosoles sequined flats \u2013 Loft ankle-strap block heels \nOne last thing \nUse this shoe capsule exercise to identify areas to expand your style horizons. If your shoe wardrobe is primarily sneakers and slip-ons, that could be a signal to branch out. \nGive yourself a nudge toward a cute-but- practical pair of Mary Jane flats or even a low wedge heel! And although practicality is a must for many of us, keep in mind that shoes can be a way to have some style fun even if you\u2019re fashionably conservative above the ankles. \nIs the shoe capsule wardrobe for everyone? Absolutely not! In fact, for many women, a minimalist collection of shoes is downright unimaginable. But if you\u2019ve already embraced the capsule wardrobe concept, a shoe capsule could be the next logical step. \nDo you like the idea of a shoe capsule wardrobe?

You're going to have to learn English, wake up early, turn off the TV and study. \n\"I want to shake you up and tell, you a real harsh truth: The world doesn't need you,\" he says. \"The only way you're going to become rich and powerful is if you stand up on your hind legs. You're only going to get the respect you demand.\" \nSimmons, the co-founder and bassist for the rock band Kiss, is brutal in his advice: Women, choose between a career or a family. Guys, get rid of your worthless friends. Above all, don't listen to the self-esteem movement or be politically correct. Simmons is here to demand that you drop and give him 20. \n\"I want to be your drill sergeant and piss you off so that you wake up and smell the coffee and go out there and become that rich and powerful person you deserve to be,\" he says. \"You cannot fail in America.\" \nWhy should you listen to this guy, someone who has spent much of his adult life slathered in scary makeup, in towering platform boots, wagging his tongue onstage and singing songs like \"Lick It Up\"? \nBecause he's also an entrepreneur who came to America with no money and no English. He's become, he says, a millionaire with a hand in a restaurant franchise, a wealth management services firm and a magazine, among others. \"You don't have enough hours in the day to understand what I do,\" he says. \nNow Simmons is ready to reveal the principles he's learned in his book, \"On Power,\" part guidebook, part self-help manual, with several profiles of people we should admire, like Oprah Winfrey and Warren Buffett. It's a small book, and that's on purpose. \"You can take it to the pooper with you,\" he explains. \nJessica Sindler, his editor, called working with Simmons \"without a doubt a memorable experience\" and that all the concepts in the book came from him. \"They're based on the way he lives his life and runs his career. He is very much a man who practices what he preaches.\" \nIn person, Simmons is a jokester and a wordsmith who clearly loves attention. He wags his impressive tongue to whoever asks and glad-hands strangers like a politician. He likes to wear a ball cap decorated with a picture of a sack of money that he's trademarked. He puns outrageously (\"Close but no guitar,\" he says at one point. \"See what I did there?\"). \nSimmons cheerfully poses for selfies, interrupts conversations and likes to take candid photos of people he encounters who are lost in their phones. \"Every once in a while, look up,\" he told one startled bystander. Sometimes, he goes too far, as he did recently during a visit to Fox News Channel. He was allegedly crude, taunted staffers and exposed his chest, triggering a network ban. \nSimmons has become legendary for leveraging Kiss's distinctive look and winking cool into everything from reality TV shows to action figures, colognes, keychains, cabernet sauvignon and even a coffin \u2014 the Kiss Kasket. \nSimmons is a curious mix of things. He's a hawk on foreign policy, no fan of unions or socialism, but a liberal when it comes to social issues. \"You want to get married to a rock? Or change your sex? Go to Mars and become a Martian religious fanatic? I really don't care,\" he says. \nHe has boasted of his sexual conquests but is a long-married teetotaler who has no patience for illegal drug users. He can quote Kierkegaard and Kant and speaks four languages, but blames the recent global financial meltdown on greedy borrowers. \nHe believes we're still basically hunter-gatherers, with men awash with testosterone and only vaguely civilized. He applauds the wave of women these days calling out men for sexual misconduct. \n\"There will always be bad guys, don't kid yourself. The best thing that's happening now is the female of the species is standing up collectively and saying, 'That's enough.' Good for women. That should always have been the case.\" \nHis advice to gaining wealth is simple: Start a limited liability partnership in your home, use social media and deduct your costs from taxes. You can keep your old job until the rewards flow in. If they don't? You can declare bankruptcy and \"then you can start again.\" (It's advice not all financial advisers endorse.) \nHaving a brilliant idea for a business is fine, but outhustling is more important to Simmons. \"It doesn't have to be new or original. It can be a stupid idea,\" he says. \"Some of the dumbest people have become enormously successful.\" About Us", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gene simmons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jessica sindler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kasket", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kierkegaard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oprah winfrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simmons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kant", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fox news channel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:33.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c9e77b9df804c9582b800cec9cdc6225cfeabc00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOo8phhHQimYknNB3g0NfE7aAdq9HQgnqX.SEpZPEAfX7cA.CpQ12PddUtfGw0LR0.mZFzjvAPCSxtrYTAQ1tVqhMyKU7.hVgQ1kM4UtMmB66A--", "site_full": "straightrazorplace.com", "site": "straightrazorplace.com", "site_section": "http://straightrazorplace.com/", "site_categories": ["mens_health", "health"], "section_title": "Straight Razor Place - Welcome", "title": "Hello from July10newbie", "title_full": "Hello from July10newbie", "published": "2017-12-03T09:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ade5936a26f96bce4c9b49c7f853be5642e491c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOo8phhHQimYknNB3g0NfE7aAdq9HQgnqX.SEpZPEAfX7cA.CpQ12PddUtfGw0LR0.mZFzjvAPCSxtrYTAQ1tVqhMyKU7.hVgQ2fXkmqdLsExRG4fFd.5D7T", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "gasman", "published": "2017-12-03T20:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I cant comment about the item you posted but i will say, welcome back to SRP.

The kit I provided in the link is about $50 and includes the razor, strop. soap, and brush ( I already own a badger hair brush). I just looked through the classifieds and it will probably cost $150 or more to get all of the above. Just as I did with the $10 insertable blade straight razor, I wanted to go in cheaply and then eventually ramp up to get something of higher and lasting quality. I'm willing to spend $50 for now on the kit in the link but only if it will really do what I want in terms of shave quality.\nDo you have any further advice?

So if you want to do something like medicine I guess work experience in a hospital, GP surgery, shadowing a doctor would be your best bet. If you know someone who is an engineer, doctor contact them.\nIt is quite hard I think to find work experience these days as employers want experience experience but don't realise students have to start somewhere..\nMaybe browse all the different courses in the universities in Italy or talk to your tutor in high school if you have one about how you are feeling about career wise? I'm sure someone can help :)\nSo in the uk, secondary education( high school) is from 11-16 yrs old and we pick range of subjects- some compulsory some optional. e.g I had to do English language and literature, Maths, science (for 2 years that included Biology, Physics and Chem). Then I had to do French and I got to chose German, Drama, History, Art and had to do RE. This is known as *GCSE's*\nAfter gcse, you have the option to do Further education . This can be A-levels, Btec's or other qualifications. (16-18yrs roughly)\nIn order to go to uni, Further education (A-levels, Btec's , other qualifications) is a MUST.\nI did A-levels that lasts for 2 years in Maths, Biology, Psychology and did French for the first year and dropped it in 2nd year.\nI guess you can say A-levels is where you pick subjects where you are more interested in and where some people pick certain subjects because those subjects are needed for a particular course at university- I think you are kind of at this stage but I know the system is different in Italy.\nE.g a person who KNOWS who wants to do medicine at uni has to pick Chemistry and another science or even sometimes 3 sciences.\nObviously not everyone knows what they want to do at uni so it is good to keep your options open:) but do bear in mind for example if you wanted to do engineering at uni, you can't end up doing Art at A-level. Despite that in uk unis they do have a foundation course for people who don't even have maths or sciences at A-level and want to pursue engineering as a career. This may be different in Italy.\nSorry for the long message!

He will be presented with the award on Thursday at the Home Depot College Football Awards show in Atlanta, which will air live on ESPN at 6 p.m. (Central). Frost was selected as the winner after leading Central Florida to a 12-0 record and an American Athletic Conference championship as the only undefeated FBS team in 2017. He accepted the Nebraska coaching job on Dec. 2, but will coach the 10th-ranked Knights in the Peach Bowl on Jan. 1 against No. 7 Auburn. In its 24-year history, the 42-year old Frost is the fourth-youngest coach to win the Home Depot Coach of the Year Award. Frost is also one of five coaches to earn the honor in either their first or second year as a collegiate head coach, a group that includes Nebraska\u2019s Frank Solich, the 1999 winner. Frost compiled an 18-7 record in two seasons at UCF after inheriting an 0-12 team. According to ESPN, UCF is the only team in FBS history to go from a winless regular season to an undefeated one in a span of just two seasons. In 2017, UCF matched its highest win total in program history while posting the first perfect regular season in the history of the American Athletic Conference. The Knights also achieved the highest in-season ranking in program history (No. 10) and established a school record with a 12-game winning streak. UCF won its 12 games by an average of more than 24 points per game and picked up three victories over teams currently ranked in the AP poll. With Frost calling the plays, UCF boasted one of the nation\u2019s top offenses, as the Knights led the country in scoring (49.4 points per game) and ranked fifth in total offense (540.4 yards per game). Sophomore quarterback McKenzie Milton was honored as the 2017 American Athletic Conference Player of the Year, while a league-record 16 Knights earned All-AAC accolades. \nThe Home Depot Coach of the Year award is the latest in a slew of coaching honors for Frost, the unanimous winner of the 2017 American Athletic Conference Coach of the Year. He is also a 2017 Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year Finalist and was the Region 1 American Football Coaches Association Coach of the Year. Frost is also a semifinalist for the George Munger Award for the second straight season. He joins Alabama\u2019s Nick Saban and Wisconsin\u2019s Paul Chryst as the only two coaches to be a semifinalist for the Munger Award in both 2016 and 2017.

Thu, 12/07/2017 - 10:23 Writer: DataLEADS NEW DELHI (DataLEADS/ANN) - The UN's peacekeeping force is dominated by troops from Asian countries, with India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal currently contributing the largest number of peacekeepers.\nThe United Nations does not have an army but it has peacekeepers for sustaining peace in conflict ridden areas. If the peacekeeping force was ranked against the national militaries it would be the 44th largest army in the world. There are a total of over 100,000 UN peacekeeping personal - consisting of 91,132 troops, 13,563 police and 1,811 military experts from 123 countries. However the peacekeeping army is dominated by the South Asian troops which have traditionally been the top providers.\nIn Asia, it is India that contributes the most number of troops with 7,471 personnel stationed worldwide. India has participated in the most peacekeeping missions than any other country.\nPakistan is the second highest contributor in Asia with 7,161 troops in the UN missions. It was the first country to respond to crisis in Somalia and sent 500 troops to Somalia in 1992. Bangladesh is the third highest troop contributor to the UN. The country has served in 58 peacekeeping missions across 40 countries since 1988. Nepal has contributed to 11 peace peacekeeping missions most of which are in Africa.\nIndonesia first contributed troops in the 1950s and after a sustained absence has been once again actively contributing to the UN peace keeping missions.\nChina\u2019s troop contribution has increased over the last many years and it is the 12th largest provider of troops in the world and sixth highest in Asia. Mongolia contributes 950 troops for UN peacekeeping mission.\nMalaysia, South Korea and Cambodia individually contribute less than one thousand troops.\nJapan\u2019s contribution to peacekeeping has diminished over a period of time. It contributes a handful of personnel for UN missions.\nCompared to its neighbours Sri Lanka remains an outlier in terms of troop contribution to the UN. Bhutan, Australia, Brunei, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar together contribute just hundred and forty personnel to the peace keeping missions of the UN.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ElevenMyanmar"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "myanmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhutan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambodia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sri lanka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "somalia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brunei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mongolia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vietnam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nepal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:34.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a42bd46f7e3b1a22297c3b6d89521b74518f315b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ETi7dItQ.zHsf.X.QAUk3y9peCcUagkXEqEA.rrg6RKX2vNHNz3OQ0gNhdkXk2G43lex0FAvFpTlFGaXWMwwsUoYJtSLsJY5dwIl_OjUqf3rayqHycemZkPfGpkPVZl4-", "site_full": "www.mycomfor.com", "site": "mycomfor.com", "site_section": "http://www.mycomfor.com/Feeds/Artikel", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "mycomfor Artikel", "title": "Cricket - 3rd Test: Sri Lanka salvage draw;

For troops to know what their regiment\u2019s colours looked like, these were displayed regularly. \nThis was done by marching the colours along the lines of troops in slow time with the aim to impress it upon the soldiers\u2019 memories. \nThe Presidential Colour was presented to the Armed Forces by the President in 2014. It symbolises the Armed Forces' loyalty and devotion to the head of state and the people of Malta. \nThe National Festivities Committee is also organising a programme of band marches in Valletta. \nOn Tuesday, Birkirkara's Duke of Connaught\u2019s Own Band will play a band march, starting from Freedom Square at 6pm. On Wednesday, the So\u010bjet\u00e0 Filarmonika La Valette (Valletta) will perform another band march starting from Freedom Square at 4.30pm. \u00ab The life and times of Karl Marx Christmas festivities in Rabat \u00bb Advert \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.

Photo: Shutterstock \nIt is Christmas time, research slows down, markets are calmer and trading volumes decrease at a rate inversely proportional to the rate of consumption of alcohol. At least that is how it is supposed to work. \nWhat is plainly clear is that from now till the end of the year it gets increasingly difficult to gather information and generate ideas that are of much interest to the regular reader. The year is nearly over and hopefully whatever had to happen has already happened. Investment decisions have been made and barring any unfortunate turn of events, accumulated profits should last onto the New Year. \nSo, faced with a blank screen and since we are now living in the age of billionaires, I thought it would be interesting to present a list of the wealthiest fund managers in 2017. The following list does not include the wealthiest people in the world but only those that have made money through investments. The following information is sourced from Forbes. \nGeorge Soros is the world\u2019s richest hedge fund billionaire with an estimated net worth of $25.2 billion. The legendary hedge fund manager recently hired Dawn Fitzpatrick, one of Wall Street's most prominent women, to run his investment portfolio as chief investment officer of $30 billion Soros Fund Management which oversees Soros\u2019 personal fortune as well as assets belonging to his foundation. \nJames Simons, the quantitative trading genius behind Renaissance Technologies, retired from his hedge fund firm in 2010, but he still plays a role at Renaissance and continues to benefit from its strong performance. With quantitative trading a rare area of strength in the hedge fund world in recent years, investors have been rushing into Renaissance and the firm now manages some $36 billion. Simons\u2019 estimated net worth has reached $18 billion. \nRay Dalio is the founder of the world's biggest hedge fund firm, Bridgewater Associates, which manages $160 billion. Dalio\u2019s All Weather fund seeks to perform well in good markets and bad. Dalio has an estimated net worth of $16.8 billion. \nSteve Cohen is one of the most successful hedge fund managers ever and has a net worth of $13 billion. He now presides over his family office, Point 72 Asset Management. It was formerly a hedge fund firm, SAC Capital, which was forced to return outside money in the wake of an insider-trading scandal that cost Cohen $1.8 billion in penalties. Cohen is now preparing for January 2018, when a two-year ban on managing non-family money expires. \nDavid Tepper has been steadily returning money to client investors of his Appaloosa Management. The hedge fund firm now manages some $17 billion. Its funds posted returns in the middle single digits in 2016. With a net worth of $11 billion, Tepper, a former Goldman Sachs trader, is now based in Miami Beach instead of northern New Jersey. \nKen Griffin's Chicago-based hedge fund firm manages $26 billion. His estimated net worth is $8 billion. \nJohn Paulson remains one of the hedge fund world\u2019s richest billionaires, though a lot less rich than he used to be. Paulson saw his net worth drop by nearly $2 billion in 2016 to $7.9 billion. Paulson is famed for betting against subprime mortgages at the peak of the 2007 credit bubble and making billions. Since then, he has suffered several wrong way trades, including bets on a Greek recovery and the island of Puerto Rico. \nDisclaimer: This article was issued by Antoine Briffa, Investment Manager at Calamatta Cuschieri.

Published by Struik, 2017. \n\n\nNot only is this the perfect pocketbook for the legions of battlefiedl buffs who plan their trips around battlefields of Southern Africa, but it's written with such professional enthusiasm that it will surely draw new supporters to the fascinating stories of the sieges that accompanied wars over two centuries. \nThis guide is a companion volume to van der Heyde's Field Gjuide to the Battlefields of South Africa which proved a highly successful publication. This specialist guide presents detailed descriptions of 17 sieges that occurred during the Cape Frontier, Anglo-Zulu, Basotho and Anglo-Boer wars. \nSome are well-known to most South Africans - such as the sieges of Lydenburg, Mafeking, Kimberley and Ladysmith. Others less so - I didn't know that Durban had been besieged in 1842 nor had I read about those at Mount Moorosi in what was then Basutoland or the sieges of Fort Cox and Fort Armstrong in the Eastern Cape. \nAs public fascination with sieges continues, it's good to have a well-qualified historian who is also a woman in the male-dominated battlefield-guiding fraternity turn to writing on her subject. Not only does she present a very readable text, but includes personal stories of heroism and heartbreak that are part of every battle and siege. As the writer points out, with sieges civilians were freqently involved, and some of them kept diaries recording their hardships and personal experiences both tragic and humorous. \nThe pages are brought to even greater life by maps, timelines, many old and some new photographs that accompany human interest stories gleaned from diaries and letters and records of the time. \nThe detailed and professional index compiled by Emsie du Plessis adds considerably to the book's usefulness as a reference tool.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anglo-zulu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emsie du plessis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "overberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicki von der", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "struik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ladysmith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kimberley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fort cox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cape frontier", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "durban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern cape", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lydenburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mafeking", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort armstrong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount moorosi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:34.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f306097b04ceb847205c3defa48a4d18fbba575", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzuW0Up1GA78hY1rCz1aAuFGOtfAfBB.ZkEnvECvSkoRsLrVsKePcEqU7DoJp4JQwfWu3GE.aAk9sxxQrDddcjsf0dWHE56naxw.ircNJez4LhGrFYzgc_CJDXuERZpWZcf.oPX5DBykAfw9Vny3Di5XiTc5Gg.oI4xiwWrsZlFKQ--", "site_full": "forums.hardwarezone.com.sg", "site": "hardwarezone.com.sg", "site_section": "http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/cars-cars-204/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Cars &amp; Cars - www.hardwarezone.com.sg", "title": "Bought a second hand car in July, now gearbox got problem, does lemon law apply? 2", "title_full": "Bought a second hand car in July, now gearbox got problem, does lemon law apply? - Page 2 - www.hardwarezone.com.sg", "published": "2017-12-07T01:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/img/sg/hwz-og-logo-big.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5181, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ceb80f6c4364f0469d097e11bc4ae096df2121ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzuW0Up1GA78hY1rCz1aAuFGOtfAfBB.ZkEnvECvSkoRsLrVsKePcEqU7DoJp4JQwfWu3GE.aAk9sxxQrDddcjsf0dWHE56naxw.ircNJez4LhGrFYzgc_CJDXuERZpWZcf.oPX5DBykAfw9Vny3Di5XiTc5Gg.oI5ODzrmdjRFBok2Xp.fCusBgnPLl12fdv0-", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "trento", "published": "2017-12-07T10:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : Where this standard 6months thingy printed?

6, 2017 \n\nWhy do humans form groups? In nature the saying goes 'birds of a feather flock together.' Human groups seem to do the same, unfortunately Human groups tend to oppose each other. Each with a different philosophy or religion or creed. The Human groups that are successful are those groups with an agenda or mission statement that defines the group as a whole. This allows each 'individual' to act for the group and for the betterment of the group. The group that is in charge of the financial system and all its problems with corruption has the following Mission Statement: \n\n\"You have been taught to insidiously plant the seeds of jealousy and hatred between communities, provinces, states that were at peace, and incite them to deeds of blood, involving them in war with each other, and to create revolutions and civil wars in countries that were independent and prosperous, cultivating the arts and the sciences and enjoying the blessings of peace. To take sides with the combatants and to act secretly with your brother Jesuit, who might be engaged on the other side, but openly opposed to that with which you might be connected, only that the Church might be the gainer in the end, in the conditions fixed in the treaties for peace and that the end justifies the means.\" (exerpt from Tank, thanks) \n\nThey have been successful because each individual exercises the mission statement. \n\nI have a Creed or mission statement. You can go to Youtube \n\nhttps://youtu.be/V7EcbnHcAEE and print a pdf copy. \n\nPDF \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1OOjr2yroYRVsLv9gI9FrmctPKWX5bpxE/view?usp=drivesdk \n\n\n\nUnderstand that these are a complete SET, ALL are as important as the rest and without them ALL, the set is broken and useless. I don't think that this protocol is in opposition to any constitution or national law in any country. I will be using this protocol in all transactions. I HOPE THE ELDERS AGREE. \n\nI have heard ' Do No Harm' as the mission statement. I agree this is a good policy. Similar to 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.' I think we all know these well. One may say that my creed is similar to the 10 Commandants. This is also true, but with a very big acception. Those were commandments. That's when SOMEONE ELSE has to tell you what is appropriate behavior for a human. Make No mistake this protocol is not for anyone who can read and understand, but for someone who can become the protocol, without question, without reservation. These are small steps in a larger calling we all are part of. This is the I. I am responsible. I can act in a group of 'I' s. ALL THE SAME, BUT ALL SEPERATE. Free from religious doctrine and secret society rituals. \n\nI would like to know if there are ANY REAL people out there that agree with and accept this protocol I call, 'The Contract With Humanity.'? All I am asking is that you print and sign just your name only to the front and then make four copies for the five in your Group. Then have those people do the same. Write my e-mail or address on the back. Chose your group wisely and be sure of your choices because those people will also be choosing their group. I have found that groups of five (not to do with any satanic crap) works the best. My crew is great. I do not want anything from anyone except aknowledgement that I am not alone in my thinking. \n\nI know I will probably get e-mails like: Where is I will love in your message?(there is a reason for that, too abstract. One could love to kill), or who do you think you are? Or some cyptic new age response. I am waiting to see just who has the mind for this. It is not easy. The I will not lie applies to everything. One could choose not to answer if your answer causes harm. I am still struggling with the I will share part. I have been given information, or acquired it, and by releasing it may look like 'hey this dude is crazy, nobody knows that.' I could have made a fortune off of this. I will put it together soon. It has nothing to do with the RV. \n\nEither send a printed signed copy to thesonofchi@gmail.com or mail to my house \n\nJoseph Rader \n2419 W. Vermijo Ave. \nColorado Springs, Co. 80904 \n\nI will keep a record and give periodic updates. \nI do not want any personal information. \nYou know if you sent it. \nAnyone can contact me at anytime \nI have nothing to hide. \nI don't want a congregation. \nI don't need an entourage. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/fNB8r6zttDw \n\nOne can get caught up in the RV and the GCR and all the 'intel' that is floating around. Are there 800#'s? Will the bankers release our sovernty and the global assets? Who is Spiritual White Boy? Are the 'elders' real and are they going to take care of us? Will Trump resign? Will the Republic and the military save us? Are we slaves to some reptilian race that eats our children? Qanon, pizzagate, Russia, Soros, the illuminati, the Vatican, p 2 Masons, collateral accounts, new tech, the Galactics, the Palladians. Who is Bruce and Josef and Tank and are they real people or psyops or con artists? I use sonofchi because it is how it sign my artwork. ARE THERE ANY REAL TRUTHS? \n\nMy Creed is the only truth I can offer at this time. \n\nThese are some of the TRUTHS I know. \n\nON THE PROJECT SIDE \n\nI have 35 acres in Colorado. Water and electric in place. This has been a slow process to get the aquaponic farm going, so I understand everyone's frustration. Working on it since 2014. Hopefully next year will be putting in the greenhouses and fishtanks. Anyone who wants to help (by help I mean contact me, show up and work.) is more than welcome. Hopefully design a fully functional portable 'turnkey aquaponic' system using empty cargo containers. I have an architect brother right down the street. But, what the heck, maybe we will be given new tech (according to Trump) and our Star Trek replicators will arrive. \n\nDo No Harm \n\nThe 'I's have it \n\nJoseph Rader \n\n\nSonofchi ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sonofchi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph rader    sonofchi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesuit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph rader", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josef", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soros", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sonofchi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "co.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gcr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vatican", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galactics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "w. vermijo ave.  colorado springs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:35.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "98acf60fd9e380d9b774b30a59c5f9daab5a5bab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrHHgATwfdqLivXjsd_jm2ApYAXxguX1b3S.s9PouUW3xwDhW5Hvf3.u9qe930X.16azrLHPPXPfZsaI.di9Yt1HdQKAcdOS_9ab8RUcDwCRQ--", "site_full": "seriesinspired.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://seriesinspired.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Series inspired by time", "title": "Eva Squillari, by Alberto Buzzanca", "title_full": "Eva Squillari, by Alberto Buzzanca", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "98acf60fd9e380d9b774b30a59c5f9daab5a5bab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrHHgATwfdqLivXjsd_jm2ApYAXxguX1b3S.s9PouUW3xwDhW5Hvf3.u9qe930X.16azrLHPPXPfZsaI.di9Yt1HdQKAcdOS_9ab8RUcDwCRQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Khanh Nguyen Dac (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Eva Squillari, by Alberto Buzzanca", "text": "Go to FEMALE PORN MODEL \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eva squillari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberto buzzanca", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:35.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d295b72b542ef0f0de076e94db93830436f5f6aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm1q9_E0Es529iXjy2SDVQlL", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=bryce love", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "bryce%20love News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Scott Boras is right about Shohei Ohtani - SBNation.com", "title_full": "Scott Boras is right about Shohei Ohtani - SBNation.com : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-11-29T18:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.456, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d295b72b542ef0f0de076e94db93830436f5f6aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm1q9_E0Es529iXjy2SDVQlL", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "SB Nation", "published": "2017-11-29T18:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Scott Boras is right about Shohei Ohtani - SBNation.com", "text": "The first thing you have to do is imagine Scott Boras in long, white, flowing robes, with a six-year beard and a twitchy eye.

Christmas here we come!", "text": "13th December. Madame's electric bike   arrived earlier.. so once it stops raining, we can launch her off down the road. I'm considering getting one as well. The man in the shop had a second hand one in his workshops that he was selling on behalf of a customer - it's been checked over and serviced - and it looks as good as new.\n\nOff to Spain today for lunch with some friends - they know a Chinese restaurant there that apparently is the biz .. (I doubt that figgy pudding will be on the menu!)\n\nNutty aka 'Bulldozaire' We weighed Nutty yesterday, our 6 month old cocker pup (known as \" Bulldozaire \" by Madame!) - and it's difficult to be accurate as he wouldn't stand still on our bathroom scales for more than a second - so I weighed myself with and without him and even then he was wriggling for England, but I'd say he's somewhere in the region of 13-14kg.. I suspect he's not fully grown yet. I think he enjoys being known as ' the destroyer of worlds ' - as he's an inveterate sniffer, licker, nibbler, chewer, biter of anything he can find.. He has some other unsavoury habits but as this is a family show, I'll draw a veil over those..\n\nMy interest in, and understanding of, modern consumer electronic products took a fatal hit a minute or two ago. I was flicking through Ebay's deals and I came across this item: \"Sphero Star Wars BB-9E App-Enabled Droid with Trainer Droid\". (and only \u00a3150 too!) No doubt there are millions 'out there' who'd welcome the thrill ( \"Wow.. a BB-9E!! Thanks Santa\" ) of finding one of these gizmos in their Christmas stocking.. but not me. I can still remember the thrill of waking up on Christmas morn to find that Santa had left an electric train set at the bottom of my bed. Ah well..\n\nLaunched in 2010 ,  NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory has been recording images of the Sun   in astonishing close-up detail. The spacecraft is in Earth orbit at an altitude of some 22,000 miles (35,000 km) and presented here ( below ) are the highlights of 5 years-worth of solar activity - as you've never seen it before.. NASA link here . Best in full screen.\n12th December . The Leningrad Cowboys .. what can I say...? This act would have been unthinkable in the good old, bad old days of the Cold War - but this shows us that they are just as capable as we are of doing something totally bonkers.. < John Wayne voice > \"Put that M16 down nice and easy, Pilgrim, and set a spell..\". This is a Finnish rock group! \n11th December. Madame found a source for mince pies the other day.. and I'm hoping that they'll soon emerge from hiding! For me, memories of Christmasses past are often conjured up by tastes or smells that I grew up with. What are the triggers that do it for me? The smell of a roasting turkey in the late morning, the taste of a warm mince pie, a glass of sherry at midday, the rich taste of a Christmas pudding (oh yes!).. In talking about food that they've encountered on the other side of the English Channel, many French people curiously recoil in horror at the memory of jelly .. As a child, I often enjoyed it with fruit and I don't recall anyone disliking it. What's to dislike?    \n\nLiving here, I've acquired some new triggers - such as the taste of Vacherin Mont d'Or cheese.. or the smell of  boudin blanc (from Montauzer in Bayonne) frying gently, and served with saut\u00e9'd apple. There are more but I'll stop there as I'm starting to drool..\n\n8th December . I read somewhere earlier that someone called Ed Sheeran was recently awarded the MBE for services to music and charity. I've got no idea who he is - and there's something about his photograph that makes me want to keep it that way. (If that means I'm very shallow - so be it.) I remember a popular music combo in the sixties known as The Beatles being awarded the MBE. Does that mean Ed Sheeran and his music is right up there with them? < Tin hat on - awaiting incoming! >    \nCaves des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Bayonne Just back from a flying visit into town to buy a nice bottle of wine for some friends for tomorrow lunchtime - and also one for us for Christmas at an excellent little shop -  Caves des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es  - in Bayonne.\n\nIn talking to Mme Rabillon, the charming owner, we somehow drifted off onto the subject of whisky - and she scurried off into the back of the shop and came back with a miniature of \" Bastille \" malt whisky (no prizes for guessing where that's made!) that she insisted on  giving  to me for me to try.. Now, the  question du jour  - where else would that happen? Answers on a postcard please.. Highly recommended. (the shop, that is..)\n\nWell, I've just interviewed the miniature of \"Bastille\" Single Malt. There was an initial hint of Islay malts with it (presumably the French company bought some old Scottish fishermen's socks and steeped them in the mash) but after that faded away, there was nothing left. No honeyed heathery tastes, no complexity, no length - just an anonymous watery finish. Don't just take my word for it - read this  review  (it's far more circumspect than mine but it essentially says the same thing).  \n\nI don't like having to write this - given that Mme Rabillon was kind enough to offer it to me - but I have to say I won't be rushing out to buy a bottle - especially not at 60+\u20ac a bottle. This is 12 year old Balvenie money - except the Balvenie would bring with it the added bonus of 20\u20ac change! (enough for the down payment on a second one!) For 60\u20ac, I'd want to be looking at a litre of Highland Park from Orkney. Now that's a real Single Malt..\n\n(By the way, Balvenie and/or Highland Park would make an ideal Christmas present. Just saying!)  \nWe were at the e-bike shop this morning - looking at one for Madame. While we were there, a gentleman pulled into the large forecourt in a large black car with a slippery-looking shape that I'd not seen anywhere before. It was a Tesla Mod\u00e8le X  (it's marketed as a Model X in the UK) and it's a 4x4 SUV. The driver pressed a button to open the rear passenger doors and - whoosh! - they disappeared skywards in a manner reminiscent of the legendary Mercedes 300SL \"Gullwing\" . After showing us a few other features of this technological tour-de-force (such as adjustable ride height and the engine compartment ), he got back in and in a startling demonstration of acceleration, he shot across the forecourt in almost total mechanical silence (the only sound came from the tyres). I almost jumped at how fast it was.. Spooky!\n\nMy concern with 100% electric cars has always been based on range - and the time taken to recharge the batteries. His answers: 560 km or 350 miles and 20 minutes! (\"What Car\" review here ; road test in English here  and en fran\u00e7ais ici )         \n\n7th December. France   is in mourning following the death of Johnny Hallyday, who died yesterday aged 74. He was a true showbiz phenomenon and he bestrode popular music in France for over 5 decades - while at the same time remaining true to himself and his roots. A simple man from humble origins - he'd been abandoned as a baby - and yet he had succeeded in life beyond his wildest expectations. He'd learnt his trade coming up the hard way - for him there was no shortcut to instant stardom, like winning a TV talent show for example. He understood stagecraft like few others before or since. I remember watching his performance ( below ) from 2003 when he was a mere youngster of 60. Ever the showman, he made a spectacularly dramatic entrance looking like nothing less than a latter day Darth Vader - and he had the crowd eating out of his hand before he even sang a note. He never put less than 100% into his act and his followers came from all ages and backgrounds.. he had a universal appeal in France.\n\nOf course, France being France, the politicised media chatterati were quick to point out that he was a man of the political right (as if that was of any significance!). In fact, one journalist said that \"Johnny didn't hide the fact that he supported the political Right\".. Why should he have done?\n\nAnyway, moving right along, enjoy this video as Johnny gives \" Que je t'aime \" - one of his best songs - the full \"treatment\"! (English lyrics here ..) I only have one question - where does he keep his house keys in that suit?! (to go straight to the song, fast forward to 4:05)\n3rd December . There was frost all over the car this morning for the first time as we took Nutty down to the beach for his Sunday run.. The alerts were chiming in the car: 2\u00b0C!

Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential chief executive Igor Sechin. \nThe former minister pleaded not guilty to the charges and told the court on Thursday he had fallen victim to \"a horrific and cruel provocation.\" \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed earlier losses, adding 0.2 percent to 28,283.07. Most other regional benchmarks fell. The Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.7 percent to 3,272.05 and South Korea's Kospi lost 0.5 percent to 2,462.98. Stocks in Southeast Asia were mixed. \nWALL STREET: On Wednesday, U.S. stocks closed mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was flat at 2,629.27, shedding just 30 points. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2 percent to 24,140.91, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 0.2 percent, to 6,776.38. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks lost 0.5 percent to 1,508.88. \nANALYST'S VIEW: \"By no means do we expect risk sentiment to rebound this morning, though with the U.S. leads, one would be keen to see if Asian markets would similarly find stability in the day,\" Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary. \"Overnight we have seen U.S. markets stabilize as the likes of the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 index broke the downtrend to find narrow-range trading, keeping the intraday changes moderate.\" \nGEOPOLITICAL ISSUES: Market reaction was muted to President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, ending decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on the issue. In other global developments, the British and Irish prime ministers spoke, seeking to overcome a logjam in Brexit talks, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. \nU.S. JOBS: A report from payroll processor ADP showed private employers added 190,000 jobs last month, slightly better than expected. The report comes two days before a government jobs report, among the last key economic indicators before the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. \nOIL: Benchmark U.S. crude recovered briefly before falling again. It slipped 11 cents to $55.85 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the contract sank $1.66 to settle at $55.96 per barrel.

CNN would not have learned that Holets while on duty had agreed to adopt a baby from a homeless drug addict about to shoot up heroin in broad daylight. \nAnd CNN would have never had the chance to chronicle that encounter, drawing the attention of millions of people around the world to the story of how Holets's family grew by one on Oct. 12. \nHolets, a religious man who values his privacy, didn't do it for the attention. He did it because he felt a calling from God. He knew it was the right thing to do. \n\"We didn't do this to have a story,\" Holets said in a phone interview Tuesday. \"That is entirely not why we did it, but after talking to some close friends whom I trust, we realized this was a way to put a face on the drug problem and maybe encourage other people to adopt.\" \nOn Sept. 23, Holets responded to a call about a possible theft from a convenience store in Albuquerque. By the time Holets and his recruit arrived at the scene, the suspect was no longer there, but Holets noticed some commotion on the grassy area behind the store. \nHolets spotted a woman about to inject a needle into her companion's arm. The woman, 35-year-old Crystal Champ, was eight-months pregnant. \nWith his body camera on, Holets approached the couple and confronted them, \"Why are you doing this stuff? It's going to ruin your baby. You're going to kill your baby.\" \nChamp began to sob. \n\"How dare you judge me? You have no idea how hard this is,\" Champ told CNN about how she felt. \"I know what a horrible person I am. I know what a horrible situation I'm in.\" \nIn an interview with the Post, Holets admitted that he initially judged Champ and her partner, Tom. But he said he soon learned how badly Champ longed for her child to go a good family. He realized Champ wanted someone to adopt her baby. \nHolets offered to do just that. \n\"His entire being changed,\" Champ said to CNN. \"He just became a human being instead of a police officer.\" \nHolets took about six weeks off from work and he and his wife, Rebecca, were at the University of New Mexico Hospital when Champ gave birth to a baby girl, Hope, on Oct. 12 - one month earlier than her due date. \nDoctors needed to give Hope treatments and medication to help her through withdrawals - \"It was very difficult to watch,\" Holets said - but she was able to leave the hospital after a week and a half. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the overall incidence of such withdrawal, known as neo-natal abstinence syndrome, has increased almost 300 percent between 1999 and 2013 in the 28 states that the 2016 study included. \n\"She's gaining weight, eating well, sleeping well,\" Holets said of Hope. \"We're just praying and hoping for the best for her. As far as development goes, we won't know the effects until she's older.\" \nWhen Sgt. Jim Edison learned what Holets did, he was floored. In his 10 years as a police officer, he has seen many \"heroic acts,\" but none like what Holets did, Edison said. \n\"This guy wasn't just taking a call, he was changing everybody's life around him,\" he said. \"It's so unselfish. I was just humbled.\" \nEdison wrote a memo nominating Holets for outstanding service for the city of Albuquerque, but felt that didn't suffice. It's his job to reward and encourage his men for doing the right thing and so Edison signed Holets up to do an interview for CNN's \"Beyond the Call of Duty\" series without telling Holets. \n\"Everyday he calls me to ask for forgiveness,\" Holets said with a chuckle. \"And I keep assuring him that we're fine. We didn't quite realize it would get this response, and neither did he. . . .But we all realize it's a really good thing, and some really good things can come of it.\" \nHolets, 27, was born and raised in Albuquerque and joined the city's police department six years ago. He and his wife already had four young children of their own before bringing Hope into their lives. \nThe couple had wanted to adopt a year or two down the road, and so when Holets approached his wife while on duty that day in September to break the news to her, Rebecca's jaw dropped. \n\"I was shocked and surprised but just super, super excited,\" she said. \nOne of Holets's conditions when he agreed to CNN's interview was that his superiors would not set up a GoFundMe page for the family. He instead urges those who want to offer support to find a local drug rehabilitation center or adoption organization and donate to them. \nHolets has also been helping Champ and her partner find the right rehabilitation center and gave them a tablet computer so they can receive photos of Hope over email. \nTo Holets's knowledge, the pair, who have not responded to a Post interview request conducted through Holets, are not clean. It was his ultimate goal from the beginning to help them through rehab. \nHolets is hopeful it will happen. It seems to him meant to be. \nShortly after Holets named his baby, Champ informed him of something he didn't know. Her middle name is Hope.

The Slovenian-based bitcoin miner NiceHash says it is investigating a security breach and the possible theft of tens of millions of dollars' worth of bitcoins, as meanwhile the value of the virtual currency has soared to a new record high. \nNiceHash said Thursday in a statement posted on its website that it had stopped operations for 24 hours and was working to verify how many bitcoins were taken. \nThere was no immediate response from NiceHash to an emailed request for more details. Unconfirmed reports said more than 4,000 bitcoins were missing valued at more than $60 million. \n\"The incident has been reported to the relevant authorities and law enforcement and we are cooperating with them as a matter of urgency,\" it said. \nThe statement urged users to change their online passwords. \nTroubles with the website over the past day or so drew alarm and complaints, with many bitcoin owners posting panicked comments on NiceHash's social media accounts. \nThe price of bitcoin has surged to over $14,100.74, gaining $1,000 in less than a day, according to coindesk, a website that monitors the price. That compares with a value below $1,000 at the beginning of the year. \nBitcoin is the world's most popular digital currency. Such currencies are not tied to a bank or government and allow users to spend money anonymously. They are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they are traded. Miners of bitcoins and other virtual currencies help keep the systems honest by putting computer power into a blockchain, a global running tally of every transaction that prevents cheaters from spending the same digital coin twice. \nNiceHash is a cryptocurrency mining application that lends computer power to verify bitcoin users' transactions. \nOnline security is a vital concern for such dealings. \nIn Japan, following the failure of a bitcoin exchange called Mt. Gox, new laws were enacted to regulate bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. Mt. Gox shut down in February 2014, saying it lost about 850,000 bitcoins, possibly to hackers.
