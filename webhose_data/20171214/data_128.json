(Photo: RICHARD POHLE, AFP/Getty Images) LONDON \u2014 A man has been charged in England with sharing a photo of royal heir Prince George of Cambridge along with details about his school in a social media post prosecutors allege was meant to help would-be terrorists plan violent attacks. Authorities have accused Husnain Rashid, 31, of putting information about the 4-year-old son of Prince William and Duchess Kate of Cambridge, the former Kate Middleton, on the encrypted platform Telegram. Britain\u2019s The Sun and the Daily Mail tabloids reported that Rashid allegedly posted the silhouette of an Islamic State fighter beside a picture of George, along with the school address and the message that, \u201cEven the royal family won\u2019t be left alone.\u201d Prosecutors also allege he planned to go to Syria to join the Islamic State. Rashid, from Nelson in northwest England, appeared in court Wednesday to plead not guilty to one count of preparing to commit acts of terrorism and one count of assisting others to prepare acts of terrorism. Prince George, the third in line to the British throne and the great-grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, started preschool in September at Thomas\u2019s Battersea, the well-regarded private day school across the River Thames a few miles from his family\u2019s home in Kensington Palace in London. \nCourt artist sketch of Husnain Rashid in court in London, Dec. 6, 2017.

The prince is protected by royal bodyguards as well as London police, and the school itself also has security arrangements. \nAutoplay ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "husnain r", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "prince george", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rashid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duchess kate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kate middleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard pohle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "husnain rashid", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "daily mail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "thomas\u2019s battersea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kensington palace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "river thames", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:31.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "710095f43072515181c3e61650c1a432f9e26a1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jY50JNf0c5._AybGw6NyqOjezGJP3HKkf21GrqsIsv4kC7QSwbLbpuwA2jW4DZ0CjZ4QBCgrFZN.IzQBV5Mo2leNCLXgv9RI500GOuvY7oh1aUrrAEpbaYQ--", "site_full": "www.nydailynews.com", "site": "nydailynews.com", "site_section": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Breaking, Local and National News, Sports &amp; Entertainment - NY Daily News", "title": "Prosecutors seek prison term for ex-Miss Turkey", "title_full": "Prosecutors seek prison term for ex-Miss Turkey - NY Daily News", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3017322.1491332558!/img/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/ap-default.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 811, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "710095f43072515181c3e61650c1a432f9e26a1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jY50JNf0c5._AybGw6NyqOjezGJP3HKkf21GrqsIsv4kC7QSwbLbpuwA2jW4DZ0CjZ4QBCgrFZN.IzQBV5Mo2leNCLXgv9RI500GOuvY7oh1aUrrAEpbaYQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Prosecutors seek prison term for ex-Miss Turkey", "text": "ANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 Turkish prosecutors are seeking a maximum one year prison term for a former beauty queen who was stripped of her crown over a social media posting deemed to be \"insulting\" to the victims of last year's failed coup, state-run Anadolu Agency reported on Thursday.\nProsecutors in Istanbul have charged 18-year-old Itir Esen with \"overtly insulting a section of the public\" for a remark she posted on Twitter as the country held memorials on the anniversary of the July 15, 2016 coup attempt, the agency reported.\nEsen was stripped of her Miss Turkey 2017 title a day after the competition in September when the tweet came to light.

All opinions are 100% my own. \nA few weeks ago, I learned about a company called Key2Bme. Key2Bme was created through the desire to remind each and every one of us that we hold the keys to our own happiness. Key2Bme offers keys (yes, actual keys) with meaningful messages. They have keys that are designed to be inspirational, focus on our special interests and help support our outside influences. Key2Bme has 55 designs for you to choose from. \nI went through the Key2Bme keys and chose my seven favorite designs- Kind, Purpose, Greater Than, Believe key, Shine key, Smile key, and Fierce key. I have seven very special recipients in mind for these Key2Bme keys. \nKey2Bme keys are ready for gift-giving upon arrival. Each Key2Bme key comes in a beautiful organza drawstring bag with a special mini quote card and a key ring with clip. \nKey2Bme keys make a really meaningful gift.

There's only one form of privilege, and that's wealth. All other forms of cultural resentment - which is what identity politics is really about - spring from that concern. \n\nIt's good that society is more aware of identity politics, but the downside of that is that not everyone involved in such activity is (to be quite blunt) reasonable, sensible, or worth listening to out of anything more than politeness. In this, I should add, they are no different from anyone else. Does someone automatically become wise or insightful by being discontented? \n\nOf course, it's not an either/or situation. You can have class consciousness and partake of identity politics. I think a bit of the latter is generally a good thing, but the trouble with it is that it is primarily a product of the 'level playing field' illusion provided by social media, in which hierarchies are rendered more or less inoperative. There isn't that much identity politics going on in 'meatspace'.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:32.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f4f3937e9c74f85b572e9ce1d638c019621be4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS6VP4OgRQRnGiNcpzsx7RFc-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f4f3937e9c74f85b572e9ce1d638c019621be4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS6VP4OgRQRnGiNcpzsx7RFc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "{\r\n    \"msg\": \"ok\",\r\n    \"pagination\": {},\r\n    \"errors\": [],\r\n    \"payload\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"notices\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"name\": \"ALLERTA METEO\",\r\n                    \"description\": \"\",\r\n                    \"created_at\": \"2017-11-28T12:53:12Z\",\r\n                    \"expire_at\": null,\r\n                    \"image_url\": null,\r\n                    \"media_url\": null,\r\n                    \"media_type\": null,\r\n                    \"external_url\": null,\r\n                    \"category\": {\r\n                        \"name\": \"AVVISI GENERICI\"\r\n                    },\r\n                    \"icon_url\": null,\r\n                    \"tags\": \"\",\r\n                    \"coordinates\": null\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"deadlines\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"name\": \"IMU\",\r\n                    \"description\": \"\",\r\n                    \"dates\": []\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"availabilities\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"fullname\": \"Eleanor Abernathy\",\r\n                    \"role\": \"ASSESSORE\",\r\n                    \"abstract\": \"Assessorato ai gatti\",\r\n                    \"phone\": \"0187546546\",\r\n                    \"email\": \"none@none.com\",\r\n                    \"fax\": null,\r\n                    \"person\": true,\r\n                    \"only_appointment\": false,\r\n                    \"availabilities\": [\r\n                        {\r\n                            \"week_day\": \"GIO\",\r\n                            \"time_slot\": \"14:00-15:00\",\r\n                            \"location\": \"Ufficio\"\r\n                        },\r\n                        {\r\n                            \"week_day\": \"LUN\",\r\n                            \"time_slot\": \"09:00-10:00\",\r\n                            \"location\": \"Ufficio\"\r\n                        }\r\n                    ]\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eleanor abernathy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:32.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "02ab7eb78e63c260f52b98021079dae6c4ebc88b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8XaZEBdINtCboba9gpSLePk38hkiuX8XYYZ_fLRkpWu_76tVhJzz_A92XZg3bF.top1eaWzEufUqRrYjC_eRYa0AN.TOiV.UhrpuXhLBvHSA--", "site_full": "www.airport-world.com", "site": "airport-world.com", "site_section": "http://www.airport-world.com/?format=feed&type=rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Airport News and Features -

Architects know it, so do psychologists, health care specialists, educational establishments, retail/F&B operators and the leisure sector \u2013 the ambiance of a place is all-important. When you get it right it can create a welcoming atmosphere and even a sense of wellbeing that boosts customer satisfaction levels and subsequently passenger spend on shopping and F&B. People simply feel more positive when they are exposed to the right ambiance and, in this respect, lighting makes a significant contribution to their overall experience. This was not lost on Zurich Airport when it came to deciding on its 2016 Christmas lights, the Swiss gateway opting to go for some unique displays in a bid to surprise and delight visitors during one its busiest times of the year. Its partners for the project were Zurich-based marketing agency, AROMA, and Austria\u2019s MK Illumination, a company with over 20 years experience of creating festive lighting in locations ranging from city centres to Tyrolean villages and local government offices to shopping malls. The latter is particularly relevant as Zurich Airport is one of Switzerland\u2019s busiest shopping centres and one of the few places in the country where people from the region can shop on a Sunday. By their very nature airports tend to be big buildings with oversize facilities, and Zurich is no exception, so MK Illumination focused on using rich showers of warm, golden light points to bring out the best of its architectural design. They created multiple large centrepiece chandeliers suspended from the ceilings and introduced \u201cbrilliant carpets of warm light\u201d spilling over balconies on the upper and mezzanine floors as well as on escalators. The bedazzling mix of lights meant that wherever passengers were in the terminal they were met with a warm, and unmistakably inviting Christmas atmosphere. \u201cWe really wanted to put our passengers and visitors in a Christmas mood and Christmas lighting, and some beautifully decorated promotional areas, was integral to achieving this goal,\u201d says Andrea Etter, Zurich Airport\u2019s head of advertising and promotions. \u201cIn this respect, I suppose, we can be compared to a big shopping centre. The aim was to make our visitors feel comfortable and have a positive experience of their stay at Zurich Airport, and based on their feedback, we know they felt very comfortable during the pre-Christmas period. \u201cThey also confirmed that the beautiful decorations had a positive effect on them. As a result, we can recommend upgrading the shopping areas with lighting, decorations and music over the Christmas period.\u201d In today\u2019s ultra-competitive operating environment where passengers have more choice of which gateways to use than ever before, airports are more than aware that they need to become almost destinations in their own right to attract passengers. Indeed, market research from companies like AT Kearney claim that airports need to transform themselves into distinct brands to standout from the crowd and differentiate themselves from their rivals. In Zurich Airport\u2019s case, there is no denying that last winter\u2019s distinctive Christmas lighting helped it in this respect, and it is planning something similar this holiday season.

He did so in 3 parliamentary elections, it is probably not fair to describe his 2017 candidature nor his London Mayoral run as harmful. These were all dirty campaigns involving unacceptable reliance on communalism. In line with your observations on 2 of these occasions this involved women, BME candidates \u2013 Oona King probably being deliberately targeted. Both were horribly treated. Respect also damaged the party in local elections. \n\nThough Respect folded \u2013 finally due to the Assange comments you cite \u2013 he grandiosely saw it as a \u201crebirth\u201d of Labour.

People who tried to work with him in Respect found he was a law unto himself and there was no point expecting any better. His misognyist antics often seem to stem directly from the same vanity and inability to listen to wiser counsel. \n\nBUT ... I will always see his stand against the Iraq war\u2014including and especially his call for soldiers to disobey orders, and his support for the right to armed resistance to a brutal occupation\u2014as something to be commended, especially when seen against the long, ignoble tradition of British Labour when it comes to imperial wars, past and present. I'd take Galloway, with all his egregious flaws, over a thousand Ernest Bevins, John Spellars or John Woodcocks. In fact it's one of the main reasons I feel frustrated by his repeated, wilful idiocies over the past decade, which have pushed him past the point of no return for so many people: we could do with a few more people who are willing to challenge the Labour right's rancid foreign-oolicy nostrums with the same passion and eloquence. This is something that I feel especially strongly after reading the full text of Emily Thornberry's shameful, stomach-turning speech at LFI's gathering last week, which might as well have been scripted by Mark Regev\u2014I can't help thinking fondly of Galloway telling a Sky News anchor, to her horror, that the Israeli army was getting 'a bloody good hiding' after invading Lebanon in 2006. \n\nSo yes, ultimately I think the Corbyn project (or whatever you want to call it) would be better off without Galloway trying to impose himself on proceedings. But if it becomes a topic of debate, it's not enough to leave it at that. Tony Blair is still a member of the party in good standing, as far as I'm aware: his trips around the world to shill for tyrants and war criminals do infinitely more to bring it into disrepute than anything Galloway said about Iraq. And there's plenty of lesser crooks such as Kim Howells, who was so brazen as to pose for a photo with one of Colombia's leading death-squad organizers and his men.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:32.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3662aeda7b78fab6ede68de4b896288f7968b187", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPKrBQP5sFZCHsU5eHvEjnBzYOnOse5qeP0xFPQJV4BlLdEuHV8eXGp5", "site_full": "www.avforums.com", "site": "avforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.avforums.com/forums/sony-tvs-forum.113/", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Sony TVs Forum | AVForums", "title": "XE9005 Thread | Page 22", "title_full": "Sony XE9005 Thread | Page 22 | AVForums", "published": "2017-12-07T00:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.avforums.com/data/avatars/m/461/461648.jpg?1325647950", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10709, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3662aeda7b78fab6ede68de4b896288f7968b187", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPKrBQP5sFZCHsU5eHvEjnBzYOnOse5qeP0xFPQJV4BlLdEuHV8eXGp5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pezza", "published": "2017-12-07T00:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "XE9005 Thread | Page 22", "text": "ReflexReact said: \u2191 Still having serious issues with getting HDR10 on this TV via my Xbox One X.

WoW at the time had a network of regional organisers - the NW organiser being Angela Hale, co-founder of Women Working Worldwide - and a chain of shops; the Manchester shop was also a base for local NGOs and campaigning organisations. Galloway didn't give a damn about any of this; like Ian McGregor, he wanted to balance the books, and he duly had the organisers sacked and the shops sold off. I heard at second hand about one long and difficult meeting where Angela had tried and failed to persuade him of the intrinsic value of running a local campaigning hub and community space. Eventually she gave up and said, \"I suppose I'm just a child of the sixties.\". Galloway smiled back at her, standing there in his dark suit and tie, and said, \"But so am I!\".\n\nGit.\n\nTo be fair, Galloway's hard anti-imperialist turn is interesting and unusual; he could have been an asset to the Left at one time.

You can't have your cake and eat it. \n\nI don't altogether trust Galloway, mainly because he appeals specifically to the Muslim community and makes it clear to them that he is himself a Muslim while refusing to discuss his religion in mainstream settings.

This is because every action the police personnel take at any point in time attracts different interpretations by different people. Police are also part of organizations in the world that have more enemies than friends. In fact, a friend to the police today may tomorrow become the enemy because of vested interest. The recent campaign in the social media calling for the scrapping of the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS), a unit of the Nigeria Police Force, has attracted mixed feelings. This is because, while many others have had sour encounter with personnel of the unit, others or their relations have, at one time or the other, been rescued from either kidnappers or deadly armed robbers by the officers of the SARS unit. SARS is a special unit of the Nigeria Police Force which was specifically created to combat violent crimes. SARS, according to many, has over the years, performed excellently well as it has assisted in arresting some notorious criminals in different parts of the country. Just as there is no perfect human institution or person, one cannot deny the fact that SARS also has some bad elements who have acted over time beyond their line of responsibility. The question though is, must we throw away the baby with the bath water?  Or must we, because some very few officers have misbehaved, not remember the good aspect of the unit, hence, scrap it ? It is instructive to note that the same SARS many people are calling for it to be scrapped was instrumental to the arrest of  most of the notorious criminals in many parts of the country. For example,  sometimes last year, two suspected notorious armed robbers terrorising and robbing residents of Ire Akari street, Ejigbo and Isolo areas of Lagos, snatching and vandalising vehicles in the area for long, were arrested by operatives of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) in Adeniji Adele Road, Lagos Island.  This, no doubt, brought a sigh of relief to residence of the area. Similarly, in 2015, due to the unabated activities of cultists and other violent crimes, including kidnapers and armed robbers in Edo State, the IGP Idris, dispatched a special crack squad comprising SARS officers to the state to tackle the situation. The situation was, few days after, brought under control. On the other hand, the arrest of over 3,000 suspected kidnappers since the assumption of office of the IGP, one year ago, is largely due to the efforts of SARS operatives. In fact, the recent successes recorded in reducing the high rate of crime and criminality, especially kidnapping and other deadly vices in most parts of the country, is largely the handiwork of SARS operatives. Also, the arrest of the notorious kidnappers that terrorised the country for more than 6 years,  popularly known as Henry Chibueze a.k.a Vampire and Onwumadike Chukwudumeme a.k.a Evans,  was achieved following the ingenuity and gallantry displayed by the SARS unit of the Force. Few months ago, the Abuja-Kaduna Highway became a danger zone as kidnappers and armed robbers almost took over the road. Many prominent Nigerians had been kidnapped and robbed on that axis. The story has become different today because of the immense contribution of SARS operatives who were drafted to that highway. Also, cases of cattle rustling that had caused serious panic among Fulani herdsmen have been reduced to the barest minimum because of the tireless efforts of SARS; they have also recovered thousands of cows from criminals and returned them to the owners. Security experts are of the consensus that the drastic reduction in the rate of armed robbery and kidnapping in all parts of the country in recent times is creditable to intense activities of the SARS. It is, however, important to stress that in spite of the shortcomings of the very few disgruntled SARS operatives, they need the encouragement, prayer and the support of all Nigerians to do more. It is pertinent to remind Nigerians that most of these SARS operatives stay awake in bushes and dangerous places to secure the country. Most of them, in fact, spend more than three months without seeing their families and making other personal sacrifices to make Nigerians sleep with the two eyes closed. Rather than castigating them, labelling them all manner of names and calling for their scrapping, Nigerians need to explore avenues of supporting the Nigeria Police Force with constructive advice and suggestions, to make the unit better. It is also relevant to say that not all the alleged wrong doings attributed to the SARS personnel are actually committed by them. In fact, many bad elements have been arrested in recent times for impersonating or claiming to be SARS personnel. It is, therefore, necessary to applaud the effort of the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Kpotun-Idris, for his swift response in reorganising the SARS unit following the recent uproar in the social media. In the course of restructuring the unit, the IGP directed the IGP X-Squad of the Force to undertake an instant investigation into all the allegations, complaints and infractions levelled against the SARS personnel across the country. He, has, therefore, appointed a Commissioner of Police to head the Federal Anti-Robbery Squad nationwide under the department of operations in the  Force Headquarters. According to the IGP Idris, police zonal commands, state commands and divisions will continue to operate anti-crime units/sections, crime prevention and control squads and teams imperative to prevent and detect crimes and criminalities in their area of responsibilities. Also, other crack squads necessary to sustain law and order and protection of life and properties in their area of responsibilities are to be sustained. \u201cFederal Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) will now exist and operate in the State and Zonal Commands under the Commissioner of Police (F-SARS) at the Force Headquarters. \u201cA Federal SARS Commander of a rank of Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) and not below Superintendent of Police (SP) will be in charge of F-SARS in states and zonal commands across the country,\u201d the police boss said. \u201cFurthermore, a new training programme to be organized by the Force, in collaboration with some Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), local and international NGOs, and other human rights organisations on core police duties and human rights observers, have been directed by the IGP for all Federal SARS personnel nationwide with immediate effect.\u201d One is, therefore, obliged to say that with the strategies by the IGP, Nigerians should be patient with the SARS operatives, pray for them and encourage them for a better and secured Nigeria. \u2013 Busu, a public affairs analyst, writes from Abuja.

Heightened expectations for the passage of tax reform into law could offer a short-term boost to the economy, but were unlikely to trigger a long-term boost to inflation that would drive longer-dated yields higher, said Ian Lyngen, head of US interest rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty straightforward. It will keep the Fed on path to keep normalising but it won\u2019t trigger the kind of stimulus that might introduce more significant inflation,\u201d he said. \n\nThe probability that the Fed will increase the target Fed funds rate when it meets in December have hit 98.3 per cent as implied by the markets, up from 87.5 per cent the day after the Fed last met at the beginning of November. \n\n\n\nIncreasing expectations of interest rate rises from the Fed have helped drive the more policy-sensitive two-year Treasury yield up 54 basis points since early September to 1.80 per cent this week. In contrast the 10-year note yield has remained stuck between 2.30 per cent and 2.46 per cent since mid-October and on Wednesday was around 2.33 per cent. \n\nMr Lyngen also pointed to the Senate\u2019s inclusion of the alternative minimum tax \u2014 a baseline, parallel tax assessment that permits fewer deductions \u2014 as damping the stimulative effect of tax reform. It may still be removed as the House and Senate seek to align their proposals but analysts say its inclusion would provide a floor to the benefit received by companies, with effective tax rates already below the statutory 35 per cent. \n\nMarket gauges of investors\u2019 inflation expectations have remained muted since the passage of the Senate\u2019s tax proposal. The 10-year break-even inflation rate edged slightly lower on Tuesday to 1.88 per cent. \n\nAnalysts also point to strong demand for longer-dated bonds as another factor weighing on yields. \n\nForeign investors have been big buyers of Treasuries this year, attracted to the higher-yielding asset compared to high-quality government debt elsewhere across the globe.

I really didn't know for sure until the last day of testing in Abu Dhabi,\" he said. \nSauber was F1's slowest team in 2017, but Ferrari junior driver Leclerc says he is confident for next year. \n\"I'm really looking forward to the first race and also that I am involved in the return of Alfa Romeo. Everyone with a passion for F1 knows that Alfa has set some milestones in the sport,\" he said. \nThere is some debate about who the 'number 1' at Sauber will be next year: Leclerc with his Ferrari links, or Marcus Ericsson, who is closely tied to the team's owners. \nAsked about that, Leclerc said: \"I will just focus on myself and my job. \n\"We get the new Ferrari engine, which will be a big step forward.

People who tried to work with him in Respect found he was a law unto himself and there was no point expecting any better. His misognyist antics often seem to stem directly from the same vanity and inability to listen to wiser counsel. \n\nBUT ... I will always see his stand against the Iraq war\u2014including and especially his call for soldiers to disobey orders, and his support for the right to armed resistance to a brutal occupation\u2014as something to be commended, especially when seen against the long, ignoble tradition of British Labour when it comes to imperial wars, past and present. I'd take Galloway, with all his egregious flaws, over a thousand Ernest Bevins, John Spellars or John Woodcocks. In fact it's one of the main reasons I feel frustrated by his repeated, wilful idiocies over the past decade, which have pushed him past the point of no return for so many people: we could do with a few more people who are willing to challenge the Labour right's rancid foreign-oolicy nostrums with the same passion and eloquence. This is something that I feel especially strongly after reading the full text of Emily Thornberry's shameful, stomach-turning speech at LFI's gathering last week, which might as well have been scripted by Mark Regev\u2014I can't help thinking fondly of Galloway telling a Sky News anchor, to her horror, that the Israeli army was getting 'a bloody good hiding' after invading Lebanon in 2006. \n\nSo yes, ultimately I think the Corbyn project (or whatever you want to call it) would be better off without Galloway trying to impose himself on proceedings. But if it becomes a topic of debate, it's not enough to leave it at that. Tony Blair is still a member of the party in good standing, as far as I'm aware: his trips around the world to shill for tyrants and war criminals do infinitely more to bring it into disrepute than anything Galloway said about Iraq. And there's plenty of lesser crooks such as Kim Howells, who was so brazen as to pose for a photo with one of Colombia's leading death-squad organizers and his men.", "highlightText": "",

Galloway didn't give a damn about any of this; like Ian McGregor, he wanted to balance the books, and he duly had the organisers sacked and the shops sold off. I heard at second hand about one long and difficult meeting where Angela had tried and failed to persuade him of the intrinsic value of running a local campaigning hub and community space. Eventually she gave up and said, \"I suppose I'm just a child of the sixties.\". Galloway smiled back at her, standing there in his dark suit and tie, and said, \"But so am I!\".\n\nGit.\n\nTo be fair, Galloway's hard anti-imperialist turn is interesting and unusual; he could have been an asset to the Left at one time.

You could also take this course for your own hobby. It is up to you. You only have one life. For you to reach the top, you need to be absolutely competent and credible. You should be good at everything. At least, if you cannot do that, you must be good with one thing.\n\nThey should have the appeal, the charm, and the charisma. You could give it to them, though. If you are competitive enough, you could grant women with their ultimate wish. You could also do the same thing to yourself. Now, think about of enrolling in the best esthetician schools in Vancouver WA . For those individuals who are planning to pursue this career, you better take your studies from a renown school. This is necessary. Truly, your lack of natural talent can be resolved by your hard work. Even so, regardless how much you worked for it, if your instructors are all unreliable, expect that your studies will stay obsolete and ineffective.\n\nThey are very knowledgeable. With your own initiative and with their experience, assure that you will be able to overcome and conquer everything. Whether you will have some kind of outcome, though, that depends on your decisions now. Take the right path. Use a renown stepping stone to reach your dreams.\n\nYou would need that for your development. You cannot just rely on your own skills forever. The market is changing. As for now, that change continues to unfold and takes place. Do not be left behind, though. Knowing the latest technology and materials offer on the market, they are important. They could give you competitive edges.\n\nYou know how hard and demanding your customers could be. Aside from that, as you have observed this, the fashion and cosmetic industry are changing drastically. You should be in. You must be aware of the latest things that are occurring around you. They will never be insignificant. In fact, contrary to that, knowing and understanding these changes are part of your job.\n\nThat is a privilege only given to credible and wonderful people. Whether they worked for that or not, expect that someone out there worked that luck on their behalf. It might be their ancestors, their friends, or colleagues. It could be God. Do not contradict love. It always destroys all rules and defies all logic.\n\nJust imagine it. Every year, a lot of students will be enrolling for the class. Some of them will make it through the graduations. Others will not. From there, fresh graduates are bound to meet their seniors in the real world. Depending on your skills, you can be demoted or promoted. That is just the regular stage.\n\nSince you learn things on the hard way, you would also view things differently. You would taste victory in its sweetest form. Now, to obtain all of that privileges, then, work with highly competent experts. Inquire.\n\nCertainly, you know and aware of it. Therefore, be resourceful. Before you could give other people some confidence, you need to have some yourself. As for your talent and skill, do not just stick to one material. Use tons of them. For you to win this game and to develop a progressive career, accept this challenge.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can get fantastic tips on how to choose esthetician schools in Vancouver WA and more information about a reputable school at http://www.portlandbeautyschool.com right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dorothy reed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "vancouver wa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:34.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "492949f8fba6a5c58b276e8ba7db7b4af564edb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTSvRcGOuFCYyDNTkFQCA3HzmAPVYC6wh6cSJR4wg7L7m722R3mo877FUGiUNJpHyEfC.4gKBUdvDTn0HN4_IqfFJUbTcIV2HOqaSuxZcgG5dmJ5YxuRfVC_VQYTv1BfqU-", "site_full": "www.visit-gloucestershire.co.uk", "site": "visit-gloucestershire.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.visit-gloucestershire.co.uk/boards/online/", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "Online Users - Gloucestershire News, chat and discussions", "title": "Possible long wait for Golden Egg demolition - Gloucester Today", "title_full": "Possible long wait for Golden Egg demolition - Gloucester Today - Gloucestershire News, chat and discussions", "published": "2012-11-09T11:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "92ef6ba927e138bd72980583bb37900eee2db890", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTSvRcGOuFCYyDNTkFQCA3HzmAPVYC6wh6cSJR4wg7L7m722R3mo877FUGiUNJpHyEfC.4gKBUdvDTn0HN4_IqfFJUbTcIV2HOqaSuxZcgG5dmJ5YxuRfVCV5S_67cvwpM88IZ6xLRBHQ--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Vanda", "published": "2017-12-02T12:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "FRUSTRATIONS are reaching boiling point over the failure to crack the problem of Gloucester eyesore the Golden Egg.\nSpeculation has been rife for some time over the future of the King's Square building, with its owners Aviva Life and Pensions Ltd reluctant to confirm their plans.\nThe company yesterday said it planned to refurbish the building ahead of the \u00a360m revamp but would not be drawn on specific dates.\nAn Aviva Investors spokeswoman said: \"We have decided to restore the building so that it can be used for retail purposes until the area surrounding Kings Square is redeveloped.\n\"As and when the redevelopment takes place it is likely to involve the demolition of the 'Golden Egg'.\"\nMeanwhile Gloucester City Council leader Paul James lambasted the company for leaving it empty.\n\"It is hugely frustrating, that nothing has been done. And it is my understanding that Aviva isn't intending to do anything with it until the redevelopment gets underway.\"\nHe added: \"I just wish they would get on with it and knock it down. The council has in the past offered to buy it off them so that we could knock it down. We thought it was a fair offer\".\nKnock down\nAviva Life and Pensions Ltd handed in a planning application to knock down the Golden Egg at the start of 2011, which was approved in April last year. But almost a year on nothing has happened, despite repeated requests for the firm to name a date.\nDeveloper Stanhope PLC is working with the city council over an overhaul of the entire area, which by 2017 will be renamed King's Quarter and contain a new cinema, restaurants, and 26 new shops, including a glass fronted restaurant.\nLast month the Gloucester branch of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) claimed the Golden Egg was \"damaging confidence\". Mark Owen, chairman of the Gloucester federation said: \"This is an eyesore in a prominent part of the city and it's about time Aviva told us what was going on. I don't understand what the problem is and why it is still there. At the end of the day, it's all about confidence in the city.

But \"identity\" also includes ethnic group, nation, and religion, all factors which people like you (Marxists) typically disregard. You can't have your cake and eat it. \n\nI don't altogether trust Galloway, mainly because he appeals specifically to the Muslim community and makes it clear to them that he is himself a Muslim while refusing to discuss his religion in mainstream settings. I totally support his right to do either of these things, but not both at the same time as it is dishonest. Secondly I dislike his association with the Iranian state TV and his support for Hamas (although he has strongly opposed Islamists at some risk to himself, but Hamas are Islamists, again he's running with the fox and hunting with the hounds). \n\nBut I'm betting a lot of the resentment against GG is more about his being the best public speaker in this country by far- I've heard him and Tony Benn together when Benn was still in good health- he was good but GG was in a different league.\n\nAs for his thoughts of Kylie Minogue- get a grip already!

He did so in 3 parliamentary elections, it is probably not fair to describe his 2017 candidature nor his London Mayoral run as harmful.

There's only one form of privilege, and that's wealth. All other forms of cultural resentment - which is what identity politics is really about - spring from that concern. \n\nIt's good that society is more aware of identity politics, but the downside of that is that not everyone involved in such activity is (to be quite blunt) reasonable, sensible, or worth listening to out of anything more than politeness. In this, I should add, they are no different from anyone else. Does someone automatically become wise or insightful by being discontented? \n\nOf course, it's not an either/or situation. You can have class consciousness and partake of identity politics. I think a bit of the latter is generally a good thing, but the trouble with it is that it is primarily a product of the 'level playing field' illusion provided by social media, in which hierarchies are rendered more or less inoperative.
