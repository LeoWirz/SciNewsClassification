I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway! \nThe magazine denied that account, and Murray had said on Twitter that there was \u201cnot a speck of truth\u201d to Trump\u2019s claim. Asked by CNBC about the disagreement with the president, Murray said: \u201cI can\u2019t begin to fathom the internal workings of the president\u2019s mind.\u201d \nTime\u2019s actual selection for \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d was the \u201cThe Silence Breakers\u201d\u2014 women who spoke out against sexual harassment ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "charles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david koch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "meredith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institutional times  tech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortune global forum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guangzhou", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:34.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "596c391951ef60f5aa50dd87dcb22e90a34aac74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ajgHiOEkCVqapEnx.TQFnzndhIvTxKbjneZIJxrhxxqPwbB_Xzf48_yszPixD4CfxyCjsnTkbEA--", "site_full": "www.chicoer.com", "site": "chicoer.com", "site_section": "http://www.chicoer.com/section?template=RSS&profile=4004455&mime=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RSS Feed from Chico Enterprise-Record: http://www.chicoer.com", "title": "Entertainment calendar for week of Dec. 7-13.", "title_full": "Entertainment calendar for week of Dec. 7-13.", "published": "2017-12-07T02:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://local.chicoer.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/chicoer.png?122017", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "596c391951ef60f5aa50dd87dcb22e90a34aac74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ajgHiOEkCVqapEnx.TQFnzndhIvTxKbjneZIJxrhxxqPwbB_Xzf48_yszPixD4CfxyCjsnTkbEA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "Entertainment calendar for week of Dec. 7-13.", "text": "Entertainment calendar for week of Dec. 7-13.

Photo contributed by Northern California Ballet By Verda Mackay, Correspondent # Comments \nParadise >> A chill is in the air. Festive music entertains shoppers as they happily anticipate the holiday season. It is also that time again for \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d ballet. \nThis classic Christmas story and fairy tale ballet will be performed for its 29th year by Northern California Ballet. \nUnder the artistic direction and choreography of Trudi Angel, Northern California Ballet will delight audiences with the artistry of this beloved ballet Dec. 15-17. \nThe opening performance will be at 7:15 p.m. on Dec. 15. The next day, performances will be held at 2:15 p.m. and 7:15 p.m. On the final day, Dec. 17, the show will begin at 2:15 p.m. All shows are at the Paradise Performing Arts Center. \n\u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d was written in 1891 by famed Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It debuted in 1892 at the Mariinsky Theatre in Russia and has become one of his most popular works. \n\u201cThere will be a surprise ending to this magnificent ballet,\u201d Angel said. \u201cSo many people who are novices to the ballet world do not understand that, not just the \u2018Nutcracker,\u2019 but any of the classics has just one composer. Ballets are just like they were 100 years ago. Most of the choreography, other than the \u2018Nutcracker,\u2019 stays exactly the same.\u201d \nThe enchanting story of the \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d begins in Herr Drosselmeyer\u2019s workshop where he is busy finishing Christmas toys to bring to the party at the home of his niece, Clara. He proudly shows the toys to his nephew, Franz. \nPreparations are underway in the home of Clara\u2019s parents, Herr and Frau Stahlbaum, for a festive Victorian Christmas Eve party in their home. \nClara (Kayleigh Newson) and her mischievous little brother, Fritz (Thomas J. Newsom), welcome their uncle Herr Drosselmeyer (Trevor Hartt). Among the presents he brings is an unusual Nutcracker doll for Clara. Fritz becomes jealous and breaks the Nutcracker, but Drosselmeyer manages to repair him. After the party is over and all is quiet, Clara tiptoes into the darkened living room to enjoy her Nutcracker doll. She falls asleep, and in her dreams a battle takes place between mice led by Mouse King (Alan White) and toy soldiers commanded by the Nutcracker (Andrew Davidson). \nTriumphant in battle, the Nutcracker is transformed into a charming prince. He takes Clara on a mystical journey through the land of the Snow Queen (Grace Rosindin) and the Magic Kingdom, home of the Sugar Plum Fairy (Kira Hickman). The Sugar Plum Fairy entertains Clara and the Prince with dancers and treats from foreign lands. Even mother Ginger and her Bon Bons get into the act. \nThe Russian act gives a wonderful performance by Sarah Witten, Lacey Witten and John Newsom. \nWhen the time comes for Clara to return to her home, she awakes holding the Nutcracker and wondering if it was all just a fantastic dream. Advertisement \nGuest artist Roberto Lara who dances with notable ballet companies in New York City, dances the roles of Sugar Plum Cavalier and Snow Cavalier. \nMany local citizens take part in the performance. They join a cast of 63, ages 6 to 65. \nCostume design and construction is by Nila Coats, assisted by Grace Rosindin.

Es gibt ihn aber auch als Desktop-Version . Die Aktion hat Tradition: 2004 hatte das Unternehmen erstmals die Weihnachtsmann-Route im Browser angezeigt. \nDer Ursprung des Santa Trackers \nDer urspr\u00fcngliche Santa Tracker ist sogar noch \u00e4lter: Der US-Versandh\u00e4ndler Sears hatte im Jahre 1955 Kinder aufgefordert, den Weihnachtsmann zu kontaktieren. Auf ihrem Werbeplakat hatte die Firma aber die falsche Nummer abgedruckt \u2013 und zwar die des nordamerikanischen Luft- und Weltraum-Verteidigungskommandos (NORAD). Damit die Kinder nicht entt\u00e4uscht w\u00fcrden, ordnete NORAD an, den Kindern am Telefon die fiktive Position von Santa Claus zu verraten. 2004 wurde diese Tradition von Google \u00fcbernommen. \n\nDiesmal mit Coding-Spiel \nMittlerweile erf\u00e4hrst Du in Googles Santa Tracker auch, wie das frohe Fest in anderen L\u00e4ndern gefeiert wird. In diesem Jahr neu dabei ist ein Coding-Spiel, dass Dir helfen k\u00f6nnte, sp\u00e4ter eine eigene App zu entwickeln. \nGoogle Assistant & Alexa nach dem Weihnachtsmann fragen \nWo sich Santa Claus befindet, kannst Du am 24. Dezember auch die Assistenten von Google und Amazon fragen: Beim Google Assistant geht das auf Deutsch, bei Alexa musst Du zuerst den Skill \u201eNORAD Tracks Santa\u201c installieren \u2013 bei dem die Assistentin aber nur auf Englisch kommunizieren kann. \n\nMit welchen Tech-Spielereien vers\u00fc\u00dft Du Dir denn Deine Adventszeit?

After royal assent and other formalities, the law will likely take effect in about a month, with the first weddings expected about a month later. \nAmendments meant to safeguard freedoms of speech and religion for gay-marriage opponents were all rejected, though those issues may be considered later. \n___ \n3 p.m. \nGay rights advocates have celebrated outside Australia's Parliament House in anticipation of same-sex marriage being legalized within hours. \nScores of men and women joined in singing on Thursday ahead of what is scheduled to be Parliament's final sitting day of the year. \nThe House of Representatives is widely expected to vote to allow same-sex marriage across the nation. \nThe Senate passed the same legislation last week 43 votes to 12. \nThe only potential obstacle to the law passing on Thursday would be if marriage equality opponents managed to amend the legislation. The amended legislation would then have to go back to the Senate for ratification. \nGay marriage was endorsed by 62 percent of Australian voters who responded to a government-commissioned postal ballot last month.

Official travel is being restricted to \u201cessential travel,\u201d which will be taken only \u201cwith additional security,\u201d the message states. The State Department previously issued a travel warning for Israel on April 11, which cautions that \u201cthe possibility of random violence continues to exist and can happen without warning.\u201d On Wednesday, Trump officially declared the disputed city of Jerusalem al-Quds as Israel's capital, despite warnings from around the world that the measure risks triggering a fresh wave of violence in the Middle East. In a speech at the White House, Trump said his administration would also begin a process of moving the American embassy in Tel Aviv to the holy city, which is expected to take years. \"I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\" Trump said. \"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.\" The announcement was a major shift by Washington that overturns decades of US foreign policy.

At over 19 hours in length, The Time in Between is at least the length of two average length romance audiobooks. Moreover, KA can always be counted on to deliver an intricate storyline with complex secondary characters who are sure to weave in a whole other element to the story above and beyond just the featured romance (which in this case follows the second chance at romance trope). The Time In Between was no exception and worked as the perfect choice for a solo long car trip that I recently took as it allowed me to get engrossed in the story, helping the monotonous driving time to fly by. As a bonus, new-to-me narrator Erin Mallon did a magnificent job with the narration, making this title a must listen. \nAs this is the third book in the Magdalene series, I want to confirm that a reading or listening of the prior titles is not necessary because this story functions well as a complete standalone. In fact, this is the first book that I have read or listened to in this series, and I had no trouble following the storyline even with its KA/characteristically large cast. \nThe blurb for this story is admittedly vague, and no doubt it\u2019s for a reason, as the beauty of this story lies in part in its unfolding. That being the case, I will keep my background of the story brief, so as not to taint or spoil the experience for you. Suffice it to say that Cady Moreland has not had an easy life. She was always looking for acceptance from her family that never seemed to come. Then one day she met the perfect man, even if the exact specifics of his situation were less than ideal. Cady accepted him and grew to feel love for the first time, until an unexpected revelation pulls the rug from under her and causes her to flee that situation. \nFortunately for Cady she was able to find true acceptance and love in the time thereafter, even if her heart still longed for Coert Yeager. Then when her life takes another life changing turn many years later, she decides to move to Magdalene Maine, where Coert has relocated and serves as the town\u2019s sheriff. Only problem is: Coert hasn\u2019t forgiven Cady for leaving all those years ago. \nWhy did Cady leave? Was their love all those years ago an act? Even if not, with all the time that passed in between, including all the life experiences that have further molded who they are today, could there possibly be a second chance at a HEA? \nSee the full review at AudioGals.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erin mallon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristen ashley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cady moreland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coert yeager", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magdalene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cady", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coert", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "audiogals", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "magdalene maine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:36.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "74593c5b6b026739a15d55e509c797f65df0bfee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQ7dljjUA6Sp5rmhfBU1brLKrE2KQsT2NdCe2532_vM5b7F5RQRfhx_SbUtkbXQYw-", "site_full": "badly-knitted.livejournal.com", "site": "livejournal.com", "site_section": "http://badly-knitted.livejournal.com/data/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "badly_knitted's Fluff Emporium", "title": "Drabble: Something Strong", "title_full": "Drabble: Something Strong", "published": "2017-12-06T19:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/sign.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "74593c5b6b026739a15d55e509c797f65df0bfee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQ7dljjUA6Sp5rmhfBU1brLKrE2KQsT2NdCe2532_vM5b7F5RQRfhx_SbUtkbXQYw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T19:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "Drabble: Something Strong", "text": "tw100 .

Photo contributed by Chico Performances By Verda Mackay, Correspondent # Comments \nChico >> When the world-renowned Christmas concert \u201cHandel\u2019s Messiah\u201d returned to Chico two years ago after a 40 year absence, audiences were mesmerized and hoped it would return again. \nThose wishes are granted on Dec. 16, 7:30 p.m. and Dec. 17, at 2 p.m. The North Valley Chamber Choral will present Handel\u2019s unforgettable, \u201cMessiah,\u201d in partnership with Chico Performances in Laxson Auditorium. \nUnder the baton of artistic director David Scholz, the choral will be joined in the performance by professional soloists and instrumentalists. \n\u201cI was asked why I want to bring this to the Chico community,\u201d Scholz said. \u201c\u2018Handel\u2019s Messiah\u2019 takes a group of singers and instrumentalists to bring to life. The one thing that draws us all together is the love of singing and of music.\u201d \nGeorge Frideric Handel was one of the greatest composers of the late baroque period of 1700-50. During his lifetime, this British composer was one of the most internationally famous of all musicians. In 1742 Handel wrote, \u201cMessiah,\u201d the work for which he is best known. It was first performed in Dublin, Ireland. \n\u201cThe \u2018Messiah\u2019 is actually in three parts,\u201d Scholz explained. \u201cWe won\u2019t be performing the whole concert as it is over three hours long. Part one is the Christmas portion of it. We will be doing the Christmas portion, and then the death and resurrection which ends with the \u2018Hallelujah Chorus,\u2019 so it\u2019s a celebration of the resurrection of Christ.\u201d \nThis inspirational concert features 46 singers, ages 22-80, from the North Valley Chamber Chorale and the community. A 16-piece instrumentalist group will provide the music. \nProfessional soloist are soprano Dara Kirchofner Scholz, tenor Daniel Ebbers, bass Robert Knight and mezzo-soprano Hannah Ludwig. \n\u201cHandel\u2019s Messiah\u201d includes such holiday classics as \u201cFor Unto Us a Child is Born,\u201d\u201cEvery Valley,\u201d\u201cRejoice Greatly,\u201d\u201cThe Trumpet Shall Sound\u201d and the famed \u201cHallelujah Chorus.\u201d \nPre-concert lectures by David Scholz will take place one hour before for ticket holders. \n\u201cI have a whole series of slides and musical examples,\u201d Scholz said, \u201cbecause the composition history of \u201cMessiah\u201d is interesting. Composers in that day and age would steal from themselves and other composers.\u201d Advertisement \nTickets are $30 premium, $22 adult, $20 senior, $12 youth, $10 Chico State Student.

All current members of the European Union are invited to the meeting. The meeting is held in Rome. All members of the EU can vote on issues, discuss, and make proposals. This European Union meeting will last until 1970 Death to the Federation Edit \nBritish Proposal: The Federation of the Americas must be destroyed at once. It is time that this excuse for a democracy (that supports nationalism, may I add) is broken up once and for all. We think that now would be the best time to take them down since they are distracted in Southeast Asia and have lost a large amount of their armed forces. First we will take the Netherlands since that is our main priority at the moment. We will lead an invasion (along with the United States, NATO, and the British Commonwealth whom I am sure would be eager to join) of the east coast surrounding Brazil and Northern South America. The UK will continue to distract them with the war over British Borneo and the USA with Indonesia. Since no rules have been made for nuclear weapons we will each launch one at a designated time on key Federation areas. We will bomb and overthrow Federation forces in Cuba. Should Spain revolt and begin attacking us we will surround them and begin a naval blockade. French, Portuguese and Andorran armies will invade them until they surrender. It is unlikely that Turkey will attack but if it does we will bomb the country and send nuclear warheads via Israel. Israel will cut off Saudi Arabia's passage through to Europe. South Africa and India will most likely not attack since they are peaceful nations and part of the Commonwealth. Add more terms and talk about this in support and please think about it very carefully before you oppose and if you do give good logical reasons for doing so. Forget about all these terms for now since this operation has not been set in stone. Voting: CLOSED Edit \nSupport: The United Kingdom: Too long this beast has looked down on the European Powers and thought of us as nothing but weak, crumbling, empires. We refuse to allow this nation to condescend us any longer. Italy: Though reluctant to do so, we agree with the idea, though for different reasons. Italy was never one of the European powers, so if it was resentful to anyone for mocking its strength, it would probably be the very people it's currently allied with. However, there already is a world war going on, and the US and the Federation have already caused untold amounts of destruction throughout East Asia. This may lead to devastation to both sides, but that devastation has already become inevitable. We act now or we wait for this war to stop, which will take many more years and thousands more casualties. This ends here. The Federation stops its aggression or it feels the might of those it has threatened and mocked as weak. VIVA EUROPA! \nOppose: French Dip: The French warn that this will only lead to tragedy and put their foot down. Should the UK go to war with the Federation they are on their own. We should focus on bringing the rest of the Europe into the EU umbrella and from there project our power abroad like in the old days. Italy Dip: If you want to prevent another world war, you're out of luck. The best we can hope for is to make it end as quickly as possible by forcing a Federation surrender now instead of in ten years. Germany: We don't want to be involved in a foreign war. British Diplomacy: We do agree with France that we should focus on the Netherlands foremost and the EU also but the Federation is a venom that is slowly eating away at our beautiful planet. Allowing it to continue its reign of terror is foolish. Everyone stands against whether they state it or not. North America hates them. (Most of) the Commonwealth hates them. And I know that we all hate them. The Federation has an army of only 400,000 (with half that in Indonesia currently suffering from casualties. Only around 200,000 are still in the mainland making this a perfect opportunity), only half that of the United Kingdom's, but facing the Federation alone is suicide. We can not sit back and continue to watch as they feed nationalism and separatists movements in perfectly stable colonies. Don't believe me? Just look at Southeast Asia! The Federation (and SDP for that matter) pushed and continues to push us out of the area leading to major instability. We admit it may have been ambitious to think that we could very easily take them down but please do consider embargoing and placing sanctions on them as a first step for now. Update: It has been confirmed that the USA will join the operation. This is pretty much what I told him (I'm only putting it up here to add some reasons as to why we should strike the FoA now): H ey I was wondering if you would be willing to help in a possible invasion of the Federation of the Americas. Before you say no hear me out. 1) The Federation currently has around 400,000 soldiers according to the nation page, half of which are currently in Indonesia and suffering from severe casualties. Meanwhile, we have about 800,000 troops and only about 50,000 are in Southeast Asia. We do not know how many soldiers you have but we do know that we already outnumber the remaining Federation forces in the mainland. 2) They are ultra-nationalists and think they are the superior superpower. This facade must end and true democracy needs to become dominant once again in South America. 3) International support. I am still trying to work on getting members of the EU to get on board (I am sure that Israel and Portugal would probably be eager to become involved in the conflict since the Federation and members of the SDP have wronged them). But I know for a fact that the British Commonwealth, Canada and Australia in particular, hate the Federation and are in extremely strategic locations. 4) We have the upper hand in nuclear weaponry although I hope and pray that this would not have to be used but since no one wishes to meet and make rules for the use of them we could possibly use them (but it is very doubtful). 5) If you are willing to do this we will help in rebuilding the nations after the Federation breaks up. 6) Cuba should be our first place to start. Once it is taken it can become a territory of the USA or an independent nation once again (after this we can begin an invasion of the East coast of the Federation while Australia secures Mexico since they most likely will join in the battle). We hope you consider this as this is the perfect time to attack them. They are at their weakest and currently distracted by us in Sabah and you in Indonesia. It is time we crushed the monster that is the Federation of the Americas. \nOutcome: France went and told anybody so it's doubtful that this will ever happen but it needs to. The Federation needs to stop butting into European Affairs that it has no business being a part of. Acting in the Best Interest of the European Union Edit \nFrench Proposal: Over the last decade or so the EU has become too aggressive to maintain a united front with so many different geopolitical goals. The French propose that each member state of the European Union be allowed to enact their own foreign policy independent of majority decisions but to maintain a common defence of Europe should it be threatened by external forces (i.e., one of the other major powers.) Paris also proposes that there be no distinction between founding nations and countries that joined the union later as this gives to much influence to the British. On a final note the The French propose that the European Union distance itself a bit from the greater conflicts occurring amongst democracies and focus more on bringing the Eastern European countries into the Euro sphere and away from Soviet oppression. Voting: CLOSED \nSupport France The United Kingdom: We think that your ideas are good but policies regarding the SDP should all be agreed upon and enacted by every EU member (i.e., ending trade between us and Saudi Arabia in order to crush them and the SDP). And we've had no higher influence in the EU but we have been acting like the de facto head of it so we apologise for that. Other than that we completely agree with your proposal. The European Union should stay out of any conflict that is not taking place in Europe but in order for us to do this we must end the conflict in the Indonesian area first, which we need help in doing so. Italy: We do agree with the idea that Europe should maintain a common defense in the face of a major power, though it should be agreed upon that all of Europe is threatened by said power and that all of Europe is willing to contribute (where all of Europe, in this case, pertains mostly to the EU).

We will be working in partnership with Brighton and Hove News and its editor Frank le Duc to provide the Brighton coverage. \nWith print and digital titles covering every part of the county, Sussex Newspapers has 1.4m unique browsers each month and hundreds of thousands of weekly print readers. It is part of Johnston Press which has led the way in developing the ground-breaking national scheme with the BBC under the direction of chief executive Ashley Highfield. \nContracts to employ an initial 144 full-time and two part-time Local Democracy Reporters have been allocated to 58 news organisations in England, Scotland and Wales following a competitive bidding process. \nThose news organisations - ranging from a radio station to online media companies and established regional newspaper groups - will now receive funding from the BBC to cover employment costs of the reporters. \nOnce recruited, stories written by the democracy reporters will be shared with more than 700 media organisations that have signed up to be part of the Local News Partnerships scheme. \nDavid Holdsworth, Controller of BBC English Regions, said: \u201cThis is a major advance in the partnership which will significantly improve the reporting on councils and public institutions, leading to greater public accountability for our local politicians.\u201d \nAs part of its Charter commitment, the BBC is investing up to \u00a38m annually in the Local News Partnerships during the next nine years to the end of the Charter in 2026. \nThe landmark partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association also includes a Shared Data Unit, based at BBC Birmingham, and a facility allowing local news providers access to relevant regional BBC video and audio content. \nThe Shared Data Unit will utilise BBC teams and seconded journalists from the wider industry to develop data journalism expertise. The first regional journalists to be seconded started on November 20. \nAshley Highfield, chair of the News Media Association and chief executive of Johnston Press - publisher of this title - said: \u201cThe ground-breaking Local News Partnership between the NMA and the BBC is now becoming a reality which will benefit the BBC, local media and, most importantly, local communities.\u201d \n\u201cThe initiative has moved the whole relationship between the BBC and the local media sector from confrontation to collaboration, and key benefits will include 150 new journalists on the ground holding public institutions to account on behalf of their readers. \n\u201cManaged by local media and funded by BBC, the Local Democracy Reporters are just a part of a slew of collaborative initiatives that will see local media get access to BBC\u2019s local video and data journalism.\u201d \nTo be awarded the democracy reporter contracts, the 58 successful news organisations had to pass stringent criteria which included financial stability and a strong track record of relevant journalism in the area they were applying to cover. \nThe award decisions were made by senior editorial BBC figures across the English regions, Wales and Scotland. \nIn areas where a single contract contained multiple reporters, some successful bidders opted to share the allocation with neighbouring news organisations. \nThe next step will be for the successful organisations to start recruiting, with a view to becoming operational in the next few months. \nA total of 150 local democracy reporters will eventually be employed once all contracts have been awarded.

Christopher Logan said it had no plans at present to pursue the voluntary or mandatory evacuation of dependents of troops stationed in South Korea. Logan also said it had no intention of altering its policy of approving family members to accompany USFK troops. Amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula after North Korea\u2019s Nov. 29 test-launch of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), Graham said in a Dec. 3 appearance on CBS that it was \u201ccrazy to send spouses and children to South Korea, given the provocation of North Korea.\u201d Graham also said he would demand that the Defense Department stop permitting dependents to accompany USFK troops.

On Friday, 24 November 2017, 235 final-year medical students, dressed in their finest and supported by friends and family, took the oath of their profession at a ceremony held in the Aula on the Hatfield Campus, thus taking the first step on their journey as medical professionals. \nAccording to Prof Tiaan de Jager, Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences, the ceremony is a highlight of the academic year and a life-changing experience for medical students. 'What students learn while studying at UP puts them at the forefront of their discipline and at the frontier of research and clinical practice. Health Sciences is the most rapidly developing Faculty with respect to academic excellence,' he says. \nProf Jannie Hugo, Head of the Department of Family Medicine at UP, welcomed the students to the event, saying that he had every confidence that each student in the group was qualified to perform equally well in an operating theatre, on a visit to a patient in an informal settlement, or in any other situation that they might be presented with. \nProf Hugo was followed by Prof Dianne Manning, Deputy Dean: Education in the Faculty of Health Sciences, who addressed the students ahead of the oath-taking ceremony. Prof Manning opened her address with a famous quote by LP Hartley, a British novelist and short story writer: 'The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.' She explained that, as this occasion was all about the future, and in light of the uncertain times that we live in, it was perhaps appropriate to rephrase Hartley's famous words and say: 'The future is a foreign country: they do things differently there.' \nProf Manning said that although the graduands now had the skills required to practise in this noble and honourable profession, they are part of a generation of doctors who enter the profession in a time of enormous complexity and uncertainty. She went on to explain that despite the uncertain times we live in, she believes the training that this high-performing group of new doctors received over the years has not only provided them with the specific knowledge and skills to ensure that they excel, but that it will also imbue them with resilience, flexibility, creativity and adaptability, which will allow them to thrive in today's ever-changing world. Prof Manning continued by saying she had no doubt that all of them had the skills, ability and passion to take their careers forward in whichever direction they chose. She concluded her address by saying: 'When I said, \"the future is a foreign country\", I think that what I actually should have said was that you are the future.' \nProf Gerhard Lindeque, Deputy Dean of the Faculty, and Chair of the School of Medicine at UP, talked about the importance of trust and ethics in the health profession before leading the students in the taking of the oath of their profession. This emotional part of the ceremony concluded with each student being invited onto the stage to sign a statement of their oath and to be acknowledged for their academic performance during their years of study. Judging by their reactions, there were more than a few very proud parents, friends and other family members in the audience, some of whom travelled a long way to share in the students' big moment. \nThe University extends its heartfelt congratulations to the newest group of doctors in South Africa.

The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.
