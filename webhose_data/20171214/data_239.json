Mahesh Prabhu \nA few generations before the time of the Mahabharata War, King Shantanu of Hastinapur's first wife was a princess named Ganga. While there are mythical stories about her representing the greatest river of Indian subcontinent, the Ganga herself, Vyasa never mentions this. Captivated by her stunning beauty, Shantanu desired her hand in marriage \u2013 she accepted on one condition: that he would never question her in any of her decisions or actions, whatever they might be. Shantanu, hastily, agreed.\nAfter the marriage, as soon as his wife Ganga gave birth to king's first son, heir apparent to the throne, the lactating mother drowned the child in the water, a most unexpected and unacceptable act under any normal circumstances. The reason wasn't clear. But that Shantanu kept quiet for the fear of losing his wife is certain. The same tragedy occurred every time a child was born; the mother drowned each child. This dytsmhr incident continued all the way until the birth of seventh child \u2013 Devavrata. Shantanu was no more able to hold on to his fury and lambasted her for her savage act. \"How could you do this to your own children?\" True to her earlier words, Ganga left the king taking the son with her, with a promise that she'd return him at the right moment.\nYears passed since the bizarre incident. During this period Shantanu spent all his time and energy working for the welfare of his subjects. His steadfast commitment to his work ensured peace and prosperity in his country. He seldom saw any woman and remained celibate.\nOnce Devavrata came of age, Ganga returned him to Shantanu as he was rightful heir to the throne of Hastinapura. Shantanu's happiness knew no bounds. He declared him as crown prince with pomp and grandeur. The elderly king was pleased that his heir was a worthy one. Devavrata was a strong person of intelligence and capacity. His bravery was unmatched. His knowledge of scriptures was insurmountable. Shanti Parva of Mahabharata speaks volumes about his colossal knowledge. He was just the kind of successor every king would dream of.\nA few years passed. Shantanu was very old by then. He was on a hunting expedition when he accidentally lost his way. He was on his chariot with his charioteer. After some time, he found a beautiful damsel named Matsyagandha. Matsyagandha in Sanskrit means \"a girl smelling fish\". But she smelled anything but fish. This was owing to some strange gift from an older sage person named Parashara with whom she had an encounter and, also, a son.\nParashara was desirous of an heir to carry on his work forward but didn't want to get settled with any ordinary woman. Marriage during the time of the Mahabharata wasn't the marriage of today. It was not an exclusive physically as well as emotional binding arrangement for \"seven lives\". It meant companionship. There even happened to be the concept of Gandharva-Vivaha \u2013 marriage by sheer and truthful acceptance of each other without any ceremony, huge functions or feasts. If you felt loved and committed \u2013 you were as good as married. Be that as it may, after her fling with Parashara \u2013 Matsyagandha's grace and outlook changed. Her son with Parashara was none other than \u2013 author of Mahabharata \u2013 Vyasa himself!\nWhen Matsyagandha met Shantanu, she was about the same age as Devavrata \u2013 Shantanu's son. Yet entranced by her beauty Shantanu wasted no time to propose her. He asked her hand in marriage. She grew apprehensive at first, knowing nothing about the old man. But to ensure she wasn't blunt \u2013 she suggested him to talk about the marriage arrangement to her father. The father after listening to Shantanu spent some time with his daughter and presented but one condition for marriage. That was \"Matsyagandha's sons will descend the throne.\" It was something Shantanu couldn't do. After all, how could a father who himself made his only son his crown prince ask him then to step down? It was hard for him to say either yes or no. He returned to his capital city with a heavy heart. His face was filled with sadness and remorse.\nDevavrata didn't take long to notice his father's changed state and inquired him about the reason. There was no satisfactory answer. But astute Devavrata questioned his father's charioteer and soon learnt the reason for his father's distress. Devavrata met the Matsyagandha and her father. He asked for her hand for his own father! On hearing the condition \u2013 he wasted little time to renounce his title of \"crown prince\" to make way for sons of Matsyagandha to take the throne.\nBut the fisherman still wasn't happy at that. \"What if your sons grow up and make claim to the throne?\" Devavrata tried to reason with fisherman. But the latter was not to be assuaged without substantial assurance. Devavrata then made his foremost vow, \"Never will I marry nor will I ever father sons \u2013 I'll remain celibate from this day onwards. And if that is not enough\u2026\" he declared fiercely \"I'll promise to stay dedicated to the the protection of throne of Hastinapur and to anyone who'll be seated on it.\" His truthfulness and absolute undeterred words convinced the fisherman and he finally agreed to give his daughter's hand in marriage to Shantanu. For his fierce vows Devavrata was thereafter known as Bhishma.\nShantanu was happy as well as shocked. Happy because he had his desired wife \u2013 sad because his beloved son had relinquished his claim to the throne. The marriage happened and Satyavati bore not one but two sons in rather quick succession \u2013 Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. Shantanu died no much time after the birth of Vichitravirya.\nChitrangada, the strongest of the sons, died in his early twenties in a battle. Vichitravirya, who remained physically and emotionally weak, was put on the throne by Bhishma. But it was Bhishma who ran all the affairs of the state along with the regent queen Matsyagandha \u2013 who was renamed Satyavati after marriage with Shantanu.\nVichitravirya wasn't an appealing person and women didn't fall for him. It happened such that King of Kashi announced Swayamvara \u2013 a practice of choosing a husband, from among a list of suitors by a girl of marriageable age \u2013 of his three daughters, named: Amba, Ambika and Ambalika \u2013 he intentionally didn't invite Vichitravirya. This infuriated Bhishma and he took upon himself to abduct the three girls by his brute force. After he took them to Hastinapur and asked them to marry Vichitravirya \u2013 Amba refused. Bhishma let her go.\nBut remaining two \u2013 Ambika and Ambalika \u2013 didn't have a long marriage with the weak king and produced no heirs. As a result, the successor to the throne of Hastinapura was in question. Satyavati asked Bhishma to take upon himself to marry the two queens and produce children to the throne. But Bhishma was a man of his words. He refused. \"But what is the use of your vow for my sons are gone and the throne of Hastinapura is in question?\" asked Satyavati to Bhishma. \"My vow was not conditional \u2013 it was and will be absolute,\" Bhishma replied.\nSatyavati then asked for her first son out of wedlock fathered by Parashara \u2013 Vyasa \u2013 to impregnate the widowed queens.\nThere's a crucial lesson for everyone in this story. Satyavati and her father's lust for influence and power was hardly enduring. To ensure safe path to throne for her future sons Matsyagandha a.k.a. Satyavati made Bhishma swear a vow and stripped him of his right to sons, family as well as companionship. When her sons were born both failed to live long enough to father children. And in a desperate measure she had to ask her pervious son with Parashara to impregnate her daughters-in-law. Even those sons had defects. Dhritarashtra was blind \u2013 Pandu often had health issues. What was all that debacle of Satyavati achieve in the end?\nWe often assume and presume things. We think that if we get something we want that we will be happy. But happiness does not reside in things \u2013 it's in the mind. If your mind is happy \u2013 you are best suited to ascertain right objectives, assess your prevalent situations and accomplish it effectively.\nBut Matsyagandha a.k.a. Satyavati's vision was a mirage \u2013 blind lust for influence and power. She saw a threat in Bhishma to her own sons before marriage \u2013 after her sons had died she tried her best to convince Bhishma into marriage. Bhishma was right to turn down her quest on moral grounds, but, if not for Bhishma the throne of Hastinapura would have been lost. Though without a competent king \u2013 people were content with the fact that it was under regency of a competent man who let go of his right to throne for the love of his father, namely Bhishma. Selflessness made Bhishma into a great man whom everyone revered. But he was bound by his vow and in the end, he was forced to lead an army of Kauravas against Pandavas to protect the throne of Hastinapura. He was a spiritual father to both \u2013 Kauravas as well as Pandavas. Since he had sworn allegiance to the throne and neither Dhritarashtra nor his sons would follow his advice, he reluctantly fell into a war against those whom he didn't want to fight. Of course, that didn't save the throne for the Kauravas either. All this arose from the vanity of Satyavati and the old desires of Shantanu that reflect the weaknesses of kings.\nWe often think we know what we want. Yet we forget that we'll have more respect for something only when it's not there or when it is lost. We're are all mortal with frailties \u2013 we don't live long enough to see the consequences of our own actions \u2013 just like Matsyagandha a.k.a. Satyavati. Had Satyavati let Bhishma be the successor \u2013 the situation would have been very different. Or maybe it would have been something else. But that's not the point. \"The wise don't regret for what has happened or worry about that is to happen. They live in the present and learn from the past mistakes of themselves as well as others, and always strive to take a path that is righteous \u2013 Dharma.\" says Vyasa.\nThe Mahabharata is more about exposing human weaknesses than any hagiography or glorification of mere human personalities. It shows us what our deep-seated limitations are and how to correct them, should we be willing to make the great labour to do so. Nothing in life comes easy, without examination, or without determination.

Although focused on US GAAP, we believe that the results are equally informative about likely implementation experience under IFRS. \nThe survey shows that most companies have now started implementation efforts, although projects are still being hindered by competing priorities with the new revenue standard implementation efforts. \nNoteworthy is that 60 percent of companies indicated that they have been surprised by some of the challenges they are running up against, including identifying leases and selecting and deploying an adequate lease tool. And nearly 40 percent of companies reported more intensive implementation efforts than planned \u2013 the top reason being the need for new lease accounting software. \nBecause the IFRS and US GAAP versions of the new leases standard are different, US companies that report under both GAAPs face an even bigger challenge. With that in mind, we summarize here the key practical issues that dual reporters should consider in the early stage of their lease implementation project. \nWhat is the population of leases? \nA critical issue is to identify a company\u2019s complete population of leases. Some companies may have good repositories of lease agreements in place. But it may not be readily apparent that many arrangements not explicitly called \u2018lease agreements\u2019 may include embedded lease components that need to be included in that population as well. \nThis step is equally important for implementing both the US GAAP and IFRS leases standards because the definition of a lease is converged, and the need to identify embedded leases is pivotal to both US GAAP and IFRS. However, the number of leases accounted for on-balance sheet under IFRS may be smaller because of the \u2018low-value items\u2019 practical expedient in IFRS 16 [1] , which is an exemption a company can take on a lease-by-lease basis. Because there is no equivalent of this practical expedient in ASC 842, some dual reporters may decide not to take this exemption under IFRS to decrease the number of differences between US GAAP and IFRS reporting. \nWhat will be your approach to implementation? \nAs with any accounting standard implementation, even before identifying the lease population, a company needs to decide how to approach the project: using a centralized, decentralized or hybrid approach. \nThe answer mainly depends on the company\u2019s organizational structure and corporate culture, as well as the number of locations and complexity of potential lease transactions. A centralized approach may help achieve greater efficiency in terms of knowledge and consistency, but may place a greater burden on the centralized team and may require longer implementation time. A decentralized approach allows the implementation work to be allocated among multiple teams having local business knowledge and local language abilities in multiple locations, but requires greater effort to develop a standardized implementation process and instructions to minimize inconsistencies. A hybrid approach combines elements of the above two approaches, spreading the work effort but allowing key parts of the analysis to be done by a centralized team. \nWhat technology will you deploy? \nAnother challenge is to find the right technology solution that will address both operational and accounting concerns. Historically, many companies may have had a lease administration tool for real estate leases, but non-real estate leases may not be in any coordinated accounting-based solution. Depending on how (or whether) relevant data are currently captured and stored, a company may need to determine whether the technology can be used to recognize and capture key lease terms, and handle accounting and reporting under both US GAAP and IFRS. \nThe answers will affect how the project implementation is conducted and staffed. For dual reporters, finding the right technology solution will be an important consideration because there are significant differences on day two lessee accounting for operating leases [2] that will require separate tracking for leases that have a different classification under US GAAP versus IFRS. \nHave you started education and communication? \nBecause of the challenges involved in the implementation process, it is very important to start education and communication with key stakeholders early. Timely education and communication will be the critical step in decision-making about the right technology solutions, respective budget approvals and allocating the right resources to the implementation project, which will have a direct effect on the success of the project. \nWhat KPMG resources are available? \nResource ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

deWitt Do you have a point you\u2019d like to make or an issue you feel strongly about? Submit a letter to the editor or a guest column. Bob Perry\u2019s guest column in The Bulletin on Nov. 8 presented an excellent analysis of the funding of climate change research. He noted the corruption of government-funded research, frequently based on discredited theories and models that point to anthropogenic global warming (AGW) and the role of carbon dioxide as a harmful gas. Perry correctly suggested the federal government, which has paid over $55 billion for climate change studies, should consider the funding sources for studies that purport to prove a connection between human activities and the climate. View More He cited examples of two studies used by the GAO in its report on government priorities \u201cto manage (climate change) risks.\u201d One such study was funded by Democrat billionaire activists Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg and the other by Obama\u2019s EPA. Another Obama legacy report that was released in November, the Climate Science Special Report prepared by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, is, according to climate specialist Dr. Gordon J. Fulks (Ph.D., physics), \u201cthe latest edition in a long line of government reports linking human emissions of carbon dioxide with just about every climate and weather event that we observe today.\u201d Fulks describes its \u201ccentral thesis \u2026 that we live in an age where weather and climate have gone substantially berserk, because we have added a little CO2 to the atmosphere, creating a \u2018runaway greenhouse effect.\u2019\u201d Noting the ludicrous nature of such a claim, Fulks argues: \u201cThe most basic physics of our climate points out that we live on a fluid planet with vast oceans and atmosphere that are never in equilibrium. Large variations from average climate are completely normal. When external forcing is applied, (such as) changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit, the great climate variations called Ice Ages come into play. Similarly, variations in solar irradiance and galactic cosmic rays probably play a role in our constantly changing climate. The primary scientific issue is the relative importance of the extraterrestrial effects to those within our terrestrial climate system.\u201d To contend, as AGW proponents do, that man has caused global warming and extreme weather events with higher levels of CO2 is a fraudulent distortion of historical data that prove the existence of much higher (and lower) temperatures during previous climate cycles. One only has to refer back to the Medieval Warming Period and the Little Ice Age to verify this fact. In fact, a recent study by the University of Alabama-Huntsville reveals the fallacy in the AGW activist position about the rate of warming and the relationship of CO2 to increasing temperatures. The study found that most climate models significantly overstate the rise in temperatures. According to an Investor\u2019s Business Daily report on the study, \u201cthe calculated value from the actual data (going back to 1880) are less than half\u201d what most climate models predict, 2 degrees Fahrenheit rather than 4.1. Using satellite data (the most accurate and comprehensive available) and correcting for temporary effects of volcanoes and El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a climate episodes, the study found that the rate of global warming was 0.096 degrees Celsius per decade, exactly what it was 23 years ago, despite significant increases in CO2. Forecasts \u201cof massive global warming based on rising levels of CO2\u201d are shown to be not only erroneous but also unscientific. The mendacious claims of the global warming/climate change alarmists are nothing more than a power grab and attempt to divert public funds to their pet AGW projects and studies. They falsely assert \u201c97 percent consensus\u201d among the scientific community on the relevance of human activity to climate change and global warming to try to shut down skeptics when the truth is that their conclusions cannot be supported by the scientific method (experimentation and peer review). They should be seen as what they are: a collection of special interest groups trying to drive governments to devote more and more finite financial resources to the chimera of man-caused global warming. \u2014 Paul deWitt lives in Bend. 18933574 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul dewitt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tom steyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fulks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 paul dewitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gordon j. fulks", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "agw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la ni\u00f1a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. global change research program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of alabama-huntsville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el ni\u00f1o", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:17.192+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a555d9fb357c5a06607a71b82dad97878dc4588", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcKC3ujgzzOJD6bohU3OeJ_xb8sJGbIaMq5EXKWIB1nsdxVogIm1B6IuZhfqNPMMnDLMQngtLLpveisQLLLiOe4dIbbAE9mbgi9D8qSMoju8EF0JlOzwJ2uA--", "site_full": "www.heraldscotland.com", "site": "heraldscotland.com", "site_section": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media", "climbing", "sports"], "section_title": "Politics | Herald Scotland", "title": "Unionist campaign splits over Brexit and second referendum", "title_full": "Unionist campaign splits over Brexit and second referendum | HeraldScotland", "published": "2017-12-07T07:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 27, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.132, "main_image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7151032/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "02b9e52b0f02881fac62b347d703019c28172e9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcKC3ujgzzOJD6bohU3OeJ_xb8sJGbIaMq5EXKWIB1nsdxVogIm1B6IuZhfqNPMMnDLMQngtLLpveisQLLLiOe4dIbbAE9mbgi9D8qSMoju8HTUCUzXq3dMvD8WYYxDw4e", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "frank anderson", "published": "2017-12-07T10:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Could they define the 'our country', as I fail to see what they are talking about.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:18.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a555d9fb357c5a06607a71b82dad97878dc4588", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcKC3ujgzzOJD6bohU3OeJ_xb8sJGbIaMq5EXKWIB1nsdxVogIm1B6IuZhfqNPMMnDLMQngtLLpveisQLLLiOe4dIbbAE9mbgi9D8qSMoju8EF0JlOzwJ2uA--", "site_full": "www.heraldscotland.com", "site": "heraldscotland.com", "site_section": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media", "climbing", "sports"], "section_title": "Politics | Herald Scotland", "title": "Unionist campaign splits over Brexit and second referendum", "title_full": "Unionist campaign splits over Brexit and second referendum | HeraldScotland", "published": "2017-12-07T07:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 27, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.132, "main_image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7151032/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b22742a20c009d7474e5e49974137409125064a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcKC3ujgzzOJD6bohU3OeJ_xb8sJGbIaMq5EXKWIB1nsdxVogIm1B6IuZhfqNPMMnDLMQngtLLpveisQLLLiOe4dIbbAE9mbgi9D8qSMoju8HTUCUzXq3dMqhjXHjZ53mO", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "Andrew McMillan", "published": "2017-12-07T10:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The unionist conservative status quo is steadily and understandibly crumbling in Scotland.

While it is unclear whether the homes would be built exactly on the proposed site of a new stadium, it certainly falls within the city's Green Belt. \nMr Colwell went on to talk about historic meetings with the farmer who owned land at Water Eaton adjacent to Oxford Parkway railway station, explaining that he \u2018had no interest in selling\u2019 and that the \u2018Cherwell District Council interest in this land was not for a football stadium or leisure.\u2019 \nWhen asked by Mr Eales whether there was ever a way of developing these sites, Mr Colwell and Ms Rees said \u2018it was hypothetical as neither site was possible, but that \u2018if\u2019 either were, then it would take a minimum of ten years\u2019. \nMr Hudspeth said at the meeting \u2018it was disappointing news, but that it was good to have clarity as these sites had generated media interest and they could now be discounted\u2019. \nWhen discussions moved on to other possible sites, Mr Colwell said: \u201cBoth West Oxfordshire District Council and most of South Oxfordshire District Council were highly unlikely to yield a suitable site. \n\u201cThe only interest in SODC that might be of interest would be close to the current stadium site on Grenoble Road.\u201d \nHe explained that \u2018the stadium was in Oxfordshire City Council territory, but the site the other side of the road, although owned by the City Council, was in fact South Oxfordshire DC territory. But that the land on the other side was earmarked for housing.\u2019 \nOther potential areas that could be large enough to include opportunities for additional commercial development were discussed, including Bicester. \nMr Hudspeth and Mr Colwell were approached for comment but both declined.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeremy faulkner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barry wood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yvonne rees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darryl eales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adrian colwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian hudspeth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eaton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hudspeth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "water eaton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oxford united", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cherwell district council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford mail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west oxfordshire district council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south oxfordshire district council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sodc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2018cherwell district council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stratfield brake", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kidlington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxfordshire city council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxfordshire county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cherwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "water eaton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green belt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south oxfordshire dc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kassam stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford parkway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stratfield brake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cherwell local plan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grenoble road", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:18.068+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a39333b29e5f9d582999cb41ba7e36c6b23a75d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRcFobIZDqbQz_8SgCEKFiRXh47hAlwzT36GfDa8gm5sNlr9SwiO1R7crMW6ggLitU-", "site_full": "tradingeconomics.com", "site": "tradingeconomics.com", "site_section": "http://www.tradingeconomics.com/rss/news.aspx?i=imports", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Trading Economics", "title": "Czech Republic Imports", "title_full": "Czech Republic Imports", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "tradingeconomics.com/charts/facebook.png?url=/czech-republic/imports", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8014, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6a39333b29e5f9d582999cb41ba7e36c6b23a75d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRcFobIZDqbQz_8SgCEKFiRXh47hAlwzT36GfDa8gm5sNlr9SwiO1R7crMW6ggLitU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Czech Statistical Office", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "Czech Republic Imports", "text": "Drag & drop charts and store your calendar preferences in a dashboard.

He went 27-47 in six seasons before the school fired him following a 3-9 record in 2012. In 2010, FIU won the Sun Belt title and went 8-5 the following year to reach bowl games in back-to-back seasons. Cristobal spent four seasons as the offensive line coach at Alabama, helping the Crimson Tide win the national title in 2015 before Alabama lost to Clemson in last year\u2019s championship game. Jim Leavitt: Taggart\u2019s first hire at Oregon as defensive coordinator, Leavitt helped the Ducks rank fourth in the Pac-12 in total defense (359.8 yards per game) and seventh in scoring defense (28.2 points per game) after they were 11th in both categories the previous year. He is expected to follow Taggart to FSU, but Mullens did not rule him out as a candidate Tuesday. Leavitt was hired to start South Florida\u2019s program at the FCS level from 1997 to 2000 before the Bulls moved to FBS in 2001. He went 95-57 in 13 seasons with five bowl appearances but was fired in 2010 after being accused of hitting a player. Leavitt sued the school and received $2.75 million. The ex-Ducks Jeff Tedford: Oregon\u2019s offensive coordinator during the Joey Harrington era from 1998 to 2001, Tedford moved to Cal, where he became the winningest coach in school history with 82 victories from 2002 to 2012. After Fresno State went 1-11 last year, Tedford returned to his alma mater \u2014 where he was offensive coordinator before coming to Oregon \u2014 and led the Bulldogs to a 9-4 record, including 7-1 mark in conference play to reach the Mountain West Conference title game. Justin Wilcox: The Junction City native and former Oregon defensive back went 5-7 at Cal this season in his first season as a head coach at any level. He also is a former defensive coordinator at Washington and USC, among other schools. One of the practice fields at Oregon is named after his family: both his father, Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker Dave, and brother Josh also starred for the Ducks. Another coordinator Beau Baldwin: Baldwin completed his first season as offensive coordinator at California after going 85-32 in nine seasons as head coach at Eastern Washington, including an FCS national title in 2010. He coached quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. for the Eagles before Adams transferred to Oregon in 2015. It seems unlikely that Oregon would hire a coach who was reportedly passed up by Oregon State. Group of 5 coaches Bryan Harsin: Hiring the Boise State coach would add some interest to the Las Vegas Bowl, where the Ducks will face the Broncos on Dec. 16. Harsin seems likely to get a Power 5 job soon after going 41-12 in four seasons as coach. He led Boise State to the MWC title for the second time this year with a 7-1 record in conference, going 10-3 overall and defeating Fresno State in last week\u2019s conference championship game. Mike Norvell: The former Arizona State offensive coordinator from 2012 to 2015 took Memphis to the American Athletic Association title game in his second year before losing to Central Florida, 62-55, in double overtime. Has gone 20-7 in two seasons with the Tigers, including a 7-1 conference record this season. Lane Kiffin: After Florida Atlantic went 3-9 last season, Kiffin was hired and led the Owls to a 10-3 mark and Conference USA championship. He spent the previous three seasons as offensive coordinator at Alabama, reaching the CFP championship game twice, including a national title in 2015. Attention and controversy seem to follow the 42-year-old, who coached the Oakland Raiders before taking over programs at Tennessee and USC, but Kiffin seems certain to be moving up to a bigger program soon. Fallen stars Kevin Sumlin: Sumlin went 51-26 in six seasons at Texas A&M before being fired last month after the Aggies finished 7-5. In his first season, Texas A&M went 11-2 and quarterback Johnny Manziel won the Heisman Trophy, but the Aggies never finished above .500 in Southeastern Conference play during his final five seasons. Sumlin\u2019s first coaching job came as a graduate assistant at Washington State in 1989, but he has spent the past 17 seasons coaching in Texas or Oklahoma. Considering Taggart fled to Florida after one season, Mullens may not want to bring in another coach who could leave for a southern school if he finds success with the Ducks. Butch Jones: Jones became one of the nation\u2019s top coaching candidates after going 19-6 at Cincinnati in 2011-12. Colorado wanted Jones before he chose Tennessee, which fired him after a 4-6 start this season. He won nine games the previous two seasons with the Volunteers and went 34-27 in five years on the job. Tennessee went winless in the SEC this year. Bret Bielema: Another coach who had plenty of success in the past but recently joined the unemployment line after going 4-8 at Arkansas, Bielema went 29-34 in five seasons with the Razorbacks, including an 11-29 record in the SEC. He won 68 games in seven seasons as coach at Wisconsin from 2006 to 2012 and led the Badgers to three straight Rose Bowls, including a 45-38 loss to Oregon in the 2012 game. Les Miles: Somebody is going to hire Miles, who won the national title at LSU in 2008 and was national coach of the year in 2011 when the Tigers lost to Alabama in the championship game. He went 114-34 in 12 seasons with the Tigers and has a 142-55 record, including four seasons at Oklahoma State. EUGENE \u2014 The Oregon Ducks quickly promoted Mario Cristobal to interim head coach for the Las Vegas Bowl after Willie Taggart left for Florida State on Tuesday. Cristobal, the former Florida International coach, appears to be one of many candidates for the full-time job.

View More Oregon athletic director Rob Mullens is seeking a football coach for the second year in a row after pulling Taggart out of South Florida last year only to see him head back home with the Seminoles after a 7-5 season with the Ducks. Mullens hired Taggart on Dec. 7 last year, eight days after firing Mark Helfrich. There is a greater sense of urgency this season because of the new NCAA early signing period for recruits that runs Dec. 20-22. Taggart compiled a recruiting class ranked No. 1 in the country by 247Sports.com, but after the coach\u2019s departure, Oregon has already lost some players who had committed to the program. Because of that, the next coach will have to be hired quickly to keep as many commitments as possible. Some candidates who might have intrigued Mullens are off the market, including former \u00adOregon offensive coordinator Scott Frost, who was hired by Nebraska on Saturday after he took Central Florida from winless to undefeated in two seasons. TCU\u2019s Gary Patterson has been rumored to be on Oregon\u2019s radar during each of the past two coaching searches because of his friendship with UO boosters Phil Knight and Pat Kilkenny. Patterson, however, just signed an extension through 2022 that will pay him nearly $5 million per year. Last year, Oregon reportedly showed interest in Florida coach Jim McElwain and Ohio State defensive coordinator Greg Schiano. They probably are not on Mullens\u2019 list this time: McElwain was fired in October when the Gators were 3-4. Tennessee was ready to hire Schiano last month before fans protested because he was on the staff at Penn State with former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted of sexually abusing children. 18945460 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sumlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vernon adams

Beer Hunting", "text": "Tim Brady December 7 0 Comments \nInteresting insight in the craft beer world. \nThe relationship between Bosteels and Artisanal Imports is a close, long-standing, almost familial one, a connection grounded in nostalgic sentiment based on memories of the early days when they worked to help each other thrive. Indeed, without Bosteels, Artisanal Imports would not have become established as an import player so quickly. \n\u201cThey gave us the brand nationally,\u201d Hoff says. \u201cThat was huge for us.\u201d \nThe main contact person between Artisanal Imports and the brewery is Bosteels\u2019 Export Manager, Jack Van Antwerpen. Hoff believes that Van Antwerpen has been instrumental in the success Tripel Karmeliet has enjoyed in the U.S. \n\u201cHe\u2019s the traveling face of the brewery here and the guy we do all of our planning with,\u201d Hoff says of Van Antwerpen. \u201cHe brought a level of organization to the brewery that we had not seen, a commercial and marketing mind that allowed Bosteels to achieve its potential.\u201d \nVan Antwerpen\u2014tall, silver-haired, and affable\u2014jokes that he has come \u201cfull circle,\u201d having started his career in the beer industry 37 years ago at the age of 22 with an independent Brouwerij Artois in Leuven. He now works for companies that produce large quantities of Stella Artois for a global market. During his time selling Leffe and Vieux-Temps in the Netherlands, then at Timmermans Lambic brewery before it was part of the Anthony Martin group, and finally as commercial manager at Brasserie Du Bocq in Purnode, Van Antwerpen developed a strong relationship with Ivo Bosteels. He moved to Brouwerij Bosteels in 2007 and provided an injection of energy and know-how which had an immediate impact on export to the States. \n\u201cIt was the best move in my career,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started at Bosteels, we were doing some containers of Tripel Karmeliet, maybe five or six in a year. Now we do that in a week.

The major factor driving this growth is increasing demand for efficient railway transportation. Due to the rapid increase in freight and passenger traffic, countries around the world are trying to develop and modernize their railway networks. Rising populations and growing economies have created demand for mass transportation. Many countries, such as China and Spain, are rapidly developing their high-speed rail networks. While countries such as India and the U.S. focus on increasing the electrified lines in their network, others, such as Brazil, Germany, and the U.K., are focusing on modernizing their aging fleets. Traction systems are used to pull or draw vehicles (i.e., they act as propulsion systems for trains). Hence with the increasing presence of locomotive and electrified rail lines, the traction equipment market will also expand during the forecast period. Asia Pacific occupied the largest share of the traction equipment market in 2015, closely followed by Europe. Get Sample copy of this Report @ https://www.marketresearchreports.biz/sample/sample/808486 This report by Transparency Market Research analyzes, estimates, and forecasts demand for traction equipment on the global and regional level for an eight-year period from 2016 to 2024 in terms of volume and cumulative revenue. The study also provides information on restraints, drivers, and opportunities along with their impact on the overall market during the forecast period. The report segments the market on the basis of equipment type and region and provides estimates and forecast of the traction equipment market for each segment. The study analyzes the product value chain, from raw material suppliers to end-users. Additionally, it contains an evaluation of the market along the Porter\u2019s Five Forces model, which analyzes the degree of competition in the market by considering factors such as the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers, threats from substitute products and new entrants. The report also includes a market attractiveness analysis for the traction equipment market on the basis of regions. The report includes a detailed competitive landscape of the traction equipment market including company market share analysis and the profiles of key market participants. The report provides a comprehensive view of the traction equipment market by segmenting the market along the lines of equipment type and geography. The equipment type segment comprises the traction transformer, traction motor, and traction converter sub-segments. The traction system is the primary driving force of locomotives. In railway systems, it is supplemented by equipment such as controllers, rectifiers, blowers, compressors, and other auxiliary systems. Traction motors are widely used in all types of locomotives. Transformers and converters are also used in the electrification of railway lines. The requirement of traction motors, traction transformers, and traction convertors differs depending upon the type of locomotive, electrification system, and terrain suitability. View Sample PDF @ https://www.marketresearchreports.biz/reports/808486/traction-equipment-global-industry-market-research-reports.pdf The traction equipment market has been segmented on the basis of geography into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Rest of the World. The Rest of the World segment includes Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Demand for each type of traction equipment in terms of volume and cumulative revenue for each of these regions has been forecast in the report for the period from 2016 to 2024.

Ella Rider, 13, is vocalist, songwriter and fiddler for local Americana band Riderbymyside (yes, she\u2019s the namesake \u201cRider\u201d), which also features her father, Gregg Morris, and mother, Kristin Morris. A lifelong Bendite, Rider has been playing music for as long as she can remember, and also plays guitar, piano, mandolin and ukulele. Riderbymyside is working on its debut album; however, \u201cLand of Hope\u201d is planned for a future Rider solo project. Q: What\u2019s the story behind the song \u2014 how was it written, recorded, etc.? A: Most of my inspiration comes from a new experience; I tend to write my best songs when I\u2019m upset. When I am having a hard time, writing a song about it helps me through it. Most of the time I come up with a melody that I like or lyrics I like, but never at the same time. Then, usually weeks later, I change all my parts around until I realize I already had a song; I just had to put the right pieces together. I like all my songs to stay really positive, so they can speak to people and mean something to them. My songs seem to mean something different to everyone because everyone\u2019s life and experiences are different and unique. Q: What\u2019s the story inside this song \u2014 what\u2019s it about? A: \u201cLand of Hope\u201d is about believing you can survive the hard times and knowing no matter what, you will be OK. I wrote this song from my own experience, but I think it speaks to everyone because at some point or another, everyone has gone through a tough time. This song is about hope and always staying positive no matter what\u2019s going wrong. This song means a lot to me not only because it was something good I took away from a rough time, but because it has managed to touch other people in a way I can\u2019t explain. The song is about hope, and everyone could use some hope. \u2014\u2009 Brian McElhiney, The Bulletin ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ella rider", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kristin morris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gregg morris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014\u2009 brian mcelhiney", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nw columbia st.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mcmenamins old st. francis school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:20.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "310167381779eec8930b0c7a843ecda60cbf2c59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvwgWRzhtJjwbgvQTB8zLXRT8NEIOcv8rIE-", "site_full": "forums.warframe.com", "site": "warframe.com", "site_section": "https://forums.warframe.com/forum/36-general-discussion/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "General Discussion - Warframe Forums", "title": "What the", "title_full": "What the - General Discussion - Warframe Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T16:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://content.invisioncic.com/Mwarframe/monthly_2017_07/warframe_share.png.bec3c989c4517e865df9b45a300e63e0.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7793, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6086c4fcf9b5092e5b8ebc7b0757a1d16bfe6876", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvwgWRzhtJjwbgvQTB8zLXRTAPlzQSMdCHPLH0hVypD2xQ--", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "RexSeverin", "published": "2017-12-07T16:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Look into his eyes!

The Russia probe had finally netted a big fish.\nAs the details of the Flynn indictment seeped out into the press, however, the bombshell was revealed as another dud. To the dismay of many Trump opponents, nothing in Flynn\u2019s rap sheet demonstrated collusion with Russia. Instead, the indictment undermined the Russiagate narrative while implicating another, much more inconvenient foreign power in a plot to meddle in American politics.\nAccording to plea agreement Flynn signed with Mueller, Flynn admitted to lying to the FBI about a phone call he placed to the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergei Kislyak, during the transition period between the election and inauguration \u2014 not during the campaign. Flynn's first order of business with the Russian diplomat was to beseech him not to retaliate for sanctions imposed by Obama on Russia for still-unproven allegations that Russian intelligence agencies hacked the Democratic National Committee. In other words, Flynn was caught trying to influence Russia, not the other way around.\nThe only area where Flynn proposed any form of coordination with Russia was in defeating ISIS and Al Qaeda in Syria. The Trump administration\u2019s attempts to collaborate with its Russian counterparts in Syria have been the target of relentless sabotage from an opportunistic media and Obama era national security officials who considered the catastrophic semi-covert operation to arm Syrian insurgents a part of their legacy. Thanks to stifling Cold War atmosphere these elements have cultivated in Washington, the US has been reduced to an impotent bystander while Russia, Iran, and Turkey have joined together to impose an end to the proxy war that has ravaged Syria for the past five years.\nTo be sure, Flynn indictment did contain a stunning revelation of collusion between Team Trump and a foreign state. But it was not the country that the national media has obsessed over for the past year.\nFlynn was found by the FBI to have lobbied Kislyak to exercise Russia\u2019s veto against the passage of a United Nations security council resolution condemning the growth of Israel\u2019s illegal settlements. And he did so under orders from Jared Kushner, the presidential son-in-law and Middle East fixer, who was himself acting on behalf of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nThanks to Flynn's indictment, we now know that the Israeli prime minister was able to transform the Trump administration into his own personal vehicle for undermining Obama\u2019s lone effort to hold Israel accountable at the UN. A clearer example of a foreign power colluding with an American political operation against a sitting president has seldom, if ever, been exposed in such glaring fashion.\nKushner\u2019s deep ties to the Israeli right-wing and ethical breaches\nThe day after Kushner was revealed as Flynn\u2019s taskmaster, a team of researchers from the Democratic Super PAC American Bridge found that the presidential son-in-law had failed to disclose his role as a co-director of his family\u2019s Charles and Seryl Kushner Foundation during the years when his family\u2019s charity funded the Israeli enterprise of illegal settlements. The embarrassing omission barely scratched the surface of Kushner\u2019s decades long relationship with Israel\u2019s Likud-led government.\nDuring the 1990\u2019s, a teenaged Jared Kushner was forced to vacate his own bedroom so Netanyahu had a place to stay when he was in New York City for business. Since at least 2006, the Kushners have donated at least $315,000 to the Friends of the IDF, the American fundraising arm of the Israeli military, and tens of thousands of dollars to illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, from Beit El to Gush Etzion.\nThe Kushner family foundation has even donated to the Od Yosef Chai yeshiva, a West Bank-based Jewish religious institution that has served for a base of radical settler terror attacks against Palestinian villagers. The yeshiva has been led by a pair of rabbis who produced a genocidal tract that the Israeli newspaper Maariv described as \"230 pages on the laws concerning the killing of non-Jews, a kind of guidebook for anyone who ponders the question of if and when it is permissible to take the life of a non-Jew.\"\nTo orchestrate his futile attempt to scuttle a diplomatic imperative of the Obama administration, Netanyahu drew on these deep ties to the Kusher family. There are troubling indications that his intelligence agencies shared material that it gathered by spying on the US with Kushner and the Trump transitional team.\nEli Lake, a neoconservative columnist for Bloomberg who frequently relies on sources from both Trump and Netanyahu\u2019s inner circles, reported that Israel\u2019s \u201cenvoys shared their own intelligence about the Obama administration's lobbying efforts to get member states to support the [UN] resolution with the Trump transition team.\u201d\nThe subtext here was clear: Israel, a country that surveilled American diplomats during Iran deal negotiations in 2015 and which is notorious for its espionage across the West, had spied on the Obama administration during the lead-up to the UN vote and shared its \u201cintelligence\u201d with the Trump team. Once again, collusion has seldom been demonstrated as clearly or disturbingly as this.\nA Clinton mega-donor defends Kushner\u2019s collusion\nSo why isn\u2019t this angle of the Flynn indictment getting more attention? An easy explanation could be deduced from the stunning spectacle that unfolded this December 2 at the Brookings Institution, where the fresh-faced Kushner engaged in a \u201ckeynote conversation\u201d with Israeli-American oligarch Haim Saban.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been in the news the last few days, to say the least. But you\u2019ve been in the news about an issue that I personally want to thank you for, because you and your team were taking steps to try and get the United Nations Security Council to not go along with what ended up being an abstention by the US,\u201d Saban remarked to Kushner. \u201cAs far as I know there was nothing illegal there but I think that this crowd and myself want to thank you for making that effort.\u201d\nKushner nervously scanned the room, mumbled \u201cthank you\u201d to his host and forced an uncomfortable smile.\nSaban\u2019s political background lent special significance to his robust defense of Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Having earned his fortune in television and the Israeli telecom industry, he has become one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most generous individual donors. Saban\u2019s millions funded the construction of Democratic National Committee\u2019s headquarters and filled the campaign coffers of Bill and Hillary Clinton. In 2012, as a reward for Saban\u2019s handsome Super PAC donations to Obama, the president nominated the billionaire's wife \u2014 a former Playboy \u201cDisco Queens\u201d model and children\u2019s fashion designer with no diplomatic experience \u2014 as special US representative to the United Nations general assembly.\nThe spectacle of a top Democratic Party money man defending one of the Trump administration\u2019s most influential figures was clearly intended to establish a patina of bipartisan normalcy around Kushner\u2019s collusion with the Netanyahu government.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott barbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament approves same-sex marriage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images members of parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the sydney morning herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "federation square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images  australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:20.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f04c2039c8e1e5a5c05e541546e37c8fd58ba2f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnTF9qf5WeNACyd_bRbdZeYKOPMPcesGBxhAtcYnH6rAgInXE41tGN8GobP_CvKRxVyBHDPOSXvag--", "site_full": "rigorousintuition.ca", "site": "rigorousintuition.ca", "site_section": "http://rigorousintuition.ca/board2/viewforum.php?f=8", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "rigorousintuition.ca \u2022 View forum - General Discussion", "title": "Did Trump collude with Israel?", "title_full": "rigorousintuition.ca \u2022 View topic - Did Trump collude with Israel?", "published": "2017-12-07T02:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a292764cfe8b2cc4f66f4ac1d8105abbff73bf1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnTF9qf5WeNACyd_bRbdZeYKOPMPcesGBxhAtcYnH6rAgInXE41tGN8GobP_CvKRxWW7YzHdRPQEI241Bu4nRuh", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "seemslikeadream", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Revealed: Blackwater Founder Erik Prince's Business Ties With Netanyahu\u2019s Disgraced Chief of Staff\nU.S. businessman at center of storm over allegedly setting up back-channel between Trump and Putin has ties to Ari Harow and an Israeli financier\nHagai Amit Dec 06, 2017 12:49 PM\nBlackwater USA Chief Executive Erik Prince testifying before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on security contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, Washington, October 2007. Larry Downing/REUTERS\nU.S. businessman Erik Prince \u2013 who has just been accused of trying to set up a back-channel for communications between the Trump administration and Russia \u2013 has deep Israeli connections as well, including business dealings with Ari Harow, the disgraced former bureau chief to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nThe founder of the military contracting firm Blackwater is worth a reported $2.4 billion and is at the center of a ruckus over U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nAccording to U.S. media reports, Prince was behind Trump\u2019s indirect channels to Putin, through the Persian Gulf states. Last week Prince, 48, testified before the House Intelligence Committee on meetings that took place in the Emirates in January. He admitted to meeting with the head of a Russian investment fund earlier this year, but claimed it was nothing to do with Trump and Putin.\nHaaretz has learned that Prince used to do business in Israel with Harow, the former chief of staff to Netanyahu. Harow turned state\u2019s evidence in August after pleading guilty to fraud and breach of trust, and is collaborating with the police on two investigations into Netanyahu\u2019s affairs.\nAri Harow in 2014, while working as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's chief of staff.Marc Israel Sellem\nPrince also has long-standing ties with the Israeli financier Dorian Barak, formerly Harow\u2019s business partner.\nA former Navy Seal, Prince is reportedly close to Trump \u2013 so much so that, according to U.S. media reports, he was present at the Trump election party in New York\u2019s Trump Tower in November 2016. He also advises Trump and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, on topics related to American foreign policy \u2013 from refugees to U.S. policy on Afghanistan. Prince reportedly has opinions on everything and isn\u2019t shy about sharing them. His sister is Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\nHis involvement in foreign policy raises eyebrows because of his involvement in Blackwater (now known as Academi), the multinational security firm that operates around the world. Though he sold the company in 2010, Prince has made a fortune from wars \u2013 from Iraq to Afghanistan. He has also attracted bad press: In September 2007, Blackwater employees escorting a convoy killed 17 Iraqis. They claimed it was an ambush, but Iraq claimed the killings were unprovoked. The Iraqi government refused to renew Blackwater\u2019s license in 2009.\nFive years ago, well before anybody predicted Trump\u2019s election, Prince visited Israel and was hosted by Harow. At the time, Harow was a businessman with a private investment fund as well as being chief of Netanyahu\u2019s bureau. Harow tried to interest Prince in investing in Indigo Strategic Capital, a venture capital fund that Harow was co-managing with Dorian Barak.\nHow much Prince invested in Indigo remains unknown, but it is known that through Indigo he invested in the Israeli companies NowForce (security) and Agent Vi (real-time video analytics).\nBeyond Israel, Barak also tried to interest Prince in investing in an African rail project \u2013 with the Spanish infrastructure company Eurofinsa \u2013 and in a joint investment with the Tehran-born, British-Jewish billionaire Vincent Tchenguiz. Prince and Barak were also involved in a mining company called Alufer.\nIn late 2013, Harow signed a conflict of interest agreement, undertaking to sever ties with his private company 3H and vowing not to be involved in its management. It would be run by partners and his two brothers, he said, and Harow returned to serve as chief of staff for Netanyahu.\nHarow is not known to have had ties with Prince over the last five years. But Indigo Strategic Holdings, a Cayman Islands-listed company that Barak set up to handle his joint activity with Harow, only closed in August.\nBeyond Prince\u2019s investments in Israel, the deeper significance of Harrow\u2019s relationship with Prince may have been in introducing him to Barak. Previously, Barak worked as head of the mergers, acquisitions and business development division at Bank Hapoalim\u2019s international division. He also prays at the same synagogue as Naftali Bennett, to whom he donated 1,800 shekels ($510) when the latter was successfully running for the leadership of Habayit Hayehudi in 2012.\nBarak became an adviser to Prince on investments and finance, and served on the boards of Agent Vi, Indigo and other companies worldwide in which Prince had stakes \u2013 from Austria to Gibraltar. They include the British hydrocarbons and mineral exploration company Bridgeporth; another U.K. company called Airborne Technologies, which makes aviation systems (some refer to it as Prince\u2019s private air force); and Alufer.\nBarak and Prince are also involved in a holding company called Frontier Capital.\nBarak also has ties in China, and launched an innovation center in Israel with KuangChi Science last year. The fund is supposed to invest $250 million, half in Israel. Its portfolio shows that it invested in companies in which Barak had previously invested money himself, partly through Prince.\nWith various people now touting Prince for a Senate run (including Steve Bannon), his Israeli ties could prove significant.\nHarow\u2019s representative said that in connection with a private company he had founded, he had been in touch with various business and philanthropic entities in Israel and elsewhere.

With his mother long gone and his father struggling to recover from a stroke, the day-to-day running of the family business has fallen to him. Days are spent out in the cold with livestock, evenings bickering with his grandmother, and nights getting steaming drunk in the local pub, all ending in coming home and vomiting.\nJohnny\u2019s only relief from his hardscrabble existence comes from the odd quick fumble with local lads (he\u2019s gay).\nHis lot changes when Romanian immigrant Gheorghe (Secareanu) comes to work on the farm. Emotional literacy is not a strong point in Johnny\u2019s family, but Gheorghe bring his gentle nature to bear on his colleague as well as the animals.\nRemarkably, God\u2019s Own Country is director Francis Lee\u2019s debut. It\u2019s a quietly powerful film, conveying more with silences, looks and tangential shots than inferior movies can manage with all their violent explosions and high drama.\nIt\u2019s also beautifully acted. O\u2019Connor convincingly conveys Johnny\u2019s loneliness and hopelessness, and while Gheorghe\u2019s psychology is less of a focal point, the Romanian actor gives his character understated strength and dignity. Veteran British performers Ian Hart and Gemma Jones also give striking turns as Johnny\u2019s gruff father and grandmother.\nLee is more interested in the personal than the political, but there\u2019s recognition of the hostility that hard-working immigrants like Gheorghe face in provincial England, and though it goes unmentioned, the specter of Brexit looms over events: what will happen to our country and businesses without the diligent Gheorghes and Georgetas who keep us from going under?\nIt adds a timely note to a timeless story.\nBy Debbie Stowe \nThe post Exclusive film review \u2013 God\u2019s Own Country appeared first on Business Review .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "francis lee  starring", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francis lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian hart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh o\u2019connor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gemma jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "debbie stowe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alec secareanu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gheorghe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o\u2019connor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gheorghes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "brokeback mountain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yorkshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cinema city cotroceni", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:20.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f04c2039c8e1e5a5c05e541546e37c8fd58ba2f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnTF9qf5WeNACyd_bRbdZeYKOPMPcesGBxhAtcYnH6rAgInXE41tGN8GobP_CvKRxVyBHDPOSXvag--", "site_full": "rigorousintuition.ca", "site": "rigorousintuition.ca", "site_section": "http://rigorousintuition.ca/board2/viewforum.php?f=8", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "rigorousintuition.ca \u2022 View forum - General Discussion", "title": "Did Trump collude with Israel?", "title_full": "rigorousintuition.ca \u2022 View topic - Did Trump collude with Israel?", "published": "2017-12-07T02:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "941af1c997c0d536dad2e94420b5483367949a93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnTF9qf5WeNACyd_bRbdZeYKOPMPcesGBxhAtcYnH6rAgInXE41tGN8GobP_CvKRxWW7YzHdRPQECBMyngQMV9A", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "seemslikeadream", "published": "2017-12-07T03:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "IZEMBLA - The dubious friends of Donald trump: King of Diamonds\nLeviev told the New York Times shortly after the building\u2019s purchase that he was a \u201ctrue friend\u201d of Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin\nLev Leviev, the guy who sells blood diamonds and uses the proceeds to fund the building of illegal settlements\nseemslikeadream \u00bb Mon Jun 26, 2017 6:43 Quote: : l\nKushner dealings with Deutsche Bank may draw scrutiny from special counsel\nWhite House senior adviser Jared Kushner in the East Room of the White House in Washington. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\nBy Michael Kranish June 25 at 9:04 PM\nOne month before Election Day, Jared Kushner\u2019s real estate company finalized a $285 million loan as part of a refinancing package for its property near Times Square in Manhattan.\nThe loan came at a critical moment. Kushner was playing a key role in the presidential campaign of his father-in-law, Donald Trump. The lender, Deutsche Bank, was negotiating to settle a federal mortgage fraud case and charges from New York state regulators that it aided a possible Russian money-laundering scheme. The cases were settled in December and January.\nNow, Kushner\u2019s association with Deutsche Bank is among a number of financial matters that could come under focus as his business activities are reviewed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who is examining Kushner as part of a broader investigation into possible Russian influence in the election.\nThe October deal illustrates the extent to which Kushner was balancing roles as a top adviser to Trump and a real estate company executive. After the election, Kushner juggled duties for the Trump transition team and his corporation as he prepared to move to the White House. The Washington Post has reported that investigators are probing Kushner\u2019s separate December meetings with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, and with Russian banker Sergey Gorkov, the head of Vnesheconombank, a state development bank.\nThe Deutsche Bank loan capped what Kushner Cos. viewed as a triumph: It had purchased four mostly empty retail floors of the former New York Times building in 2015, recruited tenants to fill the space and got the Deutsche Bank loan in a refinancing deal that gave Kushner\u2019s company $74 million more than it paid for the property.\nThe White House, in response to questions from The Post, said in a statement that Kushner \u201cwill recuse from any particular matter involving specific parties in which Deutsche Bank is a party.\u201d Kushner and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.\nDeutsche Bank loans to Trump and his family members have come under scrutiny. As Trump\u2019s biggest lender, the bank supplied funds to him when other banks balked at the risk. As of last year, Trump\u2019s companies had about $364 million in outstanding debts to the bank.\nDemocrats from the House Financial Services Committee wrote on March 10 that they were concerned about the \u201cintegrity\u201d of a reported Justice Department investigation into the Russian money-laundering matter \u201cgiven the President\u2019s ongoing conflicts of interest with Deutsche Bank,\u201d citing \u201cthe suspicious ties between President Trump\u2019s inner circle and the Russian government.\u201d The Justice Department did not respond to a question about whether it is following up on the money-laundering settlement that Deutsche Bank reached with New York state regulators in December.\nOn May 23, the Democratic members asked Deutsche Bank to disclose what it had learned in its internal review about whether Trump may have benefited from the improper Russian money transfers. The bank refused, citing U.S. privacy laws. The Democratic letter also raised the possibility that the bank had conducted a similar review of Kushner \u2014 without mentioning his name \u2014 by referring to a review of accounts \u201cheld by family members, several of whom serve as official advisers to the president.\u201d\nThe Democrats wrote that it was important to learn more about Deutsche Bank loans to Trump and family members to determine whether they were \u201cin any way connected to Russia.\u201d\nThe refinancing loan with Deutsche Bank is mentioned in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of a public offering of \u00admortgage-backed securities. It states that Kushner and his brother, Joshua, \u201cwill be guarantors\u201d under what was called a \u201cnonrecourse carve-out.\u201d Such guarantees require more than a loan default to kick in. They are commonly known as \u201cbad boy\u201d clauses, a reference to how a lender could seek to hold the guarantor responsible for the debt under circumstances that might include fraud, misapplication of funds or voluntary bankruptcy deemed inappropriate. The terms of the guarantee, which generally are not secured by collateral, are negotiated between lender and borrower.\n\u201cThe way to look at this is, so long as you\u2019re not a \u2018bad boy\u2019 and don\u2019t do anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about,\u201d said James Schwarz, a real estate lawyer who is an expert in such clauses. \u201cTo the extent you would do something fraudulent, then you have things to worry about.\u201d\nThe corporate loan and Kushner\u2019s personal guarantee are not mentioned on his financial disclosure form, filed with the Office of Government Ethics. Blake Roberts, a lawyer who represented Kushner on the matter, said in a statement to The Post that Kushner\u2019s form \u201cdoes not list the loan guarantee\u201d because the disclosure relied on \u201cpublished guidance\u201d from OGE that he said \u201cclearly states that filers do not have to disclose as a liability a loan on which they have made a guarantee unless they have a present obligation to repay the loan.\u201d\nThe Post sent the language cited by Kushner\u2019s lawyer to Don Fox, a former general counsel and acting OGE director. After reviewing the wording, he said in an interview that he would have advised Kushner to disclose the personal guarantee of the $285 million corporate loan because of its size and possible implications.\n\u201cIf I were still at OGE and somebody came to us with that set of facts, I would say, \u2018By all means, disclose it,\u2019\u2008\u201d he said, referring to \u201cthe spirit of the law.\u201d\nAfter being informed of Fox\u2019s statement, Roberts contacted Fox to present his view that no disclosure was required. Fox said in a follow-up email to The Post that even if OGE \u201cadvised there was no requirement to disclose,\u201d he would not have argued that point but \u201cI would have nonetheless recommended Jared over report in this instance given the magnitude of the contingency and the public interest in liabilities \u2014 actual and potential \u2014 to Deutsche Bank.\u201d\nSeparately, Kushner disclosed that he and his mother have a personal line of credit with Deutsche Bank worth up to $25 million.\nThe Deutsche Bank deal was one of the last Kushner orchestrated before joining the White House. It is among the dozens of complex transactions that he was involved with during his decade in the real estate business.\nAlthough Kushner divested some properties in an effort to address potential conflicts, he retains an interest in nearly 90 percent of his real estate properties, including the retail portion of the former New York Times headquarters, and holds personal debts and loan guarantees.\nThe deal that led to the Deutsche Bank loan is rooted in a holiday party held in late 2014 at the Bowlmor bowling alley, which is located in the retail portion.\nAt the party, Kushner decided that the four retail floors of the building, while rundown, could be transformed into a thriving tourist destination, according to his associates.\nThe building passed through several owners after the newspaper sold the property for $175 million in 2004 to Tishman Speyer. Tishman sold it three years later for $525 million to a company called Africa-Israel Investments. (Those transactions prompted Trump a few months ago to poke fun at the Times, tweeting that the \u201cdopes\u201d at the newspaper \u201cgave it away.\u201d)\nAfrica-Israel\u2019s decision to purchase the building was made by its chairman, an Uzbek-born Israeli citizen, Lev Leviev. He is one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men, known as the \u201cKing of Diamonds\u201d for his extensive holdings in Africa, Israel and Russia. He was then expanding his real estate holdings in New York City.\nLeviev told the New York Times shortly after the building\u2019s purchase that he was a \u201ctrue friend\u201d of Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, largely through his work with an influential Jewish organization in the former Soviet Union. The newspaper wrote that he kept a photo of Putin in his office in Israel. Leviev\u2019s company said in a statement to The Post that Leviev \u201cdoes not have a personal relationship\u201d with Putin but has met him \u201con a few occasions.\u201d Leviev\u2019s statement said he was referring to his belief that \u201cMr. Putin has been a \u2018true friend\u2019 to the Jewish people in Russia.\u201d\nIn 2008, a year after the building\u2019s purchase, Leviev invited Trump to his Madison Avenue store, an ultra-high-end establishment called Leviev Jewelry, where they were photographed together, according to the Leviev statement. Leviev hoped to work with Trump on Moscow real estate deals, according to an article in Kommersant, a Russian newspaper. The Leviev statement said that the two \u201cnever had any business dealings with one another, contrary to speculation.\u201d\nSix years later, Kushner saw an opportunity for his own company.\nLeviev, whose company was having financial difficulties, according to an Israeli press account, sold the building\u2019s 12-floor office portion for $160 million, a transaction that did not involve the four retail floors.\nLeviev\u2019s daughter, Chagit, took charge of her father\u2019s U.S. subsidiary and set out to find a buyer for the retail portion of the building. The company said it would entertain offers no lower than $300 million.\nKushner\u2019s company offered $265 million, which was rejected. Kushner himself then negotiated with Chagit Leviev and others in 2015 and succeeded with a $296 million offer, according to an official involved in the matter.\n\u201cIt was a very hard back-and-forth New York negotiating style,\u201d said Kushner\u2019s broker, Lon Rubackin. Leviev\u2019s partner in the deal, Five Mile Capital, did not respond to a request for comment.\nFew knew it at the time, but the negotiations were nearly consummated when Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, ran into Chagit Leviev on May 4, 2015, at an after-party for a Metropolitan Museum of Art gala \u2014 an encounter that was memorialized in a picture posted on Instagram.\n\u201cSuch a pleasure seeing \u00ad@jaredckushner and his stunningly beautiful wife @ivankatrump last night [at] the #metball\u00adafterparty,\u201d Chagit Leviev wrote.\nThe deal was signed a week later and closed in October 2015. The Leviev company said in a statement to The Post that Kushner simply made the highest offer and \u201cthere was no political element to the transaction.\u201d\nKushner took over a property that was only 25 percent leased, according to a company official. His company recruited tenants, offering some a year\u2019s free rent to lock in long-term contracts, according to an SEC filing. As a result, the building was nearly fully leased, with higher rents, including new tenants such as National Geographic.\nThe strategy paid off when Kushner\u2019s company went to Deutsche Bank for refinancing. An appraisal cited in SEC filings for the package of mortgage-backed securities placed the value at $470 million, a 59 percent increase in a year. The bank declined to release the appraisal, but a person involved in the deal said that such a rapid increase was unusual when New York real estate was rebounding from recession, and credited Kushner for finding stellar tenants.\nIn a statement, Kushner Cos. President Laurent Morali said the property\u2019s value increased sharply \u201cfor a simple reason: the building\u2019s dramatic turnaround. We had a vision for the property when we purchased it that no one else had, and are proud to say that we executed on it.\u201d\nKushner\u2019s company took out $370 million in new loans in October 2016, giving it $74 million more than the purchase price a year earlier. Along with $285 million from Deutsche Bank, Kushner\u2019s firm received $85 million from SL Green Realty, where Kushner had once worked as an intern. SL Green spokesman Rick Matthews said the deal made sense because the building has been mostly leased, giving it \u201cincreased value.\u201d\nThe Deutsche Bank loan was delivered just before the bank \u2014 which has long been under investigation by federal and state authorities \u2014 agreed to pay a $7.2 billion U.S. penalty in December for mortgage securities fraud in its packaging of residential mortgages. The bank also paid a $425 million New York state fine in January for failing to properly track large transfers from Russia.\nDemocrats on the House Financial Services Committee wrote in their March 10 letter that because \u201cpress reports indicate\u201d the Justice Department is continuing to investigate the money- laundering case, they are \u201cconcerned about the integrity of this criminal probe\u201d in light of Trump\u2019s \u201congoing conflicts of interest with Deutsche Bank.\u201d Bloomberg News has reported that the Justice Department has requested records related to money laundering from Deutsche Bank as part of a probe.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national ... a96038ffcf", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/gvd7PqI_Lx0", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/kushner-firms-285-million-deutsche-bank-loan-came-just-before-election-day/2017/06/25/984f3acc-4f88-11e7-b064-828ba60fbb98_story.html?utm_term=.e2a96038ffcf", "https://psmag.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_80%2Cw_320/MTQ2NTk2MjQ0Njc4NzE1MjU1/25882-1jbllqzm021k0vr06_rvikw.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:20.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e340fbab7d01ae523553e15be62282bc1fd2ad7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/qp0TC1ajDjgYeZ177f4HOWMrd5dreVkRspbkuGu26MI9D3LzwatG6qfHdCfEwJH8rCYwgpIrzJo-", "site_full": "67.227.255.239", "site": "67.227.255.239", "site_section": "http://67.227.255.239/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=22", "site_categories": ["adult", "business", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Off-Topic Discussion - NeoGAF", "title": "Best Movies of 2017", "title_full": "Best Movies of 2017 - NeoGAF", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.346, "main_image": "http://www.neogaf.com/forum/images/neogaf2/icon_social.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d105938a6b30deebd2bd11475353c55f03028003", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/qp0TC1ajDjgYeZ177f4HOWMrd5dreVkRspbkuGu26MI9D3LzwatG6qfHdCfEwJH8DeePfsSBSxKXtYLf_92dxQ--", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Kadayi", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Lack of Blade Runner 2049 is frankly baffling given some of the mediocre fare on those lists.
