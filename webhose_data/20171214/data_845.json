Comments \nPhoto Credit: Ryan Rodrick Beiler / Shutterstock.com \nTrump's plan to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and potentially to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is not going to undermine peace efforts\u2014because there are no peace efforts underway. Protests have already begun, and anger is rising not only among Palestinians but across the Arab and Muslim worlds, among numerous governments including key U.S. allies, and among people across the globe. \nUnderstanding what this move represents means viewing it from two different perspectives. Taken at face value, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital reflects Trump's need to placate his key Israel-backing donors, particularly the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and the Christian Zionist component of his rightwing evangelical base. Pro-Israel partisans in Congress orchestrated a law in 1995 mandating the embassy move, but giving the president a way out\u2014the president could waive the requirement if national security might be at stake. Every president since has taken advantage of that waiver, including Donald Trump six months ago. Congressional Israel-backers could blame the president, the White House could lament that security threats prevented the move... everyone was happy. \nBut Trump's campaign commitment to move the embassy is more important to more influential supporters than was true of earlier presidents. Plus Trump's failure to win legislative victories meant he had more incentive to make good on his Jerusalem promise. Trump called this move \"the recognition of reality.\" \nIt should be noted that it has been U.S. policy itself\u2014support for Israel, billions of U.S. tax dollars sent to the Israeli military every year, acceptance of Jewish settlements in occupied Arab Jerusalem, protection of Israel in the United Nations\u2014that is largely responsible for that reality. The UN resolution partitioning Palestine into what were supposed to be (thoroughly unfairly apportioned) Jewish and Palestinian Arab states, also recognized a special status for Jerusalem\u2014it was to belong to neither \"state,\" but rather be a corpus separatum , a separate body to remain under international control. Israel claimed West Jerusalem as its capital, and in 1967 when it illegally occupied the eastern half of the city after the Six-Day War, it announced the annexation of Arab Jerusalem and forcibly unified the city as its capital. No country in the world recognized the annexation, and since that time legally binding UN Security Council resolutions continue to reaffirm that East Jerusalem remains occupied Palestinian territory. \nTrump's decision stands in direct violation of international law. But U.S. violations of international law regarding Israel is an old story. Decades of U.S. actions accepting, acknowledging, allowing (even if sometimes rhetorically criticizing) the expansion of illegal Jews-only colonial settlements in occupied Arab Jerusalem and across the West Bank set the stage. Decades of rewarding Israeli violations of UN resolutions and international law concerning Jerusalem with billions of dollars in economic and military support set the stage. Vetoing Security Council resolutions condemning illegal Israeli settlement building in Jerusalem set the stage. \nWhat's new this time around is the deliberately provocative, reckless nature of the decision to placate donors whatever the risk\u2014the risk of violent responses across the world, let alone the risk of further violation of Palestinian rights. \nWhat is not at risk is the role of the United States as an honest broker in sponsoring peace talks. Why? Because the U.S. never was an honest broker in Israel-Palestinian talks, it was always, as at least one longtime U.S. negotiator admitted, playing the role of Israel's lawyer. That hasn't changed either. There are no negotiations underway to be threatened with cancellation. \nSowing Chaos and Threatening More War Across the Region \nThe second perspective has far more to do with the regional situation, and the war-driven anti-diplomacy foreign policy of the Trump administration. Aside from donor pressure, U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the threat to move the embassy, have to be seen in the context of the effort led by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner to consolidate a powerful anti-Iran coalition across the Middle East with ostensible enemies Israel and Saudi Arabia at its core. \nTrump has anointed Kushner his point man on reaching the \"ultimate deal\" on Israel-Palestine. It's less about any claimed interest in peace than about the collaborative regional plans being hatched by Kushner and his new BFF, Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, known as MBS. Together the two crown princes, as it were, are trying to bring Israel and Saudi Arabia together in a newly overt alliance against Tehran. To pull off that kind of normalization of relations between these ostensible enemies and not risk losing power or worse, requires changing the rhetoric, if not the actual circumstances. \nEnter the so-called \"new Israeli-Palestinian talks.\" If the ambitious young Saudi prince can convince the majority of the royal family and at least a majority of Saudi citizens that somehow new talks mean the end of the conflict and we can all stop worrying about the Palestinians, then normalization of relations with Israel suddenly looks more acceptable. Such a partnership portends a serious rise in the threat of war\u2014with not only the United States but Israel and Saudi Arabia, plus Jordan, the UAE, Egypt and more, openly unified against Iran. \nJust a week or so before the announcement about Jerusalem, the Trump administration threatened to close the PLO office in Washington unless the Palestinians accepted Washington's terms for new negotiations. Those U.S.-brokered talks would be based on pro-settlement, human rights-violating conditions that no Palestinian leader could ordinarily accept. If some Palestinian leader\u2014the current head of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas, or some other leader if the Saudis force Abbas to quit as they reportedly threatened\u2014accepts a deal legitimizing permanent Israeli control of Palestinian land, Saudi Arabia can easily slip into a cozy partnership with their erstwhile enemy. \nThe timing remains a question. Why would Kushner and his father-in-law make the goal of an Israeli-Saudi alliance against Iran more difficult by such a provocative move regarding Jerusalem? Part of the answer has to do with the primacy of Israel over Saudi Arabia in Kushner's world\u2014regardless of his recent bromance with MBS. Kushner has been a supporter of illegal Israeli settlements for years; in his role in one of his family's foundations he helped orchestrate tens of thousands of dollars donated to Israeli settlements. According to Newsweek , \"The foundation donated at least $38,000 between 2011 and 2013 to a fundraising group building a Jewish seminary in a West Bank settlement known as Beit El. During that period, Kushner\u2019s foundation also donated an additional $20,000 to Jewish and educational institutions in settlements throughout the region, the Associated Press reported.\" \nSomehow the Trump son-in-law forgot to mention those transactions when he filed financial reports required for his top-level security clearance. But it fits a pattern. In late 2016, Kushner ordered Michael Flynn, then the Trump campaign's top foreign policy adviser, to persuade Russia to delay the imminent UN Security Council vote criticizing Israeli settlements. President Obama had decided to abstain and allow the resolution to pass; Trump wanted the Russians to delay the vote so the new administration could veto it. But Moscow refused to play along. \nIf you just listened to the official rhetoric from both governments, something like a Saudi-Israeli alliance appears unthinkable. But it turns out that many \"unthinkable\" developments in the volatile Middle East are actually quite thinkable\u2014although it usually means there's a price to be paid. Washington's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital has been bandied about as a threat for years despite international law. The fundamentalist Saudi government has all but publicly pined for open relations with Israel despite Tel Aviv's continuing violations of Palestinian rights. National leaders may pay a political price for those moves. But the real price\u2014potentially in destroyed lives, devastated cities and more\u2014will be paid by the people of Iran, who will likely face even more crippling sanctions and a growing threat of war; by the people of Yemen, where the U.S.-backed Saudi war continues to escalate with horrific humanitarian consequences; potentially by Lebanon, where Saudi interference is again on the rise; and as always by the Palestinians, who have paid the price for U.S. support of Israeli occupation and apartheid for more than 70 years, and have just been sold out again. \nThere are no Israeli-Palestinian peace talks underway that might be threatened by U.S. recognition of Jerusalem. But the move certainly makes peace\u2014or justice\u2014anywhere in the war-torn region far less likely. Phyllis Bennis is a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C.

And how can one say no when she wants to literally devour every part of you-even after midnight? The result of these happenings is more than any man can wish for. From Delta, the original \"doll\" comes forth Delta and Gamma, and these three insatiable sex-hungry beauties go on a sexual rampage that will leave you panting with delight. Can they be controlled?

It is the first time that Lego has succeeded in a copyright competition case in China, where copies of its colourful bricks and figures have been a recurrent problem as it seeks to gain share in the $31 billion (\u00a323.1 billion) toys and games market.\nEarlier this year, the Beijing Higher Court passed a ruling that recognised the Lego logo and name in Chinese as 'well-known' trademarks in China, putting the toymaker in a better position to act against infringement of its trademarks.\nThe China Shantou Intermediate People's Court had ruled that \"certain Bela products infringed upon the copyrights of the Lego Group and that manufacturing and selling of those products constituted acts of unfair competition\", Lego said in a statement on Thursday.\nThe court also decided that Lego is protected under Chinese \"anti-unfair competition law\" for \"the distinctive and unique appearance of certain decorative aspects of its packaging across particular product lines (in this case, LEGO Friends)\"\nCapturing the imaginations of Chinese children with its bricks is key to reviving growth for the unlisted company after disappointing revenues in its core U.S. and European markets has brought an end to a decade-long sales boom.\nLego, whose name is derived from the Danish \"leg godt\" meaning \"play well\", is competing with Barbie maker Mattel Inc and Hasbro, the firm behind My Little Pony, for a slice of the Chinese market.\nThe case was filed against two Chinese companies, which had been manufacturing and selling Bela products that were almost identical to Lego's. They will now have to stop copying Lego's packaging and logos, it said.\n\"We think this is very important for the continued development of a favourable business environment for all companies operating in the Chinese market,\" Lego's vice president of legal affairs, Peter Thorslund Kjaer said.\n(Reporting by Stine Jacobsen;

In return, millions of dollars in commissions are being paid to middlemen \u2014 often Canadians.\nIs Canadian citizenship for sale? 3:47\nEstimates by top industry insiders of just how much the citizenship by investment business is worth each year range from $1 billion to $10 billion.\nOne of the biggest attractions for potential investors is the visa-free access the passports offer to more than 100 countries, including the European Union. Without that access, citizens of some countries like China or Russia have to go through the paperwork of applying for separate visas for each country they want to visit.\nCanadians aren't only involved in promoting the programs \u2014 they're also designing and running some of them.\nAntigua and Barbuda's program was designed by Don Myatt, a former Canadian federal public servant who worked with Henley and Partners, which designs and markets citizenship by investment programs.\nMyatt went on to become the program's first manager. Chisanga Chekwe, a former Ontario deputy minister, was its second.\n\"One runs into Canadians all of the time,\" says Kristin Surak, a professor at the SOAS University of London who has been studying the industry for the past two years.\nNuri Katz, founder of Apex Capital Partners, at Jolly Harbour Marina in Antigua. Katz says Canada pioneered citizenship by investment. 'Then other governments saw the success of the Canadian program and wanted to enjoy some of the success themselves.' (Apex Capital Partners)\n\"Really, the (citizenship by investment) industry was created by the Canadian government,\" said Nuri Katz, a top player in the industry and founder of Apex Capital Partners. \"Then other governments saw the success of the Canadian program and wanted to enjoy some of the success themselves.\"\n\"I would say Canada is the grandfather of the industry.\"\nThe roots of the industry lie in Canada's former federal business immigration program.\nUnder that program, someone with a net worth of at least $1.6 million who agreed to make an $800,000 investment in Canada could qualify for permanent resident status.\nCanada ended its program in 2014 When Canada shut down the program in 2014, it left a fully trained industry adept at selling immigration investment and public servants used to administering immigration investment programs, as well as a pipeline with thousands of clients from around the world who had applied to Canada's program and whose applications had not yet been processed.\nFormer immigration minister Chris Alexander said he shut down the program because of concerns about fraud, and the money being invested just contributed to government spending.\nThose involved in selling citizenship by investment programs around the world maintain that they simply help cash-strapped countries connect with wealthy investors seeking greater mobility or a safe haven for their families.\nThey admit that there are some \"fly by night\" operators attracted by the big money involved. They make veiled suggestions of possible corruption on the part of politicians they refuse to name.\nHowever, they maintain that most reputable people in the industry are careful about who they accept as clients and they say most government officials are doing their best to screen out those who could pose a security risk.\nWarnings of criminals and terrorists Government insiders, however, paint a picture of citizenship for sale programs open to abuse by criminals and potential terrorists. They say some countries aren't taking enough care or asking enough questions about where the money came from before handing over passports that come with visa-free access to more than 100 countries.\nIn June, those concerns led Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to impose a visa on everyone entering Canada with a passport from Antigua and Barbuda, \"to protect the safety and security of Canadians and uphold Canada's commitment to secure the North American perimeter.\"\nIn its announcement, the Canadian government said it had been watching the program since it began in 2013. Chisanga Chekwe told Antigua's Daily Observer in August that he got wind of a plan to impose a visa over concerns about candidate vetting when he headed the program in 2016 and was able to convince Canadian authorities not to do it.\nThree years earlier, the Canadian government imposed a similar measure on St. Kitts and Nevis, another Caribbean island nation. Alexander, the former immigration minister, said that decision was triggered when an Iranian, whom he described as an \"Iranian state representative,\" showed up at Toronto's Pearson International Airport with a diplomatic passport from St. Kitts and said he had come to meet then prime minister Stephen Harper.\nCanada closed its embassy in Iran in 2012 and expelled Iranian diplomats from Canada. Formal diplomatic relations have not yet resumed.\nA European Parliament delegation warns that Malta's citizenship by investment program risks 'importing criminals and money laundering into the whole EU.' (leoks/Shutterstock)\nOn Dec. 1, a European Parliament delegation led by Ana Gomes raised red flags about Malta's citizenship by investment program, saying there was \"great concern\" about the sale of Maltese passports to foreigners without disclosing who was buying them. The program, popular with Russians, includes European citizenship and visa-free access to Canada and the U.S.\n\"This system, with all its opacity, bears the risk of importing criminals and money laundering into the whole EU,\" Gomes wrote.\nThe U.S. government has also raised serious concerns about programs offering citizenship for a price. In a written presentation before the U.S Senate armed services committee in March 2015, then General John Kelly listed \"cash for passports\" programs among the security threats faced by the U.S, saying they \"could be exploited by criminals, terrorists or other nefarious actors.\" Kelly now serves as chief of staff to U.S. President Donald Trump.\nIn its 2017 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, the U.S. State Department warned Antigua and Barbuda's Citizenship by Investment Program (CIP) could be susceptible to money laundering and other financial crimes.\n\"The CIP remains among the most lax in the world,\" officials wrote.\"The CIU (Citizenship by Investment Unit) does not maintain adequate autonomy from politicians to prevent political interference in its decisions,\" they later added.\nThe report also warned about the program in St. Kitts, saying \"prior lax vetting created AML (anti-money laundering) and security vulnerabilities domestically and internationally. \u2026 The CIP continues to be afflicted by significant deficiencies in vetting candidates and conducting due diligence on passport and citizenship recipients after they receive citizenship.\"\nArmand Arton, president of Arton Capital, estimates 25,000 people buy a second citizenship each year. (Arton Capital)\nAntigua and St. Kitts are just two of countries in the growing business of citizenship for sale.\n\"There has been an explosion of demand based pretty much on political instability around the world in the last 10 years,\" said Armand Arton, president of Arton Capital, one of the largest firms matching wealthy investors with second citizenships.\nArton, who grew up in Montreal but now spends much of his time in Dubai, estimates 25,000 people buy a second citizenship each year. He expects that number to double in the next five years as more countries offer programs and the cost of buying citizenship drops.\nIn most programs, those seeking a second citizenship make an investment in the country, from contributing to a government-run development program to investing in real estate or a local business. After an application is studied and vetted, the investor and their family can become citizens of the country and are issued passports.\nThe programs can be a goldmine for cash-strapped developing nations, accounting for a substantial portion of their gross domestic product in some cases.\nPeople in the industry say it has also proven to be a goldmine for Canadian immigration consultants, some of whom used to work for the federal government when Canada had its own immigrant investor program.\nCanadian addresses dominate in Antigua In Antigua, for example, 22 per cent of the 127 representatives authorized to market its citizenship by investment program list Canadian addresses \u2014 more than any other country.\nA review of the program's reports posted online show that 80 per cent of commissions paid by Antigua's program over a year and a half \u2014 $2.2 million \u2014 went to Montreal-based ClientReferrals.com, a company that connects agents and other professionals with citizenship by investment programs and other investment options.\nCorporate filings show one of the principals in Clientreferrals.com is Guy Pilote, a former federal public servant who worked briefly with Don Myatt on Canada's business immigration program. Patrick Peters is listed as president and Lei Li as a director.\n'Canada developed this in the '80s and most of the original professionals, like myself, are from Canada.' \u2014 Nuri Katz Like many involved in the industry, Katz began by working with the Canadian program.\n\"Canada developed this in the '80s and most of the original professionals, like myself, are from Canada,\" said Katz, who grew up in Montreal. \"We've expanded and created a whole new industry but it's really just an expansion of the Canadian experience.\"\nArton says Canadians are \"proud pioneers\" of the industry.\nThe sales pitches feature idyllic beaches and promises of more mobility. Visa-free travel to more than 100 countries including Europe. Protection for your family from wars or civil unrest. Protection for your wealth \u2014 a phrase often synonymous with protection from income taxes.\nMany of those snapping up second citizenships come from countries like China or Russia, which have few visa-free travel agreements with other countries, or residents of Middle Eastern and North African countries that are in turmoil.\nBut some observers are concerned that others could be looking for passports with easy access into North America and Europe for more nefarious reasons.\nPeter Vincent, former homeland security adviser to U.S. President Barack Obama, warns of 'international criminals and terrorist organizations that are looking to evade the law.' (Submitted by Peter Vincent)\nPeter Vincent, who worked as a Homeland Security adviser to former U.S. president Barack Obama, says the U.S. is concerned about a small but potentially \"devastating\" group exploiting citizenship by immigration programs.\n\"That is the international criminals and terrorist organizations that are looking to evade the law, prosecutions in their own country or international prosecutions by global tribunals or actually looking to do something horrible and to use a passport that would ordinarily not raise suspicions to travel to commit those crimes or those acts of terrorism.\"\nNaomi Hirst, a campaigner with Global Witness, which works to expose corruption around the world, describes citizenship by investment programs as \"a tool in the corruption toolkit.\"\n'Kleptocrats' can be 'brilliantly corrupt' \"One thing that people need when they are kleptocrats and \u2026 have been stealing money is kind of a way to get it out of the country. There's actually no point of being brilliantly corrupt if you can't enjoy it.\"\nPeople like Katz and Arton dismiss the concerns of the Canadian and U.S. governments, saying it would be easier for a would-be terrorist to get into the U.S. on a tourist visa.\nIndustry officials insist the due diligence is thorough and say they do their best to check the backgrounds of applicants. However, they say that if someone is not yet the subject of an arrest warrant or convicted of a criminal offence, a threat wouldn't necessarily show up in background checks.\nEyebrow-raising citizenships Despite the checks, there have been several cases of people whose citizenships have raised eyebrows.\nCanadian Alexandre Cazes, alleged to be the mastermind behind the dark web site AlphaBay, became an Antiguan citizen in February.\nThree Chinese nationals who bought Antiguan citizenship later generated controversy \u2014 one over allegations they had lied on their application and two others because they were wanted by Chinese authorities. One of them, Ai Yang, is mentioned in the dossier that informed the Canadian government's decision to impose the visa on Antigua.\nAntigua opposition leader Harold Lovell said his United Progressive Party set up the program when it was in office to bolster Antigua's economy. However, he believes there have been serious problems with the way the program has been run by the current government.\nFor example, Lovell said Antigua tried to market the program in Iraq and invite 4,000 Iraqi families to live in the island nation.\nCanada's decision to impose a visa on Antigua \"has set the program back considerably,\" he said, adding that he thinks the program still has potential.\nNo comment from Antigua's PM Prime Minister Gaston Browne's office has not responded to repeated requests from CBC News for an interview.\nArton said the problem with some programs, like those in St. Kitts and Antigua, is that they haven't been doing enough to vet candidates.\nThe concerns have led to initiatives to clean up the image of the industry such as launching industry associations, and to a variety of recommendations.\nArton, for example, would like to see a common program for Caribbean countries and a database of rejected applicants.\nKatz believes those who market citizenship by investment programs should be regulated.\nElizabeth Thompson can be reached at elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Well, two things really.\nThe first thing is that Eve is able to manipulate the cells of eukaryotic organisms because they have mitochondria.\nViruses are neither eukaryotic, and most definitely do not have mitochondria. Alex Mercer is consisting of nothing but viral matter that turns biomass into more of itself kind of like John Carpenter's The Thing. If it ever developed any sort of crisis of morality after eating a bunch of helpless pedestrians (and if you played Prototype, and didn't do that at least once you're lying). Which doesn't stick because the writers of Prototype II are not good at their jobs.\nHe does not eat because he has to. It's because it is his way of reproducing, and replacing any lost viral matter by transforming any nearby biomass into more of himself. Just take for example literally the first time he consumes something. Namely, the real Alex Mercer. He is not actually Alex Mercer, and only his creator's memories remain. His body is nothing but the virus. Hence, why he is Black Light rather than being infected by it.\nMitochondria produces energy from oxygen, and regulates the metabolism of a eukaryotic organism.\nThe second thing is the fact that a thermonuclear explosion fails to destroy Alex Mercer completely. If somehow Eve could ignore the fact he is not an eukaryotic organism? Unless she lights him up with fires exceeding temperatures of say 10,000,000 degrees or so it's not going to stick.\nQuite literally Eve would be powerless against Alex.\nIt would be like a hollow from Bleach trying to snack on the soul of a vampire from Buffy: The Vampire Slayer. It just doesn't work because what they need isn't there to begin with.\nAnd there have even been normal human beings who have survived being set ablaze by the Ultimate Being (who is even more powerful than Eve) so long as they quickly hit the water afterwards. Daniel Dollis for example after he throws Maeda's bullets to Aya. Plus, the victims of it tend to be charred corpses rather than being disintegrated outright.\nAlex Mercer is a highly adaptive super virus that turns biological matter into more of itself, can survive thermonuclear explosions, tear through the US military with his bare hands destroying everything they have from tanks to heavily armored vehicles, and assimilates the abilities and memories of everything he consumes. He can easily make his way across the entire city on foot, outrun cars, and dodge heavy munitions.\nWhereas Eve's greatest ace would be pretty much useless against him, and in terms of physical ability he would squash her like a bug.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:45.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f8ecf0d434f05e4a2f53c63fb0882520ea86919", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog631sQyVFj_TRAub1WBI36GMajkO.Wai4hlZjOpLM4sK1ge6lv0A6uNqHcT.YM_njgg--", "site_full": "community.comicbookresources.com", "site": "comicbookresources.com", "site_section": "http://community.comicbookresources.com/forumdisplay.php?20", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "painting", "sports", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "scuba_diving", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Comic Book Rumbles", "title": "Alex Mercer (Prototype) vs Eve (Parasite Eve)", "title_full": "Alex Mercer (Prototype) vs Eve (Parasite Eve)", "published": "2017-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4126, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ae9f17661b29368496e6b102e35c275fe5018f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog631sQyVFj_TRAub1WBI36GMajkO.Wai4hlZjOpLM4sK1ge6lv0A6uNo3VKI3odM6mfj_AlJh0O6J", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "Nightmare Pet", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "[Quote: =The Chou Lives;3292026]She can evolve herself into a super monster on the go, she has flamed non living things (jet) could use that trick to ignite the air around him,[/Quote: ]\nUh no, Eve ignited the pilot in said fighter jet.

Cruz, Manila yesterday. Krizjohn Rosales Probes to include Aquino X MANILA, Philippines \u2014 The Department of Health (DOH) is looking into the possibility of requiring the manufacturer of the world\u2019s first dengue vaccine to refund the government following reports that the treatment poses risks to people without a history of dengue.\n\u201cIt is an option we are considering, but we also have to look into the legal issues,\u201d Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo told reporters yesterday.\nThe controversy on the P3.5-billion dengue immunization program broke after pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Pasteur disclosed that new clinical analysis found its Dengvaxia vaccine effective for people who have had dengue prior to immunization, but noted the risk of a \u201csevere\u201d case of dengue for people who have not.\nBayugo clarified that there had been no apparent irregularity in the purchase of Dengvaxia until Sanofi admitted that the vaccine only provides protection for those previously afflicted with dengue.\nHe explained that the DOH\u2019s decision to implement a dengue immunization program was based on the previous findings that Dengvaxia was safe for use, and there was no complaint before the Commission on Audit concerning its purchase.\n\u201cI still believe that the DOH complied with the requirements of the law in the procurement of the dengue vaccine,\u201d he added.\nHeadlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 Dengvaxia was duly registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when the DOH purchased it.\nThe DOH also complied with the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) that only areas with high dengue prevalence shall be covered by the program.\nhttp://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/12/05/1765465/doh-eyes-refun...\nViews: 12\nTags:",

(\u201cConnecPath\u201d) announced today that education champion Muhammed Chaudhry has joined them as an advisor. Milpitas, CA, December 07, 2017 \u2013( PR.com )\u2013 Chaudhry is a leader in changing the way people think about education. As president and CEO of the Silicon Valley Education Foundation (\u201cSVEF\u201d), he revolutionized the way people understand and respond to the critical need of improving schools to create the next generation of innovators and business leaders.\nUnder Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s leadership, SVEF became the go-to education foundation supporting students, teachers, and families throughout Silicon Valley and beyond. The foundation\u2019s signature program, Elevate Math, has partnered with 45 school districts and involved 11,500 students, not only in Silicon Valley, but also in Oakland, Sacramento and Oregon. Mr. Chaudhry and the SVEF foundation remain focused on new and innovative ways for students to learn while closing the achievement gap \u2013 especially for under-represented and minority students. \nFor much of his career, Mr. Chaudhry has immersed himself in educational causes, looking to unite the business, technology, and academic communities to advance those causes. After completing his undergraduate degree in business, Mr. Chaudhry worked in the private sector as a brand marketer with the Clorox Company and Dazzle Multimedia. Despite private sector success, Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s passion for philanthropy, and for causes that touched children\u2019s lives, drew him back to the non-profit sector. \nMr. Chaudhry joined SVEF in 2001, and spent the next 16 years placing SVEF on the map by forging successful partnerships with world leading firms including Oracle, Cisco, Google, HP, SAP, Target, and Walmart. Since 2008 Mr. Chaudhry has raised over $100 million for numerous education initiatives. \nUnder Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s leadership, SVEF developed successful math and science support programs, which improved the skills and performance of more than 10,000 students. These programs have become a national model. Notably, Mr. Chaudhry led efforts to create SVEF\u2019s Innovation Learning Hub (\u201ciHub\u201d), designed to align education software developers and classroom teachers to test the best products. In partnership with the San Francisco 49ers, Mr. Chaudhry also helped create the 49ers STEM Leadership Institute \u2013 which annually exposes 60 high-performing middle school students to a top-level program in STEM education. \nAbout ConnecPath Inc.ConnecPath is an ed-tech company revolutionizing how students build education and career pathways. Students have historically had to make important decisions about college and careers independently and with limited information. No longer. ConnecPath\u2019s next-generation collaboration platform brings the power of artificial intelligence to students and educators, putting an end to that uncomfortable journey. With ConnecPath, students find pathways that fit their individual passions and competencies with amazing speed. ConnecPath was founded in September 2017 and is headquartered in Silicon Valley.

The refurbishment will revive the mansion after a fire has terribly damaged it in 2015.\nCourtesy of Allies and Morrison\nThe proposal submitted from Allies and Morrison was selected from a shortlist containing several eminent architectural firms. The jury mostly preferred the British firm\u2019s proposal due to its tendency to \u201c respect the quality and character of the mansion house in its historic setting .\u201d Although the winning concept is deep, it pays attention to adding a bit of entertainment to the venue.\nCourtesy of Allies and Morrison\n\u201c Finding the right architect to restore Clandon Park is a very significant milestone in Clandon Park\u2019s history ,\u201d commented the Trustee of the National Trust and former Director of the National Portrait Gallery and jury chair, Sandy Nairne.\n\u201c The fact that many hold Clandon close to their hearts has been on our minds when thinking about its future. The jury\u2019s unanimous selection of Allies and Morrison was a result of their sensitive response to the brief, which matches the National Trust\u2019s commitment to doing what\u2019s best for the mansion, its surviving interiors and the wider estate.\u201d \nCourtesy of Allies and Morrison\n\u201c Our approach is about balance; meticulously reinstating historically significant spaces while in others exploiting the extraordinary character of massive brick walls ,\u201d said Allies and Morrison partner, Paul Appleton. \u201c New floors and ceilings are slotted into this robust matrix to re-order and to redefine, but only just as much as is needed to create timeless spaces without erasing the marks of time. From a restored Marble Hall, through the series of grand rooms on the principal floor, to a soaring new space connecting the lower ground floor to a new roof-terrace, each element plays its own particular part.\u201d \nThe mansion interiors before the fire, courtesy of National Trust Images, Photography: Anthony Parkinson\n\u201c It is hard to imagine an architectural project which bears more directly on the question of how we respond to our heritage ,\u201d Paul Appleton added. \u201c We feel enormously privileged to work with the National Trust to unfold the story Clandon Park has to tell and to begin, together, to weave plans for its future around the extraordinary evidence of its past .\u201d\nThe mansion interiors before the fire, courtesy of National Trust Images, Photography: Anthony Parkinson\nAllies and Morrison will be working hand in hand with the National Trust to transform the proposal into a design.\nThe architectural firm has asked Purcell, who has qualified for the final stages of the competition, to be the conversation architect.

Dezember 2017 leer & aufgebraucht #11 \nAufgebraucht sind mal wieder so einige Dosen, Tuben und Tiegel, Flakons und Fl\u00e4schchen! Ob die kosmetischen Versprechungen in der praktischen Anwendung eingel\u00f6st werden konnten? Welche Beautyprodukte werden erneut gekauft und welche fliegen aus dem Badezimmer? Hier erfahrt ihr es! Atacama Vivid Foundation*, Ilia Beauty via Amazingy , 46 Euro \nDie gut deckende Foundation hat bei meinem wohldosierten Einsatz immerhin fast ein Jahr gehalten und ich war zufrieden mit Auftrag, Deckkraft (\u201eLayering\u201c funktioniert super!) und Haltbarkeit auf der Haut. Pflanzliche Inhaltsstoffe sind au\u00dferdem Aloe Vera (f\u00fcr langanhaltende Feuchtigkeit und Straffung), Extrakte aus Gr\u00fcnem Tee und Rosmarin (Binden von freien Radikalen) und das Harz Mastic (optische Minimierung von Poren und Mattierung). Vivid ist in sechs Nuancen f\u00fcr helle bis dunkle Hautt\u00f6ne erh\u00e4ltlich. Fabulous Face Cleanser, Aesop , 27 Euro \nDas aus Oliven gewonnene Gel ist perfekt f\u00fcr eine milde Gesichtsreinigung auch bei schnell fettender Mischhaut wie der meinigen. Hauptwirkstoffe kommt von Bergamotteschale, Kamillenknospe und Rosmarinblatt. W\u00fcrde ich wieder kaufen. F\u00fcr eine sparsamere Dosierung habe ich einen Pumpspender aufgesetzt, denn ansonsten w\u00e4re das Fl\u00e4schchen eins, fix, drei alle gewesen. Was mir bei Aesop nach wie vor nicht passt: Die Marke macht auf Naturkosmetik \u2013 ohne es zu sein. Ich wei\u00df hier nie so recht woran ich bin. Das hinterl\u00e4sst ein dumpf-doofes Gef\u00fchl. Auch angesichts des Preises! Coverstick, Sante , 8,50 Euro Inzwischen ist nur noch ein funzeliges St\u00fcck des Abdeckstiftes \u00fcbrig. Ich brauche dringend einen Neuen! Der Coverstick mit Bio-Jojoba\u00f6l und Bio-Kamillenextrakt hat mir im Preis-Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis gute Dienste geleistet. Ich benutze ihn vor allem zum Abdecken von Pickelmalen und Pickeln. F\u00fcr letzteres ben\u00f6tigt es zus\u00e4tzlich noch ein wenig Pin-Pointing-Pinselzauber mit dem Mineral Abdeckpuder von Alverde (4,45 Euro). Letzteres habe ich schon h\u00e4ufig nachgekauft. Trifft meinen Hautton, ist leicht und l\u00e4sst sich gut dosieren! Mascara*, Kjaer Weis via Amazingy , 34 Euro Top fand ich die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe des Containers. Viele Mascara Beh\u00e4ltnisse sind gemessen am Inhalt doch sehr wuchtig! Dieser h\u00e4lt Mascara f\u00fcr drei Monate und kann wieder bef\u00fcllt werden. Das B\u00fcrstchen ist leider nicht mein Ding. Die Mascara verspricht: \u201eIt glides on easily, with a sleek wand that adds the perfect amount of product, delivers great definition, and adds layers to eyelashes.\u201c Bei mir gab es mit der B\u00fcrste leider vor allem verklumpte Wimpern. Bronze Imbe Lidschatten* , von Gretel, 30 Euro Das war ein Produkt nach meinem Geschmack! Der hochpigmentierte Mono-Lidschatten ist ein Multifunktionstalent und wurde von mir auch zum Contouring \u00e0 la Julia verwendet. Der Inhaltsstoff wei\u00dfe Tonerde absorbiert \u00fcbersch\u00fcssiges Hautfett und sorgt f\u00fcr extralange Haltbarkeit \u2013 perfekt bei meiner schnell fettenden Haut! Im Sommer hat das Produkt besonders gut mit meinem Hautton harmoniert. Hier sehr ihr es nochmal in Aktion. F\u00e4llt euch was auf? \u2013 der Post ist von Oktober 2015. Ein ganz sch\u00f6n ergiebiges Produkt also! Deocreme*, We Love the Planet , Euro Mein Urteil vorab: Wirkt \u2013 und das ohne Aluminiumsalze oder Alkohol. Der Duft Sweet Serenity (Rose) war allerdings nicht meins. Aktuell rieche und probiere ich mich durch die Duftalternativen Minze, Fresh (Citrus), Orange und Lavendel. Besonders klasse finde ich, dass die Verpackung \u00fcberarbeitet wurde. Die Metalldosen kommt nun nicht mehr mit Drehverschluss daher \u2013 hier hatte ich h\u00e4ufig Probleme mit dem Aufbekommen, insbesondere, wenn ich zuvor ein Gesichts\u00f6l verwendet hatte. Gehalten hat bei t\u00e4glicher Abwendung die Creme im \u00dcbrigen rund 5 Monate \u2013 genau genommen seit unserem Sommerurlaub im Juli (gezeigt habe ich euch es n\u00e4mlich das erste Mal in dieser Beautyurlaubsroutine ). Wie sie wirkt, m\u00f6gt ihr euch fragen? Ich zitiere: \u201eJedes unserer Deodorants hat als Basis eine Kombination aus Bienenwachs, Kokos\u00f6l und Maisst\u00e4rkepulver. Dadurch ist das Deodorant leicht zu verteilen und macht deine Haut samtweich. Die desodorierende Wirkung wird durch Natron hervorgerufen, das Ger\u00fcche auf nat\u00fcrlich Weise neutralisiert.\u201c Das hei\u00dft: Die Deocremes verhindern nicht das Schwitzen, sondern vielmehr die geruchsbildenden Bakterien.

He launched the review after calling the land protections by Democratic former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton federal overreach. \nZinke recommended reducing four large monuments in the U.S. West and modifying rules at six others, according to a memo leaked this fall. He also has said he's recommending the creation of three new monuments. \nHe didn't suggest eliminating any monuments, despite urging by some Republicans in Utah and elsewhere.

Bush, even Barack Obama on the morning after claiming the Democratic nomination, spoke to members of a pro-Israel lobby and pledged, \u201cJerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided.\u201d\nClinton and Bush even promised to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Neither kept that promise. Both were persuaded by their own Middle East experts that doing so would damage any possible path to peace in the region based on a two-state solution, which remained official U.S. policy.\nObama\u2019s vow, of course, barely lasted the day back in 2008 when he \u201cclarified\u201d it in an interview with CNN: \u201cWell, obviously, it\u2019s going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations.\u201d\nBut Donald Trump, who pledged during the campaign to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, has fulfilled part of that pledge in an act largely symbolic, but still fraught with political implications.\nOne fact is clear, of course. Jerusalem, which for millennia was the biblical heart of Judaism, today actually is the capital of modern Israel. It is where the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, meets. It is where its Supreme Court meets. And since Israel\u2019s victory in the 1967 war and its annexation of Arab East Jerusalem, it has been the undivided capital of Israel.\nBut it is also the city that hosts religious shrines sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, and for that reason \u2014 long before the politics of a Palestinian state were a consideration \u2014 it has always had a special status.\nAnd Palestinians have always regarded East Jerusalem as their future capital.\nBut the so-called peace process \u2014 which American presidents have attempted to broker going back to Jimmy Carter \u2014 remains more elusive than ever. Jerusalem has always remained on the table \u2014 a bargaining chip in an international game. Even Trump said yesterday its boundaries remain subject to final status negotiations.\nThere are far worse impediments to peace than a presidential declaration about Israel\u2019s capital. For example, the unwillingness of Palestinians to recognize the right of Israel to exist. Nothing Trump did yesterday makes the prospects for peace any more or less likely.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george w. bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy carter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "herald", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judaism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knesset", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:51.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ab3846974232893f38a83281e45f8343f9e05534", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKx1AuXLPnypclE5xDe4OeAUyhUNtWkA0YERPX4QgVxpqGtYInNt6AZjF1gBvalvVGs6NOnq2ZZvZ_rRSniBcLYvpCtZ0usPL90-", "site_full": "preppyemptynester.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://preppyemptynester.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Preppy Empty Nester", "title": "A Microwavable Hodgepodge", "title_full": "A Microwavable Hodgepodge", "published": "2017-12-06T14:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 22, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "79fe09e1c56de82e37d7aba6ae6552c7c70b3d77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKx1AuXLPnypclE5xDe4OeAUyhUNtWkA0YERPX4QgVxpqGtYInNt6AZjF1gBvalvVGs6NOnq2ZZvZ_rRSniBcLYvqa9kdBmj6N0ZGbd1ZKPF8A--", "ord_in_thread": 22, "author": "Paige", "published": "2017-12-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Kate, my husband tells me our MW is the most expensive appliance we own since about the only thing I use it for is bacon, bacon and bacon.
