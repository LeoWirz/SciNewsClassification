The nail polish may spread or streak. Layer your ornaments into different designs. It\u2019s fun to get creative here! Because it is holiday time, I used red, green, white and gold; perfect holiday colors! \nNow it\u2019s time to dip your clear ornament! You can dip one side at a time or press together and dip as a unit. Just make sure if you dip both sides at once, you break it apart to dry so it doesn\u2019t stick together. I find the best results is to dip straight down and go half way up the ornament. \n\nOnce all your ornaments are done and dry, stuff with your Godiva Masterpieces ! I love that Godiva Masterpieces are inspired by Godiva\u2019s Signature Chocolates . Best of all? They are available as individually wrapped chocolates, which make them perfect for putting inside your ornaments. You can find them in the chocolate aisle of stores like Walmart and Target . What are Godiva Masterpieces? \nYou mean other than little pieces of perfection? Masterpieces are a new line of individually wrapped chocolates and filled chocolate bars from Godiva. Each piece is crafted in the shape of a signature Godiva chocolate and filled with smooth and creamy fillings that melt in your mouth. Once exclusive to Godiva boutiques , the iconic dark chocolate ganache heart, milk chocolate caramel lion, and milk chocolate hazelnut oyster are now available in grocery stores, drug stores, and wherever you shop every day. \nThe dark chocolate ganache is my favorite if you are bringing some to me! \n\nNow that your ornament is filled to the brim, close it up and use a glittery piece of washi tape to seal and complete the marble line. The tape also provides an extra level of security with keeping the ornament closed. \n\nThat is it! You can now either display on your table, keeping the treats front and center, gift in a box or even hang on a tree! \nBeautiful custom-made holiday gifting in a snap!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "godiva", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:19.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "113f09c4bbe0765ccc54d6667e9ae1625e7dbf62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_izpV9G.ZbyAIYgTmHi.L897xkgAHnmyVmZD_7xlv2NiKnn.7I.sf9T0A.HVdHv.c.xBvLwVO.7YpG3sothl37ggi2NzJ2uuTKsBLDoRdyw--", "site_full": "www.clearcreekcourant.com", "site": "clearcreekcourant.com", "site_section": "http://www.clearcreekcourant.com/todaysnews/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "EDC continues work to help county businesses", "title_full": "EDC continues work to help county businesses", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "113f09c4bbe0765ccc54d6667e9ae1625e7dbf62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_izpV9G.ZbyAIYgTmHi.L897xkgAHnmyVmZD_7xlv2NiKnn.7I.sf9T0A.HVdHv.c.xBvLwVO.7YpG3sothl37ggi2NzJ2uuTKsBLDoRdyw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "EDC continues work to help county businesses", "text": "By Ian Neligh   1:17 pm \nThe Clear Creek Economic Development Corporation provided $370,000 to help develop local businesses this year, continuing its mission to help foster new development in the county. \nAbout 30 people met at Cooper\u2019s on the Creek in Georgetown to hear the CCEDC\u2019s end-of-year report and hear from the corporation\u2019s new director. \nThe nonprofit started in 1985 to ensure job creation and retention in Clear Creek County, in part by counseling businesses and giving out business loans.

Both of these events played strong roles in shaping my worldview.   \n\nNot being a vampire or other immortal creature, I wasn't alive for the actual explosion but a fair part of my childhood was spent growing up in the Maritimes.  I remember being taken to a park and shown a massive chunk of iron that was a part of an anchor which was flung over two miles from the harbour by the force of the explosion.  I remember being told that 2000 people died and 9000 were injured, which was one fifth of the population.  The city was devastated, with two square kilometres of the city destroyed. \n\n\n\nThen, in 1989, an armed man went into Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal and shot 14 women out of a deranged sense of entitlement.  Women were taking his place at the school, weren't dating him, and had a future where he didn't.  So he walked into a classroom with a loaded weapon, separated the male and female students and proceeded to execute the women. \n\n\n\nThe explosion was the first man-made disaster I became aware of.  One ship failed to respect the harbour protocol (because they were in a hurry, because they were tired, it's not clear) and that one decision cost thousands of people their lives and health.  There was no action of theirs which contributed to their deaths or injuries and they had little to no warning that it was about to happen.  The shooting was the first time I became aware that there are people in the modern world for whom gender or skin colour or some other inherent trait is enough to earn a death sentence.  That violence can never be entirely prevented and those who use it indiscriminately can strike without apparent warning. \n\nBoth of these events shaped my view of a world which can't be entirely trusted not to drop the other shoe out from under me.  They made me aware of how prejudice, hatred and contempt can become a deadly combination and that the only defense is to speak out against it and advocate for protections and understanding.  They taught me that there are dangerous people out there, either with intent or through carelessness, and they cannot be identified as easily as the bad guys in my Saturday morning cartoons. \n\nBut they also taught me another important lesson.  To look for the heroes (or as Mr. Rogers put it \"Look for the helpers.  You will always find people who are helping\"). \n\nIn Halifax, telegraph dispatcher Vince Coleman stayed at his post to warn an incoming train away from the impending disaster, saving lives.  Firefighters rushed to the pier to try and put out the flames before the ship could explode, with 5 of the 6 man crew dying in the explosion.  In Montreal, Nathalie Provost confronted the gunman, trying to reason with him and ended up being shot four times, but surviving.  She not only completed her degree but encouraged other women to stay in the program and not be afraid.  Alain Perreault and Heidi Rathjen, both present during the shooting, launched a gun control petition to prevent such attacks from happening again in Canada. \n\nThese are only a few examples.  Countless other stories exist, of those who helped others to hide from the shooter, locking doors to keep him from attacking, of those who tried to evacuate children and civilians.  And the outpouring of grief and support from those who were not present, but who stepped up to support survivors. \n\nThe darkness in the world is real and cannot be denied.  Neither of these events were natural, they were the result of decisions which meant they could have been stopped or avoided.  But when they happened, there were those who stepped up and became more than expected, when those around them weren't sure what to do.  And no matter the horror, the heroes outnumber those who sought to bring darkness and they keep working long after the monsters have been slain or have given up. \n\nNot everyone is a hero and that's okay.  There were plenty of people who went through both disasters numbly focused on their own survival or in disbelief that such events could be happening to them.  That's a very human reaction. \n\nIt's also human to look at both the numb masses and the monsters and feel overwhelmed.  As if the world is a terrible and sick place.  It's hard to argue against it, especially lately where prejudice and violence are once more openly hand in hand. \n\nBut I would also hope that we can remember the heroes.  Because no matter how bad it gets, there will always be those bringing light to banish the dark.  They deserve equal time in our memories and awareness.  And maybe they can inspire us all to be a little more heroic in our day to day lives, conquering the smaller day to day blemishes before they can grow. \n\nMaybe it's because I'm a romance reader and writer, but no matter how dark things get, I will always cling tight to hope and my faith in both heroes and happy endings. \n\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rogers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alain perreault", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nathalie provost", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vince coleman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heidi rathjen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ecole polytechnique", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ecole po", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "halifax", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:19.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a6fc28566348bd030096efde23799701336f0a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuiFF0P8fJPIFs.fQzvF4navg--", "site_full": "www.bay12forums.com", "site": "bay12forums.com", "site_section": "http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?board=13.0", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "DF Modding", "title": "[MODDING] 0.44.x questions thread", "title_full": "[MODDING] 0.44.x questions thread", "published": "2017-12-06T13:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 76718, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "056f0f316da3f910811f2e06f2eaa58feba99f8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuiFF0P8fJPIFsRuRLXlZiX1.sU_EX7WbpH", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "bloop_bleep", "published": "2017-12-07T10:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: from: scamtank on December 07, 2017, 01:56:05 am Quote: from: bloop_bleep on December 07, 2017, 01:24:01 am How do you specify which syndrome an interaction induces?

Have you ever seen black ice? How does black ice form? Why is black ice dangerous? Tags: Listen What are some of your favorite things to do in winter ? When the weather turns cold and snow begins to fall, you probably look forward to a snow day off from school and some sledding on your favorite hill. \nIf you're an adult, though, that weather brings with it a special headache that most people would rather avoid : driving in snow and ice. The things you take for granted under normal conditions , like steering your car exactly where you want and stopping quickly, can be tricky and hazardous during the winter. \nEven when there's no snow on the ground, driving can still be tricky if a special type of driving hazard presents itself. You can be driving along and see something on the road ahead that looks like wet pavement . When your car hits it, though, you can be spinning out of control before you know it. \nWhat did you run into? Weather experts call it black ice. The name is a bit deceptive . Black ice isn't actually black in color. It's also not milky white like regular ice. Instead, it's almost completely clear . Since you see right through it to the pavement below, it often seems to be black, thus the name \"black ice.\" \nBlack ice needs the right conditions to form. First, water must collect on the road in a very thin layer without splashing or wind. Regular rainfall on a windy day might freeze, but it would contain air bubbles and swirls that give regular ice its white color. \nBlack ice is almost perfectly clear , so the source of water usually comes from fog, exhaust condensation from vehicle tailpipes, gentle, misty rain, or melted snow and slush. It is so thin that it can form when the surface temperature of the road is freezing even if the air temperature is above freezing. \nCold, sunless early winter mornings are a prime time to find black ice on the roads. Black ice often forms overnight when temperatures drop. \nIt also tends to form on bridges and overpasses, since those structures freeze before roadways. Drivers should also watch out for spots on the road that are shaded by trees or other objects, since shady areas are perfect spots for black ice to form. \nWhat should you do if you're driving and you hit a patch of black ice? The immediate temptation is to hit the brake pedal, since you want the car to stop if you feel it sliding out of control . \nHowever, experts recommend removing your foot from the gas, keeping your steering wheel straight, and waiting just a couple of seconds until your tires regain some traction before trying to apply the brakes to stop. This sounds easy, but it can be difficult to remember when you hit a patch of black ice. \nExperts also suggest that drivers not use cruise control if black ice is possible. Turning off cruise control gives the driver more control over acceleration and braking in case black ice is encountered.

( AMZN ) devices from accessing YouTube and plans to block the popular video streaming service altogether starting on the first day of 2018. \nIn a statement to Variety , which first spotted the move by Google on Tuesday, the online search giant said it pulled YouTube from Amazon-made Echo and Fire TV devices because Amazon isn\u2019t interested in reaching a business deal with Google over carrying its other products. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to reach an agreement with Amazon to give consumers access to each other\u2019s products and services. But Amazon doesn\u2019t carry Google products like Chromecast and Google Home, doesn\u2019t make Prime Video available for Google Cast users, and last month stopped selling some of Nest\u2019s latest products. Given this lack of reciprocity, we are no longer supporting YouTube on Echo Show and FireTV. We hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon,\u201d a Google spokesperson told Variety. (See also: Amazon's Alexa Will Approach 71% of Smart Speaker Market: eMarketer .) Blocking and Bickering \nNot surprisingly, Amazon quickly fired back with its own statement to Variety saying the Echo Show and Fire TV display a standard web view of YouTube.com and send customers directly to the website. \u201cGoogle is setting a disappointing precedent by selectively blocking customer access to an open website. We hope to resolve this with Google as soon as possible.\u201d (See more: Amazon, Google Feud Over YouTube Removal From Echo Show. ) \nThis isn\u2019t the first time in recent weeks that the two have had a public fight over YouTube on Amazon devices. In late September, Google pulled YouTube from Echo Show devices without any warning, making the same argument. The companies blamed each other in that incident but a source familiar with YouTube\u2019s thinking told Variety that this time around Amazon violated YouTube\u2019s terms of service because it layered voice control over an app that wasn\u2019t made to interact with voices. Still, even with some technical issues involved in the latest dispute, it's much more likely to have to do with simmering resentments over which Google products Amazon sells and which it doesn\u2019t. In late 2015, Amazon stopped selling Google\u2019s Chromecast streaming adapter and never really sold the Home voice-activated speaker, hurting sales of both products. According to Variety, Amazon also kicked some of Google\u2019s Nest products off its e-commerce site after Google blocked YouTube on the Echo Show in September. By blocking YouTube, which is hugely popular on streaming devices, it could hurt sales of Amazon\u2019s Fire TV. Variety noted that when Google pulled YouTube from the Echo Show sales of the device declined.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

Mobile Value Added Services Market Synopsis: Future Speculation:\ufffd Today, in the\ufffdvalue chain, maximum revenue is going to mobile operators followed by mVAS service providers then comes the content\ufffdowners. It\ufffdis expected that mobile operators will lose prominence in the value chain as the market for content aggregators will consolidate with their better bargaining power making the higher revenues shift to the content aggregators from mobile\ufffdoperators. The\ufffdmobile users add to a good amount of revenues for mobile operators thus making mobile VAS (mVAS) a significant part of Mobile Telephony. It is also predicted that there will be increasing demand form Commerce, video streaming and infotainment services with the launch of\ufffd5G services. Today, Service providers are offering different range of mobile value added services to suit every end users requirement. The different category of services such as Music,\ufffd Astro and Devotional, Social Networking, Video Search, Utility VAS, Infotainment, Rural,\ufffd m-Education to name a few.\ufffd Soon we are going to witness hyper personalization in the field of mobile Value Added services. For instance; Education is soon to see a wave of hyper personalization which will be tailored to every individual student\ufffds needs and focused on learning outcomes that enable one to do something meaningful with their learning. This is a far shot from the current \ufffdone size fits all\ufffd approach of textbooks \ufffd which trips out on the individual capacity and interest of a student to absorb. Currently the mode of education is mostly linear in terms of learning a theory and application of the theory to get standard set of observations and answers. The learning methodology is a well versed on vertical path with no scope for horizontal discoveries along it. For instance, a discovery and learning of a particular word is not followed up by a thesaurus mode of synonyms and antonyms or the formation of the word (origins and semantics). The objective is memory by rote accessed by stress inducing examinations as against application, self-discovery and aided learning of the concepts beyond the scope of the text book syllabus.
