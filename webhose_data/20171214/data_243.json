Yes Im crying for help. I started the first video you sent me and its very informative. I now realize the limitations of sRGB. So 50% into what you sent, will finish tonight. I instinctively wat my workflow to be in Pro and export in sRGB only for web work.\nRight but that's only going to ensure that those with calibrated and profiled displays (and how plays a role), using color managed web browsers will see the image in a reasonable way visually.\nNow I just need my camera, my MAC and lightroom to all be on the same page....???\nYour camera shoots raw (I'm quite sure but could be wrong, you're not a JPEG shooter ). So worry about optimal exposure for raw and then hand off to Lightroom. It conducts all processing in a ProPhoto RGB like color space. Not identical but same size color gamut.

For your clients, you must export to sRGB.\nNow why would his clients have to have sRGB?\nBTW, you can take some of the photos you posted, export it to sRGB, then to Adobe and open the images one after the other with another viewer to see if there is any difference.\nOn a color managed browser, there will be nothing to worry about.\nOn a non color managed browser, (ugh) on a wide gamut display, sRGB looks awful and Adobe RGB (1998) looks much better.\nThis really has little to do with the color space of images posted and more about how viewers are implementing or not implementing color management on their side, with their browsers.\nOn Safari, a tagged ProPhoto RGB image previews exactly like Photoshop, Lightroom and other color managed applications. With color management ANY tagged image will preview as it should. Without, sRGB is the least, worst color space but I'd hope you would know that without color management, in no way is using sRGB a guarantee of any kind of visual color matching.\nNon color managed applications don't know what sRGB is. Then send the RGB values directly to the display. They don't know the condition of the display via it's device profile.

Curated by Yan-Huei Chen, the two-month long event showcases artwork from seven Taiwanese artists on the subject of reality and the ways in which we interpret our reality through sight and language. The artists explore and examine reality by incorporating their experience and understanding of history and their social environment. The exhibition, which includes paintings, sculptures as well as new media and installation art, hopes to create a dialogue with local artists and foster cultural exchange and collaboration between Taiwanese artists and their international peers. On display are works by Teng-Yuan Chang, Qing-Yao Chen, I-Ting Hou, Yu-An Liao, Pei-Shih Tu, Yi-Li Yeh and Goang-Ming Yuan \nThis marks the first time that works from Art Bank, Taiwan have been shown in New York. A program under the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, Art Bank aims to promote artistic creation and the cultivation of Taiwanese artists through a public collection program. \nBrief introduction of the works of each participating artist: \nLooking at Taiwan\u2019s history and current cultural environment, HOU I-Ting explores our unfamiliarity with the cultures of our own country in a time when global cultures are increasingly blending together. \nTu Pei-Shih\u2019s animations excel in showing the relationships between imaginations, threats, and contemporary societies, responding to conflicts and absurdities in life with fictional and imagined narratives. \nExploring Taiwanese folk cultures, Chen Qing-Yao\u2019s work is a parody of the explorers depicted on adventure/discovery-like channels, and of the Western media\u2019s way of seeing things. \nYeh Yi-Li\u2019s pieces are reconstructed memories of seeing. Combining blue-and-white pottery with toy blocks, the sculptures\u2014a mixture of Eastern and Western cultures\u2014depict and add a sense of unreality to memories. They interpret the cultural hybridity born out of the heterogeneous contemporary society and continuously reconstruct what we understand as real. \nLiao Yu-An watches the tense and delicate daily interaction between city dwellers and puts it in his work, creating a subtle, almost paranoid metaphor. \nThe archeology sites in Chang Teng-Yuan\u2019s series of works come from his observation of popular cultures and environments in our time. Logically fictitious and thus realistically imaginative, the art pieces show Earth in the future from the perspective of a group of parrot men\u2014fictional characters in Chang\u2019s series. \nYuan Goang-Ming\u2019s works resemble an image experiment about the act of taking pictures, the objects being photographed, and the viewers. It makes viewers look outside of the visual box and rethink their visual perception models and the spatial relationships created by images.

Multnomah County Circuit Judge Judith Matarazzo in November denied Les Schwab\u2019s attorney\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. The judge wrote that she agreed with the company\u2019s interpretation of one element of the law, but that the case should proceed on other questions. The lawsuit, filed by former Les Schwab Tire Centers employee Michael Palmateer in June, seeks unpaid wages due him for meal breaks shorter than 30 minutes and overtime for weeks during which he worked through shortened breaks. Palmateer\u2019s lawyers also asked the court to certify Palmateer\u2019s suit as a class action, with the potential to include hundreds if not thousands of employees and former employees, and millions of dollars. Matarazzo, while denying the company\u2019s motion, agreed with its lawyers, who argued that employers need not guarantee a meal break, or, in other words, police their workers to ensure they take those breaks. Employers need only provide their workers with a meal-break opportunity, Les Schwab attorneys argued. \u201cWe\u2019re happy that the court agreed with our position,\u201d said Dale Thompson, spokesman for Les Schwab Tire Centers, based in Bend. \u201cOur hope is that the court\u2019s view would reinforce what the law says, and that there really is no case here.\u201d Thompson said seasonal tire changes create a heavy demand and a fast pace at Les Schwab Tire Centers. But the company wants its hourly workers to take their breaks, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work and they need to sustain the work they do. There are long hours during the spring and winter change overs,\u201d Thompson said. But Palmateer\u2019s lawyer Jennifer Palmquist, of Portland, on Wednesday said the judge left plenty of room to maneuver, basically saying the question of whether Les Schwab provided a \u201clegally compliant\u201d break period is still on the table. \u201cRather,\u201d Matarazzo wrote in her order, \u201cthe court recognizes that there are a multitude of facts to determine if an employer interfered with, coerced or otherwise encouraged an employee to take a break period of less than the length required by law, or failed to notify an employee\u201d of his or her right to a 30-minute meal break. Oregon law requires a half-hour meal break after six hours of work, with some exceptions. If the employee is \u201cnot relieved of all duties for 30 continuous minutes during the meal period, the employer must pay the employee for the entire 30-minute period,\u201d the law states. In her order, Matarazzo cites the law on meal breaks, including the exceptions that permit an employer to sidestep the employees\u2019 30-minute break. \u201cIt\u2019s right out of the statute. Did they do any of these things? No,\u201d Palmquist said Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not winning.\u201d \u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7815, ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "palmquist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "les schwab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dale thompson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matarazzo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer palmquist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael palmateer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thompson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palmateer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judith matarazzo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "les schwab tire centers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "les schwab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "multnomah county circuit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:38.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51f324b17abe70b76e6820485f63628b6e30d032", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950Kd2SI3sDyOm1", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender - 4chan", "title": "/ftmg/ - female to male general", "title_full": "/lgbt/ - /ftmg/ - female to male general - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-02T16:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 248, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.073, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b63cac7fc2c41daf99f153f3374ea31b9ccc6faa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950KRaW7KJgGW5St3dQ.ORRGjk-", "ord_in_thread": 223, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T21:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9247176\nI'm interested but I'm not even transitioning so there's no point in showing my interest\nIt's also easier to google results etc. so there's no point in asking in the thread when it come sup", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:38.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "99d7cfecb7e36d8c854dacd223472d90ffe9e259", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SN9il7cGGTt7g.TSvhBp_rg.gonE.pEcRM2dRaMvIqVDF8TKQ73zzdgEq37nEHw-", "site_full": "www.dpreview.com", "site": "dpreview.com", "site_section": "https://www.dpreview.com/forums/1061", "site_categories": ["photography", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Photographic Science and Technology Forum: Digital Photography Review", "title": "Canon 1DX MKII Workflow Adobe, sRGB or Other:", "title_full": "Canon 1DX MKII Workflow Adobe, sRGB or Other: Photographic Science and Technology Forum: Digital Photography Review", "published": "2017-12-04T12:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1469, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "217dfd3bc575d26c4015c982b7d6287a4cc212e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SN9il7cGGTt7g.TSvhBp_rg.gonE.pEcRM2dRaMvIqVDF8TKQ73z88_n8TTb59H0Qer_K5ixbWduX.rZJia3pETX1KRYp2s-", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "digidog", "published": "2017-12-04T12:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: :\nQuote: :\nQuote: :\nQuote: :\nQuote: :\nJ A C Quote: :\nI am still not sure what the problems is.

Yes Im crying for help. I started the first video you sent me and its very informative. I now realize the limitations of sRGB. So 50% into what you sent, will finish tonight. I instinctively wat my workflow to be in Pro and export in sRGB only for web work.\nRight but that's only going to ensure that those with calibrated and profiled displays (and how plays a role), using color managed web browsers will see the image in a reasonable way visually.\nNow I just need my camera, my MAC and lightroom to all be on the same page....???\nYour camera shoots raw (I'm quite sure but could be wrong, you're not a JPEG shooter ).\n100% raw\nSo worry about optimal exposure for raw and then hand off to Lightroom.\nOppps... ive been handing off to Canon's DPP converting to 16 BIT TIFF and then importing to LR.\nNot necessarily. Kind of odd, do you now wish to process the raw in Lightroom?\nPerhaps this is part of the problem? I thought it was rendering my raw files better. At least they lloked better but perhaps im VERY wrong.\nIF you think they look better, they do\nIt conducts all processing in a ProPhoto RGB like color space. Not identical but same size color gamut. You can then export a master image in high bit (16-bit), full resolution, ProPhoto RGB for further pixel editing outside LR if necessary. Then resample to the size you desire for the web, convert to sRGB, maybe output sharpen (another story)\nIll want to hear this\nYou can still process in DPP (as a fellow Canon shooter, I'd go kicking and screaming but respect your decision as to what tools you prefer). Then send a processed TIFFs to Lightroom and still use the Export Presets for creating web destined images. Or any of the other modules.\nand post. All this can be done with a single export preset built in Lightroom.\nUnderstand that millions upon millions of people will not see your images as you intended or as you see because they don't have color management intact.\nI WISH I COULD SHAKE YOUR HAND!!!!\nTHANK YOU THANK YOU\nThank you.

Yes Im crying for help. I started the first video you sent me and its very informative. I now realize the limitations of sRGB. So 50% into what you sent, will finish tonight. I instinctively wat my workflow to be in Pro and export in sRGB only for web work.\nRight but that's only going to ensure that those with calibrated and profiled displays (and how plays a role), using color managed web browsers will see the image in a reasonable way visually.\nNow I just need my camera, my MAC and lightroom to all be on the same page....???\nYour camera shoots raw (I'm quite sure but could be wrong, you're not a JPEG shooter ).\n100% raw\nSo worry about optimal exposure for raw and then hand off to Lightroom.\nOppps... ive been handing off to Canon's DPP converting to 16 BIT TIFF and then importing to LR.\nNot necessarily. Kind of odd, do you now wish to process the raw in Lightroom?\nMy physical workflow for medium storage is to download from my CFast card to a 3-4TB external portable hard drive the CR2 files and setup folders by the shoot date.\nI then go into DPP and batch process so DPP creates a JPEG and 16 bit TIFF for each file in subfolders labeled JPEG and TIFF respectively. I then go into LR and import just the TIFF's and then edit with the completed file exported as a JPEG (SRGB) in a subfolder of the TIFF folder labeled as 5 Star. (Wishful thinking)\nSo far, all could be done in LR of course.\nMy only concern here (aside from sRGB) is that I seem to lose some functionality in LR because it's a TIFF vs. a CR2 file.\nYou do IF you edit in Develop! It's a rendered TIFF, no longer raw.\nIt's also more work; does not utilize (i think) some advantages built into LR for storing???\nLR is a DAM so it's a database of where all your files reside.\nI only do this because I think the files render better in DPP.\nAnd that's fine.\nI think Canon gets \"something\" about their CR2 files that Adobe might not... Or... Is you wise advise to move over to Pro vs sRGB going to eliminate what I'm seeing the advantage DPP has over LR when rendering?\nGot little to do with the color space. More with the qualities of the raw processing engine, the controls provided and of course the person pulling all those sliders etc.\nI don't know. Perhaps you do as your approach seems to be more about \"Science vs. My Feelings\" as a person who knows so little compared to you.\nThere are dozens of raw converters and people choose them for all kinds of reasons. If those reasons are sound to them, so be it.\nPerhaps this is part of the problem? I thought it was rendering my raw files better. At least they lloked better but perhaps im VERY wrong.\nIF you think they look better, they do\nIf you feel that way after reading the above... I'll take your advice.\nI'd examine what LR isn't doing that you want that DPP is and perhaps, a savvy LR user can produce that in the product. It's pretty deep (not Photoshop deep but there's a lot to look over). If you're on a Mac, Iridient Developer is IMHO better at rendering raws than LR but no DAM, none of the modules I use all the time (Print), but the differences can be subtle.\nIt conducts all processing in a ProPhoto RGB like color space. Not identical but same size color gamut. You can then export a master image in high bit (16-bit), full resolution, ProPhoto RGB for further pixel editing outside LR if necessary. Then resample to the size you desire for the web, convert to sRGB, maybe output sharpen (another story)\nIll want to hear this\nYou can still process in DPP (as a fellow Canon shooter, I'd go kicking and screaming but respect your decision as to what tools you prefer). Then send a processed TIFFs to Lightroom and still use the Export Presets for creating web destined images. Or any of the other modules.\nI can and will if still feel the same way. I greatly look forward to the first day I calibrate and switch to your advice and edit. Very excited to do this. Still, don't know exactly what to change everything in my workflow to calibrate, edit and view in Pro... but first I want to learn from you and your videos.\nGo slow! One step at a time.

With color management ANY tagged image will preview as it should. Without, sRGB is the least, worst color space but I'd hope you would know that without color management, in no way is using sRGB a guarantee of any kind of visual color matching.\nNon color managed applications don't know what sRGB is. Then send the RGB values directly to the display. They don't know the condition of the display via it's device profile.

Franken should resign,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Wednesday evening, the latest in an avalanche of statements that began with a half-dozen Democratic women and then snowballed throughout the day. \u201cI consider Sen. Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately.\u201d Franken, D-Minn., has scheduled an announcement on his future in the Senate for Thursday, and he pushed back on a Minnesota Public Radio report that he would be resigning. \u201cNo final decision has been made and the Senator is still talking with his family,\u201d his office said on Twitter. By Wednesday evening, there was widespread expectation among senators in the Democratic caucus and aides that Franken would step down. If he does, he would be the most prominent lawmaker so far to be felled by the swirling allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct sweeping through the Capitol. On Tuesday, Rep. John Conyers Jr., the longest-serving member of the House and the longest-serving African-American congressman in history, stepped down under severe pressure after multiple women said he had harassed them, including one who said she was fired for refusing to have sex with him. A freshman Democrat, Rep. Ruben Kihuen of Nevada, has faced calls for his resignation since charges emerged Friday that he had repeatedly propositioned his former campaign finance director. Accusations against Franken include an episode of forcible kissing on a USO tour before he was elected and several allegations that he groped women as he posed with them for photographs. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, also called on Wednesday for Franken to leave the Senate. But by and large, Republicans have seemed more tolerant of infractions in their own ranks. House leaders have said nothing since it was revealed Friday that Rep. Blake Farenthold of Texas used $84,000 from a secret taxpayer fund to settle a lurid sexual harassment case filed against him. And Republicans are deeply divided over Alabama\u2019s Republican Senate candidate, Roy Moore, who has been accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls as young as 14, yet has maintained the support of President Donald Trump and other conservatives. 18950891 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yamiche alcin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruben kihuen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicholas fandos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blake farenthold", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times news service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota public radio", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-ky.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:38.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51f324b17abe70b76e6820485f63628b6e30d032", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950Kd2SI3sDyOm1", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender - 4chan", "title": "/ftmg/ - female to male general", "title_full": "/lgbt/ - /ftmg/ - female to male general - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-02T16:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 248, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.073, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "482a757fa08969157ab9568536fd2224735059fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950KRaW7KJgGW5SI1agM0CgQC4-", "ord_in_thread": 205, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T08:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9245120\n>>9245172\nNevermind, derp.

He was 74. Hallyday, who often was called \u201cthe French Elvis,\u201d died Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron announced in a statement. Fans \u2014 many in tears or carrying flowers \u2014 gathered outside his home to honor the rocker. Macron said Hallyday \u201cbrought a part of America into our national pantheon.\u201d Hallyday, he said, seemed nearly invincible and long ago had been christened a \u201cFrench hero.\u201d Although many Americans had never heard of Hallyday, he was considered a godlike figure in France, where a survey once indicated he could likely get enough votes to be elected president. \u201cHearing about Johnny\u2019s death has hurt us because Johnny is our God and nobody can replace him,\u201d one fan, Yves Buisson, told the Associated Press outside the Hallyday family\u2019s gated home in Marnes-La-Coquette. His arms were covered with tattoos of the star. In 1997, French President Jacques Chirac presented Hallyday with the Legion of Honor. The Elvis-inspired rocker scored early hits with French cover versions of U.S. records such as \u201cBe-Bop-A-Lula,\u201d \u201cBlue Suede Shoes,\u201d \u201cWhole Lot of Shakin\u2019 Going On\u201d and \u201cLong Tall Sally.\u201d His 1961 version of Chubby Checker\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Twist Again\u201d sold 1 million copies, and his early appearances in France caused riots. \u201cJohnny Hallyday introduced American rock \u2019n\u2019 roll to a vast French-speaking audience around the world,\u201d Howard Kramer, curatorial director at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, told The Times. \u201cHe had a great reputation as a live performer, and he made records that were massively popular. He never really broke out of Europe, but his success was so massive he didn\u2019t really need to.\u201d Over the decades, Hallyday reportedly sold more than 100 million records and performed before more than 15 million people in concert. In 1966, he selected Jimi Hendrix as an opening act and used eventual Led Zeppelin founder Jimmy Page in the recording studio as a session guitarist. \u201cJohnny is our god. We live and breathe him,\u201d a man in his 60s told the Times of London in 2009 when Hallyday launched a six-month sold-out farewell concert series, \u201cTour 66 \u2014 I\u2019m Stopping Here.\u201d Hallyday, who in recent years had split his time between Paris and Los Angeles, said at the time that he planned to continue recording occasionally. But he said decades on the road had worn him down. He had lung cancer and had repeated health scares over the years, including undergoing back surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. \u201cI have had enough playing Johnny Hallyday,\u201d the Times of London reported him as saying a week before the 2009 tour. \u201cI want more and more to be Jean-Philippe Smet.\u201d The son of a Belgian father and a French mother, he was born Jean-Philippe Smet in Paris on June 15, 1943. His vagabond father, who performed in cabarets and theaters, soon left, and his mother became a model to earn money. Hallyday was raised by his paternal aunt, who had acted in silent films and had two daughters who became dancers. As a child, he lived with his aunt and cousins in London for several years and traveled with them when they performed in Belgium, Germany and Portugal before returning to Paris. He also made his film debut as a child \u2014 an uncredited walk-on in Henri-Georges Clouzot\u2019s 1955 thriller \u201cDiabolique.\u201d As a teenager, Hallyday idolized Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift and James Dean, and his favorite movies were \u201cEast of Eden,\u201d \u201cOn the Waterfront\u201d and \u201cThe Wild One.\u201d \u201cI adored all that period in the history of cinema \u2014 everything that spilled forth from the Actors Studio,\u201d he told Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Sun-Sentinel in 2003. \u201cI actually wanted to be an actor before I became a singer. But when I was 12, I discovered rock \u2019n\u2019 roll through Elvis Presley.\u201d At 17, he recalled, \u201cI was playing a ballroom gig one Sunday to get some money to pay for my acting classes when a producer heard me and asked me to do a record. I did it, and it all just happened from there.\u201d Hallyday began appearing in French movies after he gained his rock \u2019n\u2019 roll fame, but he primarily played singers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do,\u201d he told the New York Times in 2003. \u201cI wanted to separate the singer from the actor. So I stopped for several years and then started to work again with directors Costa-Gavras, Jean-Luc Godard \u2014 roles where I wasn\u2019t a singer at all.\u201d Hallyday received critical acclaim for his role as a bank robber in director Patrice Leconte\u2019s film \u201cMan on the Train.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the equivalent of Joan of Arc in France,\u201d late actor Jean Rochefort, who co-starred in the film, once told the New York Times. \u201cFor me, he isn\u2019t really an actor but a man who has a presence, an undeniable charisma.\u201d Hallyday, who had several marriages, including to French singing star Sylvie Vartan, is survived by his wife, Laeticia; and four children, Jade, Joy, Laura Smet and Dave. Hallyday was at times open about his turbulent personal life, and his 1966 song \u201cNoir C\u2019est Noir\u201d was often linked to a suicide attempt after the birth of his son. In recent years, he seemed to treasure anonymity. 18945450 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dennis mclellan", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "elvis", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "johnny hallyday", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "elvis presley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean rochefort", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marlon brando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montgomery clift", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacques chirac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howard kramer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hallyday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-luc godard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura smet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy page", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yves buisson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sylvie vartan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimi hendrix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sally", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james dean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laeticia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henri-georges clouzot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrice leconte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-philippe smet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zeppelin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sun-sentinel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roll hall of fame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "costa-gavras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times of london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cedars-sinai medical center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marnes-la-coquette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort lauderdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portugal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:38.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51f324b17abe70b76e6820485f63628b6e30d032", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950Kd2SI3sDyOm1", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp;

Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital despite intense Arab, Muslim and European opposition to a move that would upend decades of U.S. policy and risk potentially violent protests. Evan Vucci AP Photo On Jerusalem, Trump delivers for supporters at home By CATHERINE LUCEY Associated Press December 07, 2017 04:04 AM WASHINGTON \nPresident Donald Trump's move to recognize the divided city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital may have triggered a worldwide chorus of critics but the president had his ears closely tuned to his supporters at home. \nFor Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \n\"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\" the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \"Today, I am delivering.\" \nThose were words to savor for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed \u2014 sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nRepealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump's frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evan vucci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "white house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catherine lucey associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:39.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51f324b17abe70b76e6820485f63628b6e30d032", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950Kd2SI3sDyOm1", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp;

Follow on Twitter @MarkMorical. MOUNT BACHELOR \u2014 Powder, packed powder, tracked-out powder, corduroy, crust, hard-pack, ice \u2014 conditions can vary dramatically on the mountain slopes this time of year, and skiers and snowboarders should be prepared. For more outdoors columns by Mark Morical, visit bendbulletin.com/outdoors . Follow on Twitter @MarkMorical. View More This past Sunday was a powder morning that turned into a tracked-out powder afternoon. Tuesday was a corduroy morning that turned into a bumpy, choppy afternoon. An article on the website thesnowchas ers.com describes 22 different types of snow on most slopes. For brevity, I will cover only a handful here \u2014 the kind most often found at Mt. Bachelor ski area. On Sunday, I fought punishing lift lines to enjoy 5 inches of powder that had fallen the night before. Turning through the deep, dry snow on my snowboard was fairly easy, but as the day wore on it became increasingly difficult. \u201cPowder takes more muscle strength, so maybe you\u2019re not in as good a shape as you were at the end of the previous season,\u201d said Tom Lomax, mountain operations manager at Bachelor. \u201cSo it\u2019s something to keep in mind.\u201d As the day wore on, that changed into tracked-out powder, which is still soft but can be hard on the knees as you ride over the tracks. \u201cIt\u2019s not super flat, but it\u2019s still really soft,\u201d Lomax said of packed powder. \u201cYou can still dig into a lot of snow.\u201d Tuesday on the mountain started with corduroy \u2014 those perfectly straight lines formed by the plastic combs on the back of the tiller on the grooming machine. Skiers and boarders can carve with ease on this type of surface, but it gets chewed up as the day goes on. Such was the case Tuesday, when a soft-groomer day turned into a day of trying to avoid bumps and moguls. Lomax said snowriders should always be aware of changing terrain. \u201cPeople are gonna push the snow around all day and start to make small moguls and maybe some ruts and things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just ride accordingly. Just be in a good neutral position and be able to adjust to that terrain so you ski over it. I don\u2019t think you necessarily change your skiing a lot, but it\u2019s certainly not going to be as smooth as it was on that first corduroy run of the morning. As you go through the day, a little lighter touch on your skis.\u201d Lomax said that crust is probably the most difficult type of snow for skiers to negotiate. Crust forms when warming occurs after a recent snowfall. The moisture from the melting snow hardens with colder conditions overnight, Lomax explained. Crust is not so challenging for snowboarders, but for skiers it can pull their skis apart or be \u201chooky.\u201d \u201cYou have to make a solid platform with your skis, and really focus on keeping that platform through your turn, so you don\u2019t hook one ski and have it pull out,\u201d Lomax said. He added that most newer skis are wider, which helps skiers tremendously in crust conditions. And newer all-mountain skis are adaptable to a variety of snow types. \u201cThat used to be a much bigger deal before the new skis,\u201d Lomax said of crust. Icy conditions also occur after several days of no new snow and heavy skier traffic, Lomax noted. That combination can pack the snow and slide all the soft snow off the slopes. But when skiing ice or hard-pack conditions, skiers can ride their edges. \u201cThe new skis have a defined carving radius built into them,\u201d Lomax said. \u201cOn the hard pack, the new skis are just awesome for that. You lay the ski over and let the ski do all the work.\u201d With no snowfall in the forecast through next week and high temperatures expected to reach the 40s at Bachelor, skiers and riders could be in store for some hard-pack or icy conditions. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see some pretty warm weather this week,\u201d Lomax said. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably get harder, but the grooming machines will keep it tilled up and smooth.\u201d The weather this fall has certainly been interesting at Bachelor. Some 40 inches of snowpack on opening day (Nov. 18) dwindled to 20 inches after several days of warm rain and high winds. The resort was forced to close for a few days before reopening on Nov. 24, and lower-elevation resorts in Central Oregon \u2014 Hoodoo Ski Area near Sisters and Willamette Pass \u2014 have still not opened. Bachelor reported a snowpack of 30 inches on Wednesday, and the base remains solid on most of the main runs. But Lomax said more snow is needed to be able to open additional chairlifts, including Cloudchaser and Outback. Lomax advised snowriders to use extreme caution, especially if riding off the groomed runs. The snowpack is thin enough that riding over exposed rocks, stumps or sudden terrain changes is a constant hazard. \u201cYou have to be very careful right now,\u201d Lomax warned. \u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of hazards \u2014 things you can see and things you can\u2019t see. It\u2019s not necessarily gonna be a soft landing, if you\u2019re in the woods and there\u2019s a tree blowdown with branches, or a lava ridge that\u2019s not completely covered but it looks covered to you. All those hazards are kind of off the main runs. It\u2019s really a good idea just to start mellow and easy. We\u2019ve got almost a six-month ski season here.

The House and Senate passed separate tax cut packages in recent weeks, and both bills would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. But GOP negotiators are openly discussing the possibility of moving that rate up to 22 percent to free up more revenue, people familiar with the discussions said. One of those people said the 22 percent rate is \u201cseriously under discussion.\u201d The two people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations. No decisions have been made. The White House has been resistant to making this change, but President Donald Trump said casually on Saturday morning that the 22 percent corporate rate might be necessary. Each percentage point that is added back to the corporate rate would free up about $100 billion in revenue over 10 years. Still, White House officials have tried to stress to Congress in the past two days that their strong preference is to keep the corporate rate at 20 percent. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he, too, was resistant to raising the rate. \u201cNot as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still 20.\u201d The House and Senate must pass matching tax bills before Trump can sign the package into law. But there are a number of changes Republicans want that would make the legislation more costly, and the package cannot add more than $1.5 trillion to the debt over 10 years. One of the changes they are considering would repeal, or at least severely scale back, an alternative-minimum tax for corporations that tries to limit the deductions and credits companies can take. Another major change receiving growing attention would allow Americans to deduct up to $10,000 of state income tax or local property tax from their federal income tax. The House and Senate bills would only allow Americans to deduct the property tax component, but lawmakers are looking to give people more flexibility. Another leading Finance Committee member, Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., cited both of those issues in acknowledging that Republicans are looking for new revenue sources to address lingering problems. \u201cSo we all understand there are some things that are going to have to change. So we\u2019re going to have to figure out how to do that,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not predicting that we\u2019re going to go to a 22 percent corporate rate.\u201d The White House and Republican leaders have heard numerous complaints from wealthy GOP donors in California and New York who believe their taxes could go up under the new regime because of limitations on deductions. They are trying to make changes to address those concern before the package is completed. Trump referenced these complaints Wednesday when he said that the final GOP tax bill should take care of the \u201ctiny little sliver\u201d of people who don\u2019t benefit under the legislation as written. The president\u2019s comments came as House and Senate Republicans worked to iron out differences between the tax bills passed by each chamber, with the goal of sending compromise legislation to Trump before Christmas. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., endorsed one change under consideration, which would allow a $10,000 property-tax deduction in the bill to apply to state income taxes as well. \u201cThat sounds like a kind of reasonable idea,\u201d McConnell told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday. There is believed to be more than a \u201ctiny little sliver\u201d of Americans who will miss out on benefits from the GOP legislation, according to nonpartisan analyses that show the bills skew toward corporations and the wealthy despite their billing as a middle-class tax cut. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a fantastic tax bill. There are very, very few people that aren\u2019t benefiting by it, but there\u2019s that tiny little sliver,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to try to take care of even that very small group of people that just through circumstances maybe don\u2019t get the full benefit of what we\u2019re doing. But the middle class gets a tremendous benefit, and business, which is jobs, gets a tremendous benefit.\u201d According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, slightly more than 24 percent of taxpayers would see a tax increase by 2027 under the version of the bill passed by the House. Under the Senate-passed bill, 48 percent of taxpayers would pay more by then, largely because of tax breaks that are set to expire in five years. Republicans insist those tax breaks would actually be extended by a future Congress. 18950988 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hugh hewitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "damian paletta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick toomey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toomey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orrin hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erica werner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gop", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tax policy center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate finance committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finance committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-pa.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-ky.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:39.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b6a6aa33715df70f61442610a1dce80373a30c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJ5iB6lAljbTm89Z.iPVnTg2atwIvffo3susbwlro5QS1PkxMm4VuqIXNuuwQhu9rJPmISYzLszuucqJY_Zwi0v7ySke_3sHM-", "site_full": "hiltonhead.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://hiltonhead.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist hilton head | personals search", "title": "Large woman/BIG butt", "title_full": "Large woman/BIG butt", "published": "2017-12-07T09:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_c9QY89A8pzP_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b6a6aa33715df70f61442610a1dce80373a30c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJ5iB6lAljbTm89Z.iPVnTg2atwIvffo3susbwlro5QS1PkxMm4VuqIXNuuwQhu9rJPmISYzLszuucqJY_Zwi0v7ySke_3sHM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "Large woman/BIG butt", "text": "favorite this post Large woman/BIG butt hide this posting unhide < image 1 of 1 >   no kids, never married I like to play sports, listen to music, read etc. . .

As far as the kind of women I like I like sweet women who have an innocent side but also a freaky one when need be, someone clean of course, faithful, loyal and not a liar. I'm not into married women or women who are still living with their ex or who sleep around a lot. Also if you currently have any friends with benifits I'm not interested.

This move marked the start of a series of events that have boosted his creativity and brought about changes in the focus of his writing. Around the time of the move, Martin learned he had won the Louis Award, a competition organized each year by Concrete Wolf publishing in Tillamook for poets aged 50 or older who have not yet published a full-length poetry collection. Martin\u2019s prize was the publication in July of a collection of his poetry as a full-length book. What: Second Sunday, featuring poet John Martin When: 2 p.m. Sunday Where: Downtown Bend Library \u2014 Brooks Room, 601 NW Wall St. Cost: free View More Martin will read and discuss selections from that book, \u201cHold This,\u201d at the Downtown Bend Library on Sunday. He will also read some more recent poems written in over the past year. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of an autobiography in poetry or verse,\u201d Martin said of \u201cHold This.\u201d \u201cI think of it as a story that takes in all the emotionally important aspects of my life, although it\u2019s not necessarily chronological.\u201d Martin\u2019s poetry and essays had previously been published in various journals and anthologies, and his chapbook, \u201cThe Nick of Time,\u201d was published in 2006. Much of his verse in \u201cHold This\u201d uses the imagery of nature and the elements while examining death and its impacts. He also admits to a \u201cpreoccupation\u201d with birds, which are featured in many of the poems and also on the cover of the book. The publication of \u201cHold This\u201d brought Martin full circle in one chapter of his artistic life. He was notified the collection would be published just as he was about to begin working at PLAYA. That also happens to be where he wrote and arranged the first iterations of many of the book\u2019s poems, during a monthlong residency at the facility in 2012. \u201cHold This\u201d also includes some older poems dating back to 2005, along with more recent work. Prior to 2017, Martin\u2019s work was more inwardly focused on his emotional landscape than poetry of place. However, the physical beauty of his surroundings at Summer Lake has triggered some changes in his writing. \u201cPLAYA has to some degree pulled me more into the landscape, and maybe I\u2019ve moved a little more from my emotional geography to the external landscape,\u201d Martin said. The poet, who describes himself as an introvert, also suspects that the requirements of his new job are also encouraging him to look outward more often in his poetry. As the residency manager at PLAYA, Martin coordinates all the application processes and logistics for the resident artists at the facility, as well as coordinating alumni awareness and communication after they leave. \u201cI spent 37 years being a landscaper working with rocks and plants and wheelbarrows full of soil, so it\u2019s been really challenging but really rewarding to spend my time talking to people rather than talking to rocks,\u201d Martin said with a laugh. After living in Bend for 16 years, the move to Summer Lake has been a significant lifestyle change for Martin. Among the things he misses are the monthly collaborations with his friends and fellow poets in the High Desert Poetry Cell and another writers\u2019 group he\u2019s a member of in Bend. He\u2019s only been able to get together with them once or twice since January, but is planning to reconnect with both groups in December. Martin is an entertaining and animated presenter, as anyone who has attended a High Desert Poetry Cell reading can attest. At his event on Sunday, he\u2019ll provide some background on each poem he reads and take questions from the audience. \u201cThe worst thing for anyone to go to is a sing-song poetry reading,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be great to bring a bit of this PLAYA landscape and mindset back to Bend and see what effect that has.\u201d 18923960 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john martin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "playa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "concrete wolf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooks room", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the nick of time", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central oregon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "summer lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "playa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "downtown bend library", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tillamook", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:39.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51f324b17abe70b76e6820485f63628b6e30d032", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950Kd2SI3sDyOm1", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender - 4chan", "title": "/ftmg/ - female to male general", "title_full": "/lgbt/ - /ftmg/ - female to male general - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-02T16:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 248, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.073, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7bc3af7dd823dccec32306961a9c4dbd1204f4b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950KRaW7KJgGW5SnUrZ9LdD3iE-", "ord_in_thread": 215, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T20:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9243926\nYour friend is an idiot.

Multnomah County Circuit Judge Judith Matarazzo in November denied Les Schwab\u2019s attorney\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. The judge wrote that she agreed with the company\u2019s interpretation of one element of the law, but that the case should proceed on other questions. The lawsuit, filed by former Les Schwab Tire Centers employee Michael Palmateer in June, seeks unpaid wages due him for meal breaks shorter than 30 minutes and overtime for weeks during which he worked through shortened breaks. Palmateer\u2019s lawyers also asked the court to certify Palmateer\u2019s suit as a class action, with the potential to include hundreds if not thousands of employees and former employees, and millions of dollars. Matarazzo, while denying the company\u2019s motion, agreed with its lawyers, who argued that employers need not guarantee a meal break, or, in other words, police their workers to ensure they take those breaks. Employers need only provide their workers with a meal-break opportunity, Les Schwab attorneys argued. \u201cWe\u2019re happy that the court agreed with our position,\u201d said Dale Thompson, spokesman for Les Schwab Tire Centers, based in Bend. \u201cOur hope is that the court\u2019s view would reinforce what the law says, and that there really is no case here.\u201d Thompson said seasonal tire changes create a heavy demand and a fast pace at Les Schwab Tire Centers. But the company wants its hourly workers to take their breaks, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work and they need to sustain the work they do. There are long hours during the spring and winter change overs,\u201d Thompson said. But Palmateer\u2019s lawyer Jennifer Palmquist, of Portland, on Wednesday said the judge left plenty of room to maneuver, basically saying the question of whether Les Schwab provided a \u201clegally compliant\u201d break period is still on the table. \u201cRather,\u201d Matarazzo wrote in her order, \u201cthe court recognizes that there are a multitude of facts to determine if an employer interfered with, coerced or otherwise encouraged an employee to take a break period of less than the length required by law, or failed to notify an employee\u201d of his or her right to a 30-minute meal break. Oregon law requires a half-hour meal break after six hours of work, with some exceptions. If the employee is \u201cnot relieved of all duties for 30 continuous minutes during the meal period, the employer must pay the employee for the entire 30-minute period,\u201d the law states. In her order, Matarazzo cites the law on meal breaks, including the exceptions that permit an employer to sidestep the employees\u2019 30-minute break. \u201cIt\u2019s right out of the statute. Did they do any of these things? No,\u201d Palmquist said Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not winning.\u201d \u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7815, ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "palmquist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "les schwab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dale thompson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matarazzo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer palmquist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael palmateer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thompson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palmateer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judith matarazzo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "les schwab tire centers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "les schwab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "multnomah county circuit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:40.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6dfab951f252409c855500cba0ad74f5bac7844d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsK3zEc1jpKyM6D43kbCXlSOdpYK6pFUQTPIGE2HpDz9uDSnmIRhGj2Y4fLaz7k4MiMxss5TlAGTYCPidaHg4_5eueFBWJTOGQD7OWWn2yty9W7zKvulemr", "site_full": "medicinebyalexandros.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://medicinebyalexandros.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Medicine by Alexandros G.Sfakianakis", "title": "Closing In on Treatment for Hemophilia B", "title_full": "Closing In on Treatment for Hemophilia B", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6dfab951f252409c855500cba0ad74f5bac7844d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsK3zEc1jpKyM6D43kbCXlSOdpYK6pFUQTPIGE2HpDz9uDSnmIRhGj2Y4fLaz7k4MiMxss5TlAGTYCPidaHg4_5eueFBWJTOGQD7OWWn2yty9W7zKvulemr", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexandros G.

Submit a letter to the editor. Wildlife killers need swift punishment Nov. 24 marks a sad day for Deschutes County residents. Chuck, a trumpeter swan who resided on the river at Sunriver Nature Center, was shot and had to be euthanized. A year ago at Summer Lake National Wildlife Refuge, a trumpeter swan cygnet was shot and killed and her sidekick, a female trumpeter swan, was shot in the wing. This wounded swan, Hope, was rescued and in rehab when she died following one of her many surgeries. Do you have a point you\u2019d like to make or an issue you feel strongly about? Submit a letter to the editor. View More The killer for the Summer Lake swan has been identified. He has yet to be sentenced, as the Lake County trial has been delayed multiple times. The killer is free, has paid no expenses and still has a hunting license. The message this sends is that our wildlife is not important. This message needs to be reversed now. Upon finding and identifying a wildlife killer, sentencing would be as immediate as our judicial system allows and punishment severe. Slaughtering wildlife will be taken seriously when the fines are significant. Fines would include all rehabilitation expenses, medical costs, transportation, original cost of Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife\u2019s purchase of trumpeter swans for repopulation purposes, and legal and replacement fees. Until the fines are significant, the slaughter will continue. In addition, lifetime hunting and fishing licenses would be revoked. Finally, hundreds of volunteer hours working with wildlife would be required as the obviously needed educational component. Ask your legislators to change the process and punishment to stop killing wildlife. Mary Ann Kruse Bend Troubles in the State Department Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright\u2019s article published in The Bulletin on Dec. 1 raised significant and valid concerns about the crisis facing the State Department under the current administration. My wife and I have a son in the U.S. Foreign Service. Born and raised in Bend, for more than a decade he has had duties in Brazil, Uruguay, Albania, Senegal, Spain and now Pakistan. He has served under Republican and Democratic administrations. Never has he faced such challenges as those under the current administration. He confirms to us the lack of leadership, failure of clear direction in foreign policy and massive reductions of key personnel in the State Department, even at a time our nation is facing major crises around the world. Thirty-two U.S. embassies around the world still do not have ambassadors, including key countries of South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, South Africa, Australia and Germany. Seven countries of the European Union do not have U.S. ambassadors. Only in November have 17 other countries finally had U.S. ambassadors approved for duty, including Denmark, France, The Netherlands and Spain. What does this say to our key allies around the world at a time they are needed in the fight against terrorism, possible nuclear holocaust, natural disasters and untold other world problems? Actions speak louder than words \u2014 in this case, inaction. Countries see that America no longer cares for diplomacy and cooperation to solve the most pressing issues facing the world. A sad time for America! Dr. Ronald E. Carver Bend Be better at saying thank you I just realized I am getting very sloppy about acknowledging polite, considerate actions that demonstrate an attitude of \u201cit\u2019s OK, you can go first.\u201d I need to shape up. Have I sadly become numb to expressing public appreciation for the customary acts of kindness and good manners because of the growing absence of civility and the ever-expanding notion that life is all about me? So, in this holiday season, I want to say I am sorry if I didn\u2019t fully acknowledge my appreciation to all of the drivers who actually stopped for me in a crosswalk, who let me pull out of a parking spot on a busy Bend street, or who pulled in behind me, where there was lots of room, rather than speeding in front of me and then edging in so they could make a fast turn off the parkway. Or, to others of you who let me leave a business or an elevator \u2014 I know there are not that many in Bend \u2014 before you crowded in through a congested doorway. Thank you. So as we near the end of this tumultuous year and think about 2018, I promise to be better at saying thank you, and as importantly, doing things that also encourage you to say thank you.
