It's very hard for me to bet against Nick Saban when he has this long to game plan for an opponent, and I believe Bama will want to make a statement and show that they truly deserve to be in the playoff. Clemson's defense will play well, but I think the offense will turn the ball over 2+ times and the defense will crack.

The law professor pointed out that Trump`s plan to relocate the US Embassy to Jerusalem could hinder the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. He remarked that as one of the precautionary measures, the US government should ensure the safety of its citizens and legal entities in various parts of the world, particularly in the Middle East and Muslim-majority countries. \"The local community may show disagreement in their own ways. The US will be the target of anger,\" he stated. Hence, the governments of various countries, including Indonesia, should step up vigil. \"People of various countries, including Indonesia, should be able to refrain from taking anarchist actions,\" he emphasized. Instead, US citizens must be approached and encouraged to take action, so that Trump`s policy is not implemented. The people of US could hold a massive demonstration and also approach the court to stop the implementation of Trump`s plan, he stated. \"If communication between world leaders and Trump fails, the only way out is to stop Trump`s plan through the people of the US. The people of US can make efforts to change Trump`s policies,\" he pointed out. Several top US officials had earlier hinted that Trump may, on Wednesday, recognize Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Israel but will delay the transfer of embassies from Tel Aviv for six months. According to US officials, Trump is expected to sign a decree stipulating that the US still maintains an embassy in Tel Aviv for another six months but will seek to accelerate the move. The Trump administration will need time to deal with logistics issues, such as the absence of an embassy building and secure housing for staff members in Jerusalem, according to a US official.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nManchester United supporters have voted for Ander Herrera to replace Paul Pogba against Manchester City on Sunday. \nIn a poll posted on the @ManUtdMEN Twitter page, 63 per cent voted for Herrera to play over Marouane Fellaini, who could return to the squad at the weekend following an injury lay-off. \nOn an M.E.N. writer's Twitter handle, the same poll was posted and Herrera garnered 62 per cent of the votes in a near identical result. in a post on the Manchester Evening News' United Facebook page, Herrera received twice as many votes as Fellaini. \nHerrera has made five Premier League starts this term and Fellaini has lined up just three times, mainly due to two separate injuries that have kept him sidelined for nine matches. \nUnited manager Jose Mourinho substituted Herrera in the 66th minute of the win over CSKA Moscow on Tuesday night in what was a heavy hint that the Basque would start the derby. Read More Jose Mourinho might have confirmed his team vs Man City \nMourinho confirmed holding midfielder Nemanja Matic - who has started every Premier League fixture - would return from injury to start and added Fellaini had a 'chance' of returning to the matchday 18. \n\"The truth is Eric Bailly no chance for the weekend,\" Mourinho said. \"Phil Jones a chance, Fellaini a chance, Zlatan a big chance and Matic is injured but will play for sure. I'm telling the truth, he's injured but will play for sure. Carrick no chance.\" \nPogba is unavailable for the next three games due to suspension, having been sent off in United's win over Arsenal last week. Read More United fans are starting to get the Jose Mourinho they wanted \n\"Unfortunately I won't play but I will be there to help the team mentally,\" Pogba said. \"I need to be there to boost the team and hopefully it will help. \n\"Manchester City against Manchester United has always been a big, big derby. One city, two clubs. It's going to be a big atmosphere in the stadium and a big game with a big team and big players so that's the game you want to play.

Most are working with blockchain technology. Competition for talent has pushed average salaries to around $180,000, CEO of Eidoo says. \n\nLONDON \u2014 Blockchain developers are at a premium in Switzerland, commanding salaries up to $180,000, as the country establishes itself as a centre for companies carrying out initial coin offerings (ICOs). \nThomas Bertani, the CEO of Switzerland-based Eidoo, told Business Insider that developers with expertise in blockchain technology, which underpins ICOs, can command salaries of around $10,000 to $15,000 a month in Switzerland, equivalent to $120,000 to $180,000 a year. \n\"The reasons are: 1) highly skilled blockchain-experienced devs are very hard to find; and 2) Switzerland is well known to be one of the most expensive countries on earth,\" Bertani said. \nOliver Bussmann, the president of the Crypto Valley Association in Zug, Switzerland, told Business Insider over email that the salary estimates sounded about right. \nSwitzerland has seen a surge in blockchain companies setting up shop there thanks to the permissive approach of its regulator to initial coin offerings (ICOs). \nICOs are where startups issue digital tokens in exchange for real money to help fund their business. The tokens can be redeemed for a good or service linked to the startup at a future date and can be freely traded, offering greater liquidity to investors in private, early-stage businesses. Companies can self-issue these tokens and most use the blockchain underpinning digital currency ethereum to register who has bought tokens. \nOver $3 billion has poured into this new form of fundraising, which is inspired by bitcoin. But regulators around the world are concerned that it is unproven, unregulated, and high-risk. China has banned ICOs and watchdogs in both the US and UK have warned investors to be wary of investing. \nSwitzerland, meanwhile, has sought to become a hub for this new type of investment, which some see as the future of fundraising. \n\"You can show the regulator your white paper and they either approve it or not,\" Bertani said, referring to the documents usually used to outline ICO plans to potential investors. \nAs a result, many companies pursuing ICOs have chosen to set up some or all of their operations in Switzerland. The Crypto Valley Association lists over 100 members, including both organisations and individuals. \nMost companies who have pursued ICOs this year tend to be linked to either cryptocurrency or the blockchain technology that underpins it and this has pushed up the salary of developers in the country.

President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) opined that Indonesia`s economy has currently recorded a growth of over five percent per quarter in 2017, better than that recorded three years back when he started his term in office. \"Two months ago, marked exactly three years of my leadership, and the current condition of the Indonesian economy is significantly better than that after the first year of my administration in 2015,\" he stated during his keynote speech at The Year Ahead Asia-Bloomberg in Mega Kuningan, South Jakarta, on Wednesday. He noted that the government`s efforts to implement structural reforms to boost economic performance have begun showing results. He remarked that the improved condition of Indonesia`s economy has allowed for greater fiscal space to initiate and finalize plans for all large infrastructure projects across the country. \"These positive developments are due to only one thing, which is reform,\" he pointed out. The president expects that the Indonesian economy will grow 5.4 percent in 2018. The figure is still below the target of seven percent set by Jokowi at the start of his administrative term. Hence, the Indonesian government has continued to work hard on reforms, including cutting fuel subsidies, to create greater fiscal space in order to finance the construction of roads, railways, and ports. Jokowi remarked that his government has worked on the right track to finalize most of the infrastructure projects under construction during the five-year term of the government. On the occasion, he highlighted two lessons learnt during his three-year administration: a better condition after reform efforts and an optimistic outlook that he believed would prevail. He pointed out that the World Bank has given a better rating for the index of Ease of Doing Business in Indonesia, which rose from the 106th ranking in 2016 to reach the 72nd position in 2017. A global survey also placed Indonesia in the first position for the public trust index in the government. In terms of the tourism sector, Jokowi said foreign tourist arrivals have continued to increase, with investment in the tourism sector rising by 35 percent. \"We will not benefit from the boom in the tourism sector if we do not develop the necessary infrastructure,\" he remarked. Hence, he claimed to continue working hard to complete various infrastructure projects, including the operation of Silangit Airport, which provides direct flight connectivity to Lake Toba by Garuda Indonesia airlines. \"Other tourism destinations, including Belitung, Labuan Bajo, and Komodo, will have international flight connectivity as soon as possible,\" he added.

December 7, 2017, 3:10   \nT he development of an urban region is invariably connected with the boom of real estate and infrastructure projects. \nHowever, this comes at the cost of our trees, which face the axe on an exponential basis to give way for various development projects. \nOne expansive project results in thousands of trees being felled. But what we do not realise is the fact that a fully matured tree once gone is gone forever and any sapling planted in its place would take a very long time even to spread its branches. While it takes a lot more than desktop activism and campaigning to stop the concerned authorities from axing the trees, what can be done instead is to transplant them. Development at the cost of our trees. Source: Pexels . \nIn fact, the concept is being practised across the world and has been picked up by various civic bodies in the country as well. \nAlthough municipal authorities have been implementing the transplantation through mechanised support and massive machinery, the process can actually be undertaken by a group of individuals as well. \nHowever, one needs to keep in mind that the process requires complete commitment on the planters\u2019 behalf, for any kind of lapse could result in failure and loss of a tree. Here are nine steps that will help you understand what exactly goes behind the process of a tree transplantation: Trees ready to be transplanted. Source: Facebook . \n1. Identify the location where you intend to move the tree. The location should ideally be selected, keeping in mind the amount of space and sunlight meeting the tree\u2019s requirements. Also, your knowledge about the species plays a significant role for the tree to adapt in the new site. \n2. You can begin by moistening the soil around the tree thoroughly about three to four days before the move with the help of a hose or watering. Following which, the tree\u2019s roots have to be identified. It is important to keep in mind that you retain as much of the root system in place as possible. \n3. The digging has to be carried out carefully. You can use a sharp spade to dig a trench around the tree\u2019s base. The trench has to be approximately 1.5 to 2 feet deep. While digging the tree out, you need to leave the roots and the surrounding clump of soil intact, which together is known as \u2018root ball\u2019. Tree transplantation carried out by workers at Siddhivinayak site. Source: Facebook . \n4. Ideally, the width of the trench should be double the width of the root ball. Next, pull the tree out of the hole and shape the bottom of the root ball using the spade like a ball. If the need arises, you can cut some of the roots beneath. \n5. By tipping the tree and root ball to one side, tightly wrap the root ball with a piece of burlap that can cover the clump entirely. The burlap piece has to be secured to the tree trunk with thick cord. Please take special care to do all of this gently and try not to displace any of the dirt while tipping the root ball onto the burlap. \n6. The tree is now ready to be carried to the transplant spot and must be particularly lifted and carried by the root ball. Pay heed that the new trench is at least two to three times the size of the root ball, while the depth remains approximately an inch lesser than the root ball\u2019s length such that the burlap is visible even after placement of the tree in the trench. Manual tree transplantation. Source: Facebook . \n7. Lower the tree gently into the hole in the same position that it originally grew in and place the trunk and branches in the upright direction. You can now begin filling the hole with the unearthed soil with the help of the spade and use your hands while packing the dirt around the root ball. This will help support and stabilise the tree at the new location. \n8. Cut the cord securing the burlap with the help of scissors once two-thirds of the hole is refilled with mud. At this point, shear away any visible remains of the burlap in the hole. Continue filling the remainder of the hole with the unearthed soil and finish by creating a slight mound around the trunk base. Make sure that you water the newly planted tree thoroughly. \n9. Next couple of weeks are crucial, and you will have to keep monitoring the tree closely at least for a month or so. Don\u2019t forget to water the tree every 10 to 14 days, in case it has not rained in the meantime.

He told me he was worried about her. Michael told me that Hunger Games was about to come out and he believed that it was going to be a hugely successful film and he said that Jennifer had absolutely no idea how her life was going to change.\u201d \n\u201cAs I watched her interact with the other guests, I saw a highly confident woman and I really didn\u2019t think she needed any advice from anyone,\u201d Lansing continued. \u201cBut then, Jennifer did something quite remarkable. She turned to me and she said, \u2018I know Michael is worried about me, and I know he wanted you to talk to me but please don\u2019t worry about me.\u2019\u201d \nLansig then said that Lawrence then told her, \u201cI have a secret. I always knew I was going to be famous, so I am totally prepared for it,\u201d as Lawrence looked on embarrassed from the audience. \n\u201cIn that simple, direct honesty I actually knew everything I needed to know about Jennifer,\u201d Lansing added. \u201cI knew she was a very, very special person and I knew she was going to be more than fine.\u201d \nRecent months have seen Jennifer Lawrence become a prominent figure in the highlighting of film industry sexism, revealing that she was forced into a \u201cnude line-up\u201d of women during her early career, and felt her job was threatened after she stood up to an abusive director. \nSpeaking as part of The Hollywood Reporter \u2018s Actress Roundtable, Lawrence recounted a time where a director made inappropriate remarks towards her. \n\u201cI finally made the decision to stand up for myself,\u201d she says, \u201cand then I went to go to the bathroom at work and one of the producers stopped me and was like, \u2018You know, we can hear you on the microphone, you\u2019ve been really unruly. Which was not true, but basically my job was threatened because the director said something fucked up to me and I said, \u2018That\u2019s sick, you can\u2019t talk to me like that,\u2019 and then I was punished, and I got afraid that I wasn\u2019t going to be hired again.\u201d NME Newsletter \nSign up for the newsletter Your email address: \nBy submitting your information, you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy .

He made the remarks at the 6th meeting of ASEAN Coordinating Council Working Group (ACCWG) to discuss Timor Leste`s bid for ASEAN membership in Jakarta on Tuesday (Dec 5). \"To obtain information based on the real condition, we need to visit Timor Leste to monitor the developments in the field and its need for capacity building,\" he stated. The meeting also discussed a list of ASEAN`s activities, which can be followed by Timor Leste. Based on the ASEAN agreement, the move is expected to enable Timor Leste to take part in the activities, which can increase capacity building and encourage Timor Leste?s active participation in the activities. Meanwhile, ASEAN Deputy Secretary General for Political and Security Pillars Hirubalan V.P remarked that ASEAN should consider Timor Leste`s bid for ASEAN membership, as the country is geographically located in Southeast Asia. However, ASEAN still has to follow up on the final result of an independent study related to the implication of Timor Leste`s membership, particularly when it comes to the three pillars of the ASEAN community. The three pillars are political and security pillar, economic pillar, and social cultural pillar. The results of the study should be conveyed to the Timor Leste government during a visit to the country.
