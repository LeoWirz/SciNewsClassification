This will burden the stressed enterprise with huge transactional tax liability and make the resolution process unviable, as the new resolution applicant and the stressed business have to shell out this additional sum which in some case may reach upto 35% of the waived liability,\" the Chamber Secretary General Mr D S Rawat said in his letter to the Finance Minister. The chamber said the NCLT should be authorized to grant relief on such waiver/write-back of outstanding liabilities under normal as well as under MAT . It said there are certain provisions of the Income Tax Act which cast huge tax liabilities in the process of resolution, which if required to be discharged in absence of statutory protection would defeat the entire purpose of resolution as there will hardly any money left for revival of the asset. Besides, the resolution plan would involve transfer, assignment, issue of shares and securities for infusion of capital and transfer of ownership of stressed business and other immovable assets which may not be at the book value or fair market value as defined in law. It may thus result into huge transactional tax liability in hands of stressed business or the new resolution applicant on a notional income, seriously jeopardizing the viability of plan.

U.S. health of... \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Now, single function items are becoming interfaces connected to the Internet and offering us capabilities above and beyond their original intended purpose. The phone goes way beyond making calls, the watch goes way beyond telling time, the car goes way beyond getting us from place to place, etc. \nOur businesses and governments are becoming more efficient by investing in the IoT revolution. Industries like oil, manufacturing, agriculture, medicine, insurance, retail, and utilities are all actively innovating with IoT installs. Governments are improving the quality of cities and defense programs with smart, Internet-connected solutions. \nHowever, the IoT revolution doesn\u2019t come without hurdles. The current infrastructure is struggling to keep up with the Internet traffic. There are also security concerns around connecting everything to the Internet. \nAs a result of everything becoming connected, we are seeing shifts in investments and returns. There is already a great demand for network expansion, cyber security, and insurance. And generally, the prices of hardware will fall as IoT becomes less of a novelty. \nAll of this opens up a huge opportunity for everyone to make and save a lot of money. We will invest $6 trillion in IoT between 2015 and 2020, which will yield $12.6 trillion ROI over the next decade. Enterprise will make up the majority of the investment dollars, followed by government and consumer. \nBI Intelligence has created a slide deck exploring the most disruptive trends in IoT. To get a more detailed view of the progression, landscape and projections of the Internet of Everything, access the complete slide deck by clicking here. \nSome of the topics covered include: The market drivers for the IoT. Forecasts for the IoT market. A breakdown of how many industries are utilizing IoT devices. A look at how governments are using the IoT to revolutionize their cities and defense.

My wife Anne is having a hysterectomy late January and thereafter I will be having a new knee on my left leg. Id like to drive (was in Milan 1997) in the Panda.\nAs yet not sure where to head to but love Italian food and the ambiance. I'll be 64 and Anne 55. Any advice, destinations and accommodation recommendations would be great. As I spend five months of the year in Umbria I'd suggest spending some time there, of course. It's not as advanced in tourist terms as Tuscany, (and cheaper) but it's easy to get to Siena, for instance, from the northern part of Umbria. I really don't like cities so I'd plump for a well-recommended agriturismo. Wine is great - sagrantino, rosso di Montefalco, ciliegiolo, Orvieto - Campo del Guardiano from Palazzone vineyard is exquisite - reds or whites from Zanchi near Amelia, olive oil is the best to be found (being inland and relatively high, the olives in Umbria withstand hard winters and need less spraying against olive fly than the norm). You have to be unlucky to eat badly in Umbria but you need to find places that are a little more adventurous/interesting, which have pushed traditional dishes on a bit. Living there we don't really know much about hotels and other places to stay (however, Il Cantico della Natura near Lake Trasimeno is lovely, as is Borgo della Marmotta just outside Spoleto) but I could give you hints on places to eat in the Spoleto area.\nWe've made the trip twice a year, spring and autumn, for years, in one Fiat or another often a Panda. We spend three nights in hotels on the journey (route is Devon, Channel Tunnel, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, Italy), We're both 70 (till next week) and find August too hot, it's generally not too bad after ferragosto (the 14th) but September and October are lovely, as is May. gar074 , murphyv310 liked this post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:04.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a265b99fba8d8a8caa0acafb4c440e26bc4a6042", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSX66fZOWxt.Y538NTwyHgQ_J7eCIRfTrLy_LyBramLqxhE_Xg3PdBz.n6Qz_NQq3fbqKQ2H2WzdohCdZze3ky9w--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Assassin's Creed", "title": "Unity doesn\u2019t suck", "title_full": "Unity doesn\u2019t suck : assassinscreed", "published": "2017-12-07T02:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 46, "participants_count": 27, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b0e449e1ca3548ddacea3fe69791875099f82e83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSX66fZOWxt.Y538NTwyHgQ_J7eCIRfTrLy_LyBramLqxhE_Xg3PdBz.n6Qz_NQq3fbqKQ2H2Wzdockh6wSDxYxMJE7yt78qxhq3dMxUcGxOk-", "ord_in_thread": 26, "author": "Journey95", "published": "2017-12-07T08:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "This thread has already been posted here a dozen times.

The company uses artificial intelligence and machine learning powered by complex algorithms to connect passengers with nearby drivers. \nIn order to keep these systems running and scalable for the future, Uber needs new IT staffers. To fill its empty tech seats, the ride-sharing company is turning to third-party and custom-built systems to find and vet the right data scientists, designers, project managers and engineers. \nTo find new recruits, Uber uses HackerRank, a technology job recruitment and job listing site that aims to match coders and engineers with high-tech firms. HackerRank\u2019s two-way video application CodePair, allows Uber to watch a job candidate write code and solve problems in real time. Uber also uses Google Docs and Skype for sharing files and conducting interview sessions, respectively. [Image credit: Bloomberg] \nOnce it identifies the recruits it wants to hire, Uber deploys two of its own tools, the Interview Question Database and the Candidate Relationship Tool, to further weed out candidates. \nThe Interview Question Database is an interactive technology questionnaire, which consists of algorithmic computing problems that are submitted and ranked in importance by current Uber engineers and software coders. Uber candidates are asked to fill out the online form. Uber technologists regularly update the questions and managers rate them by difficulty, the level of the applicant\u2019s understanding, experience, and the requirements of the position the firm is attempting to fill. \n\u201cThe engineers are able to vote certain questions up or down on the effectiveness and the usefulness of those questions,\u201d says Craig Campbell, who recently joined Uber as director of technology recruiting with a mandate to fill Uber\u2019s New York and Seattle technology and development offices. He adds that some questions are ranked higher than others in order to make sure that we're constantly fine-tuning the quality of those challenges. He declined to specify how many new technologist Uber is looking to hire. \nA candidate takes Interview Question Database test on a laptop in the Uber offices in order to emulate a typical development environment. Uber does not place a time limit on the tests. Instead, the hiring team is looking for how the candidate processes and thinks through the often algorithmic-based problems. \n\u201cIt's really more about what\u2019s the algorithm in your computational thinking to get to a solution,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cAnd even if you didn\u2019t get to a solution, there are all kinds of value in how you processed and systematically thought through the challenge.\u201d \nUber also interviews and tests for emotional intelligence during the hiring process using its Candidate Relationship Tool. The system gives candidate real-world project scenarios to determine how they approach a problem, how they communicate and how they involve different members of a team. \n\u201cThe collaboration piece is something we index when we are assessing and evaluating candidates: How they collaborated with small teams, one-to-few, one-to-many and how they brought people on board and got buy-in for an idea,\u201d Campbell says. He adds that Uber looks for how candidates demonstrate flexibility when they come across a new or better project approach. \n\u201cWe really try to think about those dynamics,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cNot just in a vacuum but how have they done this with limited resources? How long have they had to undo things or unlearn things in order to get to a better place?\u201d Employer coalitions are using analytics to drive convergence of employers, payers and providers Partner Insights", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hackerrank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg campbell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skype", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google docs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:05.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "319187ba69d0cc91f754dfc519b8efae05f32940", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Mf_vUwbHGhTUnov4jGrgwvo_1tt2xFs0rM8RBbFTiV3._ygRYu98ek9PNSUA5iRw_hZtzWThj73eUYwP0x16_4GSeh5VuJbUtvcRR8DL3kmhf2tBpr2TIM5j.ZLsxqEnzV6ko387IWTEfXadJw8mqdo1rulRQk3L1PAAlJ7mZA--", "site_full": "www.news-press.com", "site": "news-press.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.news-press.com/ftmyers/home", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "media", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "GANNETT Syndication Service", "title": "Highlights: 2017 Rotary South All-Star Classic", "title_full": "Highlights: 2017 Rotary South All-Star Classic", "published": "2017-12-07T07:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2e56892f6a349ad47192b530425d443fb365e5e9/r=x1803&c=3200x1800/https/media.gannett-cdn.com/37906159001/37906159001_5670666420001_5670653478001-vs.jpg?pubId=37906159001", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 50472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "319187ba69d0cc91f754dfc519b8efae05f32940", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Mf_vUwbHGhTUnov4jGrgwvo_1tt2xFs0rM8RBbFTiV3._ygRYu98ek9PNSUA5iRw_hZtzWThj73eUYwP0x16_4GSeh5VuJbUtvcRR8DL3kmhf2tBpr2TIM5j.ZLsxqEnzV6ko387IWTEfXadJw8mqdo1rulRQk3L1PAAlJ7mZA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wochit", "published": "2017-12-07T07:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Highlights: 2017 Rotary South All-Star Classic", "text": "Let friends in your social network know what you are reading about Facebook Highlights: 2017 Rotary South All-Star Classic Lehigh's Chris Curry was named the MVP as the South all-star team beat the North all-star team 36-13 at the Rotary South All-Star Class on Wednesday at Edison Stadium.

In the past, maybe you made a resolute decision to make super-healthy green smoothies every morning. You kept it up for a few weeks, but eventually it became a hassle to keep enough fresh greens on hand. (It takes a lot!) Perhaps you used to buy green drinks at the local raw juice bar but that became too expensive. Or maybe you just haven\u2019t found a method to make fresh kale taste good. \nWe have a solution to your green predicament. Core , the companion to Soul, is for proactive health-conscious individuals who want to sustain their bodies efficiently and effectively with the healthiest green supplement . \nThe best part for busy people? Core comes in a convenient gel pack. Drink it in the morning if you remember. Keep some in your car or desk in case you leave in a rush and forget. Keep some in your gym bag. It doesn\u2019t need to be refrigerated and it won\u2019t go bad like the forgotten greens in the produce drawer in your refrigerator. \nWith Core, you get more than just the ideal greens, you get the most powerful seed blend available anywhere, all in a 1-ounce packet. Core contains chlorophyllin, aloe vera, spirulina, wheat grass, cranberry seed, milk thistle seed, kale, black cumin seed, chlorella and dandelion. (I bet you didn\u2019t put all those nutritional wonders in your smoothie.) Core has gained a clinical reputation for improving health functions and works with Soul to furnish what your body needs. \nReady to keep that green resolution you made last year? Call me today at 801.437.5994 to try Core.

By December 08 2017, 12:07pm EST More in print reprint \nThe term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d is bandied about casually in conversations and sales pitches about HCM systems. But is AI really ready for show time? And what does it actually mean? For some answers about how AI can help with hiring, performance reviews and gauging employee morale, Employee Benefit News spoke with Holger Mueller, vice president and principal analyst with Constellation Research. Edited excerpts of that conversation follow. \nEmployee Benefit News: Is true artificial intelligence used in any of the HR systems on the market today? Holder Muller \nHolger Mueller: The limitation with machine learning is that there must be enough electronic data for it. And it must have an understanding of the data: what is good, what is bad. Sometimes we don\u2019t have that. Take weather data, for example. We know it\u2019s 70 degrees, but is that nice or not nice? It depends on the person. So we need to understand the data, we must know what is good or what is bad, and we need a lot of computing power to build models to predict and make the terms. \nEBN : How does that come into play in the systems available today? \nMueller: Take, for example, a CEO search. If the data I have is based on the last search five years ago, it will probably not help me to find the next CEO. \nEBN : So it would be different if the question pertained to a topic for which there is more recent and abundant data available. What types of questions might those be? \nMueller: It could be: Who do I put on a particular shift? Who works better with whom? Who am I going to promote? What kind of salary increase should I give? Who am I going to transfer? Who\u2019s the best person on the job internally, or who is the best hire externally? Those are high-frequency interactions where there is lots of data, and that can lead to more reliable answers. \nEBN : Is it clear when you have enough data to have some faith in the system\u2019s output? \nMueller : Ultimately, with all forms of machinery, when you test these things to make the next decision, we are very good at figuring out if it\u2019s a bad decision, if it\u2019s an OK decision, if it\u2019s pretty interesting, or, \u201cWow, this is an amazing decision.\u201d So I wouldn\u2019t say, \u201cOh, we don\u2019t have enough data because we only hired 50 people last year, so don\u2019t even try to apply that data to the 20 job candidates we have right now.\u201d You can apply it to them, and see what happens. \nEBN : And hope for the best? \nMueller: Sort of. Suppose a company tests its system for performance prediction, and the model they had was only 70% accurate. Would you delay its implementation until it reached a 90% accuracy level if today your average manager is only making the optimum hiring decision 60% of the time? There is often a quest for perfection when \u201cgood enough\u201d is really good enough. \nEBN : Why would I want a system that deploys chatbots? \nMueller: The problem is that clicking on things and finding things in two-dimensional structures is not a human way for us to communicate. We only do this because 500 years ago, Gutenberg invented the printing press, and there was paper, and then somebody invented display, and it\u2019s two-dimensional too, and that\u2019s how we try to extract things. If we want to do something between you and me right now, we talk, we communicate, we don\u2019t press buttons in a menu structured to find out where is the right conversation to have. And that\u2019s why chatbots and natural language processing are so powerful. \nEBN : What are some ways one can \u201cchat\u201d with a system? \nMueller: You can say things like, \u201cTrade my next shift\u201d or \u201cShow me the attrition statistics from last week,\u201d instead of figuring out where to click and find the answers. Software has been inhuman to humans, not communicating in the way that distinguishes us from the rest of the animals out there \u2014 with spoken language. \nEBN : How are advanced systems helping managers with performance reviews? \nMueller: They can crunch the self-performance reviews and you don\u2019t have to read them individually. If you\u2019re a warehouse manager and have 100 direct reports and you are forced to read those performance self-ratings, that\u2019s a huge task. So software can tell you that here\u2019s the sentiment of the group, here\u2019s where you agree, here are the people you have to spend more time with, or less time with, without you having to read all of the typed information. \nEBN : How reliable are these systems? \nMueller: There is always room for improvement, but I think on sentiment analysis, the industry has reached a level that is beyond our understanding. And where the same technology is very interesting is when it\u2019s applied to analyzing job posts. For example, suppose you post a job and you want to understand why no woman is applying to this job. It can tell you if it was written using male lingo and women reading it think only men can apply. And vice versa. It can also be used to assess whether text will only appeal to a particular age group. \nEBN : Talk about how face recognition technology is being used in HR. \nMueller: In video interviews, systems can try to find discrepancies between a candidate\u2019s words and body language, or assess how comfortable a candidate is when asked for certain job skills, experience, and so on. \nEBN: And what about using technology to assess the mood of existing employees? \nMueller: Sure. Employees punch in, punch out, the visual software recognizes you, so why not take your mood, right? I mean the mood setup \u2014 smiling, not smiling \u2014 is very easy, very low-hanging fruit. Some people might have concerns about Big Brother and Orwell, but, yes, it\u2019s technically feasible. \nEBN : Is anybody actually doing this? \nMueller: I\u2019m not aware of somebody doing that, but if they have the information, they could do it, so all your people are recognized by the iris scan, by the facial scan, by the facial parts and getting let into premises, so you have a record. You could go back to the picture and say, \u201cOh, they looked happy,\u201d or \u201cThey looked stressed.\u201d The data is there. \nEBN : Tell me about systems that identify employees who should be promoted or transferred to new positions. Is that giving too much ground to a machine? \nMueller: No, it\u2019s absolutely a valid idea. When you think about how people transfer jobs in a traditional work environment, it very often depends upon things like who does the person know, the relationships, and not necessarily an objective assessment of the appropriateness of the person\u2019s skills or experience. Companies struggle to put the best people in the right spot. So the more objectively they can put the right people in the right job at the right time, the better you function as an enterprise.

Quote If you don\u0092t live in Australia, then your only experience of Metro Trains Melbourne is probably the ghoulishly jolly Dumb Ways To Die animated clip that went viral in 2012. But, as the clip loosely implies, the group operates one of the southern hemisphere\u0092s largest metro rail networks.Or, if you were trying to travel Down Under this Thursday, it turned out that they didn\u0092t. A reported computer failure first led to massive delays on the whole system, and eventually to the entire central part of the city\u0092s network being brought to a total halt for several hours.With thousands of commuters stuck in trains, drivers and guards pleaded with passengers not to force the train doors and escape into the danger of the tunnels (possibly via jolly songs). A desperate Twitter user held a poll on whether he should answer a call of nature through the emergency door; naturally Australia backed him with an 84 per cent Yes vote.Train failures happen everywhere: signal failures, track failures, accidents, and incidents of all kinds are common annoyances for commuters. But the whole network collapsing due to a computer error seems a bit much: could they not just turn it off and start again ?Basically, no.The biggest problem here is that Melbourne has a single underground loop line that links all its suburban tracks together. It\u0092s a bit like London Underground\u0092s Circle/District/Metropolitan/Hammersmith lines, with the crucial difference that almost all Melbourne\u0092s suburban trains go at least partially round the loop \u0096 there\u0092s no other route through the city. Even the city\u0092s two terminus stations, Southern Cross and Finders Street, form part of the city loop, and many terminating services share signalling systems with loop trains.Like many rail systems, Melbourne\u0092s was randomly constructed by private companies out for a cheap buck, with no interest in interconnected metro or in buying up expensive city blocks to build through-lines. The city\u0092s flat, swampy land also put everyone off tunnelling.A lot of mergers and some nationalisation later, the system found itself feeding into two main terminals, both overcrowded. By 1969, transport planners decided that this wouldn\u0092t do, and planned the City Loop.Planners love joining up suburban lines with a tunnel through the city. You replace two busy, land-scarce, crowded terminals with through stations, serve major city destinations directly, and only have to turn trains around in the sticks. The RER in Paris, London\u0092s Thameslink and Crossrail, and Berlin\u0092s HBF all work on this principle.But Melbourne\u0092s planners were braver.Remember, every train into Melbourne already went into either Southern Cross (then called Spencer Street) or Flinders Street. Building the loop wasn\u0092t like building Crossrail: it was like building a mash-up of Crossrail, Thameslink and the Overground to carry every single train that previously used to go into a London terminus.The planners rose to the challenge: the number of tracks on the circle varies from two to six (originally planned as four to eight). But the net result was to create a complicated service with a lot of junctions and crossovers, which needs to carry lots of trains.They had a clever solution to the complexity, too: they built one of the world\u0092s first computerised railways. The City Loop opened in 1980 with fully automated signalling, using a dedicated system called Metrol, which allowed faster, more reliable switching, signaller and passenger information. When it opened, this was a state of the art system.The trouble is, almost 40 years and some privatisation later, franchise operator Metro Trains Melbourne and government infrastructure owner Public Transport Victoria are still using it.The brains of the system have been moved from the original ancient PDP-11 mainframes to a network of PC servers, and some modern train control systems have been added; but it\u0092s still based around 40-year-old software, and the interface between the new computers and the tracks and signals still relies on 40-year-old interface boards. Metro Trains has to acquire replacements on the second-hand market as other companies retire their old servers.Using old equipment isn\u0092t rare in transport. New York\u0092s still running on kit that was 40 years old when Metrol was installed, and the systems being removed in London are even older. Although the dreaded \u0091signal failure\u0092 is a common reason for scraping along at snail\u0092s pace, they don\u0092t halt the whole system.But well, have you tried watching an analogue versus a digital TV with a bad signal? Old-style train control systems are dumb, often fail, and are designed for the failures to be local and worked around. When newer-style train control systems fail, because the brains are centralised, so is the crash. More recent ones are designed to route around these problems, but Melbourne led the way and paid the price.Worse still, in other major cities, if a signal failure takes out one line, then you\u0092ve still got a bunch of other lines to use. The City Loop means you can\u0092t do that in Melbourne: if you lose signalling here, then every train line in the city is stuffed. Although the Metrol system only covers the City Loop and a few neighbouring inner suburban stations, you can\u0092t run trains in the suburbs if they\u0092re stuck on the wrong side of the city.So what can Melbourne do? Replacing Metrol is often discussed, but would be painfully expensive, especially in terms of the disruption caused \u0096 and more recently, modern information systems have been built on top of it, which you\u0092d have to fit in with the replacement.The government are also starting work on a new tunnelled line through the CBD that's completely independent from the loop, which will help take some of the pressure off services \u0096 but even when it\u0092s done, most city lines will still be subject to the same problems.If I were Public Transport Victoria or Metro Trains, as the old joke says, I wouldn\u0092t want to be starting from here.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "metrol", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "melbourne trains city metric", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "circle/district/metropolitan/hammersmith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metro trains melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city loop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern cross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metrol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "public transport victoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metro trains", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metro trains melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city loop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flinders street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crossrail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london underground", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:06.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bbb3b8256f5beab7ccfa92ab4ecda47cafd38fd2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYt213oXyWOmuPG_Kp1et7b_kzuBHAI4pm15PX0RWzkBt6Ks8Djsm.7Dtcihwj9KcIeGkL7VDjUDMdijELx_8b1r4CV.si1IqATSIzvBx1Y8e7G8pqCDVne4TWCWm7CZUf58ZNAkhKgLj", "site_full": "www.adverts.ie", "site": "adverts.ie", "site_section": "http://www.adverts.ie/for-sale/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Adverts.ie - Recent Ads All 827,243 listings", "title": "Brand new - still sealed DYSON V6 Animal Cordless Vacuum Cleaner - Purple", "title_full": "Brand new - still sealed DYSON V6 Animal Cordless Vacuum Cleaner - Purple", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://a1.amlimg.com/MzdjYjQ5YjQ5ZTdjNWQ3ZGExMDgzY2Y1OWM1N2QwNzJmZDwPVzsnx4HMhZBsu_rRaHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmFkc2ltZy5jb20vNmUwNGNhMmJhMDkxNjE5M2Y0MjQyNzU3ZTcwNzIxMDFiMDk1OTI0MDZjNDllZmVhZTVhYTUyZDkyODRiYzU2ZC5qcGd8fHx8fHwzOTN4Mjk0fGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuYWR2ZXJ0cy5pZS9zdGF0aWMvaS93YXRlcm1hcmsucG5nfHx8.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bbb3b8256f5beab7ccfa92ab4ecda47cafd38fd2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYt213oXyWOmuPG_Kp1et7b_kzuBHAI4pm15PX0RWzkBt6Ks8Djsm.7Dtcihwj9KcIeGkL7VDjUDMdijELx_8b1r4CV.si1IqATSIzvBx1Y8e7G8pqCDVne4TWCWm7CZUf58ZNAkhKgLj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Brand new - still sealed DYSON V6 Animal Cordless Vacuum Cleaner - Purple", "text": "Got something like this at home?

A judge signed off on their papers last month, according to People . As part of the deal, they\u2019ll reportedly share custody of their two sons, Indiana , 13, and Atticus , 9.\nPhoenix, the younger sister of Joaquin and the late River Phoenix , had asked for spousal support from Affleck during the summer. The 42-year-old Oscar winner originally wanted to deny that request, but the pair reached a private financial settlement shortly thereafter.\nPhoenix filed for divorce in late July, citing \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d as the reason for the legal break, according to documents obtained by TMZ . She listed their date of separation as November 2015, though the couple didn\u2019t go public with their split until March 2016.\nThe couple met in 1995 through Joaquin, who was working with Affleck on the movie \u201cTo Die For.\u201d\nEven though Affleck moved on and started dating \u201cSupergirl\u201d star Floriana Lima , he and his ex seem to be on good terms. When Affleck accepted a Golden Globe for his performance in \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d earlier this year, he expressed gratitude to his estranged wife.\nWe\u2019ll see in a few months, when awards season is yet again in full-swing, whether Affleck will have another chance to thank his ex. He\u2019s gotten some strong buzz about his work in \u201cA Ghost Story.\u201d\nBut he\u2019s been attracting bad press over past allegations of sexual harassment. And there have been multiple petitions demanding that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences bar Affleck from presenting the Best Actress Oscar, which is the usual custom for the previous year\u2019s Best Actor winner.\nAffleck has been accused of sexual harassment by cinematographer Magdalena Gorka and producer Amanda White , who both filed lawsuits against him after making the mockumentary \u201cI\u2019m Not Here.\u201d The cases were settled outside of court for undisclosed amounts in 2010.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "casey affleck", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "affleck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magdalena gorka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amanda white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atticus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joaquin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "floriana lima", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "golden globe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "academy of motion picture arts and sciences", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "phoenix olivia vanni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "summer phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "river phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:06.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "143a0cb4cc0953dc914a0ce8c8b12ecd2a4e17b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W0QBzosqyzhZzjZ59COOioqioVfM6C9_zO5dv71dhQDHM.FflLEnY9kdjurkg47IoxfNhoaSmHkiUkeXk2kuKJ0gmx2Ot9YxjA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What is the dumbest thing you\u2019ve done as a result of sheer absent-mindedness?", "title_full": "What is the dumbest thing you\u2019ve done as a result of sheer absent-mindedness?
