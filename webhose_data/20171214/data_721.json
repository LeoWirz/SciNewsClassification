He ran for 1,796 yards with 11 consecutive 100-yard rushing games as the Owls won their first league title. \nUAB's Bill Clark was tabbed Wednesday as the coach of the year after the Blazers returned from a two-year program hiatus to win eight games. UAB is going to a bowl game only the second time in school history. \nNorth Texas sophomore quarterback Mason Fine was named as the league's offensive player of the year after throwing for 3,749 yards and a league-best 28 TDs.

Ayala", "text": "\n15. Evolution vs. Creationism: Biblical Literalism \nQualitative Research Channel \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkcC8FkS6Nc \n\nOnly part of the section with Francisco J. Ayala: \n\n2:22 Chapter 2 of Genesis does not show God creating dry land or sun, moon and stars after Adam was created. \n\nIt also does not show any days passing between Adam's and Eve's creation, it is compatible with both being created on day 6, as per the resum\u00e9 in chapter 1. \n\nThe \"difficulty\" for literalism is [19] And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name. [20] And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself. \n\nHere the solution proposed by translater is that we are talking about animals formed before Adam. Kent Hovind has another solution, God made extra examples of all kinds so Adam could watch Him create and verify He was the creator. \n\n2:37 Who is this guy? He considers that in Genesis 2 not just animals but plants (in general, as opposed to just one garden of them with trees poofing up for Adam's edification in it) and even stars - not even mentioned in chapter 2! were created after Adam. That would indeed involve a contradiction with chapter 1, which fortunately is not there. \n\nChecking by scrolling back the video: Francisco Ayala, Ph.D., Donald Bre Professor of Biological Sciences, Dept. of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, U.C. Irvine, 2001 National Medal of Science Laureate \n\nOh, at least no US university gave him any credits for his skills in Biblical exegesis ... good ... \n\n3:00 \"[hundreds and hundreds of] inconsistencies and incompatibilities\" \n\nProbably Francisco Ayala checked an Atheist's Annotated Bible or sth. \n\nEach of the \"inconsistencies\" self destructs when checked against the actual words of the Bible. \n\nTwo things scientists are often very poor on: Bible and Medieval History. \n\n3:57 - 3:59 \"[the writers of the Bible could not speak of atoms or natural selection] or even of the earth going around the Sun, because there not what people thought was the case at the time in\" \n\nFrancisco Ayala, I do not quite get what you are trying to convey. \n\nBack when I was a Lutheran (fortunately no more!) I was against women \"priests\". Some guys argued that Jesus could only name male apostles, because the priesthood back then was reserved for men ... well, in Israel it was, since Aaron and before (if you read Genesis), but that was a thing God had arranged more than 1000 years before. In the Pagan world, there were lots of cults with female priestesses. Isis, Aphrodite, and a few more, there were female priestesses back then. A N D Jesus still chose male only Apostles. \n\nWhat they were thinking was, back then people had not progressed beyond a certain misogyny, and so Jesus adapted to it, and now we have progressed beyond it, Christianity no longer needs to adapt to a misogyny no longer reflecting our culture. \n\nOf course this is blasphemous, it implies God when living among us like Man was inadequate (at least without the help of very recent interpreters pushing \"empathy\" for what Christ must really have meant very far) to \"bear witness for truth\". \n\nYou seem to have a very similar and very evil idea that scientific progress is a one way story and that while God was believing atoms, natural selection and heliocentrism, He not just ignored atoms, but contradicted Natural Selection and Heliocentrism just to adapt to the people He was molding like pottery clay through the 40 years of Desert Journey. Ah, He can make them circumcise, He can make them abhor porc meat, which Egyptians did not abhor, He can ... and yet if He had also given them Heliocentrism, it would have been too much for them. \n\nWhile there were no instruments with which to \"measure parallax\" back then, the knowledge of Heliocentrism could have been a supernatural one, one acquired by trust in God, as knowledge of Hittites has so long been for Christians, up to about a century ago. \n\nSo much for the idea God could not have revealed it. \n\nAs to the writers, they were not autonomous intellectuals to whom God revealed nothing, but some of them were prophets. \n\nNow, atoms may or may not be true (the globes you find in electronic microscopy and where you have a big and two smaller ones for water molecules are not correctly named atoms, only conventually so : if they were really a-tomoi, indivisible, there would be no isotopes and no radioactivity : whether carbon 14 decays to carbon 12 or to nitrogen 14 which is its origin - I have heard both - both its origin and its decay contradict there being no parts in carbon 14 which can go away or be added). \n\nAtoms are at least not contradicted by the Bible. \n\nBut for Natural Selection, you even have a contrary statement in the Bible, twice at least: \n\nMatth 10:[29] Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father. \n\nSame thing said in Luke, but here is an older mention: \n\nPs 103:[21] The young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God. \n\nIn other words, decision of what animals survive is not \"natural selection\", but an apparent \"chance selection\" which is really a \"providence of God\" selection. \n\nSimilarily, Heliocentrism is also contradicted twice, or more: \n\nPs 103:[5] Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases: it shall not be moved for ever and ever. \n\nAnd even earlier than that: \n\nJoshua 10:[12] Then Josue spoke to the Lord, in the day that he delivered the Amorrhite in the sight of the children of Israel, and he said before them: Move not, O sun, toward Gabaon, nor thou, O moon, toward the valley of Ajalon. [13] And the sun and the moon stood still, till the people revenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of the just? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down the space of one day. \n\nAs said, this was after God had been giving Israel extra lessons for free in the Desert, and you pretend God could not have revealed Heliocentrism to them, so Joshua could have told Earth not to turn for a while? Are we supposed to conclude that God did not know He was going to make the miracle? Or that He didn't care about which words he used, what created entity he adressed after praying? \n\nNo, it is rather the idea of Francisco Ayala which is blashemous. Not Biblical literalism! \n\nI just found out a few things about Francisco J. Ayala: \n\n\"Francisco Jos\u00e9 Ayala Pereda (born March 12, 1934) is a Spanish-American evolutionary biologist and philosopher at the University of California, Irvine.[2] He is a former Dominican priest,[3][4] ordained in 1960,[5] but left the priesthood that same year. After graduating from the University of Salamanca, he moved to the United States in 1961 to study for a PhD at Columbia University. There, he studied for his doctorate under Theodosius Dobzhansky, graduating in 1964.[6] He became a US citizen in 1971.\" \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_J._Ayala \n\nFirst identity of this post, keeping it:postID=7883265 666 845594547 - perhaps fits Francisco J.

I load to an OAL of 1.445\" (per Berry's recommendation). I have taper crimp dies for my plated bullets because I load a lot of them. But I don't load them to PF. I load them hotter - often 5.0 grains of W231 - which yields 870 f/s through my 4\" (840 is needed for PF).\nIn competition, I almost always use 148 DEWC's (both plated, and soft cast lead). These, I load almost entirely to PF and have done extensive load testing with a chronograph, using lots of different powders. I need the big round wadcutter hole so I can see my impact points though the reading glasses that I use to see the sights (getting old, sigh). Speedloading WC's takes about 3/4 second longer than any pointy profiled bullet. And yeah, 3/4 second is a lot if you take your competition seriously. I don't.\nWinchester White Box 130gn FMJ's yield 847 f/s; which is a PF of 110. I have used these quite a bit in IDPA. They are a truncated RN profile. They used to be a true RN, until some years back. Either way, they slide in nice; and I never noticed any speedloading difference between the old n new profiles. (I use WWB as the source for my brass - hence, the use of factory ammo. I buy them by the case for this purpose.) I've also used 158 plated RN's for competition (at ICORE's 125 PF) and they drop right in too. 158 LSWC's (again, to ICORE PF) drop in good, but can hang up just a touch on the \"lip.\" It's fast enough for me, but sometimes, I can feel that slight hang-up. True competitors probably would have none of that.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:56.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "275958d8d00c6f4c3acb7a365b48790997233c6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZivMBinp9uKSJEh1R2Fyx2vUneZtz8pKfm", "site_full": "www.beyondblue.org.au", "site": "beyondblue.org.au", "site_section": "http://www.beyondblue.org.au/connect-with-others/online-forums/long-term-support-over-the-journey", "site_categories": ["health", "panic_anxiety_disorders", "depression"], "section_title": "Long term support over the journey ", "title": "Feeling lost and overwhelmed...what happened?", "title_full": "Feeling lost and overwhelmed...what happened?", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://www.beyondblue.org.au/App_Themes/standard/images/BB_FB_logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6b30d9644e975d78dfb7b2d6d691372922a38db4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZivMBinp9uKSJEh1R2Fyx2vWBCK0gFZn.s4OHptzUhn27YcFhvOMlsNRzl9pMz4Pv7", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "CMF", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hey Kanga,\nThank you for your words and support.

'He' asked why I don't ring my ex to discuss the bills,school fees etc that may be a conversation needs to be had there. This got me thinking and made me realise a few things;\nMy ex has been in the kids' lives since the day they were born. 'He' walks in and out as he pleases.\nMy ex picks up and brings the kids home at a set time. If they are running late or early he or the kids will text me to let me know. 'He' says he will do things at a certain time and never sticks to it, no text or call to let me know and does not answer his phone if i ring.\nIf I ask my ex to pick the kids from school or something on a particular day for any reason I know he will be there and on time. I may confirm the day before but that is for my own peace of mind. 'He' needs to reminded constantly leading up to the event. He can't write it down or make a note somewhere, or just remember,there needs to be constant reminders right up to the day before. Everyone has to do the thinking for him.\nMy ex does not ring me to see how the kids are, we don't have that sort of relationship, he has moved on and so have I. 'He' rings every few days to see how we are or to ask about something and he wants a friendship of some sort which is understandable as little miss is still young. 'He' wants a conversation so i tell him if i am anxious or anything. If it is because of his actions I cannot change that. He just will not accept it.\nMy ex pays his set amount of child support every fortnight, pays his share of school fees/expenses when due. 'He' pays his child support randomly, sometimes every 2 months, sometimes 3 months, the amount varies each time. There is no consistency. I often have to ask for it and then still chase it up several times.\nEven though my ex husband can give me anxiety and really peeve me off, he does do what he should be doing for his kids to some degree. I can't stand him at times, I know he can be fake and show off with his expensive car and loud music but he has never abused me, called me names or sworn at me.

N.E.R.D continues preparing the world for their epic return to the music industry. After releasing music video for Rihanna -assisted track \"Lemon\", the Pharrell Williams -led group has unveiled music video for track \"1000\" featuring Future . The visuals, which is directed by Todd Tourso and Scott Cudmore, opens with a statement from the group and their record label, Columbia Records, which states that they \"do not support or condone violence in any shape of form. We only have internet access.\" The scene then changes to show protestors ripping a conservative flag, followed by a montage of violent riots and protests from all over the world. One of the scenes shows dancer Mette Towley, who also appeared in music video for \"Lemon\", showing her impressive choreography once again. At one point, Mette is seen fighting someone with Mike Tyson 's monologue playing in the background. \"But I'm totally confident. All during my training, I've been afraid of this man. I thought this man might be capable of beating me,\" Mike says. \"I've dreamed of him beating me. The closer I get to the ring, the more confident I get. The closer and more confidence I get, the closer and more confident I get.\" \"1000\" will be included in N.E.R.D's new album \" No_One Ever Really Dies \", which is set to be released on December 15. Ahead of the release, the funk rock band held a surprise listening party at ComplexCon in Long Beach, California. At the event, the group revealed that the album would feature collaborations with popular musicians. For instance, Ed Sheeran is featured on track \"Lifting You\", while Kendrick Lamar assists the band on track \"Don't Don't Do It\". \"I just know that that for all those unarmed motorists that's been killed, I know there's a moment when they tell them to do something there must be a voice in their heads saying, 'Don't don't do it,' \" Pharrell said of the latter track.

(PRO-FRIENDS) Iloilo together with its sales networks held a 4-day Corporate Social Responsibility Caravan. The first stop of the PRO-FRIENDS Iloilo\u2019s CSR Caravan was Barangay Tigum on November 7 which benefited a total of 135 kids (60 Day Care pupils and 75 Kindergarten pupils). Held at Tigum Elementary School, the kids were entertained by the magic show sponsored by PRO-FRIENDS Iloilo. They also learned basic hygiene such as proper handwashing and toothbrushing. Likewise, they enjoyed the food, received hygiene kits, school supplies and loot bags prepared by PRO-FRIENDS, while their parents, guardians and teachers were given reading glasses and undergone sugar screening for free courtesy of Golden Pillars Group, Tycoons and Go Land Marketing. On November 8, PRO-FRIENDS Iloilo\u2019s CSR Caravan continued in Barangay Balabag where one of its projects, Monticello Villas is located. A total of 130 Day Care pupils gathered at the barangay covered court to listen to the Hygiene Talk given by PRO-FRIENDS Iloilo and to witness a magic show. The said beneficiaries were also given hygiene kits and school supplies and enjoyed the Feeding Program. Success Unlimited Marketing, on the other hand, sponsored loot bags for all kids present during the event. On the third day of the CSR Caravan on November 10, PRO-FRIENDS Iloilo visited Barangay Ungka which hosts Parc Regency Residences. A total of 140 kids benefited from the feeding program, enjoyed the magic show and received school supplies from by PRO-FRIENDS Iloilo. The kids also received water bottles that they can use everyday at school courtesy of the Diamond Group. On the last day of the CSR Caravan which was held last November 10, PRO-FRIENDS Iloilo went back to Brgy. Balabag. This time, they gave joy to the indigent residents and elders of the said barangay. The beneficiaries laughed their hearts out to the punch lines and magic tricks of \u201cTito Bob the Magician\u201d and shared the food prepared by PRO-FRIENDS Iloilo. Apex Group also distributed blankets to each beneficiary. The recently conducted CSR Caravan is a way of PRO-FRIENDS Iloilo and its sales network to give back to the community where the company\u2019s projects are located as well as to the neighboring communities. \u201cChristmas is fast approaching and now is the high time for us to share not only material things, but also joy and love to everyone.

The scenes that I just saw on the internet of the raging fires in the Los Angeles area are almost beyond belief \u2014 it is a raging inferno that rips through everything in its path \u2014 from lowly outbuildings to multi-million dollar homes and it shuts down freeways or portions of them in one of the most populated areas of our nation.\nI drive through this area all the time. I was just down near there the other day but fortunately maybe a 100 miles or less north of the fire.\nI\u2019ll be on the road tonight (Wednesday evening, early Thursday morning as I write this), but I\u2019ll be going the other direction but we\u2019re having a dry spell now up this way in Northern California. These conflagrations can happen most anywhere (north of San Francisco recently). You can blame it on climate change or God trying to teach all of us sinners a lesson, but they seem to be getting harder and harder to control or stop.\nMost scientists seem to agree that man\u2019s pollution of the earth\u2019s atmosphere has some effect in climate change in which these fires seem to burn with such intensity. The naysayers suggest that is like blaming man for living, disregarding corrective measures that would sustain man\u2019s life on earth. The attitude of climate change deniers seems to be that today\u2019s profits on the burning of carbons and such come before conservation measures (I remember reading in school how it was hard to convince farmers in the Midwest to change their cultivation practices during the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s, but they finally did). Climate change deniers also suggest that the phenomenon we are experiencing with our weather and fire is just the continuing pattern of the earth\u2019s natural history. Most of us do not have the charts and data in front of us and would be hard pressed to make sense of it if we did.

While principal photography on \" Venom (2018) \" is currently underway in Atlanta, fans who will be attending the 2017 Comic-Con in Sao Paulo, Brazil can get a first look at the upcoming film's potential logo with its promotional banner. Steve Wintraub of Collider got to take photos of the poster while he was at the Sony booth. The poster also possibly unveils Tom Hardy 's Eddie Brock's likely costume in the upcoming movie. Nothing has been confirmed just yet on whether or not it's the official logo of the film as well as whether Brock will be donning the Agent Venom suit instead of his classic one. But it's possible that Sony would debut the first look at Hardy in full Venom costume at the convention. \"Venom\" has been in development at Sony for years, even during the time Sam Raimi's \" Spider-Man \" trilogy reigned supreme. The Spidey villain made his big-screen debut in the heavily-maligned \" Spider-Man 3 \", in which he was played by Topher Grace . Grace's performance as the symbiote was deemed poor, but fans still expressed hope in seeing a proper iteration of Venom in the big screen. \"Venom\" will be the first film in Sony's Marvel universe and will be followed by the studio's untitled Silver Sable and the Black Cat project . Sony's films are separate to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, meaning it's highly unlikely that Hardy's Eddie Brock will be swinging alongside Tom Holland 's Spider-Man anytime soon. The film is expected to be an origin film, with the two main characters being Venom and Carnage, whose actor has yet to be announced. Directed by Ruben Fleisher from a script written by Scott Rosenberg ans Jeff Pinkner, the film also stars Riz Ahmed , Jenny Slate , Reid Scott, Scott Haze and Michelle Williams . \"Venom\" hits theaters across the nation on October 5, 2018.

(AP) - Evan Fournier scored 27 points but injured his right ankle as the Orlando Magic rallied to beat the Atlanta Hawks 110-106 in overtime Wednesday night. \nAaron Gordon had 24 points and 15 rebounds and Nikola Vucevic added 22 points and 16 rebounds for the Magic, and Jonathon Simmons scored 15 points. \nFournier, the team's second-leading scorer, left with an injured ankle after falling on Vucevic's foot on the first possession in overtime. \nDennis Schroder led Atlanta with 26 points and seven assists. Taurean Prince had 19 points and Tyler Cavanaugh 13 for the Hawks. \nThe Magic hit 6 of 10 shots in overtime, five of them layups against a tired and ineffective defense. \nOrlando's D.J. Augustin hit a 3-pointer with 6.2 seconds left in regulation to send the game to overtime. It ended a difficult final two minutes of regulation for both sides. \nFournier hit a driving layup to put Orlando up 93-92 with 1:59 to play, and both teams struggled to execute from there. \nBazemore hit a 3-pointer with 1:33 left, but it was waved off after a review because of a shot-clock violation. Gordon then was charged with an offensive foul as he made a layup, but Schroder and Ersan Ilyasova both missed layups at the other end for Atlanta. \nSchroder ended the run of bad offense by hitting two free throws with 27.3 seconds left for a 94-93 lead, and Bazemore hit two more with 14 seconds left to give Atlanta a 96-93 edge. \nAugustin got free at the top of the key and drilled his tying 3-pointer. \nTIP-INS \nHAWKS: C Dewayne Dedmon missed his fourth straight game with a leg injury and F John Collins missed his third straight with a shoulder strain. ...

Preheat oven to 375\u00b0.\n\n2. To prepare pastry, combine first 4 ingredients in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil. Weigh or lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup; level with a knife. Add flour all at once to pan; stir with a wooden spoon until mixture pulls away from sides of pan and leaves a film on the bottom of the pan (about 3 minutes).\n\n3. Spoon batter into a medium bowl. Beat with a mixer at medium speed 2 minutes or until mixture cools to about 120\u00b0. Add 2 eggs and egg white, 1 at a time, beating at medium-low speed after each addition until completely combined (mixture will look lumpy but will get smooth quickly). Beat at medium speed 1 minute or until well combined. Stir in chocolate chips by hand. Drop dough by 2 tablespoons 2 inches apart onto doubled baking sheets lined with parchment paper (you will have a total of 20 puffs). Bake at 375\u00b0 for 20 minutes.\n\n4. Reduce oven temperature to 325\u00b0. Rotate pans, and bake at 325\u00b0 for an additional 25 minutes or until browned and crisp. Remove pans from oven. Pierce the top of each puff with the tip of a knife. Cool completely on pans.\n\n5. To prepare filling, combine 1 cup half-and-half, 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, and dash of salt in a saucepan; bring to a simmer. Combine remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, cornstarch, 1 egg, and egg yolks in a medium bowl; stir with a whisk until smooth. Gradually drizzle milk mixture into egg mixture, stirring constantly with a whisk. Return mixture to pan. Cook over medium heat until mixture thickens (about 4 minutes), stirring constantly.\n\n6. Remove pan from heat; add butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla, stirring until smooth. Spoon cream into a medium bowl; place bowl in a large ice water\u2013filled bowl. Cool cream completely, stirring occasionally (about 20 minutes). Gently fold in whipped topping.\n\n7. To prepare glaze, combine corn syrup, 1 tablespoon half-and-half, and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave at HIGH 15 seconds.
