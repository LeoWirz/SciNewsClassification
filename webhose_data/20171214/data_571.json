These are, by far, the most commonly used management system standards in the world. ISO 9001 currently represents 67%, and ISO 14001 21%, of all ISO management systems certificates issued globally. \nBoth standards were revised in September 2015. These updated versions of the standards more closely resemble modern business language and practice, reflecting both the current business environment and the needs of the user. The deadline for implementation of the new standards is September 14, 2018. \nWhat are the Benefits? \nBy updating ISO 9001 and ISO 14001, businesses will see several advantages to the 2015 iterations. These include: \nGreater emphasis on top management engagement and improved alignment between management systems and the strategic direction of the organization. These should be an integral part of a business' processes The adoption of Risk Based Thinking, giving opportunities to differentiate between the various processes based on their level of importance and impact on delivering conforming products/services. This will allow focus on key priorities Widening the concept of customers to include (in addition to the contractual customers) end-users, consumers, regulatory bodies, etc. This allows the definition and expectations of interested parties to be addressed Adopting High-Level Structure (Annex SL), facilitating the harmonization and integration of different management system standards Lessening the requirements for documentation, enabling organizations to decide on what matters most to its operation and how to manage and control it in an era where automation and smart systems play an increasing role in management What's the Feedback from Early Adopters? \nAccording to the ISO survey 2016, released in September 2017 both ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 have witnessed strong single digit growth - of 7% and 8% respectively. \nEarly adopters of the 2015 versions have given us positive feedback, identifying practical improvements gained from the experience. \nOne business has reported the introduction of new ways of working, such as post-project debriefings. These have improved knowledge-sharing around the company, fulfilling the new standard's requirement for creating a business-wide 'change to improve' culture. Adoption of the 2015 standard has also led to the creation of a 'Business Risks and Opportunities Register', detailing all issues that may impact upon the business. This helps prioritise what will affect the business most, encouraging the identification and discussion of internal and external influences and helping to create more efficient management structures. \nAnother company, working in the jewellery sector, sought ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certification because they realized it would help with sustainability and give them competitive advantage. The new versions of the standards have helped focus attention, both internally and externally, upon the core values of the business. They have used SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity and threat) analysis to assess the company in relation to culture, corporate law adherence, technology and economic conditions. \nFinally, a company in the Philippines has told us that the adoption of ISO 9001:2015 has helped them reduce losses resulting from customer dissatisfaction, when their service did not meet customer specifications or international standards. Higher customer satisfaction rates and improved trust have led to better cash flow and zero percent debt. They have also reported improved communication and employee engagement, citing the new standard as the cause of this improved work culture. \nAchieving Smooth Transition? \nThe key to a smooth transition will be the identification of differences between current ISO standards and the 2015 versions. Gap analysis by a certification specialist, like SGS, will help to identify which areas need improvement, helping companies draw up a realistic plan for implementation. \nTraining on the new versions of both standards (either face to face or online) has proved to be one of the best choices companies have made to speed up the transition process and to avoid many pitfalls. \nWorking with businesses already accredited to ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015, we have seen the benefits of early adoption. For companies not yet certified to latest versions of these standards, transition must be completed by September 14, 2018. \nFor more information, contact: \nMagd Hendy \nTransition Task Force Leader, Regional Manager - Africa\nt: +202 27263053 \nSGS SA published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:46:07 UTC . \nOriginal document http://www.sgs.com/en/news/2017/12/understanding-the-benefits-of-the-new-iso-9001-and-iso-14001-management-systems-standards \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/2F67F15FE1EEECE6840C6B0EF07EEFF959ECAD16", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "magd hendy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "iso", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sgs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sgs sa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:46.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e8e0905a0bcad089070ef70b948bc347f77e652", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSg_7TRNN2B2DN3f5v2KhuTOmVyaGaTwg4KXm1LoyOW74KYNrW2gywSyKmpCWeSUNV13XNNy4PGWOfF_8JZh.i2JNYYfbdPSv82q5Hv86sU_PRtvfoszh0bw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "[IMAGE] Reddit, I never thought I could do it but today marks my 5 year Anniversary for when I decided to workout in my basement!! : GetMotivated", "title_full": "[IMAGE] Reddit, I never thought I could do it but today marks my 5 year Anniversary for when I decided to workout in my basement!! : GetMotivated", "published": "2017-12-07T07:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 178, "participants_count": 146, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12d903c71a980b3203b6f461f74d590b5acacb93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSg_7TRNN2B2DN3f5v2KhuTOmVyaGaTwg4KXm1LoyOW74KYNrW2gywSyKmpCWeSUNV13XNNy4PGWOfF_8JZh.i2JNYYfbdPSv82q5Hv86sU_PBAupVFYeEpKP9BB.x9XBlEJV4KALWaTw-", "ord_in_thread": 41, "author": "karadan100", "published": "2017-12-07T10:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The one on the right looks like it's taken from a Bollywood movie. :)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:46.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95315b55e281e7708e833bf9f318589fb7f8f6c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvJuJc3bfreOucWbn2Ud1solDR7Bk9G7lXqA8Cd0DtgmW5SmqfiaTID5FzNbEqXi6vH2RQDR1L5lzdHQEjGwkSmi7GxL63gcvlnn1WSRi_ClOX5DYsZ8h9amwSKZNll68dGV_vJc7uYn6.KmHu9KJRxQ--", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "Outlook 2018: Asian ex Japan equities | 4-Traders", "title_full": "Outlook 2018: Asian ex Japan equities | 4-Traders", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c55857aa86b0cd2d661b8a9a62a7e005e1dbf1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvJuJc3bfreOucWbn2Ud1solDR7Bk9G7lXqA8Cd0DtgmW5SmqfiaTID5FzNbEqXi6vH2RQDR1L5lzdHQEjGwkSmr8UcYC6H1iQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Outlook 2018: Asian ex Japan equities | 4-Traders", "text": "2017 has been a remarkable year for Asian equities, with total returns for regional markets of c.40% in US dollar terms at the time of writing. These have been the strongest returns since 2009 and among the best five calendar-year returns we have seen in the last 30 years. \nEven more remarkable is that a year ago we were faced with huge uncertainties on the political and economic front. President Trump had been elected unexpectedly in the US, huge uncertainty was created by Brexit and in Europe doubts were raised on the future integrity of the European Union (EU) amid a widespread rise in populist parties. A rallying US dollar, traditionally a headwind for Asian markets, and concerns over North Korea capped off the host of worries. \nSo what lessons can we draw from the fact that equities have so spectacularly ignored these risks and gone on to post new highs across many of the region's markets? \nA 'Goldilocks' backdrop \nFirst is that economics trumps politics, and that most political rhetoric fails the tests of real world implementation. In the US we have not had massive stimulus enacted, border adjustment taxes have been abandoned and we have not seen any significant tariff barriers raised. \nMeanwhile the continued macro backdrop of moderate economic growth and low inflation globally last year has continued the 'Goldilocks' backdrop for equities - not too hot, not too cold \u2026 but a slightly warmer overall global growth picture. \nThe US dollar has also retreated from its earlier highs, which has made it easier for Asian countries to service their debt given their appreciating local currencies. All of this has maintained the constructive 'risk on' environment for equities globally, in turn supporting local markets. \nEarnings boost \nSecondly, and perhaps more importantly, earnings trump economics. What has turbo-charged Asian equities this year has been the very strong earnings delivery and consistent upgrades to expectations. \nWe started 2017 with consensus expectations for c.12% earnings per share (EPS) growth this year. As we write today, however, it looks like we will actually see 22%+ EPS growth, a far more dynamic outcome. \nThis means that although market indices are up 40%, valuation multiples have not needed to be the prime driver of the expansion, and the prospective 12-month forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the index today at 13-14x is only modestly above where it was at the start of the year. \n\nWhat is most notable is how much of the growth is geared not to the traditionally-scrutinised macro economic factors. Instead, it is based on the fortunes of a far lower profile price - that of DRAM and NAND memory - which are key ingredients in building smartphones, laptops, servers and other IT products. \nA large portion of this 22% EPS growth is attributable to Korean technology companies, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. These two companies alone are likely to make c.US$52 billion earnings in 2017 versus only US$ 22 billion last year, of which c.70% is attributable to profits from their memory divisions. \n\nRising memory prices have little to do with traditional macroeconomic drivers and everything to do with improved industry-specific supply and demand trends. This is an industry that has consolidated from an irrational market of 10+ players to a more stable, near oligopoly, of only three to four players. \nSamsung leads the way with a dominant 40-50% market share. Meanwhile demand has been very strong, helped in particular by the rapid build out of cloud computing data centres by the likes of Amazon, Alibaba, Google and Microsoft. \nSimilarly, Chinese e-commerce players have also seen very robust earnings growth, notably the triumvirate of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. These three companies are collectively likely to report earnings growth of 80%+ year-on-year. As with the Korean tech names, earnings have consistently beaten expectations this year and forecasts have been upgraded materially. \nAgain, these earnings drivers are geared to more secular industry trends and largely uncorrelated to traditional drivers such as GDP growth or government spending. What we are tapping into is a revolution in the way consumers spend time (more social media/gaming), consume (more e-commerce), transact (more online payments), search for information and in turn how companies interact with their customers. All this creates a tsunami of data in the process for the companies to exploit. As they say, 'data is the new oil'. \nFocused on the future \nThe third lesson is that although global growth feels better today and earnings growth looks healthy, there is still a very tough operating backdrop for many companies. The average performance for the market disguises some outsized winners that are capturing a disproportionate share of the spoils. So as investors we need to have a laser focus on the future and the rapidly shifting sands in almost all industries. \nLooking into 2018 we think that all these lessons remain as relevant as ever. Political uncertainties are, as always, still out there while the Fed's plans to hike rates and taper its balance sheet still have scope to rattle markets. However, in our equity portfolios we think the focus should remain far more on the bottom up fundamentals of companies than the macro machinations of politicians and central bankers. \nBroader secular trends, like the rising adoption of robotics and automation across the manufacturing industry, as well as the coming adoption of electric and autonomous vehicles, will only intensify with time. It is only 10 years since the iPhone was launched, which really represented the starting gun for the explosion in online businesses, and similarly things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are still in their infancy. \nAgainst this backdrop, we continue to be excited about the longer term growth potential for many of the stocks that we own in our Asian equity portfolios. Although markets are being fairly 'efficient' such that valuations for the stronger businesses are very full based on today's earnings, we think we are not yet at 'bubble' territory and the better companies can grow into their current multiples over the next one to two years. \nAfter such a strong performance in 2017 we should expect more moderate returns on a 12-month view, but this should not deter one from remaining invested with the winners of tomorrow. \nThe sectors, securities and countries shown above are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be considered a recommendation to buy or sell. \nClick here to read more articles in our Outlook 2018 series. \nSchroders plc published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:46:06 UTC . \nOriginal document http://www.schroders.com/en/media-relations/newsroom/all_news_releases/outlook-2018-asian-ex-japan-equities/ \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/B96A16BEC4D227A8764918546B3DA672EE13AD5D", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schroders plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tencent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung electronics and sk hynix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baidu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:46.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e8e0905a0bcad089070ef70b948bc347f77e652", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSg_7TRNN2B2DN3f5v2KhuTOmVyaGaTwg4KXm1LoyOW74KYNrW2gywSyKmpCWeSUNV13XNNy4PGWOfF_8JZh.i2JNYYfbdPSv82q5Hv86sU_PRtvfoszh0bw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "[IMAGE] Reddit, I never thought I could do it but today marks my 5 year Anniversary for when I decided to workout in my basement!!

Indianapolis Colts head coach Ron Meyer on the sidelines during a 1989 game against the Miami Dolphins at Joe Robbie Stadium. (RVR Photos-USA TODAY NETWORK) Former Patriots head coach Ron Meyer has died at age 76, the team announced Wednesday morning.Meyer coached the Patriots from 1982 to 1984, after six years at Southern Methodist University. He was AFC Coach of the Year in the strike-shortened 1982 season, and finished his Patriots tenure with an 18-15 regular-season record.\u201cI am sad to hear of Ron Meyer\u2019s passing,\u201d said Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft. \u201cHe was a colorful head coach who was very entertaining for fans during his tenure. One of the greatest things Ron did when he was hired in 1982 was to bring us a young coach from his staff at Southern Methodist University named Dante Scarnecchia. Thirty-five years later, that hire has proven to be a lasting legacy. On behalf of the entire Patriots organization, we send our thoughts and prayers to the Meyer family and the many friends who are mourning his loss.\u201dMeyer is perhaps best remembered for his role in the Dec. 12, 1982, \u201cSnow Plow Game\u201d against the Miami Dolphins in Foxborough, when Meyer called a late-game timeout so that a stadium worker could clear a spot on the field for John Smith\u2019s go-ahead field goal.Meyer went on to coach the Indianapolis Colts, then the Patriots\u2019 AFC East division rival, from 1986 to 1991.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ron meyer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dante scarnecchia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert kraft", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "providence journal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "indianapolis colts", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "southern methodist university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "r.i.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe robbie stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxborough", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:47.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e8e0905a0bcad089070ef70b948bc347f77e652", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSg_7TRNN2B2DN3f5v2KhuTOmVyaGaTwg4KXm1LoyOW74KYNrW2gywSyKmpCWeSUNV13XNNy4PGWOfF_8JZh.i2JNYYfbdPSv82q5Hv86sU_PRtvfoszh0bw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "[IMAGE] Reddit, I never thought I could do it but today marks my 5 year Anniversary for when I decided to workout in my basement!! : GetMotivated", "title_full": "[IMAGE] Reddit, I never thought I could do it but today marks my 5 year Anniversary for when I decided to workout in my basement!! : GetMotivated", "published": "2017-12-07T07:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 178, "participants_count": 146, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ed38af6c5834b0ff424110b4baed7971d0b53f0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSg_7TRNN2B2DN3f5v2KhuTOmVyaGaTwg4KXm1LoyOW74KYNrW2gywSyKmpCWeSUNV13XNNy4PGWOfF_8JZh.i2JNYYfbdPSv82q5Hv86sU_PBAupVFYeEpKP9BB.x9XBls9Vkhl.G9yA-", "ord_in_thread": 60, "author": "IIDarXideII", "published": "2017-12-07T10:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "From Academic Nerd to Future, Rich CEO.

Photographer: Akos Stiller/Bloomberg \nLego A/S , Europe\u2019s biggest toymaker, said it won its first copyright court case in China. \nThe China Shantou Intermediate People\u2019s Court has ruled that products under the name Bela, sold by two Chinese companies, infringed upon Lego\u2019s copyrights, the building block maker said in a statement Thursday. The ruling was made in September, but the appeal window only ended last month, Lego said. \nThe Danish company, which has doubled in size over the past five years, is known for its aggressive use of courts to protects its multi-colored building blocks. In July, the Beijing Higher Court passed a ruling that recognizes the Lego logo and the name in Chinese as \u2018well-known\u2019 trademarks in China. \nThe September ruling is \u201ca strong indication of the continued focus on proper intellectual property protection and enforcement by the Chinese courts,\u201d Peter Thorslund Kjaer, head of Lego\u2019s legal affairs, said in the statement. \u201cThis is very important for the continued development of a favorable business environment for all companies operating in the Chinese market.\u201d Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

This is the completion factor. Please do so.\u201d \n\nHeavenly Blessings ~ November 23, 2017 \n\nLinda Dillon ~ Channel for the Council of Love \n\nSuzanne Maresca ~ Host, InLight Universal \n\n[Meditation from 7:45 to 20:50] \n\nSt. Germaine: Greetings, I am St. Germaine. \n\nSuzi: Welcome! \n\nStG: And welcome to you, beloved angels, saints and sinners, [chuckles] masters and students \u2013 for have we not done it all and we have done it all together! \n\nSo I welcome you this day and I welcome you, yet again, into the Violet Flame, into the I AM Presence, into this deeper, higher, wider, broader sense of sacred union, not merely with your I AM \u2013 with the I AM. \n\nI am Keeper of the Violet Flame, and I am Keeper entrusted to be the guardian, the steward of the I AM Presence, and I have been offering this to each and every one of you for over 60,000 years. I think, beloved friends, sisters and brothers, that you are ready to accept my invitation on a whole new level! \n\nAnd yes, Raj (Sanat Kumara) and I are here to assist thee \u2013 by the way, as we always have been \u2013 but perhaps we are making our presence more urgently or apparently known to assist you in this final birthing. And it is not a painful birth, quite the contrary; it is filled with jubilation and celebration and joy. And it is as simple \u2013 it cannot be more simple \u2013 as simply crossing over the finish line. \n\nYou know, if you have run a marathon or done a triathlon, which many of you feel you have \u2013 and you have, by the way! \u2013 you feel that as you reach the finish line you are exhausted, you are exuberant, you are in a totally different energetic state, your endorphins are pumping strongly through your brain and through your bloodstream. But in that moment when you cross the finish line, it is but a matter of moving your body a mere few inches. \n\nAnd then, what do you do? Yes, there are some that simply fall down in exhaustion, but it is exuberant exhaustion. And there are some that say, \u201cThank goodness I am out of that melee, that chaos. Thank God I am out of the pack.\u201d \n\nAnd then there are those that will skip and run and play and join their friends and family; and some will go and have a celebration meal or a celebration drink of water or wine, it matters not, the point being: each of you, my beloveds, celebrate and declare completion of this phase in a different way. But it is also important to realise and recognise and celebrate in ways that are in alignment with who you are. \n\nNow, what gives you that final push \u2013 that final push for the last couple of km to run and to truly step over that finish line? And do not start moaning and groaning and saying, \u201cOh, St. Germaine, I didn\u2019t know there was further yet to go.\u201d \n\nMy beloved friends, I am not fooling around when I say to you that I have been offering this on-planet \u2013 because there are many chapters on and off-planet \u2013 but on-planet for 60,000 years, so I know about endurance! And I know about victory, I know about completion, and I most certainly know about jubilation and celebration! \n\nSo I come this day, beloved Gaians, not merely as master, not as some ascended being, but as brother and friend that has taken this journey in form, on planet, for lengths of time beyond imagination, with you. Now there have been many times in that lengthy journey that began with each of you, by the way, accepting the fullness of Source Violet Flame energy \u2013 because this elixir, this flame, this cup is nothing more and nothing less than Source energy. \n\nAnd in the beginning, you welcomed it. That is why it feels so familiar to you. And you drank deeply and you imbibed love, and you abided, yes, by what many call the Law of One, the Law of Love. It is the overarching, what my brother, Sanat Kumara, calls the \u201cState of Being\u201d, but it is from which all begins and all ends. \n\nOver time, many of you turned away \u2013 the scenic detours of the human experience \u2013 and some of you stayed. It matters not because we are all here together now. But even those of you who stayed during the time, during the construction, anchoring and cement-forming of the false grids and paradigms, you would say to me, \u201cSt. Germaine, can you not soften that Violet Flame? Can you not give me a paler sense of violet? How about lavender or mauve? How about a little striation of pink?\u201d \n\nAnd, of course, I would do it because at least it kept our connection, for never have any of us yearned or wanted or hoped you would simply veer away into the darkness, into the grey null zone. \n\nWe did this with full knowing that the time would come when you would turn to us, when you would turn to me, when you would turn to the Planetary Logos and say, \u201cWe\u2019re ready!\u201d And you would say to me, \u201cSamuel, turn it back up. Francis, turn it back up,\u201d for I have been known by many names. And all of them, all those beings that I have existed as, these personas that I have adopted, I did so so I could stay with you and continue to offer you the Loving Cup. \n\nAnd I do so now, not in form but as clearly present as I have ever been. And I am offering you the Elixir of Love. I am offering you the Loving Cup. I am offering you the Blue Rose of Sirius. I am offering you the Violet Bonfire. I am offering you the essence. Yes, it has become my essence as Keeper and Carrier of the Violet Flame. But this Violet Flame \u2013 what is the Violet Flame? It is the essence of Love and of Source. \n\nSo often you think: \u201cHow do we know Source? How do we know God? How do we know that infinite Creator, creative universe?\u201d \n\nAnd this essence of the Violet Flame? It is not merely a transmuter of negativity. It is a creator. It is the electrical frequency, the oscillation that increases your frequency and your rate to a level where creation and co-creation simply become your \u2018new normal\u2019. That is why SK is putting such emphasis on the Universal Laws. This is your next step. \n\nSo I am offering you the full embrace of the Violet Flame that your oscillation factor \u2013 not from negative to neutral, but from neutral to spectacular \u2013 is in full force. \n\nThe Violet Flame, the Violet Ray, is even part of the Porlana C that is sent to you by your Star family inside what you think of as that electric blue. What gives it that electric feeling and sense? It is the Violet Flame. It is what they use. And it is blended with their life force energy and they are giving it to you. \n\nNow think of this. Think of all of us on this side and your Star family. And we are sending this to you, we are offering this to you, we are giving it to you \u2013 free of charge! [chuckles] \u2013 and even sending you blessings along with it, but that is another subject! But we are giving it to you. \n\nThis is a level of sacred union and sacred partnership that each and every one of you pray for every single day. If you were to have a human being, male or female, young or old, who approached you for sacred union and said, \u201cI will give you my essence, and I will see you for who you are, and I will treat you for who I know you to be,\u201d you would be over the moon, happy, joyous, fulfilled. \n\nBut, beloved ones, that is exactly what we are doing. And as each of you imbibes, steps into, embraces, surrounds yourself, fills yourself with this Violet Flame essence, you are creating unto yourself not only the perfect sacred partner, but you are turning yourself into the partner of your own being. And in that, you are able to truly engage in what we call sacred partnership and what your heart yearns for. \n\nNo, I am not suggesting that you are going to toss out of the house the person that you have been with, quite the contrary. The whole point is that you transmute and transform and transcend into a new level of love. \n\nI am not simply offering you currency or spiritual currency or diamonds or rubies out of thin air\u2026 lead into gold. I am offering you freely, with love, with the generosity that comes from the Mother\u2019s heart \u2013 I am offering you the I AM. \n\nI am offering you the expanded \u2013 because your ability has expanded, your ability to accept has expanded \u2013 therefore, I offer you the expanded, exploded Violet Flame! \n\nWhat do you say, dearest Suzi? \n\nSuzi: I say, \u201cThank you very much!\u201d I know things of this nature can be challenging for people because they don\u2019t have proof. I understand that our perceptions are opening, so that will be my prayer: that people\u2019s perceptions are opened that they might receive this information and this beautiful, exquisite gift more completely. \n\nStG: Yes. You have this expression, and in fact I would make a joke and say I invented this expression: \u201cWhat comes first, the chicken or the egg?\u201d Can you remember us sitting in a small gathering place, a roadside inn, where we would play and laugh with these silly questions and then we would make jokes? \n\nBut we would understand because of the overriding \u2013 and I say this in very serious terms \u2013 the overriding state of being of free will; this is \u2013 I would say \u2018sacred\u2019 \u2013 but this is the rule that our Mother has made beyond any kind of tampering. And you know we love to skirt rules, and particularly unjust laws and rulers that are all puffed-up and think themselves holy when in fact they are despots, but that is an aside. \n\nThe one thing we will not interfere with or override, although I may try vehemently to convince you one way or the other, is free will. \n\nNow you say, \u201cSt. Germaine, my prayer is that people will hear and receive,\u201d and that is why I have spoken and do speak so vehemently this day. I am begging you, but I can\u2019t do it for you! I am offering this, not even as an olive branch but a blazing inferno, or a chalice filled with electrical elixir, whatever works for you. \n\nNow, where does free will come in? My beloveds, all of you have said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if this is real. I don\u2019t know if this will work. I don\u2019t know what this is going to taste like, but what the hell, I\u2019ll have a sip.\u201d I cannot force it down your throat. And the proof of passing the finish line doesn\u2019t come before; it comes after. So that is why I\u2019m so urgently pleading with you, but offering you in the greatest sense of celebration! \n\nYou know along that marathon route that there are these way stations \u2013 what I would call a way station \u2013 where they offer you various energy drinks, Gatorade or sheer water, and it is before you cross the finish line. So I\u2019ve positioned myself with you and for you \u2013 and by the way, the way station, that pickup point, is loaded with all of us. And we\u2019re offering you as you\u2019re running by \u2013 the finish line is in sight but just to reinforce you; and we havereinforced you, by the way, the entire relay \u2013 we\u2019re offering you this bottle, cup, energy drink [chuckles] of the Violet Flame. \n\nYou are already ignited, your free will is already ignited, but it is your decision. \n\nNow I want to approach this, if I might, from even a slightly different perspective because I know you all! So yes, we have covered the: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure what it tastes like but what the heck, I will take a sip.\u201d But then there are those of you who are perhaps further back and you feel that you are no longer running. You are crawling to the finish line and you are exhausted. \n\nAnd let me tell you, in truth, what you are exhausted from. You are not exhausted. And you have been receiving perhaps the palest lavender, but you have been receiving gifts and many attunements, the Tsunami, the Porlana C all along the way. You are exhausted not even because of uncertainty. You may be framing it in that way, but I want to pose it another way: you are exhausted by the chaos; you are exhausted by the lies; you are exhausted by the disgusting behaviours that human beings have involved themselves in. \n\nNow note what I say. I do not say that the human beings are disgusting, sinful, irreverent. These are behaviours, these are sidetracks, these are diversions and distractions that they have involved themselves in, and it has all come to the surface. That\u2019s why I say that this has been a marathon of chaos. \n\nWhen you are that exhausted, when you feel that you are inching, crawling towards the finish line, it is not \u2013 I see you! \u2013 it is not because you don\u2019t have this or that, because what you have is your knowing and your faith and the solid determination that you are going to do this. And in this, your exhaustion comes from being tired of trying and feeling that those that are in the race \u2013 the human race \u2013 with you don\u2019t care, and would rather engage in the low, the negative side of that vibration, \u2018the old\u2019. \n\nBut beloveds, do not think that they are not being showered by the Violet Flame as well. They are moving from what you would term in terms of your spectrum is from the negative to the neutral. You have jumped \u2013 you weren\u2019t even in neutral but let\u2019s use that as a reference point \u2013 you have jumped from neutral to spectacular, so don\u2019t worry about them! \n\nSuzi: [Laughing] I\u2019m amazed at how fast this time has gone. Many tangible things are happening on the planet indicating great change taking place. I think that what people are looking for is a shift in the financial reality of all of us. Will you speak to that please? \n\nStG: You know I can only speak in limited ways to that. \n\nSuzi: Hmm, I figured. \n\nStG: And so this is not the time or place. And, in fact, I am rather aghast that there are those who in fact claim to speak for me or who claim to know my plan, which as you know is the Mother\u2019s Plan \u2013 it is the Divine Plan. \n\nLet me say this. There have been many final arrangements. Everything has been in place for a long time, and the hiccup for much of the expansions that you are seeking \u2013 and the creation and co-creation of Nova Earth \u2013 has depended upon humans\u2026 your term would be \u201cgetting their act together.\u201d And I would suggest that this is part of my offering of the Violet Flame to those of you who are the tipping point \u2013 who are at the finish line! \n\nAnd so, it is imperative \u2013 imperative! And you know I have often spoken outrageously, vehemently, but when I say \u2018imperative\u2019 and \u2018immediate\u2019, I mean exactly that. So please drink/ jump/dive into the Violet Flame! This is the completion factor. Please do so. \n\nSuzi: Yes, relax and trust and just\u2026 \n\nStG: Swim, dance, play! \n\nSuzi: Yes. I love that! Be happy. Be in joy. \n\nStG: You know, even when we were, shall we say, making a rapid departure from various unpleasant or dangerous situations \u2013 because there were many when I was in form who did not like me; they were jealous and so we would make a hasty departure \u2013 but even in that, we were having fun! \n\nAnd when we got far enough away, we would stop and rest the horses and have them groomed, and sit and have a cup of wine and some bread. And we would laugh because we knew not only were we doing what we were choosing to do \u2013 which, even then, was transforming the planet \u2013 we were doing so to absolutely lay down the groundwork for today. \n\nSo when I say to you: \u201cDearest hearts all over this planet, let\u2019s make a hasty retreat today,\u201d come join me! \n\nSuzi: Yes, yes, indeed. And may I offer my sincere and heartfelt thanks to you and to Sanat Kumara, and of course to all of our friends who are working so hard with us in beautiful partnership. Hurrah! Hurrah for everyone!

The major factors driving the growth of the heat interface unit market include the increasing supportive regulatory and legislative framework, growing use of district heating (DH) solutions, and increased adoption of smart homes in developing nations. \nBrowse 62 market data Tables and 38 Figures spread through 132 Pages and in-depth TOC on 'Heat Interface Unit Market - Global Forecast to 2023' \nhttps://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/heat-interface-unit-market-36022569.html \nEarly buyers will receive 10% customization on reports. \nHeat exchangers are expected to hold the largest market size by 2023 \nHeat exchangers are likely to propel the heat interface unit market growth. In Indirect HIU type, two-plate heat exchangers are used. These heat exchangers keep secondary heating circuits separate from the primary heating circuits. As a result, this type of heat exchangers provide pressure break and better efficiency; hence, the growth of this market can be attributed to the growing demand for indirect HIUs from the residential, commercial, and industrial applications. \nThe market for the commercial application to grow at the highest CAGR during 2017-2023 \nThe heat interface unit market for the commercial application is likely to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. This growth is attributed to the need for better energy efficiency by commercial buildings, institutes, and offices. \nIndirect HIUs to hold a larger share of the heat interface unit market by 2023 \nIndirect HIUs are expected to contribute significantly to the heat interface unit market. Owing to the better operational efficiency, the market size of indirect HIUs is larger than that of direct HIUs. Advantages of using indirect HIUs include the clarity of primary and secondary circuits; primary and secondary circuits can be independently isolated for maintenance; and primary and secondary circuit water can be cleaned and inhibited separately. As a result, there are very few chances of pipe burst and water damage. Hence, indirect HIUs are widely used in all applications such as commercial, residential, and industrial. \nThe heat interface unit market in the Americas to grow at the highest CAGR during 2017-2023 \nThe market in the Americas is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. The high growth can be attributed to the increasing use of energy-efficient products and government initiatives. For instance, the U.S. Green Building Council has initiated to develop an energy-efficient neighborhood by engaging district heating strategies, which will help to reduce energy use and adverse energy-related environmental effects. Through this initiation, the government is planning to incorporate a district heating system for space heating and/or water heating of new buildings (at least two buildings). As a result, at least for 80% of the construction projects, district heating solutions will be provided. These government initiatives are driving the heat interface unit market in the US. \nThe report also profiles the most promising players in this market. The competitive landscape of the market presents an interesting picture where a large number of players have become a force to reckon with. The key players in this market are Armstrong Fluid Technology (Canada), Bosch (UK), Dutypoint (UK), Honeywell (Switzerland), Kingspan (Ireland), GIACOMINI (Italy), Docherty (UK), Caleffi (Italy), ALFA LAVAL (Sweden), Danfoss (Denmark), Reliance Worldwide Corporation (UK) , and Intatec (UK). \nAbout MarketsandMarkets\u2122 \nMarketsandMarkets\u2122 provides quantified B2B research on 30,000 high growth niche opportunities/threats which will impact 70% to 80% of worldwide companies' revenues.

signals after hitting a 3-pointer as Dallas guard Wesley Matthews looks away during the second quarter of Wednesday's 97-90 Boston win at TD Garden. (Winslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports) BOSTON \u2014 Kyrie Irving took over at just the right time on Wednesday night.Again.Irving checked back into the game with 7:23 remaining and scored seven of his 23 points in a span of 3:05 to lead the short-handed Boston Celtics to a 97-90 victory over the Dallas Mavericks.Playing without Jaylen Brown (swollen eye) and Marcus Morris (knee rehab), the Celtics won their fourth straight and improved to 22-4, 8-0 against the Western Conference and 2-0 against the Mavericks.Boston\u2019s Marcus Smart scored his only basket of the game to snap an 85-85 tie with 4:14 remaining and trigger an 8-0 run that broke it open.Irving scored five straight points and then added another basket as the Celtics clinched their latest win with a 12-2 run down the stretch.Al Horford, playing his usual all-around game, had 17 points, eight rebounds, eight assists, three blocks and two steals. Rookie Jayson Tatum also scored 17 and grabbed 10 rebounds. Terry Rozier had 12 points and nine assists, and Shane Larkin, coming off the bench after not playing for five straight games, scored 11 points in 15 minutes.Daniel Theis grabbed 11 rebounds in 17 minutes for Boston.Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks (7-18) with 19 points and seven rebounds while Dirk Nowitzki, perhaps playing in his final game in Boston, had 16 points. Maxi Kleber added 13 points and five blocked shots, and rookie Dennis Smith Jr. had 12 points.The Celtics, who trailed by 10 at halftime, recorded 25 assists on 36 baskets.Without Brown, who woke up with a swollen eye, and Morris, who has been so effective coming off the bench in recent games, the Celtics were missing 27.4 points and 13.6 rebounds per game, causing coach Brad Stevens to go deep into his bench.NOTES: The Mavericks announced C Nerlens Noel, who had a homecoming on this trip, will fly to Cleveland on Thursday and have thumb surgery for a torn ligament near his left thumb Friday. He could be back as soon as mid-January. ... Northeastern Huskies alum J.J. Berea visited his old campus Wednesday to raise money for Paws for Puerto Rico fundraising effort as he continues to try to help his devastated homeland. ... Dallas F Dirk Nowitzki, who may be playing his final season, got an ovation in pregame introductions. ... The Mavs continue their three-game road trip at Milwaukee on Friday, while the Celtics start a three-game trip in San Antonio the same night.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jayson tatum", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mavs irving", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyrie irving", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas f dirk nowitzki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaylen brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "horford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shane larkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wesley matthews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus morris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maxi kleber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nerlens noel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dirk nowitzki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.j. berea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus smart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terry rozier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad stevens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dennis smith jr.", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sports xchange boston", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "irving", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "northeastern huskies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mavs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mavericks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston celtics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mavericks.boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "celtics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston.harrison barnes", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "milwaukee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san antonio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "td garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:48.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b5d689c55dc7fca8b0d9d8a454710a177512397b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8j8mfi7.uiCqDt2Gq_6Jo3xHmqupWLJpPvLdSaFLqmK5EVstaUxXP6CVVYCVYPOkE-", "site_full": "www.discuss.com.hk", "site": "discuss.com.hk", "site_section": "http://www.discuss.com.hk/forumdisplay.php?fid=65", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "MP3,MP4,PMP\u53ca\u8033\u6a5f -

Until they control spending, it will remain the case. You should not put yourself in a position where their \u201crevenue tool\u201d methods affect you needlessly. Year end tax planning advice is available everywhere just now. \nMost of it is trivial because all of the ideas are obvious and presented without context. Everything about tax is contextual. What works for one will fail for another. If you have securities that are presently positioned with a loss, you should dispose of them in December instead of January so you get the tax advantage sooner. If you don\u2019t intend to sell for other reasons, ignore loss harvesting. If you intend to make significant donations, December is better than January because you get the credit sooner. Unless of course, you don\u2019t have enough income to claim it all. Pay expenses that are deductible before the year ends. \nThere are more, but the theme will be the same. They work. In theory. When everything else is equal. \nIt never is. Assess your own tax strategy \nTax loss harvesting is a good idea, but it is Tax 101. The fact that you are resorting to logistics to make your tax return work points to structural failings. You should address them. \nGood tax planning uses structures rather than a year end checklist. Interest paid that is not tax deductible is bad interest. Paying interest may or may not be bad for you. That is a different discussion. It is less bad if it is deductible. In Canada interest is deductible if there is a legal requirement to pay, the amount is reasonable, and the proceeds of the loan were use used to acquire income producing assets. (RRSPs and Tax Free Savings Accounts don\u2019t qualify.) By changing the order of events, sometimes you can make the third condition appear. Use your cash to buy personal assets and borrow to buy investments is a common tactic. Should you incorporate your business? Recent ppgovernment proposals make the question look more problematic than it is. Don\u2019t be deceived. Incorporation is nearly a necessity. There are advantages that require a corporation. Deductible group insurance for yourself. Ability to pay non-deductible expenses with corporate money where the expense relates to business. Life insurance on key people for example. Corporate after tax dollars are 85 cents big while personal after tax dollars look more like 50 cent dollars. Talk to your accountant about what expenses could be put into the corporation instead of thinking about what you take out. Build a pension plan. Personal Pension Plans have been available since 2012. Their earlier variant the Individual Pension Plan has been around since the the early \u201990s. They provide profound advantages over RRSPs. Again contextual. This is not a do it yourself project. There are limits but if you have free cash flow and care about retirement capital, these are not to be missed. They might not turn out to be right for you, but if you are not doing one, you must be able to write down the reasons why you are not. Lethargy is not enough. More on PPPs below. Understand income splitting and limits on it. The government is concerned about this and they only care about things that work for you. Investigate your options. Understand deferred income. A dollar paid 10 years, or better yet 40 years, from now has a present value much lower than the dollar you pay today. Understand your need for capital and accumulate it in ways where the government allows you to defer recognition of the income. Life insurance is a powerful tool. Strategic tax planning requires a long view \nYear to year tax planning is a mistake. The problems you have today are a function of the mistakes you have made in the past. Clean that up and the future will be easier to cope with. A Personal Pension Plan is not news. \nIt does seem though, that some have not read the memo. Here is an old article about it. A Structured Retirement Income Option. To modernize that in the context of the recent government attack on strategic tax planning, you might want to notice that the government dislikes holdcos, trusts, and some income splitting, but seems unconcerned about creating retirement income with a pension plan. They will eventually get it right on the other stuff, and it will be harder for you to use your corporation as your pension. Ergo, avoid their grasping strategy. Optimize your retirement income. \nJ.P. Laporte, CEO at INTEGRIS Pension Management, recommends, \u201cEvery business owner should set up a pension plan. Do the simple stuff first. Don\u2019t complain about teachers retiring early on a full pension, copy them by setting up your own PPP through your business. The law allows it, so why end up paying more tax?\u201d Strategically taxes matter. Here\u2019s how much. \nWhen the Dutch bought Manhattan Island for $24 in 1626, who got the better deal? The Dutch? Seems not. A five-year-old blog article, First We Sell Manhattan , deals with the outcome. \nSeems the Canarsie won big if there were no income taxes and lost big if there were. The same outcome will apply to you.

Legal & General has large businesses in Britain and the United States and concentrates on annuities, which pay a fixed income for life, as well as investment management.\nIt has also been growing in the bulk annuity market, which involves taking on the risk of company defined benefit, or final salary, pension schemes.\nThis is seen as an expanding market as many schemes are in deficit and companies want to offload them.\n\"Our business is now well-positioned and focused on the products and geographies where we see optimum growth and cultural alignment,\" Chief Executive Nigel Wilson said in a trading update.\nA day earlier L&G said it had agreed to sell a book of closed life insurance policies to a unit of Swiss Re for around $870 million (\u00a3650.2 million).\nThe insurer said sales at its retirement business for 2017 to date stood at 6.2 billion pounds ($8.29 billion) supported by strong UK and U.S. institutional pension risk transfer markets, individual annuities and lifetime mortgages.\nIt said annuity sales year to date had generated 4.5 billion pounds of annuity premium, compared to 2 billion in the first half, and that it had doubled its U.S. institutional pension risk transfer business versus 2016.\nAnalysts at KBW, however, said the 4.5 billion pounds sales figure came in below their expectations. Annuity sales stood at 7 billion pounds in 2016, they noted, reiterating their \"underperform\" rating on the stock.\nAt 0910 GMT, shares in L&G were up 0.53 percent at 263.1 pence, compared with a 0.23 percent rise in the FTSE 100 index.\n(Reporting by Clara Denina; editing by Jason Neely)\nStocks treated in this article : Legal & General , Swiss Re", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clara denina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason neely", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigel wilson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "l&g", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kbw", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e8e0905a0bcad089070ef70b948bc347f77e652", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSg_7TRNN2B2DN3f5v2KhuTOmVyaGaTwg4KXm1LoyOW74KYNrW2gywSyKmpCWeSUNV13XNNy4PGWOfF_8JZh.i2JNYYfbdPSv82q5Hv86sU_PRtvfoszh0bw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "[IMAGE] Reddit, I never thought I could do it but today marks my 5 year Anniversary for when I decided to workout in my basement!! : GetMotivated", "title_full": "[IMAGE] Reddit, I never thought I could do it but today marks my 5 year Anniversary for when I decided to workout in my basement!! : GetMotivated", "published": "2017-12-07T07:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 178, "participants_count": 146, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ec4a3b10d6cc0ab12f910f399a71d6adf084b08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSg_7TRNN2B2DN3f5v2KhuTOmVyaGaTwg4KXm1LoyOW74KYNrW2gywSyKmpCWeSUNV13XNNy4PGWOfF_8JZh.i2JNYYfbdPSv82q5Hv86sU_PBAupVFYeEpKP9BB.x9XBlT7YBut88DEg-", "ord_in_thread": 83, "author": "A740", "published": "2017-12-07T10:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Your head turned from a circle to a triangle", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:49.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ccf384eab4de1d2487c5830e1c8b5c71327012c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0mtRKqKdXdGbF0hj0NLzl5", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=taylor", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "taylor News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Bills QB Taylor has bruised tendon in left knee | National Sports | postbulletin.com", "title_full": "Bills QB Taylor has bruised tendon in left knee | National Sports | postbulletin.com : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-12-04T18:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ccf384eab4de1d2487c5830e1c8b5c71327012c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0mtRKqKdXdGbF0hj0NLzl5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Post Bulletin", "published": "2017-12-04T18:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Bills QB Taylor has bruised tendon in left knee | National Sports | postbulletin.com", "text": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y.
