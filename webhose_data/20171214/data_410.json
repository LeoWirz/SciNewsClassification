Since she was not around, I opened the box in her absence and I saw my adoption papers. I never discussed it with my mum because I felt it was something that would hurt her, that was why, it was kept secret from me\u201d \nBefore her discovery however, an older cousin had tried to let her know the fact that she was not a natural child of the Silvas\u2019, \u201cI remembered going out with my cousin and we met a big cousin She introduced me as \u2018my cousin\u2019s daughter and this is Dr Silva\u2019s daughter.\u2019 Then, the older cousin was like, \u2018Dr. Silva ke? Se Doctor Silva bimo ni? (meaning does Dr. Silva have a child?) . Did Dr Silva ever has a child?\u2019 \n\u201cI was so confused and when I got home I told my mum, \u2018I met this lady that says you never had a child.\u2019 My mum froze and she said, \u2018don\u2019t mind them, they are used to rubbish talk.\u2019 \nThe 56 years said before her adoption, she lived in a foster home of the Red Cross in Yaba, Lagos and recalled that her foster parent was Mrs. Desalu. \n\u201cEverybody would be calling me whenever my adopted mum (Dr. Silva)came with cakes and a lot of things during her visit. I went to YWCA Nursery, which was not too far from the Silva\u2019s home in Yaba. I also have memories of moving in with them when they moved to Glover Road in Ikoyi. \nAt the August occasion which had the wife of the Vice President, Mrs Dolapo Osinbajo in attendance, Joke Jacob gave a vivid account of her experience as an adopted child as exclusively reported bykemiashefonlovehaven.com Advertisements Rate this: This information is free, share with friends and family. \u2022 Reach More Than 50 Thousand Nigerians Daily, Advertise With Us, Call or Whatsapp +2347068326095", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joke silva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abimbola silva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "e.a silva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "desalu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babajiro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joke jacob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs dolapo osinbajo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silvas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "red cross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heritage adoption support and advocacy group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "glover road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ikoyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yaba", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:04.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "130cd16477c7d21695f8c45083b473d8745c13ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf7.So8NIENUO4HgXlsCozRdPA1Fd4jC3_0Y25cj1mYdo6QK_htAN2W1ZBjz75DfovFw3e9bfZ7xqGJM0U1Fa5Kc", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Alla-Hotell-I-Toronto.d178314.Reseguide-Stad-Alla-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Alla hotell i Toronto", "title": "Comfort Inn North", "title_full": "Comfort Inn Toronto North (Toronto, Kanada) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-10-13T21:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e71fd1fcd3fb590a3c6586899259f2aa9b035907", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf7.So8NIENUO4HgXlsCozRdPA1Fd4jC3_0Y25cj1mYdo6QK_htAN2W1ZBjz75DfovFw3e9bfZ7xqBmAgmoqfro5SApzWbC4bU7yglBB7gh3SEyr06ShUcJY", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-29T15:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "We ask for a late checkout at 1:00pm the night shift guy who work at the front desk said it was ok that we can check out at 1:00pm, but at 12:00pm we were ask to leave or an additional charge of $25 for every hour.

As for some other companies, they wrongly believe that implementing the ISO 27000 standards is enough to ensure that their information infrastructure is GDPR-compliant. Where these approaches go wrong is that they fail to make the connections between the requirements of the GDPR, the obligation to comply with it, and the operational reality of companies. In fact, companies today are entirely dependent on information systems and processes that capture and utilize data - and notably customer data - at all levels of the organization. To take into account only the 'compliance' aspect of the GDPR issue is to ignore the crucial question of effectiveness or, even worse, to maintain the idea that anything that is compliant is necessarily effective. This is clearly not the case at all: the first safety belts (without the retractor mechanism) were certainly compliant with the regulations, but they were neither practical nor effective\u2026 \nTHE CHOICES OF ARCHITECTURE DETERMINE EFFECTIVENESS \nThe challenge is to ensure that the multiple systems using customer data - e-Commerce, Marketing Automation, CRM, the loyalty system, etc. - are effective in protecting personal data against any use that is improper or contrary to the regulations, both in practice, and over time. Since the information system and business processes are bound to evolve, that implies making IT architecture choices based on principles that have proved themselves to be effective. For example: \n\u2022 Managing the customer repository in a centralized manner makes it possible to have not just a single 'point of truth', but also a sole point for controlling the quality of customer data and the use made of them. Doing things this way is much more effective than trying to master these aspects for each individual application that uses or processes customer data. \n\u2022 Centralizing the management of customer consents/ preferences and setting up a single bridge for all applications to access this information allows companies to ensure that all their outgoing communications comply with the most recent version of each customer's consent for each contact channel. In this way, companies not only do away with having to manage and control consents channel by channel, but they also eliminate the inconsistencies, and even the regulatory breaches, that can result from that. \n\u2022 Segmenting those applications using customer data, according to criteria such as the number of users, level of exposure, sensitivity, etc. makes it possible to create clusters and manage rules no longer at the level of each application, but rather at that of the cluster. When an architecture is built according to these principles, it enhances the effectiveness of IT teams by making it easier to establish common rules and automate processes for controlling data and their uses. It also helps ensure greater productivity and security for the business teams, as they are protected upstream from risks of data misuse under the GDPR and the company's data policy. \nTHE CHALLENGES OF THE 'DATA' DIMENSION BEYOND THE GDPR \nThe applicable regulations, in this case the GDPR, are just one aspect of the management and governance arrangements that need putting in place so as to create value from data - particularly the personal data that have become indispensable for marketing, sales, and the customer relationship. In fact, data is no longer just a resource, but a strategic 'asset' to be approached in its entirety. If a company does not have a strategy for valorizing this asset, if it does not have a clear vision of its data-related needs, and if it has not implemented anything to develop its employees' data culture, nor established governance rules ensuring the availability, security, quality, and traceability of data, then it is building its GDPR compliance arrangements on sand, with no foundations or connection with operational reality. On top of this, it will have to renew its efforts with every regulatory development. If, on the contrary, it gets the Legal Department, DPO, IS Department, and those departments that use customer data all involved in the GDPR project, then it gives itself the wherewithal to build an organization that minimizes the specific risks linked to personal data, allows those data to be securely used for productive purposes, and is effective as much in meeting external auditing requirements, as in satisfying the datarelated needs of the different departments. \nNO ONE TOOL CAN ALONE ENSURE GDPR COMPLIANCE \nRegulatory topics always generate a vast amount of communication by solution providers. They all emphasize that their software is GDPR-compliant, whether it be for solutions for managing repositories, transporting information, or reporting. In 80% of cases, these claims are unreasonable, and it is essential to understand that juxtaposing solutions certified as being 'GDPR-compliant' in no way guarantees that the organization is compliant overall. On the other hand, certain solutions, designed to match the expectations of the CNIL, do provide real support by enabling companies to supply the audit reports required by the regulations. From an operational point of view, the GDPR covers so many tools and processes that it is simply unrealistic, whether it be during the phase of establishing compliance, or equally that of maintaining it thereafter, to hope that one single tool can alone address all needs. Identifying which tools are suitable depends fundamentally on the nature of the data, their use within the organization, and the choices of architecture. Companies that embrace all these dimensions will derive value over the longterm from their investment in compliance. In contrast, those that confine themselves to the normative and administrative aspects are undertaking ineffective expenditure that provides no added value and no long-term benefit for the organization. \n[Attachment] \nABOUT THE AUTHORS \nJean-Bernard Guidt , Sales Manager of Eurobios (2006-2009), then in charge of the Urbanisme & Architecture Competence Center and of the Business & Technology Division of Capgemini (2009-2016), joined Keyrus Management in 2017 as Managing Partner.

The Yellowjackets won 89-66. BRONTE WITTPENN, Gazette staff Save \nBILLINGS -- To borrow from baseball vernacular, Zharon Richmond was swinging for the fences. \nSprinting down the left side of the court late in the game, Richmond gathered a pass from teammate Kendall Denham with just one thought. \n\u201cI saw the 5-8 guy (Montana Tech defender) and I\u2019m thinking dunk,\u201d said the Montana State Billings freshman. \nRichmond got what he wanted, helping the Yellowjackets finish off the Orediggers 89-66 Wednesday night at Alterowitz Gymnasium. \nThe game against Montana Tech was the first of three MSUB home games this week against Frontier Conference teams. The Yellowjackets (6-2) host the University of Providence on Friday and Rocky Mountain College on Saturday. Both are doubleheaders with the women\u2019s team and part of EMC Throwback Weekend. \nSven Jeuschede led the Yellowjackets with a career-high 20 points, 16 in the second half, while Zack Rollins added 16 points, 13 in the second half. Richmond finished with a career-high 15 points, while Denham added 14 points and a career-high seven steals. \nJake Miles paced the Orediggers (5-5) with 17 points. It was an exhibition game for Montana Tech. \nMSUB had to do some lineup shuffling when leading scorer Tyler Green went out early in the first half with an elbow injury. Green, averaging a team-high 15.5 points per game, did not return. The Yellowjackets were already without David Simental because of a knee injury. \n\u201cWe were playing without our two (shooting) guards,\u201d said Yellowjacket head coach Jamie Stevens. \u201cWe had to move some guys around.\u201d \nStevens installed freshman Kobe Terashima at point guard, slid Denham into the shooting guard spot, and had Jeuschede play small forward. \u201cKendall hadn\u2019t played the two guard all season,\u201d Stevens said. \nDenham and Jeuschede, who hails from Roesrath, Germany, each had four 3-pointers, while Terashima had six assists in 26 minutes. \n\u201cSven played well tonight. He\u2019s our best defender,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cWhen he gets his feet set, he showed he\u2019s a good shooter.\u201d \n\"We call Sven the German army knife because he knows all the positions,\" Richmond added. \nBoth Richmond and Terashima were solid, but also had some moments that caused their coach to cringe. \n\u201cI had a couple of weak turnovers in the first half and didn\u2019t play much the rest of the way,\u201d Richmond said. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re in the doghouse. You just have to come back and play harder.\u201d \n\u201cThe freshmen, sometimes they\u2019re still going for the home run play,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cAt the speed of this game, some things you can\u2019t get away with that you did in high school. We tell them sometimes, you have to settle for singles and doubles. And they\u2019re still going to have freshmen plays.\u201d \nMSUB led 42-41 at halftime but outscored the Orediggers 47-25 in the second half. The Yellowjackets helped force 17 second-half turnovers in the final 20 minutes. Montana Tech was limited to 16 field goal attempts in the second half. \n\u201cWe played Yellowjacket basketball,\u201d said Richmond.

He handed me the polythene bag and when I opened it, I saw white clothes and a guinea fowl inside. \nI threw the bag on the floor and asked one of my employees, Dayo, to burn it while also warning Idris to never again visit me with such gifts. \nI collapsed the next day and started bleeding heavily following which I was rushed to Ave Maria Hospital. I was informed the incident was linked to pre-existing concerns with fibroid but I believe it was caused by the diabolical items Idris brought as a supposed gift. \nI had a surgery and remained in the hospital for two months before I was discharged. As soon as I returned to work, Idris showed up at the Empire, saying he heard I was ill but that he came for cash as the bank did not pay him because they could not reach me to confirm the cheque while I was hospitalized. \nI took the cheque from him and gave him cash then bid him goodbye.\u201d \nThis is not the first time Bobrisky and Lawani would be having issues. A few weeks ago, the Cross-Dresser was arrested and after he was released, he revealed that the fashion designer was the one behind his arrest. \nBobrisky has been at loggerheads with Toyin Lawani for a long time now (Pulse) \nSpeaking of his arrest, Bobrisky revealed that the entrepreneur had accused him of stealing her clients. \n\u201cToyin Lawani asked her lawyer to write petitions against me that I worked for her and I\u2019m selling cream to all her customers. Which was a fat lie. I never worked for Toyin. She was my friend. I can\u2019t remember ever working for Toyin or learning how to make cream from her. \nThen she also said I threatened her. Before she wrote petitions against me, she had already threatened me, that she is giving me 7 days to go to the Internet and apologize to her which I said no way because she offended me. I think because I refused to apologize, she got the police involved.\u201d \nThis is round one, you would say, as Bobrisky is sure to come out with guns firing from all cylinders as he is not one to take such accusations lying low.

Design \nIf you were to name a style choice for wireless headphones in 2017, the odds are pretty good that you'd opt for single bud-per-ear because that's not only what Apple's AirPods do, but also numerous other sets including Samsung's Gear IconX, Jabra's Elite Sport and BlueAnt's Pump Air Wireless, to name but a few. \nInstead, Google went with a more traditional cabled design, albeit one with a fairly pretty fabric mesh design for the cable that wraps around the back of your head. \nEach bud rests lightly within your ear, and if your lugs are anything like mine, you may find you have to slide them around a little to get the fit just right. That's a learning curve that exists for most bud-type headphones. \nGoogle also provides a carrying case that, like all the others of its ilk, also acts as a battery pack to charge the Pixel Buds when not in use. It's a small, fabric-covered box that slips easily into your pockets when not in use. Installation \nIn theory, the first time you open up the Pixel Buds and remove them from the casing, they should spring into pairing life and seek out nearby Pixels (or other compatible Android devices), which should then spring up a pairing window in a very similar style to the way Apple's AirPods pair with iOS devices on the same account. \nNote how I said \"in theory\", there? Good, you're paying attention. Despite the instructions insisting this would happen at some point, I never once saw a handy pairing connection screen on any Android phone I tried pairing the Pixel Buds with, which meant that I had to go through the far more laborious process of pairing them manually. \nThis involves tapping a near-invisible button on the inside of the case while the Pixel Buds are still in the case, then finding them via the standard Bluetooth menu on an Android handset. \nThese days you're lucky if you're in an area that doesn't have dozens of Bluetooth devices all happily broadcasting their location, so the wait to properly identify the Pixel Buds can be a lengthy one. \nIf you use multiple Bluetooth devices, that also means you've got to repeat the process each time you need to switch to a new device or back to an old one. Performance \nPairing woes aside, the good side of the Pixel Buds is that, on the whole, they do deliver reasonably solid audio for most tastes. Unlike smaller bud-only type earphones, there's a slight bias towards a more bass-heavy tone, although not one that's likely to feed the appetite of the heaviest bass fan. \nThere's no noise cancellation on offer, and the design of the buds means that they're not even particularly noise isolating. \nHowever, Bluetooth headphones are nothing special and the Pixel Buds are meant to sell themselves on their innate Google-ness, which means that they're equipped with all sorts of ways to work with the Google Assistant. \nAll of the controls for the Pixel Buds are managed via the right ear, where a tap can pause/play music or accept a call, a swipe can adjust volume up or down and a long hold will invoke the actual assistant. This works by listening to your voice as long as you hold your finger to your right ear. \nEven in noisy environments, pickup of my basic requests worked quite well. I can't quite say the same of the general tapping of the right earbud because it's super-sensitive. Expect to start and pause your music multiple times while putting them in your ears unless you're very careful to keep your fingers clear of the right touch zone. \nAssistant access isn't a unique feature for the Pixel Buds, but it does have one feature that only works with the combination of Pixel Buds and the new Pixel phones, and that's the heavily-hyped \"real-time translation\" feature. \nOn the plus side, testing with Japanese, both spoken by myself and taken from audio samples from a Japanese language textbook, the Pixel 2 XL I used for testing translated very well indeed. \nOn the minus side, you might notice I didn't reference the Pixel Buds in that equation, and that's because the \"real time\" translation Google's talking about here actually takes place on Google Translate running on a Pixel/Pixel 2/Pixel 2 XL exclusively. \nThe only benefit you get from the Pixel Buds is that when words are spoken into the translate app, the mechanical translation is spoken to the headphones, rather than broadcast through the phone's speakers. Sure, that's slightly more private than having it broadcast a little louder, but it's hardly groundbreaking. \nHonestly, it feels much more like Google pushing users towards buying Pixels than an attempt to make the Pixel Buds stand out on their own accord. \nWhat precisely is stopping Google from letting Google Translate send audio to the Pixel Buds on other handsets? It can't be processing power because the Pixel 2/XL are running on the exact same hardware as a host of other premium handsets. \nYou're going to appear awkward using Google Translate no matter what you do, so limiting that functionality to its own handsets won't make that much of a difference. Battery life \nGoogle rates the Google Pixel Buds as being good for up to five hours of battery playback time, with a further 24 hours on offer through the charging case. Recharging the case involves plugging it into any standard USB-C adaptor. \nThat five-hour figure is entirely achievable in real-world use. I've managed to get through entire working days with the Pixel Buds in fairly frequent use, and the capacity of the case means that I didn't even have to plug it in all that often. Verdict \nIt's easy to see what Google was pitching for with the Pixel Buds, given that it's now into its second generation of handsets without standard headphone jacks in place. The Pixel Buds are more than just a standard set of Bluetooth headphones and are an illustration of where Google wants to take this kind of smart device. \nIt's just that, unless you're hopelessly in love with everything Google and absolutely must stay on brand, there's not much of a decent argument in favour of the Pixel Buds themselves. There are many examples that offer Google Assistant integration plus fitness features or better audio. \nReal-time translation sounds like a great idea, but the practical application of it shows that Google's really just cheating to keep it a Pixel-exclusive feature. When Google can build Translate directly into the Pixel Buds in a future generation, then it'll really be onto a world-changing technology. \nFor now, the Pixel Buds are OK, but they're not essential. Alternatives \nThe rapid expansion of handsets that lack standard headphone sockets has led to numerous alternatives if what you're after is a lightweight set of Bluetooth headphones. \nIf you're on a strict budget, consider the Flowfonix Buddies or Cygnett Freerun headphones. For those of a more sporty persuasion, the heart rate tracking abilities of the Jabra Elite Sport or Bioconnected HR+ might be a better fit. \nIf you want to confuse folks about your smartphone brand allegiance, you could even opt for a set of Apple's slightly less expensive AirPods .

Millions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. Officials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. Melissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" In what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. The wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. Little flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. Flames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. Across the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. Back in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. Air tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles.

What Makes The German Commerce? \nWith Germany being considered by the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the biggest exporter of goods worldwide, it is no longer surprising why the German Stock Exchange is one of the most important stock exchanges that make or break global commerce. Companies like DO + CO AG enjoy to be the part of German stock exchange. German Stock Exchange \nThe German Stock Exchange consists of eight stock exchanges located throughout Germany. DO + CO AG were included in one of its units as well. The biggest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the FWB Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse, which is owned and operated by Deutsche B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt. These companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange alone represent 80% of the overall market capitalization in Germany. The second largest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Stuttgart Stock Exchange or the B\u00f6rse Stuttgart. Most financial companies are listed here. \nOther major components of the German Stock Exchange include the B\u00f6rse Berlin-Bremen, the B\u00d6AG B\u00f6rsen AG, and the Hamburg Stock Exchange or the Hamburger B\u00f6rse. \nThe B\u00f6rse Berlin-Bremen, which is located in Berlin-Charlottenburg, was established in 2003 from the union of the Berlin Stock Exchange and the B\u00f6rse Bremen. \nMeanwhile, the B\u00d6AG B\u00f6rsen AG, which oversees trade in Hamburg and Hanover, was established in 1999 from the union of the Hamburg Stock Exchange and the Hanover Stock Exchange. Benchmark Index \nThe major index on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is the German Stock Index, commonly known as Deutsche Aktien Xchange 30 (DAX 30), which is the benchmark equity market index in the country. \nDAX 30 tracks the top 30 companies in terms of market capitalization listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Consequently, DAX 30 is a vital indicator of the health of the German economy and investor sentiment as well. Many investors are interested in such DAX companies as DO + CO AG. \nThe companies tracked by DAX 30 are capped at 10% weight in order to meet its provisions. This also prevents index heavyweight that might result from mergers and acquisitions (M&As). \nDAX 30 has two versions: 1) performance index, which is usually quoted; and 2) price index, which is similar to indices quoted in other countries. \nThe index has a base value of 1,000 since December 1987. DAX 30 indices are calculated using XETRA since June 1999. Since 2006, they are being calculated after every second. \nThe movement on DAX 30 is in 0.50 increments. The margin requirement among most brokers is 2% while the minimum trade size is one index. \nDAX 30 had its longest period of glory days around 2003 to 2007. During that time, it had peaked at \u20ac8,105.69. However, after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, DAX 30 had hit \u20ac3,580. \nBeing able to fully recover from the repercussions of the turmoil in the earlier decade, DAX 30 had recorded its all-time high in September 2013 at \u20ac8,736. \nThe performance index, on the other hand, had hit the 12,000 mark in March 2015. DAX 30 had attained its all-time high a month later at 12,374.73 after reaching an intraday high of 12,390.75. Its all-time low had been posted in November 1974 at 372.30. \nBecause of the world-renowned success of the DAX 30, more and more investors are betting on the German equity market. They pay close attention to DO + CO AG shares. Existing investors have long been enjoying meaningful returns. \nMore recent DO + CO AG (FRA:DOQ) news were published by: Startribune.com which released: \u201cMinnesota AG\u2019s lawsuit asks: What did 3M know about PFCs?\u201d on November 26, 2017.

This also means that the property's type needs to be compatible with Objective-C.\nIn addition to exposing the property to Objective-C, you will need to set up your notifications in order for observers to be notified when the property changes. There are three ways to do this:\nFor stored properties, the easiest thing to do is to add the dynamic keyword like so:\n@objc dynamic var foo: String\nThis will allow Cocoa to use Objective-C magic to automagically generate the needed notifications for you, and is usually what you want. However, if you need finer control, you can also write the notification code manually:\n@objc private static let automaticallyNotifiesObserversOfFoo = false @objc var foo: String { willSet { self.willChangeValue(for: \\.foo) } didSet { self.didChangeValue(for: \\.foo) } }\nThe automaticallyNotifiesObserversOf<property name> property is there to signify to the KVC/KVO system that we are handling the notifications ourselves and that Cocoa shouldn't try to generate them for us.\nFinally, if your property is not stored, but rather depends on some other property or properties, you need to implement a keyPathsForValuesAffecting<your property name here> method like so:\n@objc dynamic var foo: Int @objc dynamic var bar: Int @objc private static let keyPathsForValuesAffectingBaz: Set<String> = [ #keyPath(foo), #keyPath(bar) ] @objc var baz: Int { return self.foo + self.bar }\nIn the example above, an observer of the baz property will be notified when the value for foo or the value for bar changes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:09.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b17db0735f5d73744f50389cd0363561a65d9fc5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSYZPmne4ikqfmEsqZFh7u1x63rAS.Mc0LBUIwSqoJY_Fjb5DqPWKVDcsiFNuWaTbR1HqeVZUOZasEns4f9kppHr3gkMzhDFZ1z7oufUrEjyg--", "site_full": "jamesmaster0101.deviantart.com", "site": "deviantart.com", "site_section": "http://backend.deviantart.com/rss.xml?q=+sort:time+meta:all&type=deviation", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "DeviantArt: Newest", "title": "HXR OTP Challenge Day 7 - Cuddling", "title_full": "HXR OTP Challenge Day 7 - Cuddling", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://pre00.deviantart.net/bbc4/th/pre/f/2017/341/1/2/hxr_otp_challenge_day_7___cuddling_by_jamesmaster0101-dbvzs5z.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 264, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b17db0735f5d73744f50389cd0363561a65d9fc5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSYZPmne4ikqfmEsqZFh7u1x63rAS.Mc0LBUIwSqoJY_Fjb5DqPWKVDcsiFNuWaTbR1HqeVZUOZasEns4f9kppHr3gkMzhDFZ1z7oufUrEjyg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "HXR OTP Challenge Day 7 - Cuddling", "text": "Not currently featured in any groups.
