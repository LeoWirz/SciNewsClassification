Forty countries are now part of the campaign. \n\nWhile Sri Lanka has made a commitment to implement a ban on single-use plastic products from the next year, South Africa will step up its beach cleanup programme. \n\nThe four countries announced their support on the last day of the three-day long UN Environment Assembly in this Kenyan capital. \n\n\"For too long, we have treated the ocean as a bottomless dumping ground for plastic, sewage and other waste,\" UN Environment head Erik Solheim said in a statement. \n\n\"The countries supporting Clean Seas are showing the leadership we need in order to end this abuse, and protect the marine resources on which millions depend for their livelihoods.\" \n\nSri Lankan Environment Minister Anura Dissanayake said, \"Sri Lanka is taking bold action to turn the tide on plastics.\" \n\n\"We have banned plastic bags and are now working to reduce the number of plastic bottles in the country. We want to be a green and blue beacon of hope in Asia and do everything we can to keep the seas clean.\" \n\nSri Lanka has made a commitment to implement a ban on single-use plastic products from January 1, 2018, step up the separation and recycling of waste and set the goal of making its ocean and coasts \"pollution-free\" by 2030, a UN Environment spokesperson told IANS. \n\nChile is legislating to extend producer responsibility and encourage recycling and establishing more marine protected areas, while South Africa will step up its beach cleanup programme and prioritise action on tyres, electronic waste, lighting and paper and packaging. \n\nNearly 40 countries from Kenya to Canada and Indonesia to Brazil have joined the #CleanSeas campaign which aims to counter the torrents of plastic trash that are degrading our oceans and endangering the life they sustain. The countries account for more than half of the world's coastline. \n\nLegislation to press companies and citizens to change their wasteful habits is often part of broader government strategies to foster responsible production and consumption -- a key step in the global shift toward sustainable development. \n\nThe flow of pollution means detritus such as drinks bottles and flip-flops -- as well as tiny plastic fragments, including microbeads used in cosmetics -- are concentrating in the oceans and washing up on the most remote shorelines, from deserted Pacific islets to the Arctic Circle. \n\nStudies say humans have already dumped billions of tonnes of plastic, and are adding it to the ocean at a rate of eight million tonnes a year. \n\nAs well as endangering fish, birds and other creatures who mistake it for food or become entangled in it, plastic waste has also entered the human food chain with health consequences that are not yet fully understood. \n\nOn India's strategies and policies to counter marine litter, Sam Barratt, Chief Public Advocacy and Communication with the UN Environment, told IANS: \"We are seeing movement in some states in the country (India) when it comes to clean seas.\" \n\n\"We work very closely with Afroz Shah in eliminating plastic waste from the beaches of Mumbai. What we need to do is to work with industries upstream. When we clean beaches, we are creating awareness, citizens are seeing what's happening on the ground.\" \n\n\"Also, we need to work on the different types of plastic bags initiatives, whether it's people paying a small tax or micron bags which can be reused.

Presumably they had been murdered, as both were covered with blood. They had been missing from their home since Friday. Neighbors had feared they had met with an accident. Sheriff Robert Hurst and Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Edgar Douglas left for the scene immediately. \n50 years ago \nDec. 7, 1967 \n\u2022 Governor Rockefeller said Wednesday that he had been aware of the alleged threat on his life since last Sunday and that he considered the threat the first serious one since becoming governor. \"I might say this is not the first time threats have been made on me and members of my family,\" the governor said at a news conference late Wednesday. But he said he had not changed his mode of living as a result of any of them. He appeared ready to tell newsmen some of the details of the latest threat but backed down on the advice of G. Thomas Eisele, his legal adviser who said Col. Lynn A. Davis, the State Police director, had given no details. \n25 years ago \nDec. 7, 1992 \n\u2022 Dr. Deborah O. Erin, associate director of education and assistant professor in the division of surgical oncology at the Arkansas Cancer Research Center, recently received a national project grant from the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Erin's winning project was based on helping women in Arkansas' Delta region overcome barriers to preventative health care. The program will encourage participation by rural black women in breast cancer education programs and enable them to learn breast self-examination and obtain mammograms. \n10 years ago \nDec. 7, 2007 \n\u2022 Sherwood police should have recorded the conversation between a detective and the judge when the officers sought the judge's permission to make a nighttime entry into the apartment of a convicted sex offender from Texas, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday. Failure to do so led the high court to overturn Eric Wayne Kelley's rape conviction in Pulaski County Circuit Court in December 2006 and subsequent life sentence. The high court's 5-2 decision sent the case back to the lower court. \nMetro on 12/07/2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "may smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lynn a. davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric wayne kelley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edgar douglas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susan g. komen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lige north", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert hurst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary cockrum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g. thomas eisele", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deborah o. erin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockefeller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "arkansas cancer research center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "breast cancer foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pulaski county circuit court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "baxter county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:17.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a56347491abceb6882bcf3de281690f0835446b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p.OPtisgNi8jjagQwql1hW9W_N4aao5.C", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/qst/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/qst/ -

Athens is unhappy over Turkey's upkeep of Byzantine heritage in Istanbul, the former Constantinople, including the Hagia Sophia (in the background), which is officially a museum but has seen an uptick in Muslim worship in the last years OZAN KOSE, AFP/File \nA more recent bone of contention is Greece's refusal so far to extradite eight Turkish officers who fled to its territory last year after allegedly participating in the failed coup against Erdogan. \nThe Greek Supreme Court has blocked the extradition of the officers, and Erdogan lamented that taking the legal route \"takes longer\". \n\"Terrorists, when they are detained in Greece, they should be extradited to Turkey,\" he said. \"Delayed justice is no justice.\" \nTsipras said the Greek state had to respect judicial rulings and promised that the suspects would receive a fair trial. \n- 'A wide divide' - \nThe uneasy relations between Turkey and Greece date back to the creation of the modern Turkish republic out of the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. \nErdogan's Islamic-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002, sought a more pragmatic relationship based on trade and tourism, and Greece became a key backer of the Turkish bid to join the EU. \nAthens is unhappy over Turkey's upkeep of Byzantine heritage in Istanbul, the former Constantinople, including the Hagia Sophia, which is officially a museum but has seen an uptick in Muslim worship in the last few years. \nAnother festering sore is the island of Cyprus, whose northern section is still occupied by Turkish troops following the 1974 invasion in response to an Athens-inspired coup aimed at uniting it with Greece. \nMuch-touted peace talks this year to reunify the island ended without a breakthrough. \nIn a move seen by Turkish commentators as a gesture to Ankara ahead of Erdogan's visit, nine suspected members of the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C), branded a terrorist organisation by Turkey, were charged by a Greek prosecutor last week. \nburs/sjw-jph/js", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john hadoulis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stuart williams", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tzanakopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tsipras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitrios triantaphyllou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitris tzanakopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexis tsipras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sophia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prokopis pavlopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centre for international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european studies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ozan kose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice and development party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anadolu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marxist revolutionary people's liberation party-front", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kadir has university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greek supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thrace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cyprus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aegean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constantinople", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tomb of the unknown soldier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:18.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c21326a3096273ff4aa93ef9585c9aca6019b96", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrAiHOZi.yGQ_o3xsyi3jQXsI5eWMUj.1wIdemvD6jk8BZWz4X1jpwvhMSk91VL.R_otaSBxizs6MUCidJn_PxjSM6fFZ2q6fkmmReRFthuP50gpF6vensCq9e0ZAreCK7eK7xr9BrbviSSJS7.2fz7", "site_full": "swx.com.sg", "site": "swx.com.sg", "site_section": "http://swx.com.sg/forum/trading-pits/singapore-trading-pit", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Singapore Trading Pit -

Thomas Eisele, U.S. District judge (who died Nov. 26), was possessed of courage, wisdom and fairness. Fortunately, his memory and his jurisprudence will live on. \nThough well-known for high-profile rulings, his shining moment of combining fairness with courage came in 1979. In a case that didn't even make the news. \nIn U.S. v. Bailey , 467 F. Supp. 925, he precluded the United States from enforcing a height restriction in a dispute over a breakwater dike on the Arkansas River. \nIt may be the only case in history where the federal government was deemed barred by the doctrine of equitable estoppel from enforcing its own laws against citizens who were technically in violation. \nCalvin and Billy Bailey, brothers, owned Little Rock Marina. When starting the business in the mid-1960s, they applied to the Corps of Engineers for a permit to construct a dike. Informally, without assistance of experts, Calvin estimated the dike needed to be 235 feet in height, measured from the river's \"ordinary high water mark.\" \nThough that height was written on the permit, no emphasis was placed on it. Corps agents were amiable and amicable, encouraging the Baileys' endeavor. \nAs ultimately constructed, the dike was a couple of feet higher, though no one from the Corps ever cited this discrepancy, until 1973. \nThe Baileys received other permits--to pump gas, install power lines, build a moorage for barges, etc . Corps employees regularly interacted with the Baileys; they even rented slips for their own boats. \nThe evidence showed Corps agents visited Little Rock Marina \"innumerable times\" between 1968 and 1973, all without objection to the elevation of the dike. During that time, the Baileys poured heart, soul and capital into the business--detrimentally relying on governmental silence as to any dike-height issue. \nIn 1973, the Corps initiated action to enforce the 235-foot restriction. The Baileys were told this type of encroachment posed navigability issues. The Baileys knew that if the dike were lowered by two feet, their business would be underwater nine months of the year. \nThey'd be sunk. Literally. \nTheir application for an \"after-the-fact\" permit to allow the actual height of their dike was summarily denied, even though they correctly claimed that their structure, per se, had zero measurable impact on navigability. \nThe Corps sued for a mandatory injunction to force compliance with the terms of the permit--the United States of America versus the Bailey Brothers. What a mismatch! \nThe Baileys retained counsel and refused to comply with the demand. O.H. \"Bud\" Storey III was lead counsel for the defense. Having joined Bud's firm a few months earlier, right after law school graduation, I was assigned \"second chair.\" This was my first appearance in federal court. \nWhen all the evidence was in, after a three-day trial, Judge Eisele found, in a brilliant, scholarly opinion, that the Baileys' dike \"does not constitute in any significant way an obstruction to the flow, or to the capacity, of the river, or to navigation.\" \nTherefore, said this courageous and fair jurist, the \"the Corps is indeed estopped to assert a height violation of the permit in question\" because it \"acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and abused its discretion in denying to defendants an after-the-fact permit or a modification of the extant permit incorporating the present height of the dike.\" \nThirty-eight years later, U.S. v. Bailey remains the most memorable case of my career, because of Judge Eisele's courageous and fair handling of the ultimate issue. \nv", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vic fleming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calvin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eisele", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy bailey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o.h. \"bud\" storey iii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g. thomas eisele", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bailey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bailey brothers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the corps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corps of engineers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corps", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "little rock marina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states of america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:18.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "57fb672887fdcd2a035aad2cb02d622fc0263930", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQAmUCNqAUMKZP1Ojs64ZPsc4guk7U_2ndiGBMQCaTy9fDOC7NDi_5qchBAsBB6p9WsoHQ7gJeC.4aVv4t54QCHyHPuj0lA2j8_dzXGSokffjeWrKlXbqufiqUmOuIa8kcPfQpTHaO9siBs7ag5Lj6IQSCumz5nf.I-", "site_full": "inariinariblog.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://inariinariblog.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "For Mercedes W211 E320 E350 E500 Front Air Shocks + Pair Rear Air Springs (4pc) \u2013 Inari", "title": "For Mercedes W211 E320 E350 E500 Front Air Shocks + Pair Rear Air Springs (4pc)", "title_full": "For Mercedes W211 E320 E350 E500 Front Air Shocks + Pair Rear Air Springs (4pc)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "57fb672887fdcd2a035aad2cb02d622fc0263930", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQAmUCNqAUMKZP1Ojs64ZPsc4guk7U_2ndiGBMQCaTy9fDOC7NDi_5qchBAsBB6p9WsoHQ7gJeC.4aVv4t54QCHyHPuj0lA2j8_dzXGSokffjeWrKlXbqufiqUmOuIa8kcPfQpTHaO9siBs7ag5Lj6IQSCumz5nf.I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "inariinariblog", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "For Mercedes W211 E320 E350 E500 Front Air Shocks + Pair Rear Air Springs (4pc)", "text": "For Mercedes W211 E320 E350 E500 Front Air Shocks + Pair Rear Air Springs (4pc) \u2013 Buy \u2013 For Mercedes W211 E320 E350 E500 Front Air Shocks + Pair Rear Air Springs (4pc) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mercedes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mercedes w211 e320 e350 e500 front air shocks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "air springs", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:18.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "becb20e2403f41ede94b621d40367ba94351fe1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJX_deGCi7DGaTpfN9mktSqm2LesdUjNTyXdHuN3Ved5EYlFdFX7cvpyEElq6cizFnxPKYldCjiXCxz.shGyKLQaHMpe5D5o4Sw-", "site_full": "newsflyers.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://newsflyers.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "your news", "title": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 Omegle", "title_full": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 Omegle", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "becb20e2403f41ede94b621d40367ba94351fe1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJX_deGCi7DGaTpfN9mktSqm2LesdUjNTyXdHuN3Ved5EYlFdFX7cvpyEElq6cizFnxPKYldCjiXCxz.shGyKLQaHMpe5D5o4Sw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kalpedal (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 Omegle", "text": "Omegle Direktuppdatering \u22c5 7 december 2017 WEBB best website to find girls on omegle gifs youtube total drama Solusi MRO best website to find girls on omegle gifs youtube total drama [IMG] With dating increasingly taking place online and as more and more dating sites...

The CER prize is given annually to three selected individuals or organizations whose technological innovations are reshaping the world and making it better for all of humanity. The award was given during the Slush Conference in Helsinki by the Conference of European Rabbis to the top innovators from among the more than 400 that applied. \nAccording to the organization\u2019s event organizer Franciska Goldschmidt-Kosman: \u201cThe CER prize for European Internet Entrepreneurs exists to recognize the great work of entrepreneurs who have created a significant technological advancement that has a strong social value and will better the lives of people from all races and religions. Through the prize, the Council awards online platforms for improving the world and helping it make the world a better place.\u201d \nGoldschmidt-Kosman explained that the award, in addition to the financial prize, is a rabbinical stamp of approval on the project stating that this project will change the world. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect anything in return but rather wish to recognize the world of innovation and technology that is helping people. The world is in the hands of those who are innovating and helping shape our worlds tomorrow. We expect our winners to keep doing it is what they do and making tomorrow better than yesterday by creating in the here and now.\u201d \nBeer received the prize in Helsinki, and told the crowd a bit about United Hatzalah\u2019s automated tracking app that dispatches volunteer EMS personnel based on their proximity to the scenes of medical emergencies. The app which is called the Moskowitz LifeCompass has often been referred to as \u201cthe Uber of life-saving\u201d. \u201cWe created our app before smartphones existed based solely on GPS technology,\u201d Beer said. \u201cThrough utilizing the application, we have been successful at dramatically cutting down EMS response time to less than three minutes countrywide and helping to treat more than 2.5 million people in the past decade. The main supporter of this technology, the person who saw this vision through together with us at United Hatzalah was Cherna Moskowitz and her late husband Irving. They supported the development of the technology from its infancy and saw it grow into what it is today, one of the most advanced EMS dispatching systems in the world.\u201d \nWhen asked about how she feels about having her app receive the CER prize Florida resident Cherna Moskowitz replied: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled by it. I am thrilled that United Hatzalah has been able to save so many people with the app. I would have been thrilled if the technology had saved one person, so having saved this many is tremendously rewarding.\u201d \nMoskowitz continued, \u201cI believe that Eli Beer and United Hatzalah deserve the award. They have taken the technology and developed it in a very important way that saves lives when time is critical.\u201d \nSenior Development Advisor with United Hatzalah in Florida Danielle David, who has a close connection with Moskowitz said: \u201cI am so honored to know Mrs. Cherna Moskowitz. Not only is she a great role model with a generous spirit, she is also a true visionary. Thanks to her support and vision, United Hatzalah was able to develop the Moskowitz Lifecompass App and become the first organization in the world to apply advanced GPS tracking technology to the field of EMS. Cherna understood the importance of technological innovation then, and she understands the importance of it today. Cherna has touched and improved the lives of so many people, I\u2019m honored to know her, and I always enjoy my time with her. She\u2019s a true visionary.\u201d \nThe selection of the award was overseen by a committee of four judges, three from CER and a fourth from the Slush Conference leadership. The head of the committee was none other than Rabbi Pinchas Goldschmidt, President of CER and Chief Rabbi of Moscow. Goldschmidt is the first Rabbi outside of western Europe to hold the position of President of CER. \nAmong its other activities, CER defends the religious rights of Jews in Europe, and has become the voice of Judaism for the European continent. It functions as a collegial rabbinical authority, certifying the validity of giyur & kashrus and other rabbinical legal decisions and has helped communities deal with the various issues surrounding maintaining a Jewish life in modern-day Europe in the fields of kashrus, giyur, divorce, Rabbinical recruitment, and many others. \nThe Slush Conference is an entrepreneurial social networking platform that was started by students with the aims to facilitate founder and investor meetings in an effort to build a worldwide startup community. They are currently active in northern Europe as well as China, Japan, and other parts of east-Asia. It is run by youth who want to make a difference in their societies as part of the non-profit initiative that is radically changing the face of the world. \n( YWN \u2013 Israel Desk, Jerusalem/Photo Credit: Moshe Friedman ) Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://theyeshivaworld.advertserve.com/servlet/view/banner/javascript/zone?zid=13&pid=0&resolution=", "https://theyeshivaworld.advertserve.com/servlet/view/banner/javascript/zone?zid=45&pid=0&resolution=", "https://theyeshivaworld.advertserve.com/servlet/view/banner/javascript/html/zone?zid=40&pid=0&refresh=30&refresh_limit=1&resolution="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eli beer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "franciska goldschmidt-kosman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cherna moskowitz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moskowitz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moshe friedman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldschmidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cherna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldschmidt-kosman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danielle david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irving", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moskowitz lifecompass app", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinchas goldschmidt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united hatzalah", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moskowitz lifecompass", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united hatzalah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helsinki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel desk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:19.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef89eb4ec60ba1ddfc9f9183e2d88ae511a51659", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p.OPtisgNi8gljwQjwenbMqUgZsP8dxYf", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/qst/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/qst/ - Quests - 4chan", "title": "Stranded Mech Quest", "title_full": "/qst/ - Stranded Mech Quest - Quests - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T01:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 93, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ddc05a4de02755173d3d151af14a81fc7f18624", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p.OPtisgNi8gljwQjwenbMiNxyk4tcFHJhWXyb4KY3tM-", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "Stranded QM", "published": "2017-12-07T08:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>2125910\n>>2125930\n>>2127435\n>>2127469\n\"Are you alright?\" You ask, trying to make sure the girl is in decent shape...\n\"Better than I've been...\" She replies, groaning.\n\"I'm Captain Alex.

Psshaw!", "text": "By John Brummett  04 a.m. \nThe University of Arkansas was in the process of being played like a cheap fiddle. It was offering a reported $50 million over seven years to make Gus Malzahn the fourth-highest or fifth-highest-paid coach of a college football team. \nI offered one of my more banal social media comments. \nIt was a mere observation about the misplaced priorities of a poor state investing at elite levels in a football coach at a school that probably couldn't do any better year-to-year than 8-4, considering the limitations of its recruiting base stemming from its location and the population pattern around it. \n\"Crimson Tide money for Jayhawk talent\" is how I believe I put it. \nThree general reactions ensued, one purely a matter of athletic prognostication, the second sufficiently valid to put me in my place, and the other ... let's just call it revealing. \nThe athletic prognostication was that Arkansas could do better than 8-4 because Bobby Petrino coached it just a few years ago to 10-2. \nAll right, then. Your highest hope is my aberration. You see the prospect of sustainability and I see a motorcycle crash. \nHere was the valid reaction: What's it to you how much the University of Arkansas pays its football coach? It's not your money. It's not taxpayer money. It doesn't come from academic spending; to the contrary, the Razorback Foundation sends money each year to academic coffers. \nIf boosters with lots of money want to spend it on a college football interest, then that is entirely the business of those boosters with lots of money. \nAll I needed, it seemed, was to shut up and watch the games in high definition on a big screen from the comforts of my easy chair as cheese dip plopped from every third chip to belly. \nI am persuaded. \nIf rich people with millions--whether in Arkansas or College Station, Texas, or Auburn, Ala., or Clemson, S.C., or Columbus, Ohio--want to express themselves through what amounts to ownership in a major sports franchise only nominally associated with a college, pursuing enough victories by the young men performing for that franchise to make these boosters feel vital and gratified and equal to, or even occasionally superior to, counterparts in Mississippi and Louisiana and Tennessee--if not so much Alabama--then I should accept the whispered words of wisdom to let it be. \nThe greater issue of abusing young men's dreams of professional wealth by paying them nothing to risk major brain injury while the guy sending them out to take that risk gets millions, because that's what a market based on TV and rich boosterism demands--that's not an Arkansas issue. \nIt's an American issue. It's a human issue. It's a moral disgrace. \nThe third reaction, the one I call revealing, was that Arkansas is not a poor state. \nWhy, it has millionaires galore, from Jerry Jones and his Cowboy empire to Wal-Mart to Tyson Foods, I was advised. \nTwo things about that: \nOne is that a smattering of millionaires does not a state make, though it represents prevalent Republican thought that a few millionaires make life better for everyone who gets trickled on below. \nThe second is that we have evolved generationally and regionally into self-identification less by full states, which are typically varied, into what some call city-states, or metropolitan statistical regions. \nIf you are a young professional adult sprung from somewhere else, settled for your professional life in the Northwest Arkansas region from Fayetteville through Bentonville, then you behold wealth all around, from a couple of the world's richest businesses to one of the world's great art museums. There's an amphitheater, a performing arts center, great hotels and restaurants and funky crepes joints. \nThere's plenty of money evident in plain sight to compete with Tuscaloosa or Auburn or Athens or Baton Rouge--or anywhere--for a football coach or on any other obsession. \nFor an antique newspaper guy in Little Rock--a place you don't know but deem a Chicago-style killing field--to put on Twitter that you're living in a poor state ... why, you never heard such nonsense. \nDermott? Pine Bluff? Marianna? Where are those? \nYou live in a commercial hub surrounded by majestic hills to the south, eastern Oklahoma to the west and the quintessentially Midwestern environs of Kansas and Missouri to the north. \nIt's its own place, possessed of plenty of money for a rich football coach who will toil amid great financial wealth, though not so much player-recruitment wealth--nestled as this coach will be in the mid-American hills remote from the major urban population centers producing greater numbers of athletes who'll tend to favor the rosters of conference opponents who'll keep his upside at ... well, someone said 8-4. \nBut that'll get the rich boosters eight autumnal validations as well as the holiday-season trip to a bowl game that they paid for. \nv", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john brummett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gus malzahn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bobby petrino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dermott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marianna", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jayhawk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "razorback foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyson foods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal-mart", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "s.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fayetteville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baton rouge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ala.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "college station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northwest arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bentonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tuscaloosa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "little rock", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:19.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "909b50c808cac9a2a65a14ed809995b73225d003", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21SkD8hd1OJaKon2wxx0qCQmUV.jV.3nwm6_eKuVogkkEvdlUzXHlIa2UtfnlZgpEhBTuXPutNPqsy_p20u1FMIz", "site_full": "artbyserena.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://artbyserena.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Serena Lewis", "title": "Scribble Picnic - Finland", "title_full": "Scribble Picnic - Finland", "published": "2017-12-07T02:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2e51e3aa6324a31ffd3d36d46ce02fd317e933da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21SkD8hd1OJaKon2wxx0qCQmUV.jV.3nwm6_eKuVogkkEvdlUzXHlIa2UtfnlZgpEhBTuXPutNPqs9rysi36wG2FmaVrZ7zx7Nc-", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "Serena Lewis", "published": "2017-12-07T09:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thanks, Alexandra! xx I always feel a little guilty posting on a Thursday here because the gadget closes on a Wednesday in the States.

The Republican-led House passed a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \nThe House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines \u2013 a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. \nOn a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty \u2014 who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting \u2013 said the bill would undermine states' rights, \"hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,\" according to The Associated Press. \nThe NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a \"watershed\" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure \"all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.\" \nIn the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats.

The party says the accusations are politically motivated. \nHis trial got under way at Sincan prison complex in Ankara province, an HDP official told AFP, adding Demirtas was not present for the hearing. \nThe MP is being held in prison in the northwestern region of Edirne. The party has previously accused the justice ministry of preventing any court appearances by Demirtas. \nPrior to his arrest, Demirtas was considered one of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's major rivals, with oratory skills matching the firebrand Turkish head of state. \nHe led his party to success in June 2015 polls and surpassed the 10 percent threshold needed to enter parliament through winning not just support from Kurds but also liberals and the Turkish left. He repeated the success in snap polls of November of that year but with fewer MPs. \nA dozen HDP MPs were detained at the same time as him but now nine remain in prison including Demirtas and former co-chair Figen Yuksekdag.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "demirtas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "figen yuksekdag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "selahattin demirtas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "afp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pkk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdistan workers' party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hdp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peoples' democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sincan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edirne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:20.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef89eb4ec60ba1ddfc9f9183e2d88ae511a51659", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p.OPtisgNi8gljwQjwenbMqUgZsP8dxYf", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/qst/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/qst/ - Quests - 4chan", "title": "Stranded Mech Quest", "title_full": "/qst/ - Stranded Mech Quest - Quests - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T01:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 93, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba6e85655891ce0c4f8ac3d19f1f98208318b387", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p.OPtisgNi8gljwQjwenbMiNxyk4tcFHJI7tn7stRAcE-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T09:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>2127622\n\"Nothing,there are no laws against being a witch according to my governments laws; of which I am a just a humble enforcer.

First, on Sunday, came Alan Milburn and the entire social mobility team\u2019s resignation , stating the government lacks \u201cthe necessary bandwidth to ensure that the rhetoric of healing social division is matched with reality\u201d. Then the next morning the Joseph Rowntree Foundation\u2019s publication of research finding almost 400,000 more children have been plunged into poverty in the past four years. To put it in perspective, that means Theresa May and her predecessors have overseen the first sustained increases in child poverty in this country for 20 years.\nTheresa May faces new crisis after mass walkout over social policy Read more\nWhether the measure is social mobility or standards of living \u2013 after years of social security cuts coinciding with stagnant wages and rising costs \u2013 there is the lurking feeling that we are watching hard-won progress being thrown away. In the mid-1990s, about a third of children were living in families classed as \u201clacking the resources for their minimum needs\u201d until Labour governments and the introduction of tax credits (as well as higher employment) saw the rate fall to 27% in 2011-12 .\nBy 2016, David Cameron\u2019s austerity agenda had seen child poverty rates shoot up to 30%. Similarly, just before its mass resignations, the latest annual report by the government\u2019s social mobility watchdog warned that Britain is in a spiral of \u201cever-growing division\u201d with rural, coastal and former industrial areas left with dwindling prospects. The region I grew up in, the east Midlands, has the accolade of taking 10 of the top 20 spots for the worst regions for social mobility .\nWith Theresa May\u2019s vow to place fairness and social justice at the heart of her premiership perhaps ringing in his ears, Milburn\u2019s words on Sunday were scathing: \u201cThe worst position in politics is to set out a proposition that you\u2019re going to heal social divisions and then do nothing about it.\u201d He\u2019s right \u2013 but actually, I think it\u2019s much worse. It isn\u2019t simply that the Conservatives have done nothing to help working-class children\u2019s life chances or wellbeing, but that they\u2019re introducing policies that are actively making them worse.\nLook at anti-welfare measures like cutting \u201cin-work\u201d benefits or freezing housing and children\u2019s benefits. Or an education system that\u2019s scrapped education maintenance grants while stripping school budgets to the extent that teachers are unable to afford paper for their pupils . Not to mention the closure of local youth clubs and children\u2019s centres ; research from Barnardo\u2019s this week finds funding to early-years children\u2019s services has been cut by almost 50% in some areas since 2010 .\nResearch this week finds funding to early-years children\u2019s services has been cut by almost 50% in some areas since 2010\nThese measures don\u2019t simply represent the death knell of serious attempts at social mobility in this country; they spread childhood deprivation.\nSocial mobility , inequality, and absolute income are not unrelated issues \u2013 we know, for instance, that reducing inequality helps improve social mobility \u2013 but as we respond to the Conservative\u2019s failings, it would be a mistake to put the focus on addressing social mobility specifically.\nSocial mobility is in many ways an easy political agenda \u2013 one that even rightwing politicians are happy to articulate. As a goal it speaks to a very human feeling: a desire for your kids to do that bit better than ourselves. But at its core, it\u2019s a deeply conservative idea: a few \u201cdeserving\u201d individuals are helped to make their way up the class system, nothing is done about the conditions that those left behind are expected to live in.\nThe crime of recent years isn\u2019t merely that a handful of individuals are finding it harder to move up to elite jobs, it\u2019s that there are now millions of families who are struggling to even eat, stay warm, and keep a roof over their heads. And for each of them, the chance of a future with a decent job, secure housing, and good health are increasingly out of reach.\nChild poverty in Britain 'set to soar to new record' Read more\nOver the next few years the number of children in poverty is due to soar to a record 5.2 million \u2013 that\u2019s an increase of more than a million . As the date for Brexit looms, any sort of domestic agenda is increasingly slipping from view, but addressing this should be a priority.\nIt isn\u2019t a radical agenda to argue every family should have a safe, warm home and a decent income. As the Rowntree research outlines, an affordable housing programme, lifting the benefit freeze, and providing more adult education are just some practical, tangible ways a government could create change. The Conservatives are undoing decades of progress but there\u2019s one silver lining: the very fact that gains were made before shows, once the Tories lose power, they can be made again.\nTopics Children Hardworking Britain Social mobility Poverty Conservatives Theresa May Social exclusion comment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frances ryan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "david cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan milburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barnardo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joseph rowntree foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east midlands", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:21.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4358855aa2d9bfadd19173ffa0996e537a6552e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg915p_xRKgQTgWACAA9mHwv7_RD4qYp_duI43a05WV6SPpbsZI4psrl1t8y_iWRkvLwajnu.wOTtEmZ9dlu6oso1y6OWsmInqJTRTGvARWp65cICv8Lbn0N", "site_full": "wabe.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net", "site": "publicbroadcasting.net", "site_section": "http://wabe.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "China Says Indian Drone Crashed In Its Territory", "title_full": "China Says Indian Drone Crashed In Its Territory", "published": "2017-12-07T09:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201712/569030027.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71204, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4358855aa2d9bfadd19173ffa0996e537a6552e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg915p_xRKgQTgWACAA9mHwv7_RD4qYp_duI43a05WV6SPpbsZI4psrl1t8y_iWRkvLwajnu.wOTtEmZ9dlu6oso1y6OWsmInqJTRTGvARWp65cICv8Lbn0N", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Neuman", "published": "2017-12-07T09:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "China Says Indian Drone Crashed In Its Territory", "text": "China Says Indian Drone Crashed In Its Territory By Scott Neuman \u2022 8 hours ago Indian army drone flies near the site of a gunbattle between Indian government forces and suspected militants in Padgampora village of Pulwama, south of Srinagar, in March. Tauseef Mustafa / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 10:34 am \nMonths after a tense standoff between China and India along their Himalayan border, Beijing on Thursday expressed anger over what it says was an Indian drone that crashed inside its territory. \n\"This action by India violated China's territorial sovereignty. We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Xinhua cited Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China's western battle zone command, as saying. \nChina said the drone crashed in \"recent days\" but didn't say where. Zhang said his country would defend its national sovereignty against such intrusions. \nHe said China's border defense forces conducted \"an inspection of the device,\" but didn't elaborate. \nIndia has not responded to the charge. \nAlthough the two countries have made moves toward warmer relations in recent years, they also have a long history of border tensions. In 1962, they fought a brief, but inconclusive border conflict. They have also had ongoing disputes over sovereignty in other border areas, notably Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region that straddles their territorial demarcation in the west. \nThe two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive because of his calls for Tibetan independence. \nStarting in June this year, tensions flared again over a disputed region called the Doklam Plateau that borders China, Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. \nAs NPR's Julie McCarthy reported from New Delhi in July , the problems stemmed from China's construction of a road in Doklam Plateau. \"Not far from the plateau lies the narrow passage that connects India's northeast states with the rest of the country \u2014 a strategic link called the Siliguri Corridor but more commonly known as the \"Chicken's Neck. \" Any possibility of China being able to sever that \"neck\" unnerves India. \nAs late as August, India had rushed troops to Doklam Plateau and although an immediate conflict was avoided, heated rhetoric on both sides has soured relations. \nIn September, India's army chief said that his country \"could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war,\" according to The Hindustan Times. \nAnd in November, China took umbrage at Indian President Ram Nath Kovind's visit to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, Reuters reports.

The i-th element of the array denotes the angle of one piece. Our task is to make two continuous parts from these pieces so that the difference between angles of these two parts is minimum. \nExamples: Input : arr[] = {90, 90, 90, 90} Output : 0 In this example, we can take 1 and 2 pieces and 3 and 4 pieces. Then the answer is |(90 + 90) - (90 + 90)| = 0. Input : arr[] = {170, 30, 150, 10} Output : 0 In this example, we can take 1 and 4, and 2 and 3 pieces. So the answer is |(170 + 10) - (30 + 150)| = 0. Input : arr[] = {100, 100, 160} Ouput : 40 Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution. \nWe can notice that if one of the part is continuous then all the remaining pieces also form a continuous part. If angle of the first part is equal to x then difference between angles of first and second parts is |x \u2013 (360 \u2013 x)| = |2 * x \u2013 360| = 2 * |x \u2013 180|.

It took me a long time to get comfortable doing that because perfectionist. True story: I have pages torn out of journals because I didn't like the way I wrote something and my acutal 'journaling Bible' has some lined side margins missing because it didn't look right. Yes, I know I have issues. \nBut once I found a pen that makes my writing look neater (truly, pens make ALL the difference in the world), I started to get more relaxed. I don't write extensive notes. A Strong's number here and there, a question, a comment, a date, a title and page number from a book. Nothing major, just enough of a reminder. \nOf all the things I have written in the past year the most challenging is next to Matthew 11:20-24 . My question in the margin: How many miracles must you see before you turn and repent? I know, light-hearted. \nHave I seen someone lame walk? Figuratively. Have I seen the dead rise? Figuratively. Have I seen waters part? Figuratively. Have I seen the blind see? Figuratively. You get the point. \nWhen we see the word miracle we tend to think of the bigger things, the more newsworthy, Hollywood adapted movie things. And while those things are great, if that's all we classify as a miracle, we are missing some pretty huge stuff in our every day lives.  \nIn Deuteronomy 10:21, Moses says of God: \"He is the one you praise; He is your God, who performed for you those great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes.\" (emphasis mine) Nothing about the things we've witnessed are accidental, because of a bribe, or because God shows partiality. They were all for our benefit, to see and believe, to turn and repent. Question is, are we aware enough to recognize them. \nWhen we think about the fact that Jesus left heaven to come to earth, the pat answer to why is to rescue us from the hand of our enemies and enable us to serve Him without fear in holiness and righteousness. (Luke 1:74-75) But if we dig further into His mission, we can see evidence of miracles overflowing every step of the way. \nTo seek and save the lost relative or friend we didn't think would ever be receptive to Jesus. \nTo heal the sick loved one that was so deep in addiction that is now free from bondage. \nTo reveal the thoughts of our hearts so that we could turn to God in untold and unprecedented ways. \nTo forgive us when we fall flat on our face for the hundredth time and show us grace to try again. \nTo calm the storm that rages in our heart over the unexpected phone call that rocked our world. \nTo challenge our motives to do things for the right reasons even though we started out with the wrong ones. \nClearly, it would be easy to go on and on. \nAs we inch ever closer to Christmas Day and the miracle of the birth of Christ to become Immanuel, God with us, let's take the time to think about all the miracles we have seen Him perform since last Christmas. They weren't done out of boredom or just to display His power to feed His ego, they were done so that we would see them, praise Him, and lead others straight to His heart. \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "immanuel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moses", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:21.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b4bfe16e38629a8bcdbd27bcf3f410ecceff5050", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMtVlCLf2W93PeH1GBnA2veJpF9ARR85NRBw7W1EiTbniOCuu8AxTLXzmPpHB5RgR2chsigvRxU23H2R6dQf9JHLymh.b_Z8nD4-", "site_full": "valleypatriot.com", "site": "valleypatriot.com", "site_section": "http://valleypatriot.com/comments/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Comments for The Valley Patriot", "title": "Comment on Health Care Rationing and the Politics of Hepatitis C by Julian Rush", "title_full": "Comment on Health Care Rationing and the Politics of Hepatitis C by Julian Rush", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://valleypatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Hepatitis-C-5065.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b4bfe16e38629a8bcdbd27bcf3f410ecceff5050", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMtVlCLf2W93PeH1GBnA2veJpF9ARR85NRBw7W1EiTbniOCuu8AxTLXzmPpHB5RgR2chsigvRxU23H2R6dQf9JHLymh.b_Z8nD4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Julian Rush", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Comment on Health Care Rationing and the Politics of Hepatitis C by Julian Rush", "text": "Health Care Rationing and the Politics of Hepatitis C \nBy: Dr. Frank MacMillan, MD \nBack in April, I wrote about anticipated new treatments for Hepatitis C viral infection. The first all-oral treatment was FDA approved on October 10, with additional new medications expected before this year\u2019s end. These new medications not only treat, but they actually cure Hepatitis C in almost everyone who takes them as directed, often in as little as 8-12 weeks. This should be cause for celebration. But not everyone is celebrating. \nhis medicine is very expensive, and I will say with certainty that the insurance industry is looking at ways to deny or delay access to this disease ending and life saving treatment. Expensive, overpriced, price-gouging are words often heard in these discussions. While there is no doubt that the medication is expensive at $1000/day, the infection is cured at a cost of $56,000 to $180,000 depending on how advanced the disease is. As shocking as those numbers sound, they are hardly out of range for cancer care, joint replacement, organ transplant, major surgery or a major hospitalization in the intensive care unit. \nConsider that there is a stigma associated with Hepatitis C infection. Hepatitis C is a blood born virus infection. Common ways the infection is acquired is by blood transfusion, tattoo, intravenous drug use, and nasal cocaine use. Many people do not recall behaviors that could have put them at risk. For this reason, the US Preventative Health Services Task Force now recommends universal screening of all adults born between 1945 and 1965. In some cases that I see, a long ago lapse in judgment occurring in their teens or twenties has left a lifelong reminder of that indiscretion and serious health consequences. There is a feeling among some that those who have the infection somehow deserve it and do not deserve care or our concern. This was also exactly the situation in the early days of the HIV epidemic. Very quickly political pressure built to de-stigmatize HIV infection. Highly effective treatments were soon available that changed the disease from a death sentence to a chronic condition that can be treated and lived with. These HIV medications are also not cheap, and it is necessary to remain on them for life. The cost adds up over time. With Hepatitis C treatment, there is no need for maintenance treatment. It\u2019s a \u201cone and done.\u201d Could it be because of the stigma associated with Hepatitis C infection, that the insurance companies think they can get away with rationing access? I don\u2019t know for certain, but I have concerns. \nThe treatments may be new, but the people who I take care of have had the disease for many years if not decades. They have been waiting patiently for effective and tolerable treatments. The doctors who care for patients with Hepatitis C are also working tirelessly on advocacy for those who suffer. Patients who need treatment should not quietly accept denials of payment by their insurance companies. They should appeal at all levels, write letters, work with their employee benefits managers, and pull all political levers to be sure that no one who has been paying insurance premiums for health coverage is denied effective treatment because of prejudice or stigma related to this illness. \nOur country spends a lot of money on health care services; some of it is of questionable benefit. Where we spend our money is also in part driven by political considerations. Perhaps people with Hepatitis C are considered insufficiently deserving of our attention. Unfortunately, that is the attitude of some folks. The reality is that people from all walks of life get Hepatitis C, and they are no better or worse than the rest of us. When so called non-profit insurance companies, who have no problem spending millions of dollars on executive compensation, luxury boxes at sporting venues and political lobbying, can get away with denying or delaying effective treatment because of perception of cost and the prevailing stigma associated with Hepatitis C infection, they deserve to be called out on their bad behavior. Curing Hepatitis C stops the spread of the infection, relieves suffering, and restores health. For me, that\u2019s the whole reason we do what we do. It\u2019s money spent once, and money well spent. \nDr. MacMillan specializes in Gastroenterology and Liver disease and is a member of the North Andover Board of Health.

Chances are good that someone will have the perfect recommendation to complement your meal. Tell them what you are having and give them a general price range, and you should find yourself with a great bottle to go with the meal.\nIf you are not too familiar with wine, make sure to shop at a wine store.

With such a vast number of different wines out there, you want to expose yourself to as many wines as possible before committing to a case.

Many times people\u2019s tastes change over time, which means that you may not like this particular wine forever. Buying it in bulk may have you stuck with a lot of wine that you no longer like.\nMany different factors go into the pricing behind a great bottle of wine. Your favorite locations, such as Spain may drive a hard bargain for a great selection, but there are alternatives.

However, wine is best served cold before a special occasion. Store the bottle of wine in a bucket filled with ice. This will chill the bottle in thirty minutes and it will be ready for serving.\nNo matter, how much you enjoy a particular type of wine, do not purchase a whole case of it.

This could leave you with a supply of wine in storage that you no longer care for.\nOnce you get the hang of it, selecting wine is a pretty easy process.

Chuck Grassley (R-IA) speaks to reporters after the weekly Republican caucus policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol in Washington (Thomson Reuters) \nTwo of the three congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election are being gripped by partisan infighting. \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee is split as to the focus of its investigation. \nThe House Intelligence Committee could release two separate reports \u2014 one from Democrats and one from Republicans. The Senate Judiciary and House Intelligence Committees, two of the three major congressional panels investigating Russia\u2019s election interference, appear to have resigned themselves to the reality that their probes will be conducted according to the partisan interests of their members. \nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has recently begun sending out a flurry of letters to witnesses requesting new documents and interviews related to potential collusion between President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign team and Russia. \nThe committee\u2019s Republican chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley, has not signed off on the letters, all of which have been made public by the panel\u2019s Democrats. Nor did Feinstein sign off on 13 letters Grassley sent in October seeking more information about FBI agent Peter Strzok and an informant in the Uranium One probe, among others. \nA spokesperson for Feinstein downplayed the significance of the chairman and ranking member not signing off on each other\u2019s witness letters. \n\u201cSome letters are from just the chairman, some from just the ranking member and some from both,\u201d said the spokesperson, Tom Mentzer. \u201cThe goal is to receive the information necessary for the investigation, and that\u2019s why the letters are sent out.\u201d \nBut the competing letters seem like a manifestation of the new normal Feinstein described in October. \n\u201cWe have decided that each side is going to take a course,\u201d she said, referring to the committee\u2019s Democrats and Republicans. \n\u201cOur focus is obstruction of justice and whether there was cooperation/collusion between the Trump administration and Russia,\u201d she said. \nFeinstein reiterated her interest in pursuing an obstruction inquiry on Sunday. \n\u201cI think what we\u2019re beginning to see is the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice,\u201d she told Meet The Press, one day after Trump tweeted a potentially incriminating statement about his firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \n\u2018We\u2019re going to have to find a way to deal with it\u2019 \nSenator Dianne Feinstein (Thomson Reuters) \nThe tension has not waned: Following a recent flurry of letters to witnesses ranging from Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner to Russian gun rights activist Maria Butina, Feinstein said on Monday that she thinks there\u2019s a \u201csubtle\u201d effort on Grassley\u2019s part \u201cnot to go deeply.\u201d \n\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized it before,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cBut I realize it now. And we\u2019re going to have to find a way to deal with it.\u201d \nCommittee Republicans, meanwhile, have signaled a desire to leave the more aggressive investigative work to special counsel Robert Mueller. Following Mueller\u2019s indictments of Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates, Sen. John Cornyn said the \u201cspecial counsel\u2019s got his own responsibilities and it doesn\u2019t involve us.\u201d \n\u201cThe Judiciary Committee conducts government oversight, not criminal investigations,\u201d a committee spokesperson said on Tuesday. \n\u201cChairman Grassley\u2019s inquiry is looking at decisions made by Justice Department and the FBI during politically charged investigations spanning two administrations,\u201d said the spokesperson, Taylor Foy. \u201cThe American people deserve to know whether political influence has clouded the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency, whether it be investigations into Republicans or Democrats.\u201d \nFoy pointed to recent reports that Strzok, the FBI agent who served as a top investigator on both the Hillary Clinton email probe and on Mueller\u2019s Russia probe, \u201chad expressed pro-Clinton and anti-Trump views.\u201d \n\u201cThis is exactly the type of improper political influence that the Judiciary Committee should be concerned about,\u201d Foy said, adding that Feinstein had not signed Grassley\u2019s letters to the FBI seeking \u201crelevant documents\u201d about Strzok. \nThe House is still fighting \nHouse Intelligence Committee Chair Rep. Devin Nunes (Thomson Reuters) \nThe House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russia-related matters, meanwhile, has devolved so hopelessly into partisan infighting that its findings will likely be released in two separate reports, according to a source familiar with the probe. \nDemocratic Rep. Mike Quigley, who sits on the committee, hinted at that possibility in September. \n\u201cIt\u2019s conceivable that Republicans and Democrats would have separate reports\u201d if they issued their findings of the investigation today, Quigley said at the time. \n\u201cAnd that\u2019s very unfortunate,\u201d he added. \u201cI was old enough to understand \u2014 and watch \u2014 Watergate. This is so much more important. Because I believe that if you had seen what I have seen, you\u2019d want me to go full throttle. Anything that makes the analysis of this by Congress, or any other investigators, inconsistent in any way \u2026 reduces how important this is.\u201d \nMuch, but not all, of the House panel\u2019s infighting has stemmed from the behavior of its chairman, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes. Democrats feel like Nunes has \u201cgone rogue\u201d with his subpoenas, according to several committee sources. They say he has antagonized the Justice Department and intelligence community at a moment when cooperation should be prioritized. \nNunes stepped aside from the Russia investigation in early April following his decision to brief Trump and the press on classified intelligence \u2014 without telling his fellow committee members. \nBut he quickly began conducting his own investigation into \u201cunmaskings\u201d by the Obama administration, and is threatening to hold Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Chris Wray in contempt of Congress if they do not respond to a subpoena for documents relating to the infamous dossier alleging ties between Trump\u2019s campaign team and Russia. \nDemocratic Rep. Eric Swalwell told MSNBC on Sunday that voluntary interviews, absent a subpoena, were not helpful to the committee because witnesses who haven\u2019t been compelled to testify have generally opted to end their sessions early. He said in October that the committee\u2019s final report could \u201chave an asterisk on it\u201d if House Speaker Paul Ryan does not \u201cintervene\u201d to ensure Nunes\u2019\u201cfingerprints are not on our report.\u201d \nA spokesman for Nunes did not return a request for comment. Quigley said Nunes was \u201cnot the only\u201d Republican on the committee mounting \u201cobstacles\u201d to the investigation. \n\u201cI\u2019m there as we\u2019re questioning witnesses \u2014 and someday these transcripts will be made public,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of you are going to say, \u2018What the hell are they doing?\u2019 They seem to be taking over the role of a second attorney for the witness testifying before us. And it\u2019s conflicting, and it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s difficult enough as it is to do this job when you\u2019re running into all of these obstacles.\u201d \nThe committee\u2019s ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff, told CNN on Tuesday that Republicans had refused to subpoena Deutsche Bank for the Trump Organization\u2019s financial records. \nHe called it a \u201ctroubling double-standard,\u201d according to CNN reporter Manu Raju, because Nunes had made obtaining the bank records of opposition research firm Fusion GPS a major priority in the fall.

There are a number of signs and symptoms women with PCOS can have. However, not every woman with PCOS will have every symptom, and each woman will be quite individual in her experience. Criteria for a diagnosis of PCOS A diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome can be made when at least two out of three of the following criteria are met: The ovaries are \"polycystic\" because: 12 or more follicles are visible on one ovary or the size of one or both ovaries is increased There are: high levels of 'male' hormones (androgens) in the blood (hyperandrogenism) symptoms suggesting an excess of androgens such as: excess hair growth acne There is menstrual dysfunction such as: lack of periods or menses (menstrual flow) menstrual irregularity lack of ovulation (where an egg is released) With these criteria, a woman can be diagnosed with PCOS even if she has regular periods or normal androgen levels. This means women with PCOS can experience very different types of symptoms. To make a correct diagnosis of PCOS a number of other conditions that could cause similar symptoms of menstrual dysfunction need to be ruled out. When to see your doctor If you think you may have PCOS, you need to see your doctor. Below are some of the tests your doctor may recommend to test for PCOS and to exclude other conditions. Not all tests are necessary for every woman. Medical history & examination As part of the diagnosis, your doctor will review your medical history and assess your physical symptoms, weight and BMI (body mass index). Ultrasound An ultrasound of the uterus, ovaries and the pelvis can be carried out to identify whether there are any cysts on your ovaries and whether an ovary is enlarged. A transvaginal ultrasound is a painless test with no radiation. It uses a pen\u2013shaped probe with an ultrasound sensor on the tip, which is inserted into the vagina. This produces a much clearer picture than an abdominal ultrasound. Transvaginal ultrasounds are only performed on women who have been sexually active, otherwise an abdominal scan is done where the ovaries are viewed from the outside through the stomach wall. Blood tests Hormonal blood tests Blood tests are used to assess the levels of androgens in your body. Blood tests for androgens (such as testosterone) and free androgen index (FAI) are the best tests for diagnosing whether you have hyperandrogenism (high androgen levels). Other blood tests that can be useful in identifying high androgen levels include: sex hormone binding\u2013globulin (SHBG) dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) androstenedione Blood tests may also be done to assess the levels of other reproductive hormones in your body as these may affect your menstruation. These may include testing your levels of: oestradiol (oestrogen) follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) luteinizing hormone (LH) Blood tests to exclude other conditions that have similar symptoms to PCOS may measure the levels of: thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) prolactin hormones related to adrenal function (glands found above the kidney), e.g. 17-hydroxyprogesterone Other blood tests Assessing your risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes is important when testing for PCOS because there are links between PCOS and insulin resistance and being overweight. Blood tests to assess these risks will measure: cholesterol blood pressure glucose metabolism/ tolerance If you have PCOS you should have a cholesterol and glucose tolerance test every two years, and blood pressure should be checked every year. If you have risk factors such as a family history of diabetes or previous abnormal cholesterol tests then these tests should be performed more frequently. Tests for other conditions Other conditions of the adrenal glands, ovaries or pituitary gland (a small oval gland attached to the base of the brain) can be ruled out by other tests if necessary. Testing adolescents for PCOS In adolescents, menstrual cycles can be irregular for reasons unrelated to PCOS. It is best to wait for two years of irregular periods before assessing whether the cause is PCOS, unless there are other bothersome symptoms such as excess hair growth, acne or weight excess. Testing for PCOS when you take an oral contraceptive pill Taking the oral contraceptive pill changes reproductive hormone levels, so it is not possible to accurately measure your androgen and other hormone levels if you are on the pill. To accurately measure androgen levels for a PCOS diagnosis, you may need to stop the oral contraceptive pill for three months and use other forms of contraception during this time.
