The airlines say any such batteries need to be removable. Rob Carr / Getty Images Originally published on December 6, 2017 4:42 pm \nAirlines including American, Delta and Alaska have announced restrictions on so-called smart luggage because the lithium-ion batteries found in many of these suitcases pose a fire risk. \nThese kinds of bags have proliferated in recent years, including motorized suitcases you can ride and one pitched as an autonomous \" robot companion \" that follows you around. \nPrices can range from $275 to more than $1,000 , depending on a bag's bells and whistles, like device charging, GPS tracking, remote locking and built-in weight sensors. But these features require power, often in the form of lithium-ion batteries. \nThe batteries are in many electronics these days, because they are extremely efficient . But li-ion batteries have the potential to overheat and ignite, as shown in dramatic fashion by the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which the Department of Transportation banned from flights last fall after dozens of reports of the smartphone's batteries smoking, catching fire and exploding . In 2015, many airlines banned hoverboards owing to similar concerns. \n\"Beginning Jan. 15, customers who travel with a smart bag must be able to remove the battery in case the bag has to be checked at any point in the customer's journey. If the battery cannot be removed, the bag will not be allowed,\" American said in a statement on Friday. The same day, Delta and Alaska announced similar policies on their flights. \nAmerican's policy dictates that if the bag is carry-on size, passengers can take the luggage onboard, so long as the battery can be removed if needed. If passengers need to check the bag, the battery must be removed and carried onboard. But if the bag has a nonremovable battery, it can't be checked or carried on. \nAn FAA spokesman told The Washington Post that the airlines' policies are \"consistent with our guidance that lithium-ion batteries should not be carried in the cargo hold.\" \nThe FAA's policy on portable electronic devices containing these batteries states: \n\"Devices containing lithium metal or lithium ion batteries (laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc.) should be carried in carry-on baggage when possible. When these devices must be carried in checked baggage, they should be turned completely off, protected from accidental activation, and packed so they are protected from damage. \n\"Spare (uninstalled) lithium metal and lithium ion batteries are always prohibited in checked baggage and must be placed in carry-on. When a carry-on bag is checked at the gate or at planeside, any spare lithium batteries must be removed from the bag and kept with the passenger in the aircraft cabin.\" \nIn May, the International Air Transport Association, an airline trade association, published suggested smart bag guidelines for airlines. Its list of hazards and potential consequences is enough to make any flyer a little nervous. \nA spokesman for American tells NPR that rules banning the bags' powerful lithium batteries from checked baggage aren't because they're more likely to catch fire in a cargo hold, but because it's hard to fight a fire that breaks out there. \n\"You have very limited options in the cargo hold,\" American spokesman Ross Feinstein says. If a fire starts there, the crew can use fire suppression bottles to fight it, \"but you can only deploy them once.\" \n\"In the cabin, passengers and crew can fight a fire,\" he adds. \nFor manufacturers of luggage with nonremovable batteries , the airlines' restrictions are a blow. \n\"Before and at the time of production, we did our due diligence to make sure that we complied with all international regulations defined by DOT and FAA,\" one such company, Bluesmart, said on its website . \"While most airlines understand and approve of smart luggage, others might still be getting up to speed. We are saddened by these latest changes to some airline regulations and feel it is a step back not only for travel technology but it also presents an obstacle to streamlining and improving the way we all travel.\" \nSome luggage makers advertise that their bags are \"TSA-approved.\" \nBut TSA does not approve or endorse bags. And Feinstein says that on American, there won't be any exemptions to its policies, no matter the manufacturer. \n\"We know these bags are getting popular,\" Feinstein says. \"American is not opposed to smart bags. However, the battery must be removable.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

AP \nHigh-ranking U.S.-based Volkswagen executive, Oliver Schmidt, has been sentenced to seven years in prison and ordered to pay a $400,000 fine for his part in a decadelong diesel-emissions cheating scandal. \nSchmidt was the chief of Volkswagen's engineering and environmental office in Michigan. In August, he pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to defraud the federal government and violation of the Clean Air Act by participating in a scheme to circumvent federal emissions tests with rigged devices in diesel cars. Federal regulators uncovered the plot in 2015. \nVolkswagen already has admitted guilt to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, customs violations, obstruction of justice, as well as violation of the Clean Air Act. The German company has paid more than $20 billion in fines and settlements. \nIn a letter to U.S. District Judge Sean Cox of Detroit, Schmidt acknowledged his guilt. Reading a written statement in court, Schmidt broke down saying, \"I made bad decisions and for that I am sorry.\" \nFederal prosecutors also have charged eight other current or former Volkswagen executives. As The New York Times reports: \n\"But most of the people suspected of taking part in a conspiracy to defraud United States regulators are out of reach of American justice in Germany, which normally does not extradite its own citizens. Mr. Schmidt may well turn out to suffer the harshest punishment for the emissions fraud even though he was not by any means the only participant or the highest ranking.\" \nSchmidt was arrested in January while vacationing in Miami with his wife.

number of white people arrested on suspicion of terrorism has risen dramatically as the total hits a new annual high, statistics show.\nThe Home Office said 400 suspects were detained and more than 850 searched under the Terrorism Act in the year to 30 September.\nPolice arrested 12 people in connection with the Westminster attack, 23 in connection with the Manchester Arena bombing, 21 related to the London Bridge attack, one following Finsbury Park and seven linked to the Parsons Green bombing.\nThe perpetrators of the Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge attacks died while carrying out the atrocities and none of those arrested have been charged.\nThe brother of Manchester bomber Salman Abedi could be prosecuted if he is returned to the UK from Libya but his extradition has been repeatedly delayed.\nAround 15 per cent of those detained were women and girls \u2013 the highest proportion on record \u2013 and the number of arrests across all age and ethnic groups increased.\nThe largest rise was seen for suspects of \u201cwhite ethnic appearance\u201d, the Home Office said, with the number of arrests rising by 77 per cent since the previous year to 143, making up 36 per cent of the total.\nMI5 chief warns that Britain is facing an unrelenting terrorist threat The spike may partly be accounted for by crackdowns on the neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action , which has several alleged members due in court.\nAmong them are British soldiers accused of joining the organisation \u2013 which was banned last December \u2013 and a man who allegedly plotted to murder a Labour MP with a machete .\nThe biggest ethnic group among terror suspects was Asian, standing at 44 per cent (174 people) in the same period.\nOf those arrested in the year, 69 per cent considered themselves to be of British or dual nationality. The number of arrests linked to international terrorism, involving foreign groups such as Isis, jumped from from 212 to 292.\nArrests for domestic terrorism, with no connection to international groups or Northern Ireland, was up to 73 from 20 the previous year.\nUnder a third were prosecuted for committing a crime and more than a half were released without charge, with others freed on bail or facing alternative action.\nA total of 78 terrorism trials saw just nine people acquitted and almost 90 per cent convicted.\nThere were 213 terrorists in custody \u2013 a quarter up on the previous year \u2013 with the vast majority holding Islamist extremist views, followed by the far-right and others.\nSecurity minister Ben Wallace said Britain was facing a \u201cshift, rather than a short-term spike\u201d in the threat.\n\u201cThese statistics we are publishing today demonstrate the breadth of work that they undertake, alongside the rest of the criminal justice system, day in and day out to keep us safe,\u201d he added.\n\u201cBut this is not the totality of our work. The whole of society must come together to challenge the terrorist threat. \u201cThe public must remain alert but not alarmed and report any suspicions they have about unusual activity or behaviour to the appropriate authorities.\u201d\nThe Government is reviewing its counter-terror strategy in light of recent attacks , amid warnings that the threat from Isis is continuing to rise as it loses territory in Syria and Iraq.\nA report by David Anderson QC, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, found MI5 had missed opportunities that could have prevented the Manchester attack .\nHe said two pieces of evidence that should have sparked an investigation were dismissed as non-terror-related in the months before the bombing.\nAt the same time Khuram Butt, the ringleader of the London Bridge attack, was being monitored for suspected attack-planning but spies failed to detect his plot.\nDiane Abbott, the Shadow Home Secretary, said Labour was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about falling police-officer numbers amid the continued threat.\nMI5 missed opportunities to prevent the Manchester attack (Getty) \u201cAs the recent Anderson report showed, counter-terrorism police and security services want to move towards greater reliance on community policing but that has been undermined by 20,000 police officers being cut under the Tories,\u201d she added.\n\u201cThere has been a record number of terrorism-related arrests but no comparable increase in the number of charges for terrorism offences which suggests problems about the quality of intelligence and a lack of police resources.\u201d\nThe figures were released after the head of MI5 revealed that nine terror plots have been foiled since the Westminster attack in March.\nIn the latest case, a man appeared in court this week accused of planning to bomb Downing Street and assassinate Theresa May.\nSecurity services currently have 3,000 people under active investigation who are perceived to be an imminent threat, as well as a wider pool of 20,000 who have previously appeared on their radar.\nThe Government has been attempting to bolster its controversial Prevent strategy, which saw thousands of children among the 7,631 people referred to in a year.\nIt has also been increasing efforts to combat the presence of online propaganda and communications between militants using encrypted messaging-apps.\nAs well as domestic extremists, security services are attempting to manage the threat posed by returning foreign fighters.\nThe arrival of up to 300 British jihadis from Isis\u2019 former territories in Syria and Iraq was initially feared, but the actual number is now expected to be significantly lower.\nOf around 850 people who left the UK for Isis, around half have already returned and an unknown number have been killed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "firefox", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:56.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b532ac331ce5769896e9c7c0ef3e43bdb7112522", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoySJuJVf3Wy9kIOLPEvcyeQ.jNo_LpzBOZPbRiEiVzdy4YHRiqYmkzib9z9guBYsE-", "site_full": "boatlife.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://boatlife.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Boatlife: Continuously Cruising                                                   Aboard NB Valerie", "title": "Breaking Ice!", "title_full": "Breaking Ice!", "published": "2017-12-05T20:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c422040a01a260ac2b652aa2236e18a53fe2fe5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoySJuJVf3Wy9kIOLPEvcyeQ.jNo_LpzBOZPbRiEiVzdy4YHRiqYmkzllUQWulQWGRIlorOi8F0mQ--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Judith Emery", "published": "2017-12-06T01:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Glad you enjoyed your painting weekend, your roses look lovely.

Seven of the\r\n      album\u0092s eleven tracks are reminiscent of their earlier, more pop-punk-inspired\r\n      effort, Love Like This.  Although none of these are nearly as fast-paced or\r\n      sonically edgy as those on the debut LP, their live performance of \u0093When We\r\n      Were Young\u0094 suggests that these seven have the potential to become much\r\n      bigger, blood-pumping crowd pleasers on tour.  The remaining four are all\r\n      radio-ready pop hits that while certainly geared to attract new (read: teen\r\n      and pre-teen) fans do not abandon the catchiness of the others, especially\r\n      when it comes to rhythm.\r\n     \r\n      The Gold: The seven songs reminiscent of the debut album (\u0093About A Girl,\u0094\r\n      \u0093When We Were Young,\u0094 Must Be The Music,\u0094 \u0093Begin Again,\u0094 \u0093Back To The Start,\u0094\r\n      \u0093Mannequin,\u0094 and \u0093Don\u0092t Let Me Go\u0094) are definitely the highlight of this album\r\n      for me.  As an album, the dichotomy between these songs and the more\r\n      radio-friendly ones reminds me a lot of Jack\u0092s Mannequin\u0092s last effort, The\r\n      Glass Passenger \u0096 the songs with the most familiar sound are not quite as\r\n      catchy as their predecessors, but in the context of the other tracks, they\r\n      serve as a bridge for the new fans picking up the older LP and EPs.  While\r\n      this certainly leaves something to be desired for those of us who have been\r\n      following the band since their earlier efforts, I for one am willing to accept\r\n      if not embrace this approach.  It would have been very easy for the band to\r\n      put out a We-the-Kings-esque second album that completely sold itself to power\r\n      pop, but instead we have a compromise of sorts.\r\n     \r\n      The Silver: The radio -friendly and -ready songs (\u0093Someone Like You,\u0094 \u0093Thick\r\n      As Thieves,\u0094 \u0093Mona Lisa,\u0094 and \u0093Love To You\u0094) will never rank among my favorite\r\n      songs of all time, but I have to give credit where it is due: these are all\r\n      fantastic power pop jams.  First single \u0093Someone Like You\u0094 took some time to\r\n      grow on me, but after seeing the video and then hearing in its full context on\r\n      the album, I can fully appreciate the fine line being walked by the band in\r\n      trying to hand onto their pop-punk roots while also grasping at a more\r\n      expansive fanbase.  The\r\n      absolutely-must-be-unless-the-record-label-is-profoundly-stupid second single,\r\n      \u0093Love To You,\u0094 screams \u0091Top 40 Hit\u0092 with every letter of its chorus/hook.\r\n      I\u0092ve been wrong before about songs, but I really and truly have to say that\r\n      \u0093Love To You\u0094 has all the makings of a song that can compete with the\r\n      catchiest-of-the-catchy hip-hop songs currently topping the charts.  It\u0092s\r\n      actually such an interesting type of catchy that I feel like mentioning it\u0092s\r\n      hook would be akin to spoiling the end of a movie.  Check it out.\r\n     \r\n      The Bronze: Essentially, Everything\u0092s Fine moves The Summer Set out of the\r\n      genre of pop-punk and squarely into that of pop/power-pop, a move that might\r\n      not have been the best for them long term.  While they were certainly not\r\n      doing anything genre-defining or genre-busting on their earlier efforts, their\r\n      middlebrow version of pop-punk was somewhat unique because of Brian Dales\u0092s\r\n      vocals \u0096 he has a more conventionally pop voice, which against the more\r\n      aggressive pop-punk guitars and rhythm created an identifiable sound.  On\r\n      Everything\u0092s Fine, especially the four radio-ready songs, his vocals could be\r\n      mistaken for any number of other pop singers, particularly Train frontman\r\n      Patrick Monahan.  I have said on a few occasions that \u0093Someone Like You\u0094\r\n      sounded to me like a Train song and I think that assessment holds up across\r\n      the other three single-worthy songs.  Although it\u0092s certainly not a bad move\r\n      to model your band after one of the most enduringly and resurgently popular\r\n      groups of the past decade, I had really hoped that The Summer Set would and\r\n      could flex their pop-punk muscles on this album instead.\"\r\n     \r\n    - Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\r\n     \r\n      01.

Share 0 Share \nThe PCA\u2019s 2018 International Residential Ventilation & Preservation of Buildings Conference takes place on the 14th and 15th June at The Slate, University of Warwick, in Coventry. \nIt will investigate issues including the nature of occupation, methods for identifying and rectifying defects \u2013 and the expected performance of existing buildings. \nTo broaden the debate and bring together the latest thinking on the issue the association is now inviting submissions for original research/academic papers on topics related to moisture in buildings and its outcomes to be presented at the event. \nAreas of interest to the conference include, but are not limited to: Moisture in buildings Management of atmospheric moisture in buildings Ventilation & air quality in buildings Fungal decay Emerging challenges in timber protection Salt management in masonry Insect attack on buildings Protecting timber in new construction \nPosters are also welcome and the application deadline for those, as well the research/academic papers, is 5th January 2018. More details can be found at http://www.property-care.org/conferences/call-for-papers/ \nThe event is part of the PCA\u2019s acclaimed annual conference programme, which features a range of subjects including invasive weeds and structural waterproofing for delegates with an interest in property care. \nThe association has developed a reputation for delivering premier conferences that bring together industry, as well as academics and public bodies from across the UK and internationally. \nSteve Hodgson, Chief Executive of the PCA, said: \u201cOur conferences are open to both PCA members and non-members alike and attract audiences comprising a mix of contractors, surveyors, researchers and leading industry figures. \n\u201cThe 2018 International Residential Ventilation & Preservation of Buildings Conference covers a subject area of increasing importance nationally and we are looking forward to bringing together a rich, knowledge-based range of content over the two days.\u201d \nThis conference is the latest move from the PCA to address the increase in excessive atmospheric moisture in buildings being reported in UK homes. \nOther initiatives from the PCA include the development of a Residential Ventilation Group (RVG), the publication of a \u2018Code of Practice for the Investigation and Provision of Ventilation in Existing Dwellings\u2019 and a Knowledge Transfer Partnership with the University College London Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (UCL IEDE). \nAccording to the PCA, factors behind the rising trend are predominately linked with modern living \u2013 including increased levels of occupation and rising fuel costs, as well as a drive to make homes more energy efficient. \nThe trade body also cites efforts to reduce air leakage through draught proofing and retrofit insulation, as well as the changing climate patterns \u2013 featuring warmer, wetter weather \u2013 as being of significance. \nTo resolve the issue the PCA is calling for a greater focus on more effective ventilation \u2013 with the association leading calls for the development of a more robust strategy to ensure effective methods are introduced in homes. \nMr Hodgson added: \u201cThe feedback from our 400 members across the UK is that the number of cases of mould and condensation problems linked to increased levels of atmospheric moisture in properties continues to rise. \n\u201cA great many of these issues could be improved through the correct use of appropriate ventilation strategies. \n\u201cHowever, despite the impact that good ventilation can have on a property\u2019s moisture levels, the current regulation and guidance setting out minimum requirements in homes is mixed and usually ignored or misunderstood. \n\u201cWe believe the frequency of problems associated with damp and mould from indoor air is only set to get worse, with unseen and as yet underestimated problems being created due to these new pressures on properties. \n\u201cThis is an issue which can have significant consequences, with excess moisture in a building potentially affecting both its fabric and the comfort and wellbeing of occupants if left unchecked.\u201d \nThe PCA has produced a video offering a comprehensive overview of the issues faced. \nFeaturing interviews with academics at University College London Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (UCL IEDE), the short film is available to view at https://youtu.be/QFQ2a9XEop8 .

It's about an aardvark. Aardvarks eat ants, and... essay is awkward!\n;-P\nWhat I gather from your topic summary, is you want to make two things, or rather you have two desired functions . One function is, \"writing desk\", a surface to write on. The other function is, \"school bag\", which I am guessing is a bag for to carry around books and papers, pen, pencil, etc.\nThe essential properties of \"writing desk\" are, I think, hardness and flatness.\nA scaled down version of \"writing desk\" is this thing called a \"clipboard\",\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipboard\nwhich could be approximated by, just a board, preferably one that is hard and flat. Maybe without the clip, it is just called, \"board\", or \"writingboard\"? Carboard is flat, but not very hard. A piece of wood would be better, if you can find wood boards in your trash. I think there may be possibilities in plastic, especially if you can find discarded plastic pails or buckets.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pail_(container)\nPlastic pails with rectangular shape will be more easily cut into clipboard sized pieces, than will cylindrical plastic pails.\nIf all you have are cylindrical plastic pails, it might be possible to find a way to flatten the curved pieces with some moderate heat and pressure. For example HDPE, a plastic commonly used to make plastic pails, gets soft at around 100 C, the same temperature as boiling water.\nAlthough reshaping discarded plastic seems like a lot of work, if you cannot simply find some plastic, already in a shape that is flat.\nRegarding the contrivance for to function as, \"school bag\", I think I would want some kind of fabric that is strong, and sheds water. I think woven plastic fabrics, like woven HDPE, or woven polypropylene, would be good, if you can find it cheap, preferably as something someone else is throwing away.\nBy the way, regarding shape, I am naively guessing the usual shape for what you call, \"school bag\", is similar to what Wikipedia calls, \"Backpack\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpack\nI mean, that's what I carried my books around in when I went to school, in another era, when Christ was a small child, and dinosaurs roamed the Earth. ;-)\nBack to the subject of materials found in trash... In the trash in my home country, strong woven plastic can be found in discarded bags used to sell dog food, and cat food. It is used to package some kinds of food for people too. For example, beans and rice, when sold in bulk, are often shipped in sturdy woven plastic bags.\nThis same kind of plastic fabric is also often used to make tarps,\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpaulin\nand reusable shopping bags.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_shopping_ba...\nWhich makes me think... an ordinary disposable shopping bag,\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_bag\nor several used together for added strength, might serve as \"school bag\" for to contain books, plus writingboard, if no stronger bag could be found.\nActually, this topic reminds me of a similar topic posted to this forum about a month ago. It was another one of these, how-to-build-something-from-nothing kind of topics. A poster there mentioned an artifact called, \"IKEA bag\", like everyone knows what that is. It turns out, the IKEA bag is a specific brand, like brand name brand, of woven reusable shopping bag, made from sturdy woven plastic.\nhttps://www.instructables.com/community/How-to-Cle...\nNote, there also exist cheap, flimsy, reusable shopping bags, made from novwoven, spun-bonded HDPE,\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyvek\nusually not as nice, not as durable, as the ones made from woven plastic.\nBack to the subject of IKEA bag,\nhttp://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/1722834...\nI've never actually seen \"IKEA bag\" in real life, but if you can find one, or make one, I imagine it also could be used for carrying school books, plus papers, plus hard, flat, writingboard.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_bag", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pail_(container)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpack", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpaulin", "http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/17228340/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_shopping_bag", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipboard", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyvek"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:57.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2a8d4d49c4ece7b1f91ab61d967414c7757d717", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg85PnRzK.Mi281NfeEaYo864votqU6sZPUx4Dl.jeWrAbxTddFsAk.to5tLcT08_X7CteknZMGLwh3f9xVuEj6RnQKu8de_mznX3IXiPiSEDw--", "site_full": "www.instructables.com", "site": "instructables.com", "site_section": "http://www.instructables.com/community?categoryGroup=forums&category=craft", "site_categories": ["woodworking", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Instructables -

I'll first try using scare tactics of pulling out of the contract then if it's not good and I really want it I'll try putting you in a binding contract and litigated out of court and three by the time you realize all the shit that's happened to you you'll be with your head stuck up in to you know where writing a pity log post.

This is a historic day. Jerusalem has been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years. Jerusalem has been the focus of our hopes, our dreams, our prayers for three millennia.

They were returning home after a house party on Conesus Lake, listening to the radio. A sudden interruption broke the news. Bader doesn\u2019t remember the exact words, but he remembers clearly how that carefree mood during a December Sunday drive went dark. \n\u201cI knew right away I was destined,\u201d recalled Bader, who was on a train headed for Alaska just five months later. One of 16 million Americans who went on to serve in World War II, Bader would spend 44 months in the Army, in combat and experiencing horrors he doesn\u2019t want to recall. \nWorld War II veteran David Van Gelder was just 16 when the Japanese attacked the U.S. Navy base on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on this day 76 years ago. Like Bader, also now living in Canandaigua, Van Gelder was quickly drawn into the war that became the focus for every American. \nVan Gelder was among the youngest in the war effort, first in the New York Army National Guard and by 1943, at age 18, with the Army in Alaska. He recalled being a guinea pig of sorts, assigned to testing military equipment and clothing to withstand the extreme temperatures to which the troops were subject. Van Gelder showed framed photographs he displays on the wall at his home on Baker Drive. He and comrades are clad in heavy, tightly hooded coats and thick, sagging pants. He pointed out the shoes \u2014 made of felt, he recalled, and comical, even then. But the temperatures were no joke: testing 30 degrees below zero and even colder. \nOn this 76th anniversary of a day President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared \u201ca date which will live in infamy,\u201d Bader and Van Gelder are among a diminishing number of World War II veterans. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs says the United States is losing 372 veterans per day. Only 620,000 of the 16 million Americans who served were alive in 2016. \nAll Americans' lives changed on Dec. 7, 1941, when hundreds of Japanese fighter planes descended on the U.S. naval base near Honolulu, Hawaii. The attack destroyed or damaged nearly 20 American naval vessels including eight battleships and over 300 airplanes. More than 2,400 Americans died in the attack, including civilians, and another 1,000 people were wounded. On Dec. 8, 1941, President Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war on Japan. Three days later, Nazi Germany declared war against the United States. \n\u201cI remember what hell it was,\u201d recalled Bader, who celebrated his 100th birthday Oct. 13. Showing framed photographs and other memorabilia from his service, Bader talked about some of what stands out from that period. In his apartment at Quail Summit in Canandaigua, he showed a display of the many forms of currency he was paid during the war from the areas he served in the Pacific. He also showed a wedding photo with his bride, Estelle. They raised six children, their firstborn son born before Bader returned from war. \n\u201cI slept in a lot of foxholes,\u201d recalled Bader, who worked nearly 40 years after the war for Eastman Kodak making film. He talked about having a .50 caliber machine gun, a heavy machine gun designed toward the end of World War I, during his service in the Pacific. \nHe touched the corner of one framed plaque he has from the war, where his dog tag \u2014 his World War II military ID \u2014 was fastened. \u201cI took them off a lot of guys,\u201d he said quietly. \nBader was in the battle of Okinawa. It was the last major battle of World War II and one of the bloodiest. On April 1, 1945 \u2014 Easter Sunday \u2014 the Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet and more than 180,000 U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps troops descended on the Pacific island of Okinawa for a final push towards Japan, according to history.com. \nAs Bader recalls that battle and enemy casualties: \u201cThere were no men left ... they ran out of ammunition. We had a lot of personnel. Holy cow.\u201d \nAlso known as Operation Iceberg, the battle took place in April through June of 1945. The largest amphibious landing in the Pacific theater of World War II, it also resulted in the largest casualties with over 100,000 Japanese casualties and 50,000 casualties for the Allies. Some have described the 80-day plus battle for the Island of Okinawa as the \u201ctyphoon of steel\u201d. \nThe Japanese formal surrender came on Sept. 2, 1945. Bader was in Japan after the war. He remembers the women and children, devastated and destitute. They came looking for food. Bader recalled feeding them along with other troops. \u201cWe had enough food to feed the world,\u201d he said. \nVan Gelder, 92, said he was fortunate to survive the war that took so many lives. He served as well in the Pacific. Like Bader, he prefers to forget the most painful aspects of the war. But he is heartened that people want to learn from the past. He said Americans must always be on the alert. \n\u201cBecause we have what other people want, we\u2019ll always be in a dangerous place,\u201d he said. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "estelle doyle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franklin d. roosevelt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "estelle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "van gelder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie sherwood jsherwood@messengerpostmedia.com  joseph bader", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bader", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david van gelder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roosevelt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "canandaigua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifth fleet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rochester institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nazi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastman kodak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york army national guard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. marine corps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of veterans affairs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rochester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canandaigua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clarissa street bridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baker drive", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honolulu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okinawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conesus lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearl harbor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:58.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "294ef08eff3285469cf7e3e59fecd402ef6b2540", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxboLsQV2dbiCw--", "site_full": "forums.moneysavingexpert.com", "site": "moneysavingexpert.com", "site_section": "http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.php?f=90", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Household &amp; Travel - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "title": "Help:Three network are scamming me", "title_full": "Help:Three network are scamming me - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T10:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2270, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "855fb4d18ffc9c0ab0dc43ba27e95ba8da56150e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxYn2gSBTjSkNIn8iFko7Qk5MGpqHmm_wgw-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "camelot1971", "published": "2017-12-07T11:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\u201c This is why i now record every single phone conversation i have.

While not a reason to look at your code, instead, if we don't have a valid reason to look or don't have access to technical resources either internal or via external consultants who we are fairly confident could build whatever the software is we are buying given time and resources then we DO NOT WANT TO SEE YOUR IP. This goes as far as shell scripts vendors use for stuff that we don't particularly care about. If they leave them on our boxes we make sure we destroy the data. If the company is worth 50bn then there is it a very small chance their about to make a huge pivot to your particular niche and therefore need your code to solve a problem. The reason companies buy software is because they don't want to pay people to maintain it and in addition they DEFINITELY don't want to get sued for looking at your code. So for no other reason than legal repurcussions you can probably trust them not to do anything sketchy. (Disclaimer: small business units do sometimes go rouge. Make sure youre talking to someone who understands the company wide impacts of fucking this up)\n2. If the code is going to be used in sensitive environment (ie. Air gapped networks) we may want to scan for both destructive malware dependencies or just bad code that intentionally or unintentionally might damage systems. Also you would be amazed how many vendors build hooks to call out to the internet in standalone software packages that they \"certify\" for offline use.\n3. If we need to build a bunch of integrations ourselves (ie you would be useless to us in so far as needing to understand legacy core banking systems and the like and therefore are not helpful with your knowledge of the code base, we need someone with knowledge of both code bases at a fairly low level) then depending on the size of the code base we might ask for all of it or just all the external interface implementations. Not the definitions. The actual code.\n4. If you are a small company it is not unlikely that we will negotiate a clause which says that if you disappear or all your developers die or whatever, then we are allowed to internally use your code base to build our own stuff since we will end up with dependencies on it and will want to make sure we can still function without you (this is obviously not ideal, we would rather throw money at you to make problems go away, but if you aren't a business any more then we just have to hire people to do it) I actually heard a colleague working at a competing bank in Australia tell me that their agreement with hashicorp gives them ownership of consul enterprise code base for use internally if hashicorp disappears. You just need to make sure your lawyers and on this properly to make sure you clearly define the circumstances in which the large companies expectations of you maintaining the code are no longer met and therefore they can do it if they need to.\n5. If we just don't trust you to not be hiding some black magic bullshit behind the scenes. This is usually the result of particularly uninformed sales people making claims that cannot technically be true, and thus out due diligence require that we handle it ourselves. It's also much more likely that we will recommend a bunch of software auditing companies we have used and we trust to audit the code base for us, just so we don't have the liability of your IP in our heads.\n6. If we have government financial institution regulations which apply to the thing we want to use your software for and we are required to check of sign off the risk. As an example, an Australian bank running things on cloud platforms that hook back into traditional on prem systems it is mandatory without exception that all data at rest or in flight be encrypted. We trusted a large software company on this and only when we had auditors sniffing traffic over the network did we discover that major data intensive operations relating to backup integrity decrypted everything and then pumped it over the wire between instances using HTTP at which point we where $6m deep in licensing fees so we had a few very difficult conversations about \"fix it or fuck off and pay us substantial reparations\" because we suddenly needed a lot of technical lawyers (who ate as rare as hens teeth) to explain what had happened to avoid fines that could have cost literally billions.\nSummary: there are a bunch of reasons a company might want to see your code. If the person you are talking to is speaking on behalf of the whole organisation (ie. They understand broader business implications of doing anything shady) then you're almost definitely safe. If your a bit on the fence about the whole thing, get a third party auditor in, but the request itself is pretty reasonable.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:58.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5b3ed022e5180c5494186ad8b1acfddd7e1a2fa4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QhIqDBNAks71FyqZ7WmwWEfrJSImIfcXCCFxCuCLZNCQJ.D2ehftZXijuLMBgh3QdXiDqqae059.SshS9Q.zmPFc_HQE_Wu8iiL5LB07WxNg--", "site_full": "adolfo-payes.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://adolfo-payes.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "adolfo pay\u0102\u0160s - vi\u0102\u0105etas", "title": "Dicen que la memoria hace a la Humanidad. 126", "title_full": "Dicen que la memoria hace a la Humanidad. 126", "published": "2017-12-06T06:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a36a3f035bb4f80a49456e349a96e74933d9357", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QhIqDBNAks71FyqZ7WmwWEfrJSImIfcXCCFxCuCLZNCQJ.D2ehftZXijuLMBgh3QdXiDqqae059.SshS9Q.zmPFc_HQE_Wu8gwwq8YI8jgrWlXcz9Bxbq_", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Sandra Figueroa", "published": "2017-12-07T09:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Saludos Poeta siempre grato pasar a deleitarme con lo que compartes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:58.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5bdcae4fd08c61b592ce3dd608af87dd74f19b39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZAY2xGd6Y16c", "site_full": "news.ycombinator.com", "site": "ycombinator.com", "site_section": "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Hacker News", "title": "Ask HN: Huge enterprise customer wants to see our source code", "title_full": "Ask HN: Huge enterprise customer wants to see our source code | Hacker News", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 243, "participants_count": 178, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2232, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc438d7d2f83672f00cd631c1f38f845e725176d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZKv3nVPq562wD6NxrLitpP0-", "ord_in_thread": 234, "author": "mslate", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\"If you want to see our source code then acquire us.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:58.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5bdcae4fd08c61b592ce3dd608af87dd74f19b39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZAY2xGd6Y16c", "site_full": "news.ycombinator.com", "site": "ycombinator.com", "site_section": "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Hacker News", "title": "Ask HN: Huge enterprise customer wants to see our source code", "title_full": "Ask HN: Huge enterprise customer wants to see our source code | Hacker News", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 243, "participants_count": 178, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2232, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a5bf139aa2ecd3b84954a3c0d7c88e6352fa1be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZKv3nVPq562wu2S69SBG6HU-", "ord_in_thread": 240, "author": "CuckDepriver", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "1) yes but was more than algorithms 2) If you're not realistic and being stupid with yourself and look at the amount of money that the industry has there's ($50bn) no legitimate way if I were to see your code would not steal it because I have \"UNLIMITED RESOURCES\".

Now, being a bank that's kind of their core competency so letting someone else build it just seems silly.\nBut two years later I was on a project trying to hook a bunch of stuff up to this system and we noticed that we couldn't get a proper test run because it kept giving us different figures for the same inputs.\nAfter asking again for the code, or even pseudo code that would explain the behaviour we again told no.\nA bunch of lawyers got in a room and they explicitly threatened to sue us if we tried to decompile their code or monitor the system to learn the logic. My response to this was immediate alarm bells because that meant we where not allowed to actually test the system which paid for most of the development of and hosted internally.\nA discussion with just our lawyer revealed that, because it was related to home loan rates, our liability was actually significantly reduced if it where technically possible to decompile the code and verify what it was doing because the cost of not being able to explain it to auditors would be so high and the amount we would be sued for might maybe max out in the 10's of millions.\nAfter a bit of very low level analysis we found that their algorithm for determining a load rate included a random number generator to determine an arbitrary discount in the case that very similar data was input repeatedly.\nWe later discovered that a developer was trying to be clever and get more home lones sold and had entirely missed the point of risk profiling properly. Ie. We don't want to sell you a home loan at a low interest rate if the risk of you defaulting makes it less profitable.\nEventually the resolution we came to was that HP would fix this shit up and they would provide us with all of the original source they had access to.\nBut for the next 20 years or so we will be carrying the liability of potentiallt hundreds of loans (this system wasn't used by most business units at the time but we where thinking of expanding out its use, hence the project) that have an interest rate that is lower than it needs to be (like 1-1.5% lower!) to cover the risk profile of the person who got the loan.\nAnd all we needed was the code and that wouldn't have happened.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:58.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aeb7b18406ce51267adc1e0f58b5dc5e74383171", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.BfYtXdcIUvRvMKDAl4_VLfIBhJVYLHMOxmVBzdmNxCTXggcNYU95qAc0X3nD2qBuqExNeljTow1ndtlSZGKLWbujRnWZKZlxOF.E2NODMZxJ_n0dVk4Buen2cwYJ5UdKIwpQG.pY4GBstb7G2jyFB5OkdCu6LEI6kgi7mUen4iatJ6Rop0vbm", "site_full": "www.pantagraph.com", "site": "pantagraph.com", "site_section": "http://www.pantagraph.com/search/?f=rss&t=article&c=lifestyles*&l=25&s=start_time&sd=desc", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "www.pantagraph.com - RSS Results in lifestyles* of type article", "title": "Orange: The color of warmth and comfort", "title_full": "Orange: The color of warmth and comfort", "published": "2017-12-06T14:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pantagraph.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/fc/4fc14047-f369-5c75-a6a8-8b54fd28b93f/5a27ea846436b.preview.jpg?crop=779%2C438%2C0%2C0&amp;resize=779%2C438&amp;order=crop%2Cresize", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 44692, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aeb7b18406ce51267adc1e0f58b5dc5e74383171", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.BfYtXdcIUvRvMKDAl4_VLfIBhJVYLHMOxmVBzdmNxCTXggcNYU95qAc0X3nD2qBuqExNeljTow1ndtlSZGKLWbujRnWZKZlxOF.E2NODMZxJ_n0dVk4Buen2cwYJ5UdKIwpQG.pY4GBstb7G2jyFB5OkdCu6LEI6kgi7mUen4iatJ6Rop0vbm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Puja Bhattacharjee, CNN Animation by Emmanuelle Walker, Nexus Studios", "published": "2017-12-06T14:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Orange: The color of warmth and comfort", "text": "Save \nIt is the color of fall, of beautiful sunsets, of a warm fireplace in the dreary winters and of marigold flowers. \nFrank Sinatra called orange the happiest color. Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky described orange as \"red brought nearer to humanity by yellow.\" \nIt is a sacred color in many Eastern religions. Hindu and Buddhist monks wear orange robes, and in Hinduism, orange represents fire and therefore purity; impurities are burned in fire. \nThe word orange came into the vernacular late, according to Julian Yates, professor of English and material culture studies at University of Delaware. \nThe color and the fruit are closely tied together; the English word for the color comes from the same word as the fruit, Yates said. Hottest of all colors \nOrange is perceived by some as the hottest of all colors, the most gregarious and fun-loving color, said Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute. Oranges and orange blossoms have historically been considered symbols of love and fruitfulness, she added. \n\"This belief started in ancient times, as it was seen as the color reflective of love, both earthly and heavenly. Greek muses wore orange, as did Bacchus, the pagan Roman god,\" Eiseman said. \n\"In general terms, a color ascribed to a god perpetuated the hope and belief of immortality.\" \nOrange is also the color of fire -- of molten lava in erupting volcanoes and slow-burning wood. Discovery of fire was a defining moment for mankind. \n\"They developed fire, a source of warmth and comfort and the end to eating raw food. What color was fire? Orange,\" said Sara Petitt, faculty of fabric styling at Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. She pointed out that orange is an energetic color. \"It combines the energy of red and the happiness of yellow.\" Dichotomy: rarity and commonality \nAccording to Eiseman, the color orange wasn't readily available to the masses until technology caught up and orange dyes could be produced chemically. That didn't happen until the 20th century. \nFor that reason, it became a highly desirable color, she said. \n\"The earliest uses in the 20th century was more for theatrical purposes than anything else. It was a great favorite for theatrics and dance programs, on the stage, in costuming,\" she said. \nSergei Diaghilev, the founder of Ballets Russes, used orange profusely in costuming and sets in the early 1900s, she pointed out. \"It was a traveling dance company. Not everybody could afford to see those amazing colors. So, again, it was a color reserved mostly for those people who had a great deal of money,\" she said. \nIn contrast, once orange dyes became more readily available, the color came to be associated with affordability. \nIn recent times, orange has been adopted by causes and companies. \nThere's Wear Orange, a coalition of more than 200 nonprofit organizations demanding gun safety. \"Orange is a bright, bold color that demands to be seen,\" its website says. \"Orange expresses our collective hope as a nation -- a hope for a future free from gun violence.\" \nThe United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, also known as UN Women, has utilized the color as a theme running through all of its global campaigning to prevent and end violence against women and girls. \"This color was adopted as a symbol of a brighter future, free from violence against women and girls,\" UN Women spokeswoman Sharon Grobeisen said. \nJennifer Wyatt, archivist at Home Depot, said that when the home improvement store started in the United States in 1978, the founders wanted an affordable and accessible store. \"They picked the color orange because of that accessibility, activity and also the affordability, because they didn't want customers to be intimidated,\" she said. The color is also associated with other DIY chain stores globally, such as UK company B&Q. \n\"In the late '70s, do-it-yourself wasn't really the way it is now, where everybody does it themselves. So they wanted it to be appealing to people, to stimulate that activity,\" Wyatt added. The orange store signs were visible to freeway traffic. Standing out in style \nThe Fashion Institute of Technology's Petitt believes orange is associated with inner magnetism. \"I don't think shy people wear orange. You want to be noticed if you wear orange,\" she said. \n\"If you are depressed and you go to your closet, you are probably not going to pick out an orange dress to wear.\" \nIt is also considered a transitional color because it is associated with the change in season. Fashion psychologist and blogger Shakaila Forbes-Bell said the color has gained a lot of interest in recent years. \n\"We see safety orange, as it is titled, up and down the catwalks for spring and summer 2018 especially in the New York shows like Tom Ford, Calvin Klein and Rihanna's Fenty Puma,\" she said. \nForbes-Bell said it's not surprising that orange is having a revival. \n\"Nowadays, we have seen a revival of bold colors,\" she added. \nIn the 1990s, as computers became ubiquitous, the Western world gained access to views of the way other cultures used color. People saw orange in different contexts than they might have seen it before, said Eiseman. Exotic, orange-hued spices from around the world became more familiar in the kitchen. Neon orange had a moment in fashion and street art. Makeup for people with darker skin tones became more common, and often employed hints of orange. Even kids TV shows, such as \"Rugrats,\" used the color often. \nOwing to this exposure, the appreciation for orange is far greater than it ever has been before. \n\"Designers like Hermes and Versace have long embraced orange, and now people, not only in the US but all over the world, were viewing how dynamic the color could be, and it helped to raise consumer awareness,\" she said. \nEiseman pointed out that when top designers feature a color, there is much of an aspirational quality that it takes on. One might not be able to afford a Hermes scarf, but one could certainly find that \"look\" and color for a lower price, she said. \nSince the mid-1990s, she said, orange has steadily grown more of a favorite, and every year, we have seen that it still stays in the color palette. \n\"With color trends, colors are favorites for a number of years, and then they retreat in the background,\" she said. \n\"That has not happened with orange,\" she said. \"Orange has stayed.\" \nSee more from our Colorscope series here.

People in coastal areas should also be aware of large waves and spray. \nAs Storm Caroline moves away from the UK much colder air is expected to spread across the country down into England. \nA yellow warning for snow has also been issued by the Met Office, with 2-5cm widely expected across much of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and northern England. \nThe storm has already triggered an

after every Premier League home match this season.\nA few Premier League clubs have allowed City to film their away matches too, but United will not be one of them after they rejected a request to have Amazon Prime cameramen in the tunnel this weekend due to their belief that it will already be crowded due to the number of licenced broadcasters already there.\nIt\u2019s understood that 23 individual television rights holders have requested to broadcast the match, meaning that space inside Old Trafford will be at a premium.\nBut it is also likely to trigger the rivalry between the two

These activities were also the largest job offerors, i.e. the number of job vacancies was also highest here. The total number of posts in the third quarter was over 558,000, increasing 0.7 percent on year and decreasing 0.5 percent compared to the previous quarter. \nThe rate of job vacancies, i.e. the share of job vacancies in the total number of posts, was 2.3 percent in the third quarter of 2017, an increase of 0.1 percent compared to the previous quarterand 0.3 percent on year. \nIn the third quarter, the rate of job vacancies was highest in education (3.2 percent), accommodation and food service activities (3.1 percent) and information and communication (3.0 percent).The rate of job vacancies was lowest, meanwhile, in agriculture, forestry and fishing (0.7 percent), real estate activities (0.8 percent) and mining and quarrying (0.9 percent). \nCompared the previous quarter, the number of job vacancies in the third quarter increased in the public sector, but the majority of vacant posts (71 percent) were in the private sector. In the third quarter of 2017, the rate of job vacancies was highest in state institutions and enterprises (2.9 percent) and foreign private sector enterprises (2.8 percent). The rate of job vacancies was lowest in Estonian private sector enterprises (1.9 percent) and in local government organisations (2.3 percent). \nMost of these vacant posts were located in Harju County (64 percent), including 49 percent in Tallinn, followed by Tartu County (ten percent) and Ida-Viru County (five percent).

I thought I was doomed to have this horrible curse on me for the whole of my life, or until I got old and my sebum levels changed. THE REASON THIS POST IS LONG IS BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE DIFFERENT THINGS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE'S ACNE AND I WANT YOU TO JUDGE ON YOUR OWN IF YOU THINK MY STORY COULD HELP YOU. ALSO, you might think \"This guy's acne was horrendous - mine is not that bad.. His post wont apply to me.\" just please consider what worked for me.. It is effective on a wide range of acne from what I have researched. I am going to outline this post in a way that I think is helpful, and I know anyone as desperate as I was will read through the whole thing, but I will break it down in easy sections for you to browse and highlight the cure at the bottom for your convenience.\nBackground of my experience with the disease:\n24 year old male Started getting mild pustular acne on back and shoulder blades around age 13 years old. Began browsing these forums. Tried oral doxycycline. By age 14 it had become nodulocystic. Tried topical antibiotic clindamycin+salycylic acid to no effect These lesions would start as deep, nonpainful bumps. They would grow over several days until being large fluid-filled boils or furuncles and then would pop, usually at night or when a shirt rubbed over them. (Heaven forbid if a friend backslapped me playfully!) Staining my shirts, bedsheets, and mattress with blood/pus became a constant routine. Sleeping was difficult. Self-esteem plummetted. My posture deteriorated as I would stand in odd ways to stop my shirt from rubbing against open abscesses and I would hunch my shoulders upwards to hide scars along the nape of my neck. Suicidal ideation became a regular occurrence. The lesions, after healing, left hypertrophic scars which remain to this day and are my next battle. (I am just glad to have a smooth back and butt pain-free and a body not being ravaged anymore by this affliction) Ages 14-16 it only got worse, began spreading to my upper arms and upper chest.\nWent on 6 month course of isotretinoin (Accutane). Acne cleared up for ~1.5 years, until I was about 18\nBy age 21, it had reached the same severity as it was at age 16. Acne began spreading down to my butt, thighs, and groin.\nAt age 23 I began a rigorous trial of various over-the-counter, holistic, and prescription remedies, some helped (list below) but most had no change.\nBy age 24 it had plateaud at its peak severity. I would usually have 5 to 10 large painful nodules and 10+ pustules, but they would come in waves. Sometimes as few as 5 lesions (but this only lasted for about 3-4 days) before flaring back up to 10+.\nI took a new direction in September 2017\nAt the time of writing, I have been on this intervention for 2 weeks and my acne has improved by literally 95% with only 2 nodules left, both of which are receding.\nPsychological effects of my acne:\nLow self-esteem leading to long-lasting depressive disorder\nAnxiety attacks at sports games, beaches, sexual encounters, physicians offices when I knew it was expected to take my shirt off (i almost always refused unless comfortable with the girl or had to because of the doctor)\nSexual difficulties\nConstant tension along shoulders due to hunching shirt up in public to hide neck scarring -> weird posture because of trying to hold my shirt off my lesions\nI remember being so jealous of guys who could take their shirts off at the beach and run around playing catch with a football. They just seemed so limber and carefree\nPhysical effects of my acne:\nDisfigurement (obv)\nPain\nBleeding and oozing pus (particularly overnight, but also at inopportune times in public)\nPicture:\nThis is not of me, but is an accurate representation of what my back looked like. I am attaching as a link because it may be disturbing to some viewers\nhttp://cdn.lifebuzz.com/images/145670/lifebuzz-72e485672960d6893f5fac8fad3cb92c-limit_2000.jpg\nThings I tried up until September 2017, which were NOT effective in CURING my acne : An exhaustive, but not 100% complete, list of things I tried, with approx. length of treatment in [brackets] and my subjective rating of their efficacy in {curly brackets}, broken down by category. On my quest to cure my acne it was really helpful to read other people's things they had tried. Topical Benzoyl peroxide in strengths up to 10% [2007-2017 on and off daily for months at a time] {Barely helped} Clindamycin + Salicylic Acid prescription cream [2007 - 2017 on and off daily for days at a time on particularly large or painful lesions] {Definitely helps as a spot treatment} Salicylic Acid 2% [2007 - 2010 on and off daily for months at a time] {Less effective than BP for me} ZZ cream from Demodexsolutions [2017 daily for months] {Definite reduction in severity but did not cure me. WIll write more about this below} Sulfur ointment 10% [2017 daily for weeks] {Didn't help, i really hated this one because it would get greasy and wet on top of my painful lesions, causing any fabric to stick even harder and then rip off later} Turmeric (applied powder in shower and left on for 10+ minutes) [daily for weeks] {helped with inflammation/severity but was not curative} Head and shoulders (zinc pyrithione) [daily for weeks] {didn't help} Selsun blue (selenium sulfide) [daily for weeks] {didn't help} Ketoconazole 1% shampoo [daily for weeks] {didn't help} Black cumin seed oil [daily for weeks] {helped a little?} Bio-oil [daily for weeks] {didn't help but didn't expect it to, its more for scars} Potato peels [less than a week] {didn't help} Tea tree oil - either straight, watered down, or mixed with 91% isopropyl alcohol [twice daily, several weeks] {didn't help} Urine [less than a week] {helped} Apple cider vinegar Oral RX: Doxycycline antibiotic [1 trial in 2007, 1 trial in 2014] {didn't do anything} Accutane (isotretinoin) [6 months daily in 2010] {competely cleared up my acne for 1.5 years} Side effects included dry lips (went away after stopping), sensitivity to sunlight (still to this day), and - in my opinion - exacerbation of depression and suicidal ideation Oral non-prescription agents: I tried these in various combinations (for example, a thread on here recommends B5 + Cysteine + Vit C) daily for months. No improvement. Niacin Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) L Cysteine NAC (N Acetyl Cysteine) B Complex (B12, B6, others) Milk thistle + Fennel Acidophilus probiotic + fiber Vitamin E Vitamin A Vitamin C Magnesium Zinc Krill oil Borage oil diatomaceous earth Candidagone Wormwood+Black walnut+clove antiparasite drops Apple cider vinegar Urine (yes, I was this desperate. It works for some people apparently) Diets tried, for approx 1 - 2 months at a time: Gluten free Dairy free Low fat High fat No alcohol \"Other\" remedies: Daily sea salt baths [weeks] {helped a little} Daily diluted bleach baths [weeks] {made a huge difference - I think this is the closest runner-up to being curative of this whole list} Tanning {helped!} Extensive exfoliation with gloves [daily for weeks] {helped a little} No showers Lots of showers Cold showers Burning hot showers Changing pillow cases and towels regularly\nFalse leads:\nAs you can tell by my list of things I tried, at some point I tried attributing my acne to a systemic Candida infection or parasite infection. I was skeptical, however, because I had no other findings indicative of Candida such as thrush, carb cravings, or fatigue and no other findings indicating parasites such as caloric malabsorption, GI distress, and general malaise.\nThe breakthrough:\nI am a medical student, so I would like to think I know a little bit about the inflammatory process and disease pathogenesis. As my education progressed I learned that the boils and furuncles that my nodules would eventually become almost always cultured Staph aureus. Well, this is no surprise, it is a major part of our skin's flora and an opportunistic pathogen. So, I wondered, WHY do I have these eruptions while other people who also have bacteria in their skin flora do not? The age-old explanation for why we get acne is a buildup of bacteria in and around the hair follicle / sebaceous glands due to a sebum blockage.\nI began to wonder why bacteria was piling up in my pores to such a severe extent. Other people with normal skin also had bacteria all over them, but for some reason mine was getting brought deeper into my skin, where it could set up shop (the microenvironment within the follicle is different and must offer pathogenic bacteria an opportunity to thrive, which in turn produces inflammation). I didn't get it - I wasn't immunosuppressed (a.k.a. my immune system is good, it should be able to fight the bacteria properly before it reached unmanageable level and created this horrible painful pimple). I wasn't picking at my skin and therefore destroying the protective barrier of my keratinized epidermis.\nI put together every associated symptom I had that I could possibly think of: Optometrist commented on eyelash dandruff when I got vision checked at age 10 Acne began mildly in a small patch before progressing to severe, then began spreading to different areas over the course of a few months/years Number of lesions varied in a 2-3 week cycle Hairline and scalp acne At random times in the day but particularly at night, I felt a prickling, crawling sensation under my skin in areas that were affected by acne. Googling this symptom led me to posts on this forum and elsewhere that brushed this sensation off as \"just feeling the acne growing\" or \"this is a sign of a Candida infection\"\nI looked at all the remedies I had tried to find a pattern.. Over-the-counter anti inflammatories (SA, BP, vit E, others) didn't work, as expected.. These can help lower overall inflammation but if bacteria is still getting in your pores and causing problems, your skins gonna have a bad time. Various diet modifications (to the extreme extent of eating ONLY boiled chicken and raw greens for a week) did not resolve it, indicating this was not an autoimmune reaction to an ingested allergen (such as herpes dermatiform, the cutaneous presentation of Celiac's disease and can strongly resemble what we know as acne) A blood test to measure my AST + ALT (measures of liver functioning) plus assisting my liver with NAC / milk thistle, diatomaceous earth, and anti-parasite medication did not help, which seemed to rule out toxin buildup (either primary or secondary to parasite metabolism / liver dysfunction) The exfoliation in the shower with purpose-made gloves (in the few areas where I could reach without painfully blowing open a cyst) did help, but it wasn't curative. This just confirmed my suspicion that this had to have something more than a simple \"Your pores just make soo much sebum and sucks for you, you get acne from it!\"\nAfter looking at my attempted treatments, symptoms, and various reading throughout the recesses of this forum, I finally put it all together\nTHE CAUSE:\nAn overabundance of Demodex falciparum mites.\nNOTE: Those unaware of \"Demodex\", and those who are deeply suffering, desperate for a cure, will keep reading. BUT, I know that many on this forum are skeptics of any mention of these mites... It is my firm belief that some of you simply have acne due to some other reason, while many of you do infect have acne due to these mites. Chinese medicine widely regards them as the cause of 90+% of post-pubertal (adult) acne. I used to scoff at the Demodex explanation 10 years ago, and I regret ever doing so. Some of you will simply parrot what you have read already on here even though you have good intentions. Others have a vested interest - financially, or otherwise - in promoting other approaches. All I know is I wish I had pursued this lead in the posts I read mentioning DEMODEX from back in 2005 - 2009; I would surely be a different (more confident, less scarred, more optimistic) person today.\nThe explanation is quite simple. Demodex live on most everyone's skin and generally don't cause much trouble. For various reasons, their population increases too much in certain individuals. These mites travel to various depths within your skin and lead to the deposition of their waste, corpses, and eggs in and within hair follicles. They also carry S. aureus and other opportunistic organisms deeper into the skin with them. The body responds with white blood cell extravasation + inflammation. Depending on the extent of your infestation + hormonal influences, you'll get anything from simple pustules, all the way to widespread furuncles (connected boils) that ulcerate and leave painful abscesses that scab over to form deeply disfiguring scars.\nThe variation in efficacy of my treatments finally made sense!\nOf course anti-inflammatories (such as benzoyl peroxide or SA regimens and vitamins) won't cure this acne - the root cause is still present. They may improve it..\nOf course topical clindamycin helped.. It kills off the bacteria that the mites brought down into your pore, resulting in markedly decreased inflammation. But it has no effect on STOPPING the acne from forming.\nOf course bleach baths + UV (tanning) helped. Bleach baths are recommended by dermatologists for reducing # of Staph auereus (specifically in the treatment of eczema). Not only are you killing the bacteria on your skin, its likely to have a detrimental effect on the mites.\nOf course my acne was cyclic\u2026 The life cycle of Demodex is a few weeks.. As one generation dies off, it takes a while for new eggs to hatch and mature.\nOf course I had scalp issues and hairline acne.. I had a serious infestation of Demodex up there. This is why treatments of demodex (such as demodexsolution's Zhongzhou cream) are not effective in severe infestations.. You have a steady supply of mites up there and any patch you don't cover, they'll find. The itching, crawling sensation at night / occasionally during the day? Our touch receptors are not sensitive enough to feel something the size of this mite crawling.. Thats why I dismissed this theory initially. But as I learned in medical school, a type IV hypersensitivity reaction is DEFINITELY something that can be felt.. And that's what is occurring here, as your immune system marches out WBC's to battle.\nSo, with my theory that mites were the cause of my past 10+ years of misery, it was time to CONFIRM it by doing an anti-mite therapy\u2026\nTOPICAL ATTEMPTS:\nThanks to a doctor in the family I was able to procure 5% permethrin, the gold standard for scabies treatment. Now, I knew I did not have scabies (thank heavens), but numerous posts on here and on the internet testified to its efficacy against Demodex. I began a daily treatment for 2 weeks, hoping and waiting\u2026.\nNothing. No improvement. I was devastated. It seemed I had run out of possibilities and leads, and was facing \"idiopathic\" acne.. a.k.a. \"don't know why you've got this.\"\nI had heard a lot about demodexsolutions but was highly skeptical of them. Their site was archaic, and they were halfway across the world. With desperation mounting, I ordered 2 vials of ZZ cream.\nThey arrived about a week later and I began applying it twice daily on my spots. Now, let me tell you, within minutes of applying this cream I began feeling a soothing relief on my lesions. I'm not saying it was a magic cure - maybe it was just the mint tingling - but having tried dozens and dozens of different things, ZZ cream just felt different. It felt soothing. Every morning I woke up and my painful pimples would have shrunk by a little. My Demodex theory began to gain traction!\nUntil, trouble struck. I woke up one day and had 3 new nasty nodules in my torso :'(\nThe tubs of ZZ cream were extremely expensive for the amount I received (I would run out of a tub after a week and that was only with spreading it on active lesions, each one cost around $35-40) and I didn't find this to be a sustainable solution. I also had a feeling that, while effective, it wasn't enough to eradicate an infestation as widespread as mine.. I was heart broken.\nThat's when I came across this thread:\nAnd on this thread, I was led to this article:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197121201315X\ntl;dr of the article:\nIvermectin and metronidazole are commonly used for various bacterial and parasitic infections. Ivermectin acts on invertebrate-specific ion channels, while metronidazole inhibits DNA synthesis primarily in anaerobic cells. (a.k.a., they have an extremely safe clinical profile on humans. In fact, Ivermectin is one of the pharmaceutical pinnacles when looking at efficacy to minimal side effect ratio if dosed correctly)\nThe most interesting result in that study to me was the figure showing the reduction in Demodex over the course of 4 weeks.\nIt shows that a combined metronidazole+ivermectin therapy was more effective than ivermectin alone. By 2 weeks in, the mite density had approximately halved, and 4 weeks in was reduced by 90%.\nSo, I got ivermectin and metronidazole and began the next chapter in my life.\nSo, I proceeded to obtain ivermectin and metronidazole and followed the dosing regimen in the study.\nTHE CURE .2mg/kg ivermectin on Day 0 and Day 14 (for me this came out to 18 mg each time. Up to 30mg on humans has been shown to be safe, and doses 10x that [as in, 2mg/kg] in rodents have been safe). 250mg metronidazole 3x a day for 4 weeks\nWithin a week, my acne had gotten better by about 50%. Now, at 2 weeks, I'd say its close to 75% cured. I have never seen results this fast and consistently. I expect that I (and anyone else with a demodex infestation causing acne) will still need prophylactic measures upon completing this regimen. I am unsure of whether that will be a once or twice-a-month dose of ivermectin, or if perhaps a topical application of tea tree oil + 91% isopropyl alcohol (shown to be effective against demodex) will be sufficient. I will keep you posted on that.\nI am thankful beyond words to have found this treatment. I plan to check this thread at least weekly for the next several years in order to give back to this community that finally helped me cure this dreadful, painful, ugly affiliation. Once my back is completely cured I will begin applying biooil to fade the hyperpigmented scars.\nFor obtaining ivermectin and metronidazole (which are available by prescription, and should definitely NOT be obtained from local or online aquarium/veterinary supply shops and measured out in a milligram scale and dissolving the ivermectin in a oil or pure 160+ proof vodka since it does not dissolve in water like its friend metronidazole ) the recommended practice would be to take the study to your physician along with an easily searchable pharmaceutical fact sheet about the safety of these drugs (Physicians are trained in med school to throw antibiotics, topical retinoids, and consults to derm at anything resembling acne and many will consider a psychiatric evaluation if you start mentioning demodex without bringing this information in hand) and ask plainly and simply for what you want.\nMy experience with this forum is that there are people who will be quick to point out flaws in my approach, and provide criticism. I have nothing to benefit from this post besides the pleasure of helping other people accomplish something more quickly and painlessly then I had to battle 10+ years for.Many of you have been conditioned to roll your eyes at the very mention of the word \"demodex.\" I hope you can find a cure, but please do consider the information in this post.\nGood luck to all. You do not have to resign yourself to decades of suffering. Derms told me my only hope was Accutane (which I already did, and it has a proven 75+% reoccurrence rate a.k.a. the acne comes back but not before causing potentially irreversible side effects in youor waiting till I am 40+ years old. I look forward to hearing from you. Edited Friday at 11:49 PM by 99f\nclarification Kicking acne's butt since 2017\nDemodex mites are often elevated in facial/body acne and rosacea sufferers. The most effective treatment is oral ivermectin-metronidazole.

He holds a degree from Boston University and an MBA from University of California. He joined Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, in 2014. In his future role, Nambiar will report to Kai Beckmann, CEO Performance Materials and Member of the Executive Board of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. \u201cAnand joined us with AZ Electronic Materials, so he is very familiar with our materials business for the semiconductor industry,\u201d said Beckmann. \u201cHe has proven his management capabilities in different roles across the globe. I\u2019m convinced Anand will lead our semiconductor materials business into a bright future.\u201dThe move once again demonstrates the Group\u2019s commitment to grow leaders across businesses and its ability to fill leadership positions with experienced managers from within the company. \nAnand Nambiar will succeed Rico Wiedenbruch (47) who has decided to leave the company and take a break for private reasons. Beckmann explicitly regretted Wiedenbruch\u2019s decision: \u201cI would like to sincerely thank Rico for his great achievements and dedication. He established our materials business for the semiconductor industry as a growing business with excellent opportunities. I would have liked to keep Rico on my Leadership Team. While I regret his decision very much, I do respect his private motives.\u201dThe business with semiconductor materials became part of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, through the acquisition of AZ Electronic Materials where Wiedenbruch had led the respective business since 2012. During the first nine months of 2017, the business unit delivered strong organic growth, with dielectrics and deposition materials for chip production performing well in particular.In order to ensure a smooth transition, Wiedenbruch will continue to lead the business unit until the end of March 2018 and will serve as an advisor until mid 2018.

We are here to assist you toward a better understanding of the emotions some of you are experiencing at this time.  This year, many are finding that holiday lights do not seem to be as bright, festivities not as attractive,  shopping more of a burden, and that holiday celebrations no longer hold the same sense of excitement and enjoyment that they used to.   This is because your evolving energetic frequency has shifted you out of alignment with much that up to now you enjoyed.   Foods, entertainments, friends, etc. as well as many traditions  no longer hold the same value they once held,  which can make things difficult when you are in situations surrounded by people still  in alignment with these things.  Because you have evolved,  attempts to  revive the past  and \"get on board\" as before,  simply will not work.   This does not mean you will never again enjoy these things but rather means, you will begin to see and experience them in new ways and with a deeper understanding of what they represent rather than from a level that is in alignment with the emotionally based commercial hype being broadcast to you 24/7.    Excitement and celebrations will no longer be as intense as they were in the past simply because you are now experiencing them from a different level of awareness.   The world will continue to push and many will accept  holiday concepts whether they be traditions or simply TV promotions because these things hold the promise of that happiness and love everyone seeks. Most of these promotions are based in the belief of lack and limitation and as long as there remains a receptive audience at that level, they will continue.   Businesses functioning from the third dimensional sense of lack and limitation are beginning to sense change, which is causing them to  intensify sales efforts through ever more promotions, gimmicks, and emotional nonsense.   In order to be successful in the new energies,  businesses must begin to function at the level of these new energies, which is the level of love and gratitude.   Love ( I lovingly do my best to  provide for you what you need.)   Gratitude  (You respond with  just and fair payment.)   An example of a higher resonating business is one in which the owner and workers go out of their way to make things right for a customer even to the point of occasionally telling them that they really don't need the particular product or service.  An old energy business is one that really doesn't care about its services or product, customers, or employees as long as the sale is made.   Things will never again be as they once were.  The idea of the \"Good ol days\" is a myth.  In reality these were times in which a great deal of darkness and density was either well hidden or accepted by a society with rigid concepts of morality.   Evolution cannot be stopped.  Mankind is graduating and cannot go back to places  outgrown, although many are trying.   We wish to speak on the subject of disease.  Disease simply refers to interrupted/discordant energy (dis-ease)  within one or more of your bodies--physical, mental, emotional, or even spiritual.   Dis-ease  perfectly reflects duality and separation and has become  firmly established in world consciousness because of the many un-awakened lifetimes everyone has lived within that belief system.   God does not. nor cannot  sustain or maintain anything unlike itself for IT is all there is.  If disease was a Divine Idea in the mind of God, it would be forever incurable, held permanently in place by Divine Law.   At this time when a great deal of cellular clearing is taking place, most of you are experiencing various physical symptoms.  However, disease is still being formed anew from an alignment with certain belief systems, cellular memory of some disease still active, and occasionally a specifically chosen lesson.   You are creators.   Whenever society directs attention to a specific disease in some way, it automatically causes it to become more fully integrated into the universal human mind as a power.   Because you are spiritual beings, your real body is spiritual.  Everyone has a permanent spiritual energetic body, but the density of the third dimension requires  a physical (denser) body.  Every soul chooses pre-birth and with guidance;  their parents, time of  birth, name (if parents can intuit it),  gender, and a vehicle that would best serve them in accomplishing what they have chosen to learn while on earth.   Some souls specifically choose a  body with physical or mental imperfections because it will perfectly serve their soul growth or that of the parents. (These are usually soul group decisions.)  The soul does not enter at conception, as many believe,  but most will  go in and out until the later phases of gestation when it permanently enters its chosen vehicle.  This leaves time for a soul to decide if the vehicle,  parents, and situation are those that will best meet their intentions.   Never judge yourself or others according to any physical, emotional, or mental issues you or they may be dealing with. The appearance of a perfect physical body does not always reflect a high state of consciousness because the energy of duality always manifests as  pairs of opposites.  The sick or deformed body, or  the mentally impaired person you see may be an evolved soul who out of love, chose that particular vehicle in order to assist with another's learning process.   In reality, as with everything in the material world, the physical body is simply a three dimensional interpretation of the perfect spiritual body, but that level of awareness has not yet been attained by most. After incarnating into  third dimensional energy,  most forget and begin to accept beliefs and concepts  based in duality and separation setting the stage for accidents, disease, and discords of every kind. \nAs a soul evolves and becomes aware of who and what they are, this is automatically reflected in the physical. The best anti-aging, beauty treatment is meditation because it aligns a person with their true self.  This is how Jesus performed so called miracles.   Because those seeking help  aligned with his state of consciousness, a consciousness devoid of any beliefs of disease, the outer appearances of discord simply dissolved, having nothing to feed and support them.   This was not healing nor was it a miracle, rather it was a revealing--a revealing of the universal reality which is never personal or limited to one special person but is rather the natural expression of an attained consciousness of truth.   As mankind begins to realize that dis-ease is formed from energies of duality and separation, they will  begin to cease creating them.  Age and deterioration, lack and limitation, sickness and health are firmly imbedded beliefs promoted throughout the world as reality but which in reality are concepts based in the belief in them.   Health is an area where the majority have given their personal power away in deference to the \"experts\".  Many still believe themselves to be at the mercy of their body and so from a level of fear embrace every new promotion or \"expert\" advice regarding what foods to eat,  what exercises to do, and everything  \"bad\" for them--concepts that more often than not, become obsolete as soon as a new \"expert\" comes along.  What may be right for one, may be totally wrong for another because everyone is an individual expression of Source.   Food is actually the material sense of energy.  At a certain point in the evolutionary process you will begin to get your energy directly rather than needing to get it from material food.  This is why you may hear or read about people who do not need to eat (fruitarians, breatharians) and is also why many of you are now experiencing smaller appetites.  (You are beginning to get your energy from within, and don't need as much physical food.)   Most do not realize that health is an area where power needs to be reclaimed.  It is a gradual process that few have fully attained at this point.  It is very  important not to fall into the trap of  believing that you have somehow spiritually failed if you get sick or are experiencing some disease.   Rather than aligning with whatever is being touted as the latest health trend, trust your intuition to guide you in knowing what foods, exercise, or actions are appropriate for you.  You will discover that some ideas will resonate in a way that you respond to and others will not--trust this.  When you live from this level, those things right for you may seem to come from some person, article, class, etc. but in reality, will be coming from your own state of consciousness, through them.   It is important not to ignore something physical in the belief that you are \"above\" needing human help or that you must handle it \"spiritually\".  Be very honest with yourselves, trusting your intuition and never pretending a state of consciousness not yet attained.  Most importantly do not fall into a sense of guilt when you feel the need to seek help.  Help is available on all levels of awareness and you do not spiritually regress if you hold truth within as you realize a need to seek it.   On earth there are many basic reasons for the  body to function less than optimum, false foods, separation from the healing energies of nature, and  even the pollution you breath and drink in every day effects your physical body until you attain and are able to live out from a consciousness of their non power.   You are learning to move beyond world beliefs and not react with fear and trepidation to every ache and pain with visualizations of diseases and dire events.  Instead use every experience as a tool to  remember and more fully integrate the truth that you are a divine being with a body of Light who happens to be using a physical vehicle at this time in order to learn and experience.   You are NOT YOUR BODY , you have a body, but you are not a body.  Just as with your  automobile, you take care of it,  wash it,  fuel it,  and give it regular maintenance,  but you never become it.

About 300 households without safe drinking water. \nThe damage on infrastructure impacted negatively on the wellbeing of learners particularly girls who lost most of their study time lost as they had to walk longer distances to fetch water. \n\u201cBefore the intervention, walking long distances uphill with a 20 liter bucket on our heads left us physically exhausted and emotionally spent,\u201d lamented 16 year old Joyline. Odrie Ziro, Welt Hunger Emergency WASH Coordinator echoed similar sentiments revealing that the flood had impacted negatively on the lives of women and girls. \u201cThe energy that can be used for other activities is actually spend in trying to collect water from far down the valley. This has had more impact on the girl child as she does a lot of fetching as compared to their male counterparts,\u201d she said. \nThrough funding from Government of Korea, UNICEF Zimbabwe partnered Welt Hunger Welfare in rehabilitating Esikhoveni piped water scheme and install a solar-powered system. An additional deep borehole was drilled to augment the old one. A 100 000 liter tank that supplies water to a village stretching over 12.5km was also rehabilitated. The piped water scheme removes the burden of distance as water taps are now within a 500m radius from the nearest households. \u201cAs a community that depends on agriculture they would not do their agricultural activities as they spent a lot of time going down the valley to fetch some water. That has changed now,\u201d Ziro says. \nThe piped water scheme will also have a positive bearing on hygiene issues. Ziro explains \n\u201cWhen water is scarce, people have a tendency to use as little water as possible to wash their hands. They may even forgo the critical times you would want them to wash their hands, thereby risk diarrhea diseases. Now that water is at their doorsteps that risk is alleviated,\u201d she explained. \nThe intervention also improved the lives of villagers in Ntabamuhlope village whose piped water scheme was also rehabilitated. The faulty electrical power system was replaced by a solar-powered piped water scheme which now guarantees the community a reliable water supply. Mandlenkosi Sigola, a visually impaired beneficiary, expressed gratitude at the development as it improved not only water supply but also hygiene. \u201c\u201cWe are grateful for the water. I find it easier to keep my toilet clean as water is right in front of my house,\u201d he said. \nA Water Point Committee manages the piped water scheme and a constitution governing use has been drafted and will be discussed with community members before adoption and submission to the district.
