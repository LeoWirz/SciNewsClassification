Both had their fair share of 'characters'. One particularly hot summer afternoon while I was there directing traffic on horseback one of the patrons from the Royal Exhibition emerged carrying a schooner of beer and a five-gallon bucket of water. He promptly placed the bucket in front of the horse and handed me the schooner, turned around and left. The horse refused his free drink whilst the jockey disposed of his responsibly.\" \nNot quite the Norm. \"'Free Jock' is spray-painted on a pylon leading into Bathurst Street in Sydney. Does anyone know the story behind Jock?\" asks Gail Grogan of Constitution Hill. \nThe man himself, Harry Bell from Bowral (C8), writes: \"Yes, Jude, I still wake each morning and gather my wits; I open the Herald , and read the Obits. If my name's not there, then I know I'm not dead. So I eat a good breakfast and go back to bed (or to my laptop).\" On a more serious note he adds: \"Judges' Associates were more than Court officials. They were friends, indispensable confidantes and (in country towns) hard working Clerks. It is alway a pleasure to hear from/of them.\" \nColleen Burke of Drummoyne is perplexed: \"What happened to spreading peace and joy at this time of the year? My husband opened his Christmas bonbon at a city restaurant yesterday to find the toy inside was a miniature soldier with rifle poised ready to shoot. His dining companion also got a soldier, this one with a bayonet.\" \nMore fruit (C8).\"One of my neighbours has a giant prickly pear cactus that is currently bearing fruit,\" writes Meri Will of Dee Why. \"Is this fruit edible? How does one go about picking, preparing and eating prickly pears?\" Carefully would be our only suggestion, very carefully. \nAnother citizenship test perhaps? Peter Riley of Penrith found it curious that many politicians put a horizontal line through the number 7 on their signed and dated citizenship declarations. \"Malcolm Turnbull, Bill Shorten and many others use the European style. That's not how kids are taught to write in Australia. Is this a quirk or a political foible?\" Originally published on smh.com.au as ' Column 8 '.

The Henry   celebrated her outstanding service with a retirement party held on November 16, 2017, hosted by Dr. Celeste Kong, Professor and Chair of the Department of General Dentistry. Mrs. Tomassetti\u2019s well-deserved retirement will begin on January 1, 2018. \nSusan began at BU in 1970, when she took the position of Staff Assistant in the School of Social Work. Just a year later, she made the jump to the College of Arts and Sciences, where she served as the Department Administrator in the Department of Political Science for eight years. \nSusan then moved to the University Professors Program (UNI), where she held the position of Assistant Director from 1981-2009. While working with UNI, Mrs. Tomassetti led the development and management of the academic budget, grant accounts, and the course scheduling system. She also served as the Alumni Relations Officer, where she planned and organized all programmatic events for alumni, and represented UNI on University-wide committees. \nIn 2009, Susan became the Assistant to Doug Sears, Vice President and Chief of Staff to President Brown, and Assistant to the Director of Military Education. She held these positions for three years, in which time she was responsible for obtaining and organizing data for reports to the New England Association of Schools and Colleges; running the day-to-day operations of the largest ROTC program in New England; managing military faculty appointments for each unit; and maintaining Mr. Sears\u2019 schedule and office, among other tasks. \nMrs. Tomassetti finally made the move to GSDM in 2009, when she accepted the role of Administrative Manager in the Department of General Dentistry, where she has excelled.

Updated 27 minutes ago Toymaker Lego wins Chinese copyright case against brick imitators Reuters Staff 3 Min Read COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Lego has won a landmark case in China against two companies that manufactured and sold toys almost identical to its LEGO Friends range but branded Bela, the Danish toymaker said. Sets of Lego bricks are seen at a toy store in Bonn, Germany, September 5, 2017. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay It is the first time that Lego has succeeded in a copyright competition case in China, where copies of its colourful bricks and figures have been a recurrent problem as it seeks to gain share in the $31 billion (\u00a323.1 billion) toys and games market. Earlier this year, the Beijing Higher Court passed a ruling that recognised the Lego logo and name in Chinese as \u2018well-known\u2019 trademarks in China, putting the toymaker in a better position to act against infringement of its trademarks. The China Shantou Intermediate People\u2019s Court had ruled that \u201ccertain Bela products infringed upon the copyrights of the Lego Group and that manufacturing and selling of those products constituted acts of unfair competition\u201d, Lego said in a statement on Thursday. The court also decided that Lego is protected under Chinese \u201canti-unfair competition law\u201d for \u201cthe distinctive and unique appearance of certain decorative aspects of its packaging across particular product lines (in this case, LEGO Friends)\u201d Capturing the imaginations of Chinese children with its bricks is key to reviving growth for the unlisted company after disappointing revenues in its core U.S. and European markets has brought an end to a decade-long sales boom. Lego, whose name is derived from the Danish \u201cleg godt\u201d meaning \u201cplay well\u201d, is competing with Barbie maker Mattel Inc and Hasbro, the firm behind My Little Pony, for a slice of the Chinese market. The case was filed against two Chinese companies, which had been manufacturing and selling Bela products that were almost identical to Lego\u2018s. They will now have to stop copying Lego\u2019s packaging and logos, it said. \u201cWe think this is very important for the continued development of a favourable business environment for all companies operating in the Chinese market,\u201d Lego\u2019s vice president of legal affairs, Peter Thorslund Kjaer said.

Where is this claim of unlimited scaling >?\n\n3) Spam attacks - why would you attack a tangle with spam if you are not benefiting from it . Email scammers are at least profiting from data... Tangle spamming does nothing at all \n\n4) ALL EXCHANGES have frozen WITHDRAWALS to your iota wallets. Why would they do that during the biggest price jump.. You own Iota, you would like to transfer it back into the exchange, BUT YOU CANT , because the TANGLE OWNS YOU ... Hold your IOTAS till the dev dumps more iotas into the exchange and cashs out for a massive massive profit ..\n\n5) Why would you own IOTA if it was completely useless. ?

We say, sod off. Send her a message\u201d.\nAnd in a video filmed outside Holyrood , the group\u2019s spokesman says \u201cseparatists\u201d want to use the \u201cdevolved assembly\u201d to block a UK-wide vote on Brexit.\nThe group opposes more powers for Holyrood on the grounds it would harm the Union.\nThe campaign has been set up by David Clews and Kyle Coats, who until last month were development manager and social media coordinator respectively at Scotland in Union.\nMr Clews, a former Renfrewshire councillor, said Scotland in Union was too \u201cscared\u201d to talk about Brexit, but UK Unity was \u201centhusiastic\u201d about making it part of the case for the UK.\nANALYSIS: Meet Scotland's alternative unionists\nUnless Unionists dealt with Brexit head-on, the SNP would demonise it to undermine the Union and engineer another referendum, he told the Herald.\nWith a \u00a31000 start-up budget, the London-registered group claims to have signed up more than 2000 supporters in a fortnight, with a social media campaign reaching 1m people.\nWith a blunt, confrontational style designed to set it apart from Scotland in Union, the goal is to replace it as the country\u2019s main non-party campaign for Unionism.\nRenfrew-born Mr Clews, 35, said: \u201cScotland in Union are agnostic on Brexit. They don\u2019t have a view on it, which is ludicrous when it\u2019s the only issue being talked about just now.\n\u201cI said they should at least come out and discuss it, but they were too scared of touching it.\n\u201cIntrinsically, all the people are Remainers. But it was a UK-wide decision and we have to respect it. What I\u2019m arguing is that with Brexit there is hope. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom.\u201d\nElected a Tory councillor in 2007, Mr Clews defected to Labour in 2011, and left elected politics in 2012, but remains an \u201con/off Labour member\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cI would describe ourselves as populist. We believe that in Scotland there\u2019s a need for a much more aggressive pro-UK campaign, one that can remind people of the hope that being part of the UK can bring.\u201d\nSNP MSP George Adam said: \u201cIt's refreshing to see the ultra-unionists experiment with independence - taking their own future into their own hands. But it's little wonder that this right-wing front is tearing itself apart over Brexit - much like the Tory party.\u201d\nThe split comes amid signs of strain at Scotland in Union.\nANALYSIS: Meet Scotland's alternative unionists\nA \u00a3250-a-plate fundraiser at Edinburgh \u2019s Prestonfield House raised an estimated \u00a3350,000 in late 2016 thanks to blue-chip patrons and a jaw-droppingly extravagant auction.\nWith guide prices up to \u00a312,500, lots included stays at private safari lodges in Kenya and Botswana, French and Swiss skiing chalets, centre court seats at Wimbledon, a polo festival in India, and assorted deer stalking, fishing and grouse shooting events in the Highlands.\nThere was a \u00a3100-a-ticket raffle to win a Mini Cooper convertible, a VIP tour of the Rangers FC training facility and seats in a director\u2019s box courtesy of Paul Murray, and a signed copy of the JK Rowling novel, A Casual Vacancy.\nIn January, with speculation mounting Nicola Sturgeon would call a second referendum, it hired former Labour MSP Graeme Pearson as its \u00a350,000-a-year chief executive.\nHe admitted he had \u201cnever heard\u201d of the group, which claims to have 25,000 supporters.\nBut after Ms Sturgeon delayed her plans, Mr Pearson quit in August and was replaced by Pamela Nash, the former Labour MP for Airdrie & Shotts.\nThis autumn, Scotland in Union held \u00a3150 and \u00a3100-a-plate fundraisers in London and Edinburgh, but on a far more modest scale than last year.\nAuction lots in London included a team building event at the Go Ape Tree Top Adventure, golf at Woburn, a brewery tour, and three nights in an Edinburgh flat.\nRaffle prizes included Union cufflinks, a sports shop voucher, and, instead of JK Rowling, a signed copy of Alex Salmond : My Part in His Downfall by Telegraph veteran Alan Cochrane.\nAsked if Scotland in Union was still cutting it, Mr Pearson said: \u201cI would like to hope so.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cThe challenge for Scotland in Union, given the Nationalist debate has gone into a cupboard because it\u2019s inconvenient, is to maintain some kind of opposition and be ready when the Nationalists come out to fight their argument again.\u201d\nAlastair Cameron, Scotland in Union\u2019s founder and executive director, denied it had lost its way.\nHe said: \u201cScotland in Union has no link to them [UK Unity] at all. I would not call them a breakaway group. I\u2019d call them individuals who were with Scotland in Union who have decided to do something else.\n\u201cIn terms of their suggestion that Scotland in Union has had is day, I don\u2019t think any of us who are with Scotland in Union would believe that is the case.\n\u201cWe think there is still an urgent need for a pro-UK, non-party campaign. Scotland in Union does not take a position on Brexit. Neither Leave nor Remain strengthens the case for separating Scotland from the rest of the UK.\n\u201cThe new group is not in any way connected to Scotland in Union. They\u2019ve gone and done something different - analogous to someone working for a medium-sized company going and setting up their own venture, but it\u2019s not in any way connected to or endorsed by [us].\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jk rowling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan cochrane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george adam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david clews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle coats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicola sturgeon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex salmond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alastair cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pamela nash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cooper", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "airdrie & shotts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ms sturgeon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "telegraph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour msp graeme pearson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prestonfield house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rangers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "union", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wimbledon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renfrewshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "highlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holyrood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "botswana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk unity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:43.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d74becb44453d970a3247b3d60d0cccbd1f3fec4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcaEpr0Q7xVsXO92W1D1CnUVoiWU5T6aL7H1LC.TIYeuhGBzr5gumVsDgINlqjNmfYa3ANS5bmVnBvEd5.YqdUThhnstTf1LZ1BTYbLKwbVeu_mx.hiLWN4xb8_jNvTzDw", "site_full": "www.heraldscotland.com", "site": "heraldscotland.com", "site_section": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/homenews/", "site_categories": ["media", "climbing", "sports"], "section_title": "Home news from the HeraldScotland", "title": "Unionist campaign splits over Brexit and second referendum", "title_full": "Unionist campaign splits over Brexit and second referendum | HeraldScotland", "published": "2017-12-07T07:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 49, "participants_count": 34, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.132, "main_image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7151032/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d0194987c93aabafd3101f977bdc36aa3789827", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcaEpr0Q7xVsXO92W1D1CnUVoiWU5T6aL7H1LC.TIYeuhGBzr5gumVsDgINlqjNmfYa3ANS5bmVnBvEd5.YqdUThhnstTf1LZ1BTYbLKwbVeu_mx.hiLWN481XESARfgQnIc.MmWp1ud0-", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "Peter Moseley", "published": "2017-12-07T09:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "[Quote: ] [bold] Malcolm Quote: : Life of Britain:Scotland in Union: \\\"The only people we hate more than the separatists are f", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:43.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3932add7b094ab32a0bd3845a88b00ae745d7842", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqIPOAqF97r3Or7uTVKw7xI.0G27P2Hti3iL85q.c69iv7V11a3d5.bRbNhSz72zzBrEemQHKgwYnvk2LT2jL_ubmRqbZYkAmCZDhsaLLMeKfAJBYcQ4llkzaq2Gbf4.jcc-", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "http://www.marketwatch.com/rss/topstories", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "MarketWatch.com -
