Could you be a gardener without knowing about plants. What about being a doctor without knowing about the human body, diseases, and medicines? To do a job well, you have to learn about your job or business. Once someone is trained to do a job, they have to be willing to do the hard things in their job. If a person is an athlete, she has to keep her body fit and play by the rules of the sport. If a person is a nurse, he has to be prepared to work with sick people, give needles, and sometimes work the night shift. Someone who is a teacher has to be willing to prepare lessons and mark homework. Being a worker for Jesus means training and hard work too. And no matter what other jobs we do, if we are Jesus\u2019 followers, we are His workers as well. Which things below might be training for this job? Can you think of more? 1. Memorize Bible verses. 2. Spend a lot of time shopping at the mall. 3. Help out in Sunday School. 4. Work on the committee of your youth group. 5. Watch TV every chance you get. 6. Have a time every day when you read your Bible and pray. 7. Learn how to introduce someone to Jesus. 8. 9. PRAYER: Dear God, please help me be a good worker for You, so when I see You, I will not be ashamed. Amen.

He is a photographer and digital artist, and in both genres, he pushes the boundaries and turns art on its head. His artworks get very unusual receptions. \nHis photography is initially confusing, before you try to appreciate it as a work of genius. His technique of disrupting an image by presenting it in an unfamiliar form to achieve an intentional effect of control over his audience, suggests the omnipresent and undesirable web that he wants to (de)construct and reinvent in order to \u201cregain moral order\u201d by mimicry and hyperbole. \nAs such, for example, the artist creates art from fashion mannequins to convey a narrative of coping with the breakdown of moral order and the impersonality of everyday life. He seems to decry the mundane nature of humanity in the 21st century resulting from over dependence on the internet, and denounces the extreme bombardment of inane adverts online. \nThis artistic mockery is also evident in his photographic construction of a series of images #Politicianeyes (Let me help you lead you) that expose the realities of power structures beyond the mere reportage style typical of photographers. He delves deeper and boldly presents his audience with campaign posters of candidates seeking political office (Parliament) caked with dirt and weariness around Kampala city. The contrast of seeking high political office with filthy posters suggests the disengagement between the political elite and the majority of the impoverished city urbanites. While these out of context images can be read as a direct attack on a political sphere that relates directly to Uganda, the theme of corruption extends itself to human nature as a whole when we examine other works in which Rumanzi presents himself as a figure central to the art. \nAs such, Rumanzi\u2019s personality is a replication of his art with its unpredictable and chaotic nature. He is both quiet and talkative with a penchant for world histories, politics, philosophies and literature. He also loves to analyze those around him and himself. His whimsical character embodies the disorderly terrain of Kampala city where he partly assumes the role of a protagonist who conveys the contradictions of the urbanites- perhaps himself included- to a wider global society. \nIt is the introspective approach that culminates in deeper engagements with the audience, while inviting dialogue on the subject of human character viz-a viz the artist. The artist\u2019s injection of his character into art makes it gain credibility as a masterpiece of his creation that undeniably represents him figuratively. As such, Rumanzi art projects the power of fusing an artist\u2019s personality into art while turning art on its head. \nIt is similar to a phenomenon caused by a photo that appeared on the cover of New York Times Magazine in 1985 of American artist Jean Michel Basquiat wearing a dark Georgio Armani suit with white shirt and tie, leaning in a chair, one bare foot on the floor, and the other up in the chair suggested the power of the extraordinary in art. \nThe portrait quickly elicited mammoth approvals from art critics and fashion pundits and defined what character the artist wanted to always project: a living piece of art walking on the streets of downtown New York. Basquiat had the ability to make art from anything, including himself, and his inspiration for his craft was diverse: from dressing up in high fashion Armani suits, sometimes splashed on with paint, to fusing mysterious elements of texts and colour, historical references, and abstract and figurative techniques in his work. His work was layered with muted tones of racism, power, money and authority.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "basquiat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rumanzi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominic muwanguzi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgio armani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean michel basquiat", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "canon rumanzi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kampala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uganda", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:26.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "191896dd857b5c183e4c448eb8f74f58b9db719a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPJcWh73UHIfso7ceIO5V0RFRKz99o6wHat3a4B6xsc4ZRF9vjY_7Y587tZzAxefaooW7cySH_5CnSnqhgDh.Vz65QYdTxixijka4lZ_qi78gyq5UDUOFqnk", "site_full": "www.avforums.com", "site": "avforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.avforums.com/forums/blu-ray-dvd-discs.168/", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Blu-ray &amp; DVD discs | AVForums", "title": "What was your last Blu-ray purchase?

And the thing is these deflationary factors have not been talked about a lot by the Fed (call it ignorance, what you will).

And that these spying techniques were used over a year ago? \nIt appears the identities of those who were spied upon may have been \u201cunmasked\u201d for political reasons, and Senator Rand Paul wants to find out the truth! Is the onus all on Susan Rice, or her former boss, Barack Obama? \nFrom Western Journalism: \nAllegations that former national security director Susan Rice unmasked Trump transition officials are only the tip of the iceberg, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said Wednesday. \nPaul noted that if the privacy of Americans connected to the Trump team could be violated, so could the privacy of millions of others. He also had a question he said Rice needs to answer. \n\u201cDid the president direct you to eavesdrop and sift through intelligence?\u201d Paul said. \n\u201cIf someone were investigating the Trump administration, it ought to be the FBI not someone in the White House,\u201d Paul added. \u201cShe\u2019s a political appointee that reports directly to the president.\u201d \nPaul said the American people need some straight answers, which have not been forthcoming. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think she answered the question, \u2018Did she unmask people in the Trump administration?\u2019 She said, \u2018Maybe I did, but I didn\u2019t do it for political reasons,\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think it\u2019s incumbent on her to show to the American people why it wouldn\u2019t have been a political reason.\u201d \nThe broader issue, according to Paul, is the attack on American\u2019s privacy. \n\u201cDid you know that over a million Americans\u2019 phone calls are listened to without a warrant?\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to protect American privacy. We can\u2019t allow intelligence to be used for political purposes.\u201d \n\u201cThe fact that there could be a political figure in the Obama administration that was purposely searching a database, looking for Trump officials, I think confirms exactly what the president said when he said that the Obama administration was doing something nefarious with regard to surveillance on his transition team. And it sounds like they were,\u201d Paul said Tuesday. \nImage result for barack wiretap \nHe told Fox News that there was no \u201clegitimate reason for [Rice] to be searching a database and unmasking people.\u201d \n\u201cThis is a real separation of powers issue. And it shouldn\u2019t be happening,\u201d he added. \n\u201cMillions of Americans\u2019 data and phone calls are in this data bank,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe should not let political figures search this data bank for political purpose or for any kind of personal purposes.\u201d \n\u201cFor years, both progressives and libertarians have been complaining about these backdoor searches,\u201d Paul said Tuesday on MSNBC. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re searching maybe one foreign leader and who they talk to; we search everything in the whole world. There were reports a couple of years ago that all of Italy\u2019s phone calls were absorbed in a one-month period of time.

They were huge red cysts with three heads each that would grow on both cheeks (almost symmetrically), and wouldn't stop being inflamed for two weeks at a time. It was ugly and really painful, and they left marks that would not go away for atleast three months and scars that are still on my cheeks.\nAs I went from acne-free to covered in horrible red acne and scars on my face I became depressed and lost five kgs. I also started to *lose my hair* and had *dry flaky skin on my palms and face*. The skin on my palms would peel off and my hair would fall in clumps. I noticed a decrease in the *quality of hair, which became extremely dry, frizzy and lost its overall shape and texture*. I felt like I had a different person's hair on my head. I went to several doctor's who could not help me, and I got hormone and thyroid tests done which did not tell me anything. After studying my acne and symptoms over a year I self-diagnosed myself with hypothyroidism. Self-diagnosis can be dangerous, but sometimes it's about reading your body's signals. As I took measures to deal with hypothyroidism, my acne went away and I have been cyst-free for six months now. Here is what helped and what didn't:\nWhat did not help:\nCutting carbs : Helped with weight-loss but acne kept coming\nDrinking lemon water in the morning: Good habit but cysts continued\nBurdock Root: did not take full dose and suffered from horrible purging breakouts over jawline on both sides of my face\nGreen Tea: Helped with overall health and skin but cysts continued\nVitamin A and D :Helped with overall skin but did not do anything for cystic acne\nWhat really helped:\nCalming myself down: stressing about my cysts made them worse\nMakeup and concealer: You can always conceal redness; it took me a while to discover this and I have been at peace since then, cysts or no\nALOE VERA: This gel is magic and will speed up scar healing so much, and make your skin glowy. Tip: Keep it on overnight, on full face.\nZinc: I started taking 15mg of zinc daily because it can support your thyroid. This was the key to being cyst-free. It might not work for everyone, but my hair and skin only returned to normal once I began to take zinc. Don't take too much! [I take 15mg Zinc Gluconate daily from Holland and Barrett. I've been taking one every day for a year now with no side-effects. No nausea or hair loss; my hair is almost too thick right now.]\nSelenium: I eat one brazil nut everyday. I have not had a single cyst or even big pimple since. It can really support your thyroid. Try it! It's magic. From my experience, zinc is not enough, but in combination with selenium I have almost zero acne issues.\nMagnesium: I swam in the ocean for a week, and when my skin and hair drastically improved, that's when I suspected I might have thyroid issues. I don't know whether it is the magnesium or zinc or whatever mineral that is present in sea water that did it, but it changed my skin health soooo drastically (just a week!) that it was insane. So try magnesium sprays, tablets, or a swim in the ocean!\nIt's depressing to deal with acne but try and listen to your body. Don't go gluten and dairy free without ruling out hormonal or thyroid and other endocrine issues. Two years ago I was in a horrible place, and was constantly sad about my skin. Today it's something I think about maybe once a month, and only if I can see my scars. Otherwise I can get away without washing my face, eating like crap, being stressed, getting no sleep, having sex, etc. without it showing on my skin! It's only because I know my body needs certain nutrients. If you have any of these symptoms, try what I did!

The report published by The Citizen Lab, a laboratory at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto says the Ethiopians created an online campaign which targeted dissidents, journalists, and those who advocated the Oromo ethnic group across 20 countries. It reports the Ethiopian government infected the computers of these targets using the PC Surveillance System (PSS), a commercial spyware system developed by Cyberbit, a subsidiary of Elbit. This is not the first time Israeli spyware is identified by Citizen Lab but it is the first time spyware is identified as a method to track anti-supporters as a cyber campaign. The Toronto researchers who reported it in The Citizen Lab discovered a digital fingerprint called logfile, which gave them the opportunity to follow this Ethiopian campaign for more than a year. In response to a request for comment from Calcalist, who published an article on the findings, Cyberbit said, \u201cIntelligence and defense organizations buying the products are required to use them by law, and in accordance with the jurisdiction given to them by law. Cyberbit does not operate its products, and like other Israeli and non-Israeli defense companies, it is not fully aware of the way its products are being used in covert by nature activities by intelligence and defense agencies. In light of this, Cyberbit is committed to full confidentiality with regard to its clients and is not able to refer to any specific deal it has made, or to any specific client. The company\u2019s products aid the national security of countries in which they are sold, and state agencies in such countries are required to operate these products within the law.\u201d Founded in 1966 and based in Haifa, Elbit, the defense and homeland security manufacturer, has also acquired the intelligence division of Israel-based intent-based solutions company NICE Systems for $158,9 million, merging it into Cyberbit. The company has just announced it has signed a $74 million deal with the Israeli Ministry of Defense for a 13-year contract.

Developments in the automation industry (driven by increasing population and therefore disposable income as well as high standards of living) also motivate the automotive garage equipment market. Rising concerns about post-purchasing maintenance of vehicles also count as an important propellant. \nRequest Report Brochure @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=21578 \nThe market can segmented on the basis of types of garage into the independent, dealership, specialty, mobile service concept van, and other varieties. In terms of types of vehicles, the market can be divided into the following categories: two wheelers, passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, and heavy commercial vehicles. Types of equipment include vehicle lifters, MOT & ATL, roller brake testers, wheel balancers, wheel alignment, exhaust emission analyzers, dispensers & drainers, battery changers, automotive jacks, cord reels, and others. Vehicle lifters are mechanical instruments used to lift vehicles while roller brake testers detect the brake performance of trucks and trailers without calculating the stopping distance of vehicles. Wheel aligners adjust the angles of the wheels in a manner so that they are perpendicular to the ground and parallel to each other. Wheel balancers spin the wheels without causing them to vibrate. Exhaust emission analyzers perform the function of detecting diesel, gasoline, and natural gas leaks from vehicles. Automotive jacks, such as hydraulic jacks, are employed to create pressure to lift heavy vehicles off the ground, enabling easy repairing. Mechanical jacks are available in the form of screw jacks. Cord reels play the role of license plate holders. \nRequest For Customization@ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=CR&rep_id=21578 \nBased on garage type, independent garages are low-cost local automobile repair shops which offer a range of personalized services, dealership garages sign contracts with automobile showrooms and offer routine check-ups, while mobile mini vans are portable garages mainly found in developed nations of North America and Europe. \nBy geography, the market can be distributed over North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and Latin America. North America is leading the market for automotive garage equipment owing to its well-grown, technologically developed manufacturing sector and automotive industry. Its population is also considered to possess high purchasing power. Europe acquired the second leading market share due to Germany being a globally dominant producer of high-end automotive vehicles and equipment. The market performance of Asia Pacific is also commendable and likely to improve further in the near future. Japan and China are technologically well-established with healthy manufacturing sectors. Recent trends have displayed India to be emerging, with its adoption of macro-economic changes, improvements in GDP, and rise in the disposable income of its population. Furthermore, globalization has led to the importing of new technologies which has resulted in the advent of more-high end garages providing solutions for high-end cars. \nLeading companies operating in this market include Delphi in the U.S., Auto Serv in the U.K., SKF Lubrication Systems GmbH and Geneart AG in Germany, and Manatec, ATS ELGI, and Jetage in India.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ats elgi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auto serv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delphi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skf lubrication systems gmbh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mot & atl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneart ag", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east & africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manatec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:28.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c224c4486e7c9085b27c12fbb1adb57274a8612", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR4WbPvBJfyDdGuUkELafiDW0PQ6C9iUXyBLu5OWEGcJeIlMiXyIPnsZZgVlejmFYVcdHsRlgGRsB1FGDbSpbi0hIoLkQJamsqoaZg.U5zLeQ--", "site_full": "www.talkbass.com", "site": "talkbass.com", "site_section": "https://www.talkbass.com/forums/strings-bg.16/", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health"], "section_title": "Strings [BG] | TalkBass.com", "title": "Tapewound string for high-F (7 string bass)", "title_full": "Tapewound string for high-F (7 string bass) | TalkBass.com", "published": "2017-12-06T18:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.talkbass.com/styles/flatawesomeplus/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31197, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8e74388112b0bdd84a5296aaf3cb75aadde209e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR4WbPvBJfyDdGuUkELafiDW0PQ6C9iUXyBLu5OWEGcJeIlMiXyIPnsZZgVlejmFYVcdHsRlgGRsB1FGDbSpbi0hIoLkQJamsrI6fyn6shn85m_NsM_zivr", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "lz4005", "published": "2017-12-06T11:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Root 5 said: \u2191 Isn't a high F around .020\"?

Wall colors fade and crack, and flooring and carpeting can stain and become worn. The same goes for all the appliances in a bathroom and kitchen. All of this can lead many homeowners to an \u201caha\u201d moment, when they realize they need to think about planning a fix up for their home, to restore its luster, as well as its resale value.\n\nStart The Plan \n\nPlanning a remodel can seem a daunting task, but the truth is, with the help of experienced home renovation contractors , a remodel can be a project well worth doing. Many homeowners pay for a remodel by taking out a home equity loan, and if they can get a loan at a low interest rate, it can be a wise way to add value back into the house.\n\nYes, remodeling does require some work and planning. There are a wealth of creative ideas in online home decorating sites, and these can be a good way for the homeowner to see what certain colors and textures look like in an actual home. Once a good idea for the remodel has been developed, it\u2019s time to start looking for the right contractor to guide the process. \n\nFinding That Great Contractor \n\nLuckily there are now great resources online for finding good contractors. Many sites offer listings of reputable local contractors, along with samples of their past work and client reviews. Homeowners can scan these listings until they find a good candidate. A phone consultation with the candidate can offer an opportunity for discussing the project at length, and getting some cost estimates. From there, an agreement can be signed and the real work of remodeling the home can get under way.\n\nThe contractor should guide the process and keep it on budget. it\u2019s important to make any major design changes while still in the plan phase, before money is spent on labor or materials. Once the work really begins, the contractor will partner with the homeowner to ensure the project stays on track.\n\nYes, remodeling a home is a major project, but done well, it can be immensely rewarding, and it can pay major dividends too. So why wait? Start planning that remodel today!\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "time", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:30.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41dc185f65983f8dafcd8d1127cf90007614a4d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.A6XYV4xAnxs17HzcM2B5_TmF2oS.7aws2u7Vh6vID0j0XILnZtyhZ3HhJ3be60zjXwYnUwfJGuPEJAwqVJmNCLgZsoev9YoENIqfhlDK1tA--", "site_full": "www.amamascorneroftheworld.com", "site": "amamascorneroftheworld.com", "site_section": "http://www.amamascorneroftheworld.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "A Mama's Corner of the World", "title": "Hypatia of Alexandria Book Spotlight & Giveaway", "title_full": "Hypatia of Alexandria Book Spotlight & Giveaway", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "41dc185f65983f8dafcd8d1127cf90007614a4d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.A6XYV4xAnxs17HzcM2B5_TmF2oS.7aws2u7Vh6vID0j0XILnZtyhZ3HhJ3be60zjXwYnUwfJGuPEJAwqVJmNCLgZsoev9YoENIqfhlDK1tA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Angela Thompson (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hypatia of Alexandria Book Spotlight & Giveaway", "text": "This morning, I am featuring Hypatia of Alexandria by Laurel A.

Keep Reading And Learn", "text": "Have you ever wanted to change something about the way you look? With plastic surgery, not only is it possible, is is commonplace. There are all kinds of surgeries you can have done these days. Here are some cosmetic surgery tips, to help you decide if this is something for you.\nIt is important to find out more about the recovery following an operation; some patients may have to spend an entire month resting. By being sure you know about your procedure and the recovery time, it\u2019s easier to integrate the surgery into your life.\nYou should ask specific questions and think about certain issues when you are selecting a cosmetic surgeon. You should not select a surgeon on price alone. You will want a board-certified surgeon. You want a surgeon who takes the time to answer your questions and fears. more resources should trust your instinct, if your surgeon makes your uncomfortable, you should find another one.\n\nWhile it can be easy to overlook, make sure you investigate the surgery center in addition to the surgeon. The place that the procedure is going to be performed at should be licensed, or accredited. Discuss this with the doctor. If you find out that the center does not have one of these qualifications, rethink your decision to have your procedure performed there.\nBefore you need it, raise as much of the money as you can for your plastic surgery. While there are pricing options available to you, they often have interest rates that you can avoid. To avoid high financing fees, simply take the time to raise your own money before the surgery.\nAsk about different options for the anesthesia. For major interventions, a general anesthesia is best, but you should know about the risks involved. You have the right to ask for a general or a local anesthesia but do more research so you can make an educated decision. Ask your surgeon to have a qualified nurse assists him or her for the anesthesia if necessary.\nWhen it comes to your health and cosmetic surgery, be sure that you make sure that you are having plastic surgery done for the right reasons. This is important because you want to make sure that you decide why you are having it done in order to ensure that you are not making a poor decision.\nBefore you have surgery, validate the credentials of the surgeon. Make certain they have the education, and experience to perform the procedure. This simple step helps to ensure a positive outcome from the surgery. You should also ensure that their license, and insurance is current, and valid in your state.\nBe certain to inquire about the length of the recovery period and aftercare procedures. Depending on the procedure, you may need a good amount of time before you can go back to work and resume your regular activities. Don\u2019t try and do too much too soon; be realistic during your recovery period.\nEven if your surgeon suggests multiple procedures, consider having just one surgery done at a time. The more surgeries that are performed at the same time, the higher the risk for complications and errors. Having multiple surgeries at the same time means you as the patient are under anaesthetic for a longer time, which carries its own set of risks.\nYou should know the type of care you will need after your surgery. This is important in order to make sure that you can plan not only for yourself, but also so that others can free up their time if you do require additional assistance.\n\nBefore you go in to have cosmetic surgery, take anything you may need in your home and place it on lower shelves and out in the open. This is a good idea because you want to stretch as little as possible after having surgery done. Straining too much can cause some damage.\nWhen considering cosmetic surgery, make sure that you include all of the costs involved, when checking to see whether you can fit it into your budget. Additionally, be aware that the same procedure can cost thousands more, depending upon where you live. For example, the cost for a rhinoplasty procedure ranges from $7,000 to $13,000 in New York City. It can cost significantly less in other parts of the country.\nMake sure that you do not have painted nails when you go in to have plastic surgery. The doctor will need to check your nails for any signs that your body is not getting enough oxygen after the anesthesia is given. Painted neails will make it nearly impossible for them to tell.\nThe traditional medical advice of getting a second opinion for any diagnosis still applies to cosmetic surgery. If a doctor is absolutely confident, they can perform a procedure for you with minimal or even no risk, check things out with an alternative practitioner. If possible, get a third opinion in case the first two conflict in their advice.\nSearch the Internet for patients who have had the procedure you want. If you can, try to establish contact with these patients. They will be able to tell you which doctors to use, and which to stay away from. Also, these people may be able to provide you with what you can, and can\u2019t expect from the procedure.\nBefore undergoing a surgery there are several vitamins, and minerals that you need in a daily regimen. These include Vitamins A, C, and E. After you are in the recovery period, there are a few extra vitamins. B6 and B12 that you will want to add to the previous ones.\nWhile diet is always important, it should be maintained throughout your life. It is especially important around one month before a plastic surgery. A proper diet means, that your body is better prepared to heal itself in the recovery period. Avoid fried, or fatty foods. Stick with healthy whole carbs, and proteins.\nWhen looking for a cosmetic surgeon, price should not be a deciding factor in the surgeon that you choose. Do not simply go with the surgeon who has the lowest price. Price is not an indication of the quality of the surgeon, and the results you receive. It could be an indication of their experience. Even if, they will be the one doing the surgery.\nPlastic surgery has many benefits, but there are also risks involved. https://pagesix.com/2017/04/04/melanie-griffith-on-plastic-surgery-hopefully-i-look-more-normal-now/ need to educate yourself about what you\u2019re getting into so you can minimize risks and accept the limitations of surgery.

The museum tweeted that \u201cDa Vinci\u2019s Salvator Mundi is coming to #LouvreAbuDhabi,\u201d which was confirmed by Christie\u2019s, the auction house that handled the sale of the painting. Christie\u2019s declined to say whether the museum bought the painting.

The painting, the title of which means \u201cSavior of the World\u201d in English, was the most expensive painting ever sold at auction.

Loaded with innovation and a well-crafted waxing and waning of intensity, Inertia is most closely reminiscent of The Rose Chronicles, Single Gun Theory and Bill Leeb\u2019s project Delerium\u201d \u2013 Big Takeover Magazine \n\u201cAdd a cauldron, Curve, Bloody Knives, darkwave, Nine Inch Nails, Wolfgang Press, and mix everything up nicely. The result is We Are Parasols. Their sound really goes far beyond genres and subgenres, exuding modernity\u2026. This seems as if an obscure Beggars Banquet\u2019s album. \u2018Inertia\u2019 is one of the records of the year, inspiring and instigating us with its mix of shadows and dreamery\u201d \u2013 The Blog That Celebrates Itself \n\u201cInertia is 13 sonic gems that slip into one\u2019s ears like honey slides down the tongue\u2026 A unique voice in Portland\u2019s, or the world-at-large\u2019s, music scene\u201d \u2013 Northwest Music Scene No Movement Records has announced the forthcoming release of their sophomore album \u2018Inertia\u2019 from We Are Parasols , a Portland-based alternative trio known for making music that simultaneously embraces several genres while walking the thin line between dark and light. It will be made available on cassette and digitally.\nA throbbing beat. Machines on march. Guitars can be a drill or sing like an angel. A voice like a computer caught in a human throat. A whisper. A howl. Synthesizers are sometimes smooth and glassy, sometimes jagged and bloody. A walk on the shore can easily turn into an apocalyptic landscape, depending on your perception.\nInfluenced by Curve, Wire, Cocteau Twins, Depeche Mode, Gazelle Twin, Skinny Puppy, Nine Inch Nails and Bloody Knives , their new offerings on \u2018Inertia\u2019 features tracks ranging from the analogue postpunk near-industrial enigma of projects like Clan of Xymox and The Tear Garden to electronic dark reverie similar to Delerium and Gazelle Twin classics to the stripped back melancholy served up by This Mortal Coil .\nDubbing their own music as \u2018industrialgaze\u2019 and \u2018darkwave\u2019, We Are Parasols is comprised of D (vocals and bass), Jerman (guitars, piano, synthesizers, programming, and samples), and Alec Eye (drums, programming, and synthesizers).\n\u201cI have a stronger desire \u2014 or, really, a need \u2014 to continue to make and perform music. So that deep need often overrides the fears I have about creating and sharing our art, and performing live,\u201d says D .\nWe Are Parasols began as a shoegaze-electronic hybrid band. Their debut full-length \u2018Infrastructure\u2019 was followed by their \u2018bite_your_tongue\u2019 EP , a more minimal ambient release. The song \u2018No Movement\u2019 off the band\u2019s debut album, which was about an android sex worker, ultimately spawned the musical world of their new album \u2018Inertia\u2019.\n\u2018Inertia\u2019 combines industrial, shoegaze, dream pop and darkwave with sci-fi in order to tell a dystopian, possibly humanist, probably anti-human, story about violence, technology, politics, control, and an android feminist anti-hero known only as a synthetic sexual tasked android body.\nThere are 13 tracks on the cassette version of the EP, which comes with a full color 4-panel J-Card featuring all the lyrics, as well as a digital download (a poster is also available). While these same 13 tracks are available through online stores and streaming platforms everywhere, the Bandcamp edition includes a special bonus track \u2013 \u2018hush (Piano Version)\u2019 \u2013 especially for lovers of early 4AD output .\nOn December 8, \u2018Inertia\u2019 will be released via No Movement Records, a Portland-based label and artist cooperative lead by Jeremy Wilkins, focusing on a darker, electronic-based sound and fully committed ourselves to releasing cassette tapes. The album can already be ordered in both formats via Bandcamp . \nWe Are Parasols will perform next at Portland\u2019s Brickbat Mansion on December 1. RSVP via Facebook or email at rsvp@thesteepandthornywaytoheaven.com Admission is free, but anyone who donates of $5 or more gets an \u2018Inertia\u2019 poster with a download card.\nTRACK LIST 1. data

told member states that the British government has till Friday evening to agree on a potential deal or else negotiations will not move on to the next stage. Barnier informed EU ambassadors that Downing Street had told him a potential solution was being worked out that could possibly satisfy both Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Ireland, but that it had yet to be signed off by any of those involved, the Guardian reported on Thursday. Another meeting of diplomats of the 27 member states has been scheduled for Friday evening. If the UK fails to agree a joint position with the European commission by Friday, the member states informed Barnier that they would not have time to take it back to their capitals for scrutiny ahead of next week\u2019s critical European council meeting. In that scenario, the leaders would once again rule that insufficient progress had been made on the opening issues of citizens\u2019 rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border for talks on trade and a transition period to start. A failure to move talks on in December would mean that the terms of a transition period could potentially only be discussed after the next European council summit of leaders in March 2018, by which time key businesses in the UK will have had to make decisions over their location and investments in the country, the Guardian reported. It is possible that the leaders would call an emergency summit in January or February 2018 to agree to move talks on and discuss the terms of a transition period. The UK is set to exit the EU by March 2019.
