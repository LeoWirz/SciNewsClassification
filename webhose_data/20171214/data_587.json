The Dragons didn\u2019t want to wait for news from Leipzig - where the home club actually lost - and quickly tried to secure the three points (they were winning 3-0 at halftime) and get to the ten points mark they needed to assure the second place in Group G, behind Besiktas.\nThe Dragons were above all strong and effective: they didn\u2019t give an easy time to Monaco's attack \u2013 the French team was already eliminated from European competitions, but had a strategy clearly set in counterattack designed by Leonardo Jardim \u2013 and, whenever they reached the area, the Dragons created difficulties. The duo Brahimi and Aboubakar, which led to two of the first three goals, was decisive for a victory that confirmed FC Porto as, once again, the only Portuguese club to reach the last 16.\nBefore starting the match, S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o had a bad surprise: Ot\u00e1vio had to stay out of the team due to a last minute injury, and Andr\u00e9 Andr\u00e9, the only news in regards to Friday's classic, went in. But when the ball began to roll, good news soon came: Aboubakar's early goal nine minutes in (after a great Brahimi pass) gave the blue and whites an important comfort for what was to come.\nDominant and more objective than a shy opponent, FC Porto ended the first-half with a comfortable lead. Aboubakar made it 2-0 on minute 33 - after an attack that started on the right, but that came to the left, to the Cameroonian\u2019s feet, who dribbled Glik before beating Benaglio - and the 3-0 came just before the break, this time with Aboubakar passing to Brahimi for a classy finish.\nBetween the two goals, Ghezzal and Felipe were sent-off, after a disagreement initiated by the opponent, which ended up being decisive for a second-half that had everything to be boring, but that instead became more open.\nThe opponent made it 3-1, 61 minutes in, from penalty, by Glik, after a play in which the referee considered Marcano played the ball with his hand \u2013 too bad that he didn\u2019t see two other plays for penalty in Monaco\u2019s area. More stretched out on the pitch than in the first-half, Monaco was also seeing the ball getting to their area more frequently, and, in a beautiful crossed shot with his left foot, Alex Telles made it 4-1, four minutes later, that killed any chance of recovery for the opponent.\nEven before the final whistle, the match continued to be entertaining, as former blue and white coach Quinito would say, and had two more goals: Falcao, returning to Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o, made it 4-2, 77 minutes in, and was applauded; Soares, who replaced Aboubakar, still had time to secure a 5-2 win 88 minutes in. This time FC Porto didn\u2019t win 3-0, as in the previous two official matches, but again won by three goals.

Denver, Cleveland and NYG are slated to pick QBs by most of the experts (although i think Cleveland should stick with Kizer but whatever browns gonna brown), leaving a void for the teams behind us, most QB hungry ones being Cincy, Arizona, Miami, NYJets ( even tho im head over heels for McCown) Green Bay ( only if ARoD peaces them for better waters ) and Jacksonville although they might get Eli which im all for. So in a draft with highly touted QB talent and clearly many QB hungry teams willing to pay to win early, what do you guys think a good price would be for our Number 5 pick? \nPersonally it would have to be a superstar player along with multiple mid round picks IE: Cincy sends us AJ Green and 2 3rds and a 5th for that Pick, or NYJ hands over Powell and Wilkerson plus picks etc you get the Gist \nlet me know some wild ( but believable) trade scenarios in the comments below! \nalso Side note im a HUGE no to Trading Luck we have the nicest human in the world with a godsend of an Arm you cant put a price on that, especially if hes still a top 5 QB with a destroyed shoulder  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

Slager, who fatally shot a black motorist in 2015, could learn his fate as soon as Wednesday afternoon, Dec. 6, 2017, as his federal sentencing hearing winds down on its third day. (Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via AP, Pool, File) \nCHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) \u2014 For three days, attorneys representing the federal government and a former South Carolina officer charged in an unarmed black motorist\u2019s shooting death have presented technical testimony to a judge to consider how much time Michael Slager should spend in federal prison. \nThat includes use of Slager\u2019s stun gun, which the former officer says Walter Scott grabbed and turned on him, causing Slager, who is white, to fear for his life and shoot in self-defense, firing five times into his back as he ran away. \nOn Thursday, attorneys are expected to call friends and relatives of both men who will tell the judge the effect Scott\u2019s death and the officer\u2019s arrest have had on their lives. What\u2019s known as victim impact testimony is intended to help the judge determining the defendant\u2019s sentence weigh the personal implications a crime has had. \nA preview of that testimony came Wednesday, when Scott\u2019s youngest son spoke to the court so he could return to his high school classes. Clutching a photograph of his father, Miles Scott said he has had trouble sleeping ever since his father\u2019s death. He said he misses watching football games with his dad and can\u2019t fathom not being able to watch with him the game they both loved. \n\u201cI miss my father every day,\u201d Miles Scott said through tears. \u201cI would like you to sentence the defendant to the strongest sentence the laws allows because he murdered my one and only father.\u201d \nSlager, 36, pleaded guilty in May to violating Walter Scott\u2019s civil rights. Federal officials have recommended 10 to nearly 13 years in prison, but his attorneys argue Slager should face far less time. \nSlager pulled Scott over for a broken brake light in April 2015, and Scott, 50, ran during the stop. After deploying his stun gun, Slager fired eight bullets at Scott as he ran away, hitting him five times in the back. \nBefore he hands down Slager\u2019s sentence, U.S. District Judge David Norton must decide whether the April 2015 shooting was second-degree murder or manslaughter. Slager faced murder charges in state court, but a jury in that case deadlocked last year and the state charges were dropped as part of his federal plea deal. \nSlager has said the two men scuffled and he fired in self-defense after Scott grabbed his stun gun. In his closing argument, defense attorney Andy Savage acknowledged the shooting was criminal but reiterated the stance that his client was protecting himself and feared for his own safety. \nDuring closing arguments, prosecutor Jared Fishman disputed that story. \n\u201cWalter Scott never assaulted the defendant. Walter Scott never took the defendant\u2019s Taser,\u201d Fishman said. \nThe attorney portrayed Slager as a calm, calculated officer who hadn\u2019t killed Scott in a moment of passion but did so intentionally \u2014 a hallmark of murder, not manslaughter. \n\u201cHe was not in a frenzy,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cHe was not in the throes of passion.\u201d \nFishman also said Slager had changed his story several times as to what he remembered about the shooting, including flawed state trial testimony about Scott charging him with his own stun gun. Fishman said those statements aren\u2019t backed up by evidence. \n\u201cThis is not memory loss,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cThis is a concerted, deliberate effort to obstruct justice and to cover up for his unjustified shooting.\u201d \nIn an unusual move, attorneys for Slager called the state prosecutor to the stand to question her about their assertions that she and federal prosecutors unfairly teamed up on Slager. \nSolicitor Scarlett Wilson said she had interacted with federal prosecutors but couldn\u2019t recall specific contacts and hadn\u2019t planned prosecutorial decisions with them. \nAlso Wednesday, Scott\u2019s mother, Judy Scott, said she was on the phone with her son when he was pulled over and told him to comply with the officer\u2019s demands \u201cso there wouldn\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d \n___ \nKinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Personally, I\u2019m eyeing the Personal Essays critique because I\u2019d like an expert to pick apart my essays (I\u2019ve never been formally trained in that area of writing). If your writer wants to improve their craft, give them a gift from Writer\u2019s Digest. \n#3 Amazon Kindle Unlimited Every prolific writer is an avid reader. Reading good writing is the best way to improve one\u2019s own, so I highly recommend purchasing a Kindle Unlimited subscription so your writer will be able to read over 1 million ebooks each month! \n#4 On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction This book, as its subtitle states, is a classic. I own it, and I still am moved by the introductory chapter in which the author explains why using precise language is vital to protecting truth in society. This would make a great gift for nonfiction writers. Click here to see the latest price for On Writing Well #5 Elements of Style (Illustrated) This is every grammar geek\u2019s favorite book. I used to own two different editions of it (one was a gift from a friend, the other was a gift to myself) until I became a minimalist and gave away most of my books. I regret giving this particular one away. I loved the illustrated version; it\u2019s quirky and humorous. Click here to check the latest price of The Elements of Style #6 Writer\u2019s Market 2018 If your writer friend is interested in selling their writing, THIS is the book to get them.

If your writer friend is interested in writing for newspapers or magazines, the AP Stylebook is a must-have. Click here to check the latest price of The Associated Press Stylebook 2017 #8 The Chicago Manual of Style (Book Publishing) The Chicago Manual of Style is typically used in book publishing (fiction and nonfiction). So if your writer is interested in being published, this is the book for them! \n#9 MLA Handbook (Academia) Yet another style guide is MLA. This one is most commonly used in academic settings, so if your writer is studying English, Literature, or Creative Writing, this is likely the guide they\u2019ll need. \n#10 Grammarly Premium Grammarly is an app that\u2019s like Spell Check on steroids. It does so much more, and I run all my articles through it before sending them off to my clients\u2014and yes, Grammarly catches things that I didn\u2019t. The Grammarly Premium subscription is the perfect gift for a writer because it unlocks so many features that will uplevel their writing, such as style suggestions and sentence structure checks. Want proof that getting Grammarly will help your writer improve? Here ya go: Click here to help your writer friend uplevel their game with Grammarly Premium #11 A Writer\u2019s Retreat Of all the unique gifts for writers, this is the most valuable. Every writer dreams of a place where they get to do nothing but focus on their writing and get expert insight from more advanced writers. I have longed to go on a writer\u2019s retreat for two years now but have yet to go because they tend to be pricey. Alexis Grant of The Write Life recommends The Porches writer\u2019s retreat in the Virginian countryside because it\u2019s high quality and inexpensive. Rates are about $390/week, though it\u2019s not nearly as guided as more expensive writer\u2019s retreats. As for me? I\u2019ve been longing for the Write Away Europe France Writer\u2019s Retreat held in the French countryside in June. They also have other inspiring locales for their retreats.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexis grant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grammarly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "unique gifts for writers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digest critiques & workshops writer\u2019s digest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mla handbook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:05.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40cb817a8f3cc2b8d8c74bd46feb2573bfd045fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlRNQbuGr0BZgw0Oep68YAT", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "/brit/ the british culture general", "title_full": "/int/ - /brit/ the british culture general - International - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T12:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 293, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f75c31dce2ae90780bcd937efa95f485e4235bfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlRNQbuGr0BZqALVEG0eSjxzL3lyYUNeLo-", "ord_in_thread": 68, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>82716394\nLondon", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:05.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e9ac4b193646832ca6dc33d6050a3ada7f9bddd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1oZMyfOIQ8.JS5v.T.q2cgw", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "Adamu selects 10 players for COPA Lagos tourney", "title_full": "Adamu selects 10 players for COPA Lagos tourney", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e9ac4b193646832ca6dc33d6050a3ada7f9bddd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1oZMyfOIQ8.JS5v.T.q2cgw", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "Adamu selects 10 players for COPA Lagos tourney", "text": "18 hours ago Adamu selects 10 players for COPA Lagos tourney Ten players have been selected at the Brinin-Kebbi camp of the Super Sand Eagles for the COPA Lagos Beach Soccer Tournament opening, in Lagos, on December 8.

This same figure is thought to be likely for the 14 year old boy as Epic Games has not motivation to bankrupt these players, so I think a hefty fine will stop them from ruining the game for others.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "charles vraspir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "torrentfreak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vraspir", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "epic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delaware", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:05.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0cda2043bb995fb9d321ec2abe074ac4d79df18a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1rOPqiqAQIhhrUtEqtAt8uM", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "Shocking!!!!

Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital despite intense Arab, Muslim and European opposition to a move that would upend decades of U.S. policy and risk potentially violent protests. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) \nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s move to recognize the divided city of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital may have triggered a worldwide chorus of critics but the president had his ears closely tuned to his supporters at home. \nFor Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \n\u201cWhile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\u201d the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \u201cToday, I am delivering.\u201d \nThose were words to savor for a president who\u2019s been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed \u2014 sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns. \nRepealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump\u2019s frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel\u2019s claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He\u2019s now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president\u2019s former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president\u2019s action. \n\u201cIf I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\u201d said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cAny move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\u201d \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump\u2019s words about the embassy as \u201cjust a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\u201d \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump\u2019s campaign operation trumpeted: \u201cJerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\u201d And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \u201ccontinues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\u201d \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\u201cMy hope is it doesn\u2019t change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\u201d said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \u201ctriumph of domestic politics and personal ego\u201d over \u201csound foreign policy.\u201d \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem\u2019s borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \u201can agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\u201d \nThe president hasn\u2019t hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \u201cI will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\u201cWhat he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\u201d said Brinkley. \u201cIt\u2019s making people feel there\u2019s activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\u201d \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "white house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:05.043+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "404ecc26ad0b3393db0fe3d3b0916989209823e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxdQX0XQMFNoU4jaKP_qcvVLHFk4.NYKHaRrswPdYIbBE", "site_full": "blog.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/blog?query=a&start=271&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "[\uc601\uc5b4\ud1a0\ud53d] \ud3c9\ucc3d \ub871\ud328\ub529 \ud604\uc0c1", "title_full": "[\uc601\uc5b4\ud1a0\ud53d] \ud3c9\ucc3d \ub871\ud328\ub529 \ud604\uc0c1 : \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ube14\ub85c\uadf8", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "KS", "spam_score": 0.359, "main_image": "http://blogthumb2.naver.net/MjAxNzEyMDdfMTQg/MDAxNTEyNjM3MTg0NzA2.SRj8SxwO9BeqQajwlGK_BXki5tLEkAcyvWVgtxE0l64g.rBcydtNbr0F6RGvl704qqMMaNOm2Nnld05HrghqtloAg.JPEG.xcus/Screenshot_1.jpg?type=w2", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "404ecc26ad0b3393db0fe3d3b0916989209823e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxdQX0XQMFNoU4jaKP_qcvVLHFk4.NYKHaRrswPdYIbBE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NOWWHAT", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "[\uc601\uc5b4\ud1a0\ud53d] \ud3c9\ucc3d \ub871\ud328\ub529 \ud604\uc0c1", "text": "\ud3c9\ucc3d \ub871\ud328\ub529\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc774\uc57c\uae30\ub97c \ud574\ubcf4\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace7 \ub610 \ud3c9\ucc3d\uc2e0\ubc1c\uc774 \ub098\uc624\ub354\uad70\uc694.\n\uc65c \uc774\ub7f0\uac78 \uc904\uc11c\uc11c \uc0ac\ub294\uc9c0, \uc65c \ub2e4 \ub611\uac19\uc740 \uc637\uc744 \uc785\uc73c\ub824 \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc774\uc57c\uae30\ub97c \ud574\ubd05\uc2dc\ub2e4.\nhttp://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2017/11/129_239482.html\nShoppers battle to buy Pyeongchang long padded coats People desperate to buy Pyeongchang long padded coats formed long queues outside official Winter Olympics Stores around Korea on S... koreatimes.co.kr\nShoppers battle to buy Pyeongchang long padded coats\nBy Chyung Eun-ju People desperate to buy Pyeongchang long padded coats formed long queues outside official Winter Olympics Stores around Korea on Saturday. The coats had sold out at online and offline stores within two weeks since going on sale on Oct. 26. Stocks were finally replenished on Saturday. Queues outside snaked more than several hundred meters hours before opening time, with some stores forced to call police. \"I have been waiting since 7:30 a.m., but I received ticket number 238,\" said Lee, a woman, 60. \"I am worried I won't be able to buy as many tickets as I want.\" About 700 people queued outside Lotte Department store in Jung-gu, with shoppers jostling for position.

A $25,000 ransom in bit coin was being sought for the files being held. County officials said late this afternoon they are not paying the ransom. (Diedra Laird/The Charlotte Observer via AP) \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County\u2019s computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina\u2019s most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county\u2019s computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won\u2019t significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\u201cI am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\u201d said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \u201cWe are slower, but we are up and running.\u201d \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state\u2019s largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven\u2019t affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common \u2014 and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco\u2019s mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \u201ceasy targets\u201d because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\u201cOnce you\u2019re in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\u201d he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it\u2019s taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county\u2019s 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn\u2019t able to gain access to individuals\u2019 health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county\u2019s chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \u201cpatience and hard work.\u201d \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew . \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dena diorio", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "irwin carmichael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith gregg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross rustici", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anjanette flowers grube", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cybereason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county sheriff\u2019s office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diedra laird/the charlotte observer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:06.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40cb817a8f3cc2b8d8c74bd46feb2573bfd045fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlRNQbuGr0BZgw0Oep68YAT", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ -
