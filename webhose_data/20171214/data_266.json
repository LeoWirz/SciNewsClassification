It compliments a meal as well as an occasion! Learning how to select the best wine, however, can be a bit challenging. The following article will help you in choosing a great wine and all that goes with it.\nA good tip if you\u2019d like to get more into wine is to come to your own conclusions. Everyone\u2019s a critic these days and wine is no exception. If you\u2019re just blindly following a so-called expert\u2019s advice, you\u2019d be doing yourself a disservice. Instead, try to figure out what you like on your own.\n\nParticularly if you are just discovering wine, don\u2019t buy too much of any one thing. You may want to grab several bottles of whatever you enjoy, but as you continue learning more, you are going to start to like different things. You probably won\u2019t be interested in the wine that you enjoyed several months ago.\nPurchase your inexpensive wines from a warmer climate. While there is no one rule for buying wines, in general, those from warmer climates have the most flavor and appeal. Consider France, California and regions in Australia when making your selection. This is a great way to make a quick choice in the grocery store and come home with a bottle that your guests are likely to enjoy.\nAll wines do not taste good while at the same temperature. White wines are better when they are cold, while red wines should be a little below room temperature. Drinking them at the wrong temperature can change the way they are supposed to take, which may change your overall opinion.\nParticularly if you are just discovering wine, don\u2019t buy too much of any one thing. You may want to grab several bottles of whatever you enjoy, but as you continue learning more, you are going to start to like different things. You probably won\u2019t be interested in the wine that you enjoyed several months ago.\nDo not go out and buy cases of wine just because you like the taste of it. Many times people\u2019s tastes change over time, which means that you may not like this particular wine forever. Buying it in bulk may have you stuck with a lot of wine that you no longer like.\nCelebrate with wines you enjoy. Restaurants, bars, and stores may promote certain brands of wine, especially ones that are related to celebrities. But you might find that it is very expensive. More costly wine doesn\u2019t always mean it\u2019s better in quality. Drink what you like.\nAvoid over chilling white wines. Many wine drinkers will buy a bottle of their favorite white and return home to pop it in the fridge. While chilling whites is important, too much cold will diminish flavors in the wine; sometimes the most important ones. Target a temperature around 60 degrees up to 68 degrees to achieve the prime flavor.\nDon\u2019t always believe everything you are told, even if the person claims to be a wine expert. A good expert will admit that they don\u2019t know everything. Keep in mind that everyone\u2019s wine preferences are different. You should never allow an expert opinion to override your own feelings.\nLearn the pronunciation of all of the wines that you serve so that you sound as professional as possible when you are around your guests. This can go a long way if you are having a party or get together with friends in your house. There are common names for wine, so get acquainted with the lingo.\nEffervescent wines and champagne are meant to be served chilled. The flavor is enhanced the colder it is, and it will not taste the same at room temperature. Leave your bottle of champagne in the fridge for at least two hours before serving.\nThe body of a wine is a great way to pair it with a dish. The \u201cbody\u201d of a wine refers to how substantial the wine is. It often also correlates with the alcohol content, with fuller-bodied wine containing more alcohol than a lighter wine. Heavier dishes should be paired with a full-bodied wine, as a lighter wine runs the risk of tasting watery when paired with something like a hearty steak.\nAlways know which check this site out are seasonal. Throughout the year, different wines may increase in popularity depending on the holiday or season. Port wines are an excellent example of this, as they tend to increase in price in the weeks leading up to Christmas. When you know wines by their seasons, you can purchase them off-season and save.\nNeed a lot of wine for a big wedding, party or other event? Consider buying Cava, which comes from Spain. This affordable style of wine never disappoints with its flavor, texture or price. There are many brands available, which will impress your guests and keep your budget well balanced, too.\n\nWant to know how grappa is made? Grape skins, called pomace, which remain from making wine are distilled. This ferments them to create a very strong beverage which is perfect as an aparatif or digestif. Want a real kick in your coffee? Add some grappa for a real wake-me-up in the morning!\nIt just makes senses to take all advice and reviews from wine \u201cexperts\u201d with a grain of salt. No expert in the world knows everything there is to know about wine, and the true experts will admit as much. Understand that a lot about the wine you choose will be personal preference.\nvisit the up coming internet page has helped you get started in discovering the wonderful world of wine.

He has undergone Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, an Ivor Lewis procedure, contracted Sepsis with a ventilator keeping him alive, suffered multiple organ failure, successfully overcoming all of this only to learn in late August, that his cancer had metastasised to his liver, small bowel and stomach which is now terminal. \nThe term \u2018Hockey Family\u2019 has become one commonly used in recent years, and exemplified none more so than within the Coventry Blaze fanbase, who with the hockey community as a whole came together to raise significant funds to help the club\u2019s all-time leading goal-scorer Adam Calder in his fight against cancer. \nMore recently though, it\u2019s Kevin whom the Blaze Family have come together to support, in a way that Wife Michelle describes as \u201canother level.\u201d \n\u201cNo matter how tired, ill or pained Kevin feels, the support network and the atmosphere at Blaze games will always inspire him and remind him to keep on fighting,\u201d Michelle said. \nRecognising the importance of the Blaze and the game to Kevin\u2019s fight, one of the Blaze Booster Club founders and popular 50/50 seller Tim Ansell, approached and worked with the Blaze management and Elite League to arrange a very special night to allow Kevin to become \u2018Coach\u2019 for the night against the Braehead Clan on 16th September 2017. \nOverwhelmed by the opportunity, a nervous \u2018Coach Kev\u2019 arrived at the Skydome Arena with his game face on, ready to go to work. He was met by the Head Coach Danny Stewart and Director of Hockey James Pease who took him through the game night routine, lines, the tactics and plans for the night. \nCoach Kevin was then sent to scout the Braehead warm-up, armed in the knowledge of what to look out for. \nThen it was game time. As the lights went out, Kevin stood pride of place at the centre of the Blaze bench, shoulder to shoulder with Stewart and Pease awaiting the arrival of his players for the night. \nGoals from Luke Ferrara and Marco Vallerand gave Blaze a strong 2-0 advantage going into the first period break, which for Kevin meant a relaxed experience in the dressing room. The middle twenty though were a different story with the only marker coming from Clan\u2019s Adam Brace for 2-1. Heated words this time were spoken by the Head Coach, the effect being two further Coventry goals from Jordan Pietrus and Ryan Dingle to wrap-up a home win and give Coach Kevin a 1-0 win record. Video Playback Not Supported \nKevin said of the experience, \u201cThe Coventry Blaze club welcomed me onto the bench and needless to say, this rare opportunity was emotional, exciting and I am very humbled to have been given this unique memory. I have ultimate respect for this club and was privileged to be allowed to be involved with such an open and honest management team. To say that my eyes were opened to the back-room aspect of the organisation, having spent a very informative few hours, would be an understatement. The insight into what goes on behind the scenes was very open, informative and refreshing and has given me an appreciation of matters that I may have incorrectly judged previously. \n\u201cGaining fist pumps from the guys in front of me when goals were scored, engaging with me above and beyond the call of duty, is testament to the kind of team we have here in Coventry. \n\u201cThe guys in the dressing room post-game allowed me to witness winning celebratory rituals, presenting me with a chorus of \u2018three cheers for Coach Kevin\u2019 and a signed stick with a personalised message on it. \n\u201cTo say that I have admiration for the Coventry Blaze management, team, volunteers and fans is an understatement. This \u2018one off\u2019 opportunity gave me a chance to create a fantastic memory which will be carried forward by my family for many years to come. We are all very humbled by the whole experience and the caring nature of the people that made this happen. \n\"Thank you is not a strong enough expression of gratitude for what this meant to my self-esteem and the positive impact it has had on my attitude to how I handle matters, that I have no control of, in the coming months. One thing that is for sure is my intent is to be at the Skydome for every game, cheering on my team, through thick and thin\u201d. \n\u201cOn a much lighter note, I can honestly say that I have retired from coaching with a 100% win-rate and that is something not many other coaches can say.\u201d All the best Kevin! Was great having you around yesterday! #1-0 \u00f0\u009f\u0090\u0089\u00f0\u009f\u0090\u00b2 \u2014 Ross Venus (@rvenus59) September 18, 2017 What a night!!! \u00f0\u009f\u008e\u0089 Was special for all of us also Kevin!

Ps Watch out for those pucks \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u009c \u2014 Ryan Dingle (@rdingle19) September 18, 2017 \nMichelle concluded, \"The support from the club, fan base and everyone involved with the Blaze has been amazing. Kevin takes great comfort knowing that I can, and will, continue to come along to the games and will never be on my own, as we have made many close friends who are a superb source of support, of whom we can't thank enough.\" \nArticle published in the current edition of our official magazine OnFire.

Ogogo and Emeagwai are Akinlabi\u2019s girlfriend and friend respectively. .\n.\nTheir car was stopped by 5 policemen including Abua, at a checkpoint along Igbuzo Market. One of the policemen, identified as Nwokolo, was said to have demanded money from Akinlabi and the driver told him that he did not have N200 to give him. .\n.\nNwokolo then reportedly demanded one of the N1,000 notes Jerry had on him. As Akinlabi drove off from the checkpoint, Abua reportedly shot at the car and bullets pierced the back of the vehicle, hitting Ogogo, who sat at the back seat. .\n.\nThe bullet also grazed the back of Emeagwai, who was at the passenger\u2019s seat. Akinlabi revealed that four cops, including the team leader, one ASP Akhabue, were detained by the police, while Abua evaded arrest. .\n.\nAkinlabi said he took the victims to a general hospital in Igbuzo, from where Ogogo was referred to the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba. He said he called a senior police officer at Asaba who notified the state Commissioner of Police of the incident. .\n.\nHe said, \u201cThe CP and the DPO of the Igbozo Police Station came to the FMC and deposited N100,000, but I have spent much more than that.

Among the 10-19 age group, 16 000 people died last year, a rise of 35% over 2010. \n\"The rise in youth mortality is a scandal,\" Marie-Pierre Poirier, Unicef's director for West and Central Africa, told AFP. \n\"Most of these teenagers are unaware of their HIV status,\" she said. \n\"Everyone is responsible. Support from international donors is insufficient for the region's needs. And governments must give priority to the fight against Aids, even if they have limited resources,\" she said. \nThe situation is not entirely bleak - the region slashed mother-to-child transmission of HIV by a third from 2010 and 2016 - nor is it the same everywhere. \n1.3 million awaiting treatment \nAdult HIV prevalence ranges from less than 0.4% in Niger to 6.2% in Equatorial Guinea, the figures show. Nearly half of all infected children in the region are in Nigeria. \nBut the major problems are common, say experts. \nOne is the lack of so-called point-of-care HIV tests, so that a patient can be diagnosed and immediately treated - a major step in prevention. \nAnother is availability of antiretroviral drugs, which suppress the virus but do not eliminate it. \nThe cost of Aids therapy has plummeted since the first triple-therapy drug regimen became available in 1996, and access to the lifeline - taken in a simple once-a-day pill - is spreading across parts of Africa. \nIn West and Central Africa, though, 1.3 million people who know they have HIV are still awaiting treatment. \nStigma and discrimination, as well as homophobia, are factors that help the virus to spread underground. \n\"We have to shift up gears, to that of 'emergency response,' we have to mobilise all of society - government, civil society, families,\" said Poirier. \nsubmitted via MyNews24 .

If you balance your budget you might find that you are spending a LOT of money eating out. If you do decide to eat out, see if there is any good deals for your local area on some of the better places you like to eat. *Trust me I work in a restaurant, watch the big increase spending items*( appetizers,dessert,*ALCOHOL*)\nWell, hello Newbie!\n{Deleted excerpt about walking uphill in the snow both ways to save a $1 and grab a baggie floating by in the breeze to wash out for later BACK IN MY DAY.}\nThis one I wanted to dive into a bit more.\nWe like to eat out occasionally, and here's what we've found to save $$ while doing so:\n1) Water. Drink water, saving about $2 a person at the table in the cost of tea or pop.\n2) If there is a place you really like, check out the website - there are often coupons or daily specials that can stretch your dollar. Our favorite pizza joint offers a Sunday carryout special on a pizza and four salads for $25 - since what we love about them is their pizza AND their salads, this is a treat we can afford for our family.\n3) Along the same lines, check out the website for their lunch menu. We've found we can save quite a bit on a more realistic portion size of our favorite meals, at our favorite places, if we go during lunch. Some places offer lunch on Saturday as well, but my husband and I will also have a \"date\" mid-day mid-week instead of at night, saving us some $$.\n4) Consider sharing an entree, or ordering an app and one entree to share. This can save us $10 or more per outing, plus some calories, as I usually eat like a bird and my husband usually cleans all the plates.\n*CLEANING SUPPLIES AND EVERYDAY USE ITEMS*\nFind out what you actually use, then buy that as cheaply as possible.\nFor example, I splurge on two items in particular - those wet cleaning wipes for the kitchen, and detergent.\nI used to make our own detergent, and it worked fabulously. As my finances loosened up a bit, I decided it was worth the cost of buying again to recoup my time. I then found a detergent I like (All free and clear). So - instead of worrying about all sorts of detergent sales, I just get All as cheaply as possible. Sometimes thats a coupon plus a Target cartwheel, but most of the time it's in a giant jug at Sam's. I just make sure to use what's needed (not what's recommended on the jug!).\nThe cleaning wipes: I have three kids and I am a messy cook - these are a life saver to me. Since brand doesn't actually matter to me on this (it's \"handy wipey thing with cleaner on it\"), I just get the best deal I can. Sometimes coupon and cartwheel, sometimes Sam's, sometimes sale. Most of the time off-brand.\nBut we also do not use paper towels or napkins - we use cloth cleaning rags and dinner napkins for everything else.\nFor toothpaste, toothbrushes and other dental items, I've found manufacturer's coupons plus Cartwheel are my best bet, especially as I can buy in bulk and store (we got through a LOT in our house).\nI have to be a little more particular on soaps and lotions, as we have varying degrees of sensitive skin and allergies in our household, but when we find one that works, I then concentrate of buying *that particular thing* as cheaply as possible. Takes a lot of the work out of saving money when you can focus on just a few particular items.\n*ELECTRICAL-\nLight Bulbs-Changing out to LED light bulbs, These are usually more expensive but they last longer and offer a decent amount in saving. If you have a a lot of light bulbs in your home you can save some serious money over the course of a year.\nEnergy Efficient Devices- microwaves,refrigerators,tvs,computers all use electricity finding out the yearly energy draw on your next purchase. A new device could save you a bit of money in the long run!\nPlug in Management- Some devices still use electricity when plugged in. If you want to save some additional money you can unplug them till you need them!\nHeat- Wear more sweaters and use less heaters!\nI present to you: the attic tent. http://boards.fool.com/the-attic-tent-27113085.aspx?sort=who...\nThis was the single most useful thing we did for our electric and gas bills (and more noticeable immediately, our comfort level) until we could afford new windows and siding.\nNext most useful was a cover that goes over the attic fan during the months we don't use it: https://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-43251-48-Inch/d...\nYeah yeah, I can (and do) save 20 cents or something like that a month in unplugging things, but we got a LOT of bang for our buck with a couple of simple projects.\nBest thing we've done SINCE getting new windows and siding is get the Nest thermostat our energy company was offering for free. Since we installed it ourselves we got a $50 check, and then will get a $25 rebate each year. It controls the environment much better than our previous programmable (which had also been free, sans rebate, from the electric company).\nEnergy Efficient Devices- microwaves,refrigerators,tvs,computers all use electricity finding out the yearly energy draw on your next purchase. A new device could save you a bit of money in the long run!\nUpgrading our major home components did make a world of difference, but before buying any large appliance - check with your energy companies! Both our electric and gas companies offer rebates we have taken advantage of for our AC, our furnace and a fridge. We will be taking advantage of a water heater rebate when we replace it.\nCars- Cars can be a huge expense! Do not I repeat DO NOT buy what you can't afford. Period. With that being said I recommend if you are buying a new car.Kelley blue book it find out what the avg is and if you are going through a dealership. HAGGLE, they will try and get you for WAY higher and lock you into a lease or a high % loan. DO NOT DO IT! Ask for less than what the avg is going for and then walk AWAY if they don't follow don't worry you can always come back and they will probably try and get you a better deal the classic (*I talked to my boss this the best deal we can offer*) They will do this multiple times and NEVER take what they initially offer. EVER. With that being said if you do decide to buy a car, go through a credit union with your car loan. Banks will give you a much higher interest %.\nBest advice for car buying: don't unless you have to (drive it until the wheels fall off*).\nWhen you DO have to, determine what you actually NEED, and then research the ever loving chit out of the available options.\nWhen you have one paid off, keep putting the payment into the bank account each month. After a few years, you'll have the $$ stashed to buy the next one in cash.\nimpolite\n*Or, in my case: 1) you total it, 2) the head gasket blows, 3) it won't frackin' start when you need it to so you sell it to a guy 4 years after buying it for only $1000 less than you paid or 4) your spouse insists on something more reliable when you'll be going out of state twice a month. I once drove a Suburban, during the summer, while pregnant, without working AC.

(I recommend investing the savings earned but it's your goods!)\nKirenos, welcome! It's refreshing to see someone new looking for ways to get ahead.\nWhat you've mentioned is good general advice for others starting out. But based on my own experiences (I'm late gen-X, turned 40 this year), I can't stress enough the importance of focusing on ways to increase your MEANS. Yes, money was tight after I graduated, so looking to save was critical back then. In time I got married*, which means we have dual incomes, and those incomes have grown dramatically over time. If you stay disciplined by not overspending on the major items (house, cars, debt) as your income rises, you'll find that you can stop worrying about the little things, as they tend to take care of themselves.\nThe other key point is to leverage the time value of money through saving/investment. Start saving early. Put aside what you can, and strive to increase that by a little bit every year, or every time you get a raise. Before you know it you'll be putting away a ton of money, and you won't even feel the pinch. Eventually you'll get to where investment returns dwarf your new contributions. For example, this year my wife and I will contribute a combined $36k to our 401k accounts - meanwhile those retirement accounts are up almost $200k YTD. A few more years like this and our investment returns may exceed our work income.\n*(Choose your partner carefully, as divorce can be incredibly expensive!!!)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:49.068+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a8b1f14fd6174ffbb73d18c2e4edb302db664a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCr.Z8D1NLW8HK1MYSlK.noPqjEDBx7jK8i8SbV9fCu4xzh48txdzEyXifLlAzzOdXdnamCGDflDKg--", "site_full": "boards.fool.com", "site": "fool.com", "site_section": "http://boards.fool.com/living-below-your-means-100158.aspx?sort=collapsed", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "TMF: Living Below Your Means ", "title": "A millennials Perspective.", "title_full": "TMF: A millennials Perspective. / Living Below Your Means", "published": "2017-12-06T01:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 22, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.114, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1336, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a166e0a04d7220e0e43dbd45af8596a29f72b14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCr.Z8D1NLW8HK1MYSlK.noPqjEDBx7jK8i8SbV9fCu4xzh48txdzEyXifLlAzzOdXfy_yZjtcpNu.E0R5Cew2VB", "ord_in_thread": 20, "author": "Kirenos", "published": "2017-12-07T00:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\"No, it's the LEDs.

No work for me yesterday - back to bed for the whole danged day.   I had a dinner date with Elaine last night and didn't want to skip on her. There was nothing left in my system by then and I figured if I'm going to eat, I may as well go somewhere nice and have her company. Bring out the jammy dress!\n\nDress - no label, handmade, consignment; first seen here in March (look how short my hair is!) Shoes - Half Truth Veda, Fluevog; last worn here (2nd outfit) in October for theatre with Mom (pewter leather skirt!) Coat (below) - Vassali, consignment; last seen here in November Coat (below) - Hilary Radley, thrifted; last worn here in March \n\nIf you're wondering why there are two coats listed, it's because I wore this exact outfit again today for work. It's not like anyone saw me last night and then I didn't have to think about it. No thinking.\n I did add my Star Trek communicator badge today, but other than that, all the same. I am feeling better, but I'm very dehydrated and tired. Must be good to myself.\n\nRemembering that the neckline on this dress is really wide, I wore a black tank under it to cover my bra straps.\n I have a black half-slip under it as well, to add warmth.\n\nOuterwear from last night. Too cold! This coat is not warm enough for 5 degrees.\n But my furry set gets lots of love from me.\n\nFur toque/scarf/leather gloves - Danier \n\nToday's outerwear - welcome to the Unsafe Ocelot!\n Get used to it - I wore this coat to death last winter, and if it stays really chilly, I expect to wear this a ton this year too.\n\nThe stuff:\n Work was insanely busy. I was glad to have low heels on.\n\nGold bling:\n A few people at work noticed my communicator badge. Gotta let my nerd flag fly!\n\nStar Trek badge - MoPop gift shop Earrings - thrifted Amber ring - c. 1996 \n\nExtra bonus outfit! It's my Weight Watchers employee dinner tonight. They always expect me to be extra-glitzy (where do they get this idea? Hmmm).\n No stair picture, because it's pitch dark right now (6pm). I always try to get one wear out of this dress every holiday season.\n\nDress - Adrian, vintage 60s, thrifted; last seen here ...uh oh! I wore this same dress for my WW meeting last year in December 2016!  Shoes - Channi B; last worn here in November with dragons Coat (below) - Forever 21, thrifted; last seen here in May 2016 over a green satin dress (I look awesome there!) \n Okay, yes, I love this dress, and I do plan to wear it this season, but I can't wear it tonight!\n\nI will wear this coat, but not over this dress.\n I only see most of my WW colleagues once a year, at this dinner, so I totally have to change. Ack!\n\nThe stuff:\n I'm keeping the earrings on, and still wearing these fab shoes.\n\nBling:\nAnd keeping the pin on, but not the necklaces worn as bracelets.\n\nSo....\n\nGalaxy pin - Sarah Coventry, vintage fair Earrings - first wearing, vintage fair Belt (not shown) - vintage fair \nNow, this is what I'm wearing for dinner! I threw on a vintage slip, grabbed this silver metal link belt, and voila!  I like this dress, but I don't love this dress. This is it for this dress.\n\nDress - Doncaster, vintage 80s, thrifted; last seen here (2nd outfit) in January for a wrong-day theatre date with Mom Shoes - as above, Channi B Coat - as above, Forever 21, thrifted \n\nYeah, no. I look too grannyish in this (not that there's anything wrong with being grannyish, but it's not the look I'm going for).\n\"Is the cleaning lady done yet?\"  It feels like too much of this green fabric. Meh.\n\nI like it with the coat, though.\nAnd it will do. Off to catch my ride!
