to see a private for-profit medical clinic open in a building the band plans to construct on its urban reserve in Winnipeg.\nDennis Meeches says the First Nation is in the process of finalizing lease agreements with a number of potential tenants for a $20-million office building planned for land on Madison Street, near Polo Park Shopping Centre.\nWinnipeg businessman plans to open private MRI clinic on urban reserve Winnipeg gets first urban reserve Meeches says one potential tenant is White Cross Healthcare, which is headed by Winnipeg businessman Daren Jorgenson.\n\"We still don't have a signed lease agreement with White Cross, but we're hoping that they will sign on, for sure,\" Meeches said.\nJorgenson, however, says the clinic will be part of an initiative called Our Buffalo Ltd., which he called an \"economic empowerment project.\"\n\"One avenue is private health care and we're working with Long Plain First Nation and Chief Dennis Meeches to see that happen,\" he said in an interview on CBC's Information Radio .\nThe Winnipeg clinic aims to provide a wide range of private and public health care services, including family physicians, dental care, blood and urine tests, and diagnostic services, including MRI, CT scans, and X-ray, Jorgenson said. (CBC News)\nMeeches says the First Nation isn't a partner with Jorgenson on the clinic project, although he says it supports what Jorgenson wants to do.\nThe band currently leases space on its urban reserve in Portage la Prairie to White Cross Healthcare.\nJorgenson said the Winnipeg clinic aims to provide a wide range of private and public health-care services, including family physicians, dental care, blood and urine tests, and diagnostic services including MRI, CT scans, and X-rays.\nJorgenson says he hopes to partner with Manitoba Health to provide a mix of public and private MRI services. He says he hasn't spoken to anyone in government about the idea, yet.\nPossible Health Act challenges The plan faces possible challenges under the Canada Health Act , which forbids charging a fee for any medically necessary services.\nHealth Canada says the Canada Health Act applies on and off reserve, and \"medically necessary MRI scans are insured health services and should be covered by provincial plans whether these services are provided in hospitals or in private clinics.\"\nJorgenson argues that because the clinic is on a reserve, he's confident he can structure the business in a way that the act would not apply to him.\n\"We feel confident in our legal advice and we're pushing forward,\" he said.\nMeeches says he supports the idea of an MRI clinic on the site, but expressed uncertainty about the plan.\n\"If he's able to achieve that, all the power to him. He has an opinion on that [and] he should be able to have one. If we could do anything to support that, I think we would,\" Meeches said.\nJorgenson recently put out a call for health-care workers with treaty status to work in the clinic. He says their income will be tax-free while working on the urban reserve as part of treaty rights upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe 1983 case of Nowegijick v. The Queen concluded that personal income earned by people with treaty status working on reserve could not be taxed, because it is considered personal property, which is exempt under Section 87 (1) of The Indian Act .\nMeeches says he doesn't know about whether the act would apply to Jorgenson's business, but he says his First Nation is always looking for economic opportunities and believes private clinics on urban reserves could be a \"game changer.\"\n\"We think that health-centre concept that Daren is proposing would actually be a good fit. I think many people know right across the board that health issues are a major issue for Indigenous people,\" he said.\nBefore construction can begin, Meeches says they have to first demolish a building at 410 Madison St., which is owned by the First Nation but is not part of the urban reserve.\nWith files from Rignam Wangkhang", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2462/index.do"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rignam wangkhang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dennis meeches", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daren jorgenson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meeches", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jorgenson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "long plain first nation", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "manitoba health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "health canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbc news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "information radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madison st.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court of canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white cross healthcare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nowegijick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white cross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meeches", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffalo ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winnipeg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madison street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "polo park shopping centre", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:42.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "01856951e6e968621d0115bd8987f024502da439", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBcd2M7J9tK9j38n2sC8qr.p9oZrsYSXgELauw_vZR8hRHhdDgdLInt3l7CcyZDe7G2RzEbpfpC4QAfr252.64vA-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

The biggest power companies in the world are scrambling to buy up new startups in order to stay at the forefront of the distributed energy transition -- and they\u2019re spending billions of dollars in the process. \nTotal annual investments in distributed energy companies by European and North American utilities more than tripled between 2010 and 2016, according to data compiled by GTM Research. \nIn total, utilities invested $2.9 billion in 130 individual distributed energy companies since 2009 -- $1 billion of which was invested in 2016 alone. The trend has continued this year, with nearly half of global industry deals involving renewable energy during the second quarter, according to a report from Ernst & Young. \nThose numbers are only a preview of what\u2019s to come. \n\u201cI think the appetite for acquiring startups will really increase over the next few years,\u201d predicted Matthias Dill, the managing director of Germany-based Statkraft Ventures , a venture capital fund backed by Norwegian energy firm Statkraft. \"We see three fundamental trends driving M&A activity in the energy sector: Incumbents embracing distributed energy, startups becoming relevant players in the energy sector, and players from other sectors entering the energy sector. The exciting part is that all of this is happening at the same time.\u201d \nIncumbent utilities are now grappling with the reality of distributed energy. Consequently, operations are already changing in significant ways \u2013 and utilities are doing everything they can to future-proof themselves. \nThe shakeup is evident in Europe, where E.ON and RWE both split up their fossil fuel and renewable assets last year. RWE created Innogy to focus on renewable energy, electric vehicles and retail markets. And E.ON established Uniper, in order to separate its upstream fossil fuel operations. Both are seeking out partnerships and acquisition targets to grow their renewables businesses. \nAnd there is much more money waiting to be spent. According to the International Energy Agency\u2019s latest forecast, renewable energy investments will amount to $7 trillion by 2040. Trillions more will be invested in energy efficiency and demand-side management. \nThe trend holds true for midsized European power companies as well. U.K.-based Drax Group acquired the electricity provider Opus Energy last year for \u00a3340 million ($453 million). The Netherlands-based Eneco invested in two German companies -- virtual power plant developer Next Kraftwerke and renewable energy provider LichtBlick -- and acquired the Dutch smart thermostat company Quby. \nDill said startups like Quby are especially appealing to incumbent power utilities because they bring in new business possibilities and, once acquired, no longer present an acute threat. \nStatkraft Ventures invested in one such startup in 2015. Munich-based Tado was developing intelligent climate control platforms, and Dill\u2019s team saw an opportunity to market the product through utilities. \n\u201cWhen they started out, they weren\u2019t really an energy firm. They were already successful, but mainly an e-commerce and consumer electronics firm,\u201d said Dill. \u201cWe invested two years ago, and today their major customers are the utility sector. Now they enable incumbent utilities to offer new products to their customers and have a better customer relationship.\u201d \nA diverse and growing pool of cleantech startups like Tado is entering the scene and presenting new possibilities for mergers and acquisitions. More companies than ever are working in the energy space, and many got their start outside of the energy sector . \nTechnology maturation and customer preferences are drivers of the trend. Wind and solar costs rival conventional fossil fuels; customers want renewables and greater control of their energy use; and the business models are becoming more sophisticated. \n\u201cToday, the heavy lifting in developing technologies like solar, wind and storage is done, but this generates a new set of questions,\u201d explained Dill. \u201cStartups are in a perfect position to address these new issues, which are often centered around data-management and customer experience, and they can be addressed in a very capital-efficient way.\u201d \nTado has become so attractive to utilities that it receives a steady stream of offers to acquire the company. \n\u201cWe get inbound inquires every two months,\u201d said Tado founder and managing director Christian Deilmann, \u201cbut Tado is not up for sale. We are just getting started.\u201d \nSince Statkraft invested in Tado, the company has grown \u201ctenfold\u201d in customers and revenue, added Deilmann. \nOther nontraditional players are eyeing cleantech startups too. Last year, the California-based cloud-computing giant Oracle bought Opower, a utility software company, for $532 million. Years earlier, Google was at the forefront of this trend when it bought smart-device maker Nest for $3.2 billion in 2014. \nEnergy-focused investment firms like Statkraft Ventures are catalyzing this market by searching for promising startups that can meet the changing needs of utilities. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding startups that, from whatever background, can have a big impact on the energy sector,\u201d said Dill. \nAs a venture arm of the Norwegian energy company Statkraft, Statkraft Ventures has an intimate understanding of large utilities. \n\u201cIt\u2019s very useful to have a shareholder that understand the specifics of the energy sector, because [it is] not always straightforward,\u201d said Deilmann. \nWith such strong demand for clean technologies over the coming decades, the recent M&A activity is only the beginning. \n\u201cWe and our peer VCs are building a pipeline of targets that will be bought soon,\u201d said Dill. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice point in time.\u201d \nExpect the biggest energy companies to be on the hunt for acquisition opportunities.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

As the user Nomads1 pointed out, the main problem with rescuing Grace from the scrap heap is that there's not much to take hold of. It's never a nice thing to say about the cast of a comic book (or any other work of fiction, for that matter), but the feeling that Grace and Anissa were added to [I]Outsiders[/I] v3 just to add a \"touch of color\" without particular regard for 360\u00b0 work on their characterizations is very strong.\nA 6'10\", muscle-bound, super-strong, bisexual Asiatic woman with a heart of gold and the mouth of a sailor who used to work as a bouncer in shady clubs? What's this? A challenge at checking as many boxes on the \"OC team member\" form as you can?\nOh, and she has a really, [U]really[/U] dark backstory, having been sold as a slave when she was a child! What a pity that tragedy doesn't automatically make the superhero if it's not developed into sufficiently interesting angles (a crapton of characters conceived from 1986 to 1996 can testify) and that unfortunately Ms. Choi is very lacking in that department since she was \"born\" undercooked.\nIn all honesty, the only time I saw Grace as a character with potential of being something more than a meteor doomed to fade from view shortly after her creator stopped writing her (which is exactly what happened) was surprisingly[*] during her 2-page appearance on [I]Final Crisis: Last Will and Testament[/I], where she goes to Rocky Davis filling the role of a kinda-sorta confessor because, despite her atheism, she needs to confide to somebody who won't judge her how much she resents her reputation among her teammates, who probably think she's in a back alley collapsed because of too much drinking or in the company of one of her one-night-stands. [I]That[/I] was the only moment I saw a trace of genuine hidden depths in her and, if she ever had to resurface at some point, I'd like the writer to remember what was written in those two pages.\nRight now, I can't think of many places where I'd like to see her pop up. Definitely not the [I]Wonder Woman[/I] title, where characters and concepts have all their nuance and reasons for interest mercilessly beaten out. Maybe [I]Deathstroke[/I] or [I]Justice League[/I], given Priest's success at giving dignity to undercooked characters the likes of Tanya Spears or the other Wally West, but I can't expect him to save everyone of them or otherwise he'd need a 4,000 issue run on each title. An intriguing option would be Lobdell's [I]Red Hood and the Outlaws[/I], since I wouldn't mind an Artemis-centered story arc where she tracks a stray sister of hers and because of that the whole team is involved in some really crazy s**t.\n[*] \"Surprisingly\" since we're talking about Brad Meltzer, the writer who accurately avoided writing a female POV in [I]Identity Crisis[/I], a series that would have desperately needed one.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://shehulk.sliverofice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/grace-stops-bullet.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:43.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "130ee469d9ac9493a59ad37dac9f9c2e834b3aff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5YJ2kVA2Z4bZapa2M.4Qb4-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "130ee469d9ac9493a59ad37dac9f9c2e834b3aff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5YJ2kVA2Z4bZapa2M.4Qb4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Error: Permission denied (/media/My Book/downloads/The.Simpsons.S24E09.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION [PublicHD]/The.Simpsons.S24E09.720p.HD\r\n\t\r\ndrwx------ 1 pi       0 Dec 15 16:24 downloads\r\n\t\r\nchmod 777 downloads -R\r\n\t\r\nsudo service transmission-daemon stop\r\n\t\r\nsudo usermod -a -G debian-transmission pi\r\n\t\r\nsudo nano /etc/init.d/transmission-daemon\r\n\t\r\nsudo chown -R pi /var/lib/transmission-daemon/info/\nsudo chmod 755 /var/lib/transmission-daemon/info/settings.json\r\n\t\r\nsudo chown -R pi /somewhere/downloads\nsudo chown -R pi /somewhere/incomplete\r\n\t\r\nsudo service transmission-daemon start\r\n\t\r\nsudo service transmission-daemon stop\nsudo nano /etc/init.d/transmission-daemon\r\n\t\r\nUSER=debian-transmission\r\n\t\r\nUSER=root\nctrl-x\nY\n# hit enter to overwrite\nsudo service transmission-daemon start\r\n\t\r\nsudo chown debian-transmission /downloads\r\n\t\r\n[Service]\r\n\t\r\nUser=pi\r\n\t\r\nsudo umount /media/pi/usb_disk\nsudo mkdir /mnt/usb_disk\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o uid=pi,gid=pi /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb_disk\r\n\t\r\n[mybook]\n    path = /media/mybook\n    guest ok = yes\n    read only = no\n    browseable = yes\n    writeable = yes\n    force user = xbian\r\n\t\r\nchgrp -R folder_name\nchmod -R 765 folder_name", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:43.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d3851e3228645f9af9a3c8ad0db9ab1b2056907", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWQ9Y6eh2oczCDlEdQGjZ63CI9k62X3xmdRnlf4BLDvmxN0eOjcxYjSE3LKevEYECuzmPd1fny7yGh5sAJuSUGinJdZxC3rvSZ", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-kitchen-organizer-storage/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Kitchen Storage &amp;

Back to Article news The Physically Challenged in the Southwest have requested for a separate ministry to take care of the people in the category. The physically challenged who are members of an umbrella body in the Southwest, The Association of the Physically Challenged Southwest, made the plea in Lagos during a solidarity visit to the Aare Ona Kakanfo designate, Dr Gani Adams . Speaking through their spokesman, Prince Paul Adelabu who said there are over 25m physically challenged in the country, the physically challenged said a separate ministry for them would enhance their welfare and allow government cater for them better. Insisting that the 25m figure increases on daily basis, Adelabu said motor cycle accident victims add to the figure regularly, stressing that it is imperative that government begin to consider the welfare of the people in the category. Appealing to the Aare Ona Kakanfo to make case for the physically challenged in the Southwest, the spokesperson said it was jubilation galore among members when news got to them about Adams as the choice for the 15th Aare Ona Kakanfo. According to him, Adams is better positioned more than ever before to cater for the physically challenged just as they thanked the Aare for his previous assistance. Reacting, the Aare Ona Kakanfo designate promised to do all within his best to ensure an improved life for the physically challenged.

Submitting that the country can afford to take care of its physically challenged like the European governments, Adams explained that before now, his Gani Adams foundation has been organising programs for the physically challenged adding that he will do more than before as the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yoruba land. According to him, the physically challenged should be pampered, adding that it is time government consider a separate ministry for them because it is important they live comfortable lives. |", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aare ona kakanfo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gani adams", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "adelabu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ona kakanfo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul adelabu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "southwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "port harcourt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:43.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d3851e3228645f9af9a3c8ad0db9ab1b2056907", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWQ9Y6eh2oczCDlEdQGjZ63CI9k62X3xmdRnlf4BLDvmxN0eOjcxYjSE3LKevEYECuzmPd1fny7yGh5sAJuSUGinJdZxC3rvSZ", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-kitchen-organizer-storage/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Kitchen Storage &amp; Accessories - Buy Kitchen Storage &amp; Accessories at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Family Special Kitchen Rack", "title_full": "Family Special Kitchen Rack | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2015-04-15T04:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 257, "participants_count": 216, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.075, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2991f8742ad7ac769948cf67e9e735891f9cbee9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWQ9Y6eh2oczCDlEdQGjZ63CI9k62X3xmdRnlf4BLDvmxN0eOjcxYjSE3LKevEYECuzmPd1fny7yGh5sAJuSUGikXr8JdiXUr4r86PcLM0i3M-", "ord_in_thread": 229, "author": "Alex L.", "published": "2017-11-15T16:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "Four Stars", "text": "Received in good condition.

Importing strings from California takes about a couple weeks in transit plus I have to deal with the exchange rate between the US Dollar and the Canadian Dollar and, if I place an order for more than $100 CAD, the Canadian Government slams a tariff on top of that to punish Me for buying online from a US retailer.\nThat is why having a Canadian retailer selling strings is a great option for us.\nWhen I order from BSO, I am always trying to optimize buying in bulk to optimize the shipping costs versus not buying too much so that I don't have the Canadian Government import tariff.

The city's Public Health and Human Services Committee passed a bill that enables Philadelphia's Department of Licenses and Inspections to regulate the bullet-resistant barricades that stand between customers and cash registers in many neighborhood corner stores, according to  Fox 29 . \u201cNo establishment required to obtain a Large Establishment license \u2026 shall erect or maintain a physical barrier that requires the persons serving the food either to open a window or other aperture or to pass the food through a window or other aperture, in order to hand the food to a customer inside the establishment,\u201d the bill states. It also calls for larger establishments to have bathrooms for customers.\nMany of the hundreds of deli owners feel as though they are being singled out and are among those protesting the bill, according to Fox 29.\n\u201cIf the glass comes down, the crime rate will rise and there will be lots of dead bodies,\u201d Rich Kim, the owner of Broad Deli, which sells soda, meals and beer by the can, said. \u201cThe most important thing is safety and the public\u2019s safety.\u201d\nKim said the glass went up after a shooting and says it saved his mother-in-law from a knife attack.\nFox News  previously reported that the bill, put forward by Councilwoman Cindy Bass, focuses on \u201cstop-and-go\u201d convenience stores that act more like bars than the restaurants they are licensed to be, selling beer and shots of liquor over the counter and attracting crowds that end up becoming public nuisances, according to lawmakers.\nPennsylvania state law mandates businesses with restaurant licenses should regularly sell food and have tables and chairs to seat 30 people. But some businesses keep their seating locked up or out of reach and the grills shut down, selling little more than alcohol and forcing customers to wander outside.\nBass told Fox News that in \u201cmore than 90 percent of cases they are breaking the law in terms of operating outside the requirement of their license.\u201d\nBass said the bulletproof glass and partitions at some of these businesses are a concern of the city\u2019s health department, as if a customer is choking or having an allergic reaction, a barrier should not stand in the way of safety.\nShe also addressed the security concerns. \u201cThousands of businesses operate in the same neighborhoods with no Plexiglass,\u201d she told Fox News, mentioning stores like Rite-Aid and barber shops. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a bar with Plexiglass.\u201d\nKim objected to the claims that the bill stemmed from nuisance complaints city officials got from constituents, and said that calls to police often were met with slow responses.\nThe chairman of the Asian American Licensed Beverage Association of Philadelphia, which represents 217 \u2018beer delis\u2019 in the city, also said most of the businesses being targeted \u201care in not-as-safe neighborhoods.\u201d\nA full council vote is slated for Thursday, December 14, according to Fox 29.

round of talks aimed at putting an end to nearly seven years of bloodshed in Syria opened last week in Geneva. \nNegotiations were paused over the weekend and resumed on Tuesday, but without the government delegation headed by Syria's UN ambassador Bashar al-Jaafari. \nJaafari had criticised the talks before his departure, saying there were \"big problems in this round\", a reference to the opposition's insistence on President Bashar al-Assad's removal. \nThe opposition, united in one delegation for the first time, has so far defied calls to give up on its demand that Assad step down before any peace deal can be reached. \nJaafari described that position as \"provocative\" and \"irresponsible\", warning that \"there will be no progress\" if the opposition maintained its stance. \nFor several days, government sources had said officials were still deliberating whether they would come back to Geneva. \nUN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura has met with the opposition's delegation

research here before submitting to AirTasker.\nI've made a number of attempts at cutting my own 5 pointed star.\nTo be used as a large fruit bowel or Christmas decoration.\nI've never been able to build one with enough accuracy.\nSo this year instead of having another go,\nI'm researching how to get it to the CNC stage.\nFirst step is to get it into a CNC recognisable file in .dxf format.\nI've got a SKP file for the bowel and another two skp files: one each for the left and right segments of a point.\nIs there anyone I can send these to where we can convert these into something (like the proper perspective)\nthat the CNC operators will know how to use?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nnb: .dwg and .dxf Thanks,\nBarry G.
