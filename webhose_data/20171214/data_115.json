Golden Globes nominations will be announced Monday, the critics \u2018 groups have already started naming this year\u2019s best films, and several publications ( including EW ) have rolled out their own Top 10s for 2017. This year, however, there\u2019s a new authoritative voice on the best films of the year \u2014 the Wendy\u2019s Twitter account. \nAfter IndieWire\u2019s Eric Kohn reached out to the fast food restaurant on Twitter to inquire after its favorite movie of the year, Wendy\u2019s quickly replied, naming Lady Bird, The Big Sick, Get Out, and Logan as Wendy\u2019s-approved. ( Blade Runner 2049 also got a shoutout for its lush cinematography.) Lady Bird was pretty great. Also, enjoyed The Big Sick and Get Out, and Logan remains surprisingly high on the list. Also, Blade Runner was visually stunning. \n\u2014 Wendy\u2019s (@Wendys) December 6, 2017 They very quickly said no \n\u2014 Wendy\u2019s (@Wendys) December 6, 2017 \nBefore long, Lady Bird\u2019s distributor, A24, chimed in, asking for more in-depth review \u2014 and Wendy\u2019s delivered a thoughtful take on Greta Gerwig\u2019s acclaimed coming-of-age tale. This is all happening so fast. A great example of the confusion found while coming of age, great dynamic between Lady Bird and her mother, and an interesting look at class differences and their affect on the mentality of youth. \n\u2014 Wendy\u2019s (@Wendys) December 6, 2017 \nWendy\u2019s also weighed in on an important question currently dividing Film Twitter \u2014 whether the critically-acclaimed, 18-part series Twin Peaks: The Return qualifies as a film or a TV show.

I think I reviewed all the restaurant we like if you check my profile.\nWhilst there we also did some vespa tours. I wouldn't particularly recommend the Evening Foodie tour - some of it was fun but overall I would have preferred to spend the money on a nice meal in a restaurant.

It wasn't a ton but enough to play in a little bit. I went out to lunch with a couple friends and on the way to her house I saw a whole flock of wild turkeys. Speaking of wild turkeys we don't have those but we have ducks and they make the cutest little footprints in the snow. We were invited to Lynn and Rebecca's house Friday night (they are all moved into their new house). Allison loved playing with their golden-doodle! Saturday (the 2nd) we went to the carousel for a free ride and visit with Santa. We are doing the 25 days of Christmas and the 1st was to write letters to Santa and the 2nd was to visit Santa. Jenna was the only shy one. On the 3rd the activity was to make paper snowflakes and we had fun making a mess and making our windows and fish tank pretty. Yesterday (the 4th) the activity was to drive around and look at Christmas lights. Well, in theory it sounded like the perfect way to spend the evening. In reality we had a crazy evening. But to start the story we need to go back to the beginning of the day. That day hadn't been going so well, we had gotten a bill from the dentist for almost $2000, Charles wasn't feeling well, and just a lot of little stresses the whole day. We ate dinner and packed up to leave on our drive. It had snowed and I hadn't driven the suburban so the snow had thawed and refrozen to the windshield. When we tried to use the wipers one side the rubber split off the wiper and the other side just totally broke in half and the metal arm scratched into the windshield. We scraped off the windshield and headed to O'riley auto-parts to grab some new wiper blades. About halfway there we hear this loud crack and we see a huge crack form in the middle of our windshield (it was previously perfect). We get to the parts store and the cheapest wiper blade for the Suburban was $20 per side! So instead of spending $40 on the cheapest blades we looked through the garbage in front of the store (there are usually people's old blades in there). We were super lucky to find a set of blades that fit our Suburban (they have a uncommon connector). So we finally set out to look at lights. About 5 minutes into the drive the girls were all complaining that they had to go to the bathroom. We were on the far edge of town where there wasn't any stores so we decide to just have them go off the side of the road. Well Charles decides to power-slide to turn around and we end up going off into a farmers field. We drive out of the field and everyone goes to the bathroom. We finally start looking for lights and there really aren't that many but the kids have fun ooing and awwing at the few we did see. The picture above was the most decked out house we could find and it wasn't even that crazy of a display. We finally headed home when the girls said they had to go to the bathroom again after only 30 minutes... Today is a new day right? This morning the girls were doing something... I don't know what exactly but they had a whole bunch of random toys and things all set up on the floor of the kitchen. Mornings are my favorite because these 2 just play so well before Jenna goes to school. Speaking of Jenna going to school she now goes to school 20 minutes early to help her catch up. She was having a hard time and hopefully this helps. We are trying it out for a month and if it hasn't made a significant improvement we will try something else.

Photo: Charles Krupa/Associated Press \n\n\nWhatever you may hear, the Republican tax-reform proposal isn\u2019t an assault on higher education. The House and Senate plans include a new 1.4% excise tax on the net investment income of university endowments, but the levy applies only to private colleges with at least 500 students and endowments of more than $250,000 a student. Schools like Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Princeton\u2014which together hold over $100 billion\u2014are predicting doom. Yet this long-overdue tax will benefit higher education in the end. \n\nOver the past 30 years universities have chased higher returns on their endowments, leading them to take greater risks. Our research shows that more than 75% of the assets in university endowments are now in risky investments: equities, hedge funds and private equity. Think of Harvard as a tax-free hedge fund that happens to have a university. \n\nThe proposed levy on investment income\u2014dividends, interest and capital gains\u2014is fundamentally a tax on this risk-taking, not on the endowments themselves. By taxing risk-driven income, the GOP plan doesn\u2019t target higher education. It goes after hedge funds masquerading as university endowments. \n\nWhen an endowment is invested in safe assets such as bonds, it serves as a rainy-day fund to buffer the risks a university takes in its normal operations: admitting students on scholarship, launching new research laboratories and generally expanding its educational and research missions. Such a safe endowment generates almost no investment income, meaning there would be no tax liability under the GOP proposal. \n\nInstead the tax would fall on large, risky and illiquid funds. Endowments that make such investment decisions cannot effectively protect their schools. During the financial crisis, Harvard\u2019s endowment lost nearly 30% of its value. After failing to sell its private-equity portfolio, the university had to institute drastic hiring and budget freezes. \n\nA large and risky endowment also reveals a university\u2019s poor assessment of its internal investment opportunities, such as scholarships and research. If Harvard and Stanford have educational and research projects that could benefit from additional funds, why put their money at risk in the stock market? Perhaps the answer is that the opportunity to run a tax-free hedge fund is too attractive. In that case, why should taxpayers subsidize their activities? \n\nIn colleges\u2019 defense, states have placed perverse restrictions on their ability to use endowments as rainy-day funds. The Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act is a law in 49 states that limits the maximum endowment payout rate between 5% and 7% a year. Although well-intentioned, that and earlier restrictions prevent universities from tapping endowments to fill the kind of budget holes they experienced in 2008. \n\nTo have the best chance of improving incentives for endowments, the proposed investment tax should be accompanied by a repeal of these payout caps. But it\u2019s a mistake to think that taxing risky investments by university endowments is an attack on academia. Discouraging superwealthy schools from pumping cash into stocks, hedge funds and private equity should lead to increased spending on education and research. Isn\u2019t that the purpose of higher education? \n\n\nMessrs. Gilbert and Hrdlicka are assistant professors of finance at the University of Washington.

The Auks also benefited from Hillers forfeits in five weight classes as they opened their season with a victory. The Dialog/Mike Lang \nArchmere was ahead, 18-0, before a single second of wrestling had occurred. Senior Gary Clements was the first to do battle, meeting Tower Hill\u2019s Ky Jacobs at 126 lbs. Clements scored on an early takedown and led, 4-1, in the final seconds of the first period, but Jacobs got a pair of points back on a last-second reversal. Jacobs added two more points in the second, but with 1:05 to go in the second, he escaped Jacobs\u2019 grip and earned the pin. \nDaniel Ciampoli was next up for the Auks, facing Andy Richmond at 132. Richmond picked up two points for the lead, but Ciampoli rolled him for the pin just 44 seconds into the period for the 30-0 advantage. The Auks\u2019 good fortune would continue at 138, as Ethan Huffman pinned fellow freshman Sander Margolin at the 46-second mark. \nThe best match of the afternoon took place at 145, pitting Teddy Hughes of Tower Hill against Archmere\u2019s Josh Mottola. Neither wrestler scored through the first two and a half periods, but Mottola went up, 2-0, with 30 seconds remaining. Hughes got one back on an escape, then tied it up when Mottola was called for stalling. Hughes nearly won it at the end of regulation, but his escape came just after the buzzer. \nHughes picked up two points on a reversal 18 seconds into the extra period, and he earned the sudden victory with three back points on the same sequence. The three team points the Hillers earned for the win were their first of the day. \nArchmere earned its only non-fall or forfeit win of the day at 152. Matt McDougal was up, 6-0, over Blaine Boyden after the first period, four of those being back points. The lead was still six, 8-2, after the second, and two more in the third gave the Auk the major decision and four team points. \nNolan Collins of Archmere made quick work of Anand Raju at 160, getting the fall at 47 seconds, and in the final contested weight class, 182, the Auks\u2019 Bennett Brooks pinned Brian Brown at 1:54 of the first. \nThe forfeit winners for Archmere were Aristotle Makoujy (106), Liam Clements (113), Joseph Raziano (120), Michael Devine (220) and Robert Quercetti (285). The Hillers got forfeit wins from Reece Ratliff (170) and Will Borda (195). \nThe Auks will be back on the mat this Friday at 3 p.m. at the Yellow Jacket Invitational at Newark High School.

We first cleaned up the house and the kids were so helpful cleaning up the kitchen. I told them if they helped we could set up the tree that day. But before we got a tree we went on a little big kid family date to Gravity Factory (a trampoline park). We left Jenna and Allison with Grandma Tietjen and took Chloe and Charlie. We had a BLAST!! It was so fun! We climbed the climbing walls, did flips on the trampolines, tried out the Ninja Warrior course (I could tell I was still weak and sick because I did a lot worse this time than my first time), played dodgeball, and just had fun. We all had fun to see a little video montage click HERE (It also includes are tree decorating). After getting super tired we picked up the little girls and went to get our tree. Then it was time to decorate! I love our tree this year! Our guard dog :) The rest of November included playing at the office. Playing with your new birthday presents. Yoga in front of the tree. I was still super tired and fighting the residual effects from the sickness that instead of weightlifting I did a lot of yoga and it was super nice. It was just the right intensity. It was hard but I wasn't dying. I'm so not flexible so every pose is a struggle. We watched some Christmas movies. More yoga...haha, I was super excited to be flexible enough to get into this pose. Then on the last day of the month I hung this up. My mom had made this garland for me to do the 25 days of Christmas! So I came up with ideas and wrote them on slips of paper for each day. Today is day 5 and we've had lots of fun so far but that will be for another post. Now it's time for December!

And to see the video of us singing Happy Birthday to her click HERE . She helped me bake her strawberry cake. She wanted a unicorn cake and this is how it turned out. Not exactly how I wanted it to look but it worked. She is obsessed with My Little Pony so she was super excited for all the ponies she got.

So we are going to quickly catch up. Thanksgiving happened. I was in charge of the mashed potatoes and 2 pies. I made a pumpkin and a lemon meringue. They both didn't turn out as well as they could have but at least the lemon meringue looked cool...I just didn't cook the custard quite long enough so it wasn't quite set up enough. We had it at Charles's parent's house with just one of his brother's family, his parents, Valerie, and my sister-in-laws parents. It was a small group compared to normal. The food was yummy...I was still sick so my taste buds weren't fully functioning. I love this guy! I'm super thankful to have him and all my littles in my life! After dinner I wanted to take a nap...haha. We hung out, talked, the kids played, and we did puzzles, and ate pie and snacks. Charles's mom made this cute turkey cheese ball. But for most of the night we just worked on this 1000 piece puzzle. By the time we went home I couldn't differentiate colors anymore. Overall a very relaxed and nice Thanksgiving. I'm so grateful to live where I live, with the people I live with, and the family and friends I have. Sometimes when I feel like complaining I just have to think about how spoiled I am and I am very lucky to be where I am. I hope everyone else had a safe and fun Thanksgiving!!

Pilgrim Haven Natural Area features woodlands, hiking trails and a beach on Lake Michigan. Steps being taken to make public access easier are being accomplished, in part, as a result of a $70,000 grant made by Entergy Corporation\u2013Palisades to the Southwest Michigan Land Conservancy (SWMLC). SWMLC will use the grant funds to match funding from a Michigan Natural Resources Trust Fund (MNRTF) grant awarded earlier this year to the South Haven Area Recreation Authority (SHARA). \"The generous grant from Entergy-Palisades will assist Southwest Michigan Land Conservancy and South Haven Area Recreation Authority in moving forward with a new phase of improvements to the Pilgrim Haven Natural Area,\" says Peter Ter Louw, SWMLC President and Executive Director. \"These improvements will allow us to safely open this extremely unique nature preserve on Lake Michigan for South Haven area residents and visitors.\" With the contribution from Entergy-Palisades, Southwest Michigan Land Conservancy and South Haven Area Recreation Authority will be able to continue the work to create public access and offer community uses of the property. The land includes a stretch of Dyckman Creek and almost 800 feet of beach along Lake Michigan. Located just north of Van Buren State Park, Pilgrim Haven Natural Area was donated to SWMLC in December 2011 through a bequest from the estate of Suzanne Upjohn Delano Parish. She wanted to see the former campground remain as open space and opened to the public. In the fall of 2016, SWMLC entered into an agreement with the South Haven Area Recreation Authority for the management of the preserve. SHARA is a partnership of the City of South Haven, South Haven Charter Township, and South Haven Public Schools. Under the agreement, SHARA is responsible for the general maintenance and management of the nature preserve, as well as implementation of current public access improvements. SWMLC will continue to own the property and care for the natural areas and wildlife habitats on site through the work of employees and volunteers. \"Our support is about stewardship and being a good neighbor not only today, but tomorrow and years to come,\" says Palisades Site Vice President Charlie Arnone. \"Future generations will be able to enjoy Pilgrim Haven thanks to the work of the Southwest Michigan Land Conservancy. The organization provides an incredible service to this region and we are so proud to partner with SWMLC on this important project.\" South Haven Township Supervisor and Chair of SHARA Ross Stein says, \"Visitors can enjoy time on the beach, swimming in Lake Michigan, walking along a creek, or hiking through the woods,\"\"For over 100 years, the property that is now the Pilgrim Haven Natural Area has been a beloved place for people to come to enjoy the Lake Michigan shoreline, and we\u2019re thrilled that we can be a part of continuing that legacy.\" SHARA is pleased to partner with SWMLC in managing Pilgrim Haven - it is a remarkable open space and a wonderful gift to the community,\" says Stein. \"And the generous grant from Entergy is helping to ensure Pilgrim Haven is open to all.\" Souce: Southwest Michigan Land Conservancy Share", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kathy jennings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shara ross stein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie arnone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter ter louw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "southwest michigan land conservancy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south haven public schools", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pilgrim haven natural area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swmlc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pilgrim haven pilgrim haven shoreline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south haven area recreation authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suzanne upjohn delano parish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "entergy corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "entergy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "palisades", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dyckman creek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south haven", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "van buren state park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pilgrim haven", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pilgrm haven natural area beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south haven township", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south haven charter township", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:25.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ffe641bec3eb9563a262f3223dfdc1653aece0f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOquKTnF9G8pMQ5A9FLuggO6z3fcq2x_g0AFzrn0cGIky3eSyd4EFo6Lqjiga3DnmGpLSqRTE3sRMm4DG2UKgqKjTJbvu.KDJnE-", "site_full": "stitchingnotes.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://stitchingnotes.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Stitching Notes", "title": "Artist Trading Card Swap", "title_full": "Artist Trading Card Swap", "published": "2017-12-06T09:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EWJv3ZBKdw0/WiXQabQe0LI/AAAAAAAAHMo/cvDpPsPdO2sOdcdM-_3XENg1DECy5A4sQCLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/IMGP6628.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ffe641bec3eb9563a262f3223dfdc1653aece0f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOquKTnF9G8pMQ5A9FLuggO6z3fcq2x_g0AFzrn0cGIky3eSyd4EFo6Lqjiga3DnmGpLSqRTE3sRMm4DG2UKgqKjTJbvu.KDJnE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Larisa (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-06T09:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "Artist Trading Card Swap", "text": "Tuesday, 5 December 2017 Artist Trading Card Swap It's been a while since the last swap and I was wondering whether Ali would run another round this year. She usually organises four swaps per year, but taking into account how busy she has been lately, I was not sure she would do it. When I saw her announcement about the ATC swap a couple of months ago, I was really happy and could not wait to sign up. The theme for this swap is \"Small Things\" and it fits so perfectly with my sewing because most of all I do enjoy working on small things and adding tiny finishing touches. So here is my card for this round called \"Small Things\". I believe that life (or should I say, our every day) is a collection of small things - that first cup of coffee in the morning, a new or an old favourite book that you enjoy reading, a slice of a cake or maybe a short getaway from your daily life to enjoy some warm sunshine, a warm hug from your loved one, maybe it's a chat with a friend. It's that pretty flower in your garden that you stop to smell or some craft that you enjoy working on. All the small things that together form something bigger, filling our lives with joy, happiness and content. My morning is never complete without a cup of coffee shared with my Dear Husband. It's a tradition we started without even thinking when I was working and we all were in a hurry to get ready for school and work in the morning. We started having our breakfast standing up at our breakfast table in the kitchen and slowly it became a tradition and now even our Little One brings his small step to join us to share the breakfast together while standing up. It only takes a few minutes, but fills my day with joy, happiness, inspirations and love. I did a little bit of snooping around my partner's social media to get some ideas and a feel of what she might enjoy in life and I found the perfect inspiration for my card. I do hope that my partner will like this card and find at least one or two small things she can relate to. I used to bake a lot and cake decoration was one of the hobbies that kept me going when the times were quite hard. I used to bake cakes just for fun, for my family and my friends. The best part always was the decorating process. Playing with the sugar paste like you would with play dough. It was so much fun and most importantly it took my mind off many dark thoughts and brought joy to my family and friends! The rose... I simply love flowers and one day I will have a garden filled with beautiful flowers that would bloom all year round. But for now I buy flowers and enjoy just a few potted plants on our balcony. An Iceberg Rose is one of them and it's a delight to see it grow and bloom. I had a little scare just recently because the plant almost died, but it's coming back to life and bearing new buds that are going to open up soon. It makes me smile to think that we will have fresh Iceberg roses for Christmas from our balcony. I also have a Red Riding Hood plant with the most adorable pink flowers that is getting ready to bloom again after a short break. Some time ago I bought a wonderful book on Etsy and it arrived in a simple handmade fabric envelope that the seller designed and sewed herself. I thought it was such a lovely touch and very good protection for the book. I myself made a few fabric envelopes for my books that I carry around in my bag and they are very useful, so I thought it would be nice to place the ATC inside a small envelope, not so much for protection, but to add that last tiny finishing touch. Raw edges, simple stitching in dark brown thread to match the card and a small stamp on the front. That's all. It would even make a great Christmas present wrapping, I think. The other day I looked through my collection of Artist Trading Cards that I received over the last four years and it brought so many lovely memories of happy mail days and memories of late evenings I spent working on my cards. Ali's ATC swap was the first ever swap I joined and I was so worried, even scared stepping into this unknown world to me. I am glad I took that step as it opened up a new wonderful world to me. If you are (like me years ago) thinking of joining in any swap or sew along, I would highly recommend doing it without any hesitation. You will meet wonderful people and open a new creative world to yourself, even when you are not sure how to do certain things, there will be some one to guide you and help you along the way. It is a wonderful experience that leads to new beautiful friendships. Happy sewing, happy inspirations and happy first steps in anything you do!

Truth Super Deluxe Edition - I know we're getting an Audio Fidelity copy of this (which I very much want), but a super deluxe with the mono mix, some sort of stereo mix (original or remix by someone who knows what they're doing), singles, BBC sessions, and other recordings would be fantastic\nLed Zeppelin - New Live Stuff - I guess we could call this rumored, since John Davis is definitely mastering something , and I'm sure whatever it is would be fantastic, but I would definitely love to see Japan '71. Something unknown would be cool too (basically anything would be nice in this case)\nThe Beatles - The White Album Super Deluxe - Also more rumored than just wishful thinking, I just got the Pepper box and think it's outstanding. The two discs of outtakes alone made it a worthwhile purchase for me (and was totally the draw, as I never nee d remixes and already had the mono). The White Album is probably my favorite Beatles album so a super deluxe with outtakes (Esher demos, 27 minute \"Helter Skelter,\" anything else) would be most welcome. Side note: I also have a weird obsession with finding the original '87 discs sealed in the original longbox, I always preferred the two separate cases for this release for some weird reason.\nThe Who - San Francisco '71 - Nothing to say here other than that it's a great show (from what I can tell from what's available) and I want to hear it\nDeep Purple - Made In Europe box - This has been rumored for a while and supposedly should be happening soon, but I won't hold my breath.\nBlack Sabbath - More archive releases - Much like Zeppelin, the Sabs are celebrating their 50th anniversary in 2018, and I feel like their vaults have barely been raided.

From his beginnings as a slack, alt-country rocker (playing Uncle Tupelo\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019ve Been Had\u201d) and A.M. -era Wilco (with \u201cPassenger Side\u201d) to his recent turn as Mavis Staples\u2019 producer and songwriter (on \u201cJesus Wept\u201d) and later, Nels Cline-era Wilco (\u201cLocator\u201d). \nThe constant in all this experimenting is Tweedy\u2019s voice as a singer and songwriter \u2014 one that invites a deep trust, even when it courts darkness. Performing solo with an acoustic guitar, his voice was once again at the center of it all. \nNaturally, Tweedy surprised, opening with an unreleased song that looks forward and back \u2014 a theme of the evening. \u201cI leave behind a trail of songs / from the darkest gloom to the brightest sun,\u201d he sang. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my way, but it\u2019s hard to say / what I\u2019ve been through should matter to you.\u201d It may hard to say why, but it\u2019s clear that it does.

He reiterated his message made to parish councillors of Mumbwa Catholic Parish on the importance of supporting couples as well as putting in place pastoral programmes that accompany couples and families. The Archbishop was on a pastoral visit to Mumbwa last Sunday. Mumbwa is a town in the Central Province of Zambia, lying 160 Km west of the capital, Lusaka. \nAs has become the tradition of Mumbwa Catholic Parish, on the occasion of the Archbishop's visit to administer the Sacrament of Confirmation, parish councillors met Archbishop Mpundu in a Question and Answer session. \nTaking a question on Catholics who seek divorce in civil courts after blessing their marriage in a Catholic Church, the Archbishop spoke of his disquiet with the trend. \n\u201cThere is a high rate of divorce prevailing in Zambia today; Lusaka alone last year recorded over 8,000 marriages granted divorce by local, magistrate and even the high court. This is because the laws of Zambia permit divorce under certain conditions and circumstances. As for us, Catholics, the fault is almost entirely of our own making because when young people want to receive the Sacrament of Matrimony, they know they have to go to the Church so that the priests can do the needful and finally bless the marriage in Church. When problems arise in marriage, they do not go back to the priests to seek guidance and counselling but run to the courts because they know that the Church does not permit divorce. However, as soon as the courts grant them divorce they remarry and return to the Church and want to be re-admitted to the Sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist! The divorced and remarried are not allowed to receive the Sacraments of Penance and Eucharist. The Church does not recognise divorces granted by civil courts of whatever level granted to Catholic couples because a validly contracted Catholic Church Marriage cannot be broken. In other words, it is indissoluble,\" Archbishop Mpundu told his audience. \nThe Archbishop, however, urged parishes to ensure adequate preparation of young couples who wish to access the Sacrament of Matrimony. He suggested that there ought to be in place a programme of pre-marriage catechesis for young adults after they receive Confirmation; marriage catechesis for engaged couples with the intention of tying the knot of Matrimony and then later Family Life catechesis which he described as very critical. \n\u201cThe stages mentioned (above) are critical because most young people enter marriage with very little if any useful knowledge of what it is all about. Traditional life provided the formation mainly for the young women but little if anything for the young men except perhaps in patrilineal societies. In all this there was and still is a lot that does not agree with the Catholic Christian doctrine and morals; it needs to be evangelised. Besides, Traditional life provided quite well the support mechanism for the newly married and young couples, but this support is largely absent in the rapidly urbanised Zambia. This vacuum must be filled-in efficiently and effectively by the Church otherwise the two institutions of marriage and family will be greatly weakened and finally damaged beyond repair in the foreseeable future. The future of the family is the future of the Church; The Catholic Family is known as \"the Domestic Church\". To the measure that the family is adversely affected is to the same measure that the Church is affected,\u201d Archbishop Mpundu emphasised. \n(Paul Samasumo, Vatican Radio)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul samasumo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "archbishop mpundu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "telesphore-george mpundu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mpundu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zambia conference of catholic bishops", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic church marriage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vatican radio\u2019s english africa service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbwa catholic parish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic christian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic family", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vatican radio", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "central province of zambia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zambia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lusaka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbwa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:26.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "140478d54b48b477708746b770943597827dbb93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7uI68rqpB3Ly2x2JbwLqa42nJvKF3MTE59VkchO3OXgaP1F1Lny.dRr3zbx_WVDVPX2tt_GLM6BHkuHne_oeGFNMCHQ1UKEiE-", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "2018 \u2013 Pre-orders, rumours, hopes dream and aspirations | Page 3", "title_full": "2018 \u2013 Pre-orders, rumours, hopes dream and aspirations | Page 3 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/80/80811.jpg?1511637799", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93da689f9bb4dce58cb640ffe56777e51d68b38a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7uI68rqpB3Ly2x2JbwLqa42nJvKF3MTE59VkchO3OXgaP1F1Lny.dRr3zbx_WVDVPX2tt_GLM6BHkuHne_oeGFge71jsAZy6eNr_l_AYQdqg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Instant Dharma", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The next Zappa vault release.
