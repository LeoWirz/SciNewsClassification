But you'll still have options.\nGoogle is threatening to pull YouTube from Fire TV by Jan. 1, the latest round in a fierce battle between the two tech heavyweights. If that happens, Fire TV owners can still watch on a phone, tablet or personal computer. That includes an Amazon Fire tablet, as Google hasn't threatened to block that yet.\nFor those willing to abandon Fire TV, just about any other device will play YouTube. Not all of them will play video from Amazon, although Apple TV just got Amazon's app Wednesday.\nLATEST BUSINESS How This Audio-Focused App Motivates You to Run Cheddar FOX Business Report - 12/7/17 Fox7 A Simple Solution for Solving the Annoyance of Finding Roommates FortuneTime Lawmakers\u2019 Most Popular Hashtag in 2017 Veuer Lawmakers\u2019 Most Popular Hashtag in 2017 Buzz60 FOX Business Beat: Thursday, December 7 Fox5DC Alaska Airlines Offering Early Boarding for Passengers Wearing an Ugly Christmas Sweater Buzz60 Why in These States, Holiday Shopping Will Cost You More! Buzz60 One Of The Biggest Companies In The World Is Cutting 12,000 Jobs Buzz60 One Of The Biggest Companies In The World Is Cutting 12,000 Jobs Veuer Here are some reasons you might want to stick with Fire TV \u2014 and some you might not.\n___\nTHE CASE FOR FIRE TV\nYouTube was never the centerpiece of Fire TV to begin with. It's not even a full-fledged app on Fire TV \u2014 just a link to a YouTube website designed for mobile devices.\nFire TV itself is best seen as a companion to Amazon's $99-a-year Prime loyalty program. Although Amazon has gotten better about promoting rival services, video available through Prime remains prominent.\nThe device has Amazon's Alexa voice assistant built-in. In addition to weather, sports scores and stock Quote: s, it offers playback controls for some selected apps. That lets you ask Alexa to forward 30 seconds, for instance.\nAmazon's $40 Fire TV Stick is good for regular, high-definition TV sets. If you have a higher-resolution 4K TV, you'll want the regular Fire TV for $70. There isn't a lot of 4K video yet, but the price difference is small compared with what 4K TVs cost.\nThe regular Fire TV also offers high-dynamic range, which has better contrast and produces brighter whites and darker blacks. Again, HDR video is slowly coming.\nOn the downside, Fire TV doesn't offer iTunes or Google Play video \u2014 and YouTube may soon join the list. Fire TV's remote also lacks volume controls, something that's becoming standard on streaming devices.\n___\nGOOGLE'S ALTERNATIVE\nThe current feud centers on Amazon's refusal to sell some Google devices that compete with Amazon products. That includes Google's Chromecast, a streaming device that's cheap but slightly tricky to use, since you have to start video on your iPhone or Android phone and then switch the stream to the TV.\nPlenty of video services work with Chromecast \u2014 but Amazon doesn't let its video service work with the Google device.\nGoogle offers other manufacturers its own software for streaming devices called Android TV. On those devices, Google's YouTube and Play services often get prominent billing in search results, but at least you can get Amazon video. Again, no iTunes.\nOne of those gadgets is the Shield from Nvidia. It's pricey, starting at $179, but comes with 4K and HDR. You get voice searches through Google's Assistant \u2014 playback controls with some apps, weather info and some data you might never think to ask a TV, such as flight status.\nShield is powerful and designed with gamers in mind; one feature allows screen sharing of game play. A package that includes a game controller costs $20 more. The controller gives you a headphone jack for private listening and hands-free queries with Google Assistant.\n___\nPLAYING NICE WITH BOTH\nRoku has one of the most complete channel libraries \u2014 more than 5,000, many of which you've never heard of. You can get YouTube, Google Play and Amazon video, but not iTunes.\nRoku's Express sells for just $30. The $50 Streaming Stick gets you a remote with volume buttons and voice search \u2014 though we're talking basic queries related to shows and apps, not playback controls or information such as weather. The $70 Streaming Stick Plus adds 4K and HDR. Bells and whistles in the $100 Ultra include a remote that will emit a sound to help you find it under your couch cushions.\nThe Ultra's remote has a headphone jack, so you can watch TV without waking up roommates. For cheaper models, you can get that through Roku's smartphone app. (With Fire TV and Apple TV, you can pair wireless headphones.)\n___\nFOR APPLE FANS\nApple TV is the only device to support iTunes. It also has YouTube, but not Google Play. Amazon joined Apple TV on Wednesday.\nThough an iPhone isn't required, Apple TV will be most useful with one. The basic device is $149; a version with 4K and HDR costs $30 more. You're paying for the experience \u2014 in particular, integration and syncing with other Apple gadgets. For instance, you can type passwords on an iPhone instead of navigating a keyboard on the TV.\nSiri offers similar playback controls and information queries as Alexa and Google Assistant. The touchpad on the remote offers faster forwarding and rewinding than rivals.\nAnd while all streaming devices offer more than just video, Apple TV goes much further in offering an iPhone-like experience on a big screen. You can browse Ikea's catalog or order food from Grubhub, for instance.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/iG2ZVLmb-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/ZTXE6kHa-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/cnmXegNF-720.jpg)", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/wz2pEv9L-720.jpg)", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/71/75/14655298/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/UWhGR1bW-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/SZ53Ihv2-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/PmlyZoV3-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/ge6Cf1gZ-720.jpg)", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/71/75/14655298/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/sZS0QHzO-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/1xuoUrLy-720.jpg)"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:09.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "29e0578e3bb7b75da08571a5c4ded7b7fb89fb60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.atIXNnaXxGciShFBUBfPwxEel4QUH7JRdhM3RgNnNL3ymMpfNeJ5lngGJ7gN8bjXqOiSxUfGxkdmkDedpJC3U", "site_full": "www.ramforum.com", "site": "ramforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.ramforum.com/f91/", "site_categories": ["entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "The Great Outdoors - DODGE RAM FORUM - Dodge Truck Forums", "title": "Show off pics of deer kills ! - Page 12", "title_full": "Show off pics of deer kills ! - Page 12 - DODGE RAM FORUM - Dodge Truck Forums", "published": "2017-11-21T13:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4901ad90ae56c9f4b36ab74cd56d94ff9e3d12d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.atIXNnaXxGciShFBUBfPwxEel4QUH7JRdhM3RgNnNL3ymMpfNeJ5lngGJ7gN8bjXqOiSxUfGxkfLQGs.swNsAK4XHyy1lP1m06qN5yGl2mA--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "R.L.K.", "published": "2017-12-05T05:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Originally Posted by Buckfat 2017 Good Lord what a brute !!

That being said, I feel Christianity has so much to offer even modern society, so it constantly disappoints me to see them chase such divisive issues which are really not the most important overall (the big three are abortion, euthanasia and sexual ethics). There are far more important matters the church can address which are nowhere near as divisive.

We ate dinner there, saw lots of friends, and the kids really enjoyed the fair games. Here\u2019s Leah on the cupcake walk. \nJen had made cupcakes for the cupcake walk, but Leah opted for the emoji cupcake instead. \nMany of the games let you win tickets which could be exchanged for prizes. Our kids ended up with way too many prizes, but our neighbors (who have 3 kids) ended up with even more. Bob was excited to carry them all home (though he doesn\u2019t have the giant beachball yet in this picture). \nThis was the church\u2019s first year doing it, but I really hope the organizers keep it going every year.

That being said, I feel Christianity has so much to offer even modern society, so it constantly disappoints me to see them chase such divisive issues which are really not the most important overall (the big three are abortion, euthanasia and sexual ethics). There are far more important matters the church can address which are nowhere near as divisive. Unfortunately though, that big three continues to define them and as such society sees the church as divisive and untrustworthy (an Essential poll a few weeks back found that the Church has a 28% trust rating, which was the third lowest after the Unions and Political parties). Of the three, depending on which strand of Christianity you talk to. SSM and sexual ethics (even before SSM marriage was even a thing) have always been at odds, and the most controversial, since the sexual revolution of the 60s. It is not surprising for the church to buck those trends.\nMost Christians while having strong opposition to those 3 issues, and I am somewhat glad they do stick with their convictions (especially on euthanasia). I think for instance with euthanasia in Australia, they put their money where their mouth is, in aiming to provide high quality pallative care (e.g. anglicare).

Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential chief executive Igor Sechin. \nThe former minister pleaded not guilty to the charges and told the court on Thursday he had fallen victim to \"a horrific and cruel provocation.\" \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin.

This new technology utilizes distributed computing solutions to run 3DCS analyses on scalable computing resources in the cloud, both freeing up users licenses and machines for continuing work as well as dramatically improving the speed of the analysis. \nParallel Works is an innovative cloud-based platform that empowers users with \u201cpersonal supercomputers\u201d. The platform enables users to seamlessly run large-scale technical analyses in parallel \u2013 across hundreds to thousands of computer cores \u2013 leveraging the scale of the cloud at the click of a button. This makes studies that typically take hours, days or longer to be completed in a fraction of the time. With this new solution, users can determine how much cloud compute power to use based on the size of the job, adding additional machines for large jobs, or using only a few for basic analyses. \n\u201cBy giving users the ability to offload their analysis to the cloud, they no longer have to wait for long run times before continuing their work,\u201d said Dave Johnson, 3DCS Product Manager at Dimensional Control Systems. \u201cNot only does this free up local hardware and license, but now users can spend credits as needed to run their analysis as fast as they want. This means that priority results can be produced in minutes, while low priority ones can be allowed to run in the cloud over a longer period of time.\u201d \n\n\n3DCS software is an advanced tolerance analysis package integrated into Dassault Systems\u2019 CATIA, Siemens\u2019 NX and PTC\u2019s Creo CAD platforms. As the standard for variation analysis software across the automotive and aerospace industries, 3DCS offers powerful tools for engineers and designers to simulate their products assembly process and 3D tolerance stack-up to reduce scrap and rework as well as quality issues that could lead to warranty and liability claims. \n\u201cThis partnership opens new options for our user base,\u201d said Donald Jasurda, Vice President of Dimensional Control Systems. \u201cIt is our goal to constantly strive to deliver the best possible tools for dimensional analysis. In doing so, we work to both improve the functionality of the software, and improve its ease of use. This new feature will give our users the option of increasing their analysis speeds as needed, increasing their productivity and delivering the results they need when they need them.\u201d \n\n\nThe Distributed Computing platform is easy to start using. Credits are used to run analyses in the platform, which can be purchased in sizes tailored to suit the needs of customer\u2019s projects. DCS and Parallel Works are offering all users 300 free credits to evaluate the Distributed Computing platform and prove its value. To learn more and get your free Credits, go to http://www.3dcs.com/distributed-computing-powered-parallel-works-cloud . \nAbout DCS \nDCS has been supporting quality management in industries including automotive, aerospace, medical device, electronics and industrial machinery for over 20 years. DCS solutions are used daily by companies like Airbus, BMW, GM, LG, Nissan, Phillips, Sony, Textron Aviation and VW.

So I need to convert a basic authentication token request made by the app, and convert that to a Oauth2 token request. \nIf the credentials are valid in the backend system, then I get a Access token in return. \nIdeally I would like to just pass the client ID and client secret from the basic authentication request to the oauth2 token request. But I am not entirely sure that is possible. Storing the credentials can be an option, but as mention I would like to go with just passing them through the proxy. \nSo the job in question is to: \n- Make an API proxy/converter that makes it possible to convert a token request from basic authentication to Oauth2. Ideally this solution should be made in SAP cloud platform, but using apigee is also an option. \n- Make the solution easy to copy/paste so it is easy to use on multiple backend systems/data sources \n- Make some fault tolerance or error logging in case of errors/warnings. \n- Make it testable", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:10.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "213ebba71ce3b53142922326dcc05f8bf690c188", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw37pM0ts6wjUDYlgl5D4Rshneb15Be3GzI.1aoqZd_NWt9lIhEWm9RHOX_W0oEyk3ukzFpEc6g7LpPgN3WvqHStvuirubkdqCRAavCyZ8tiWvdVwYVgn8qfo_el7KtLSQ5dU_e_45R3cKOfGwB92CVxeV3KMDCoukz5E8CG0uXGp76a16Owfd_4aSHPHV74A-", "site_full": "www.gumtree.ie", "site": "gumtree.ie", "site_section": "https://www.gumtree.ie/s-leinster/jobs/v1l2q0p1", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Jobs in Leinster | Gumtree Classifieds Ireland", "title": "Architectural Designer (Dublin) Hi Tech Semiconductor Plant Project 217385589", "title_full": "Architectural Designer (Dublin) Hi Tech Semiconductor Plant Project | Dublin | Gumtree Classifieds Ireland | 217385589", "published": "2017-12-07T12:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://securet9.classistatic.com/1.1.451/images/en_IE/logoOpenGraph.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 62533, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "213ebba71ce3b53142922326dcc05f8bf690c188", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw37pM0ts6wjUDYlgl5D4Rshneb15Be3GzI.1aoqZd_NWt9lIhEWm9RHOX_W0oEyk3ukzFpEc6g7LpPgN3WvqHStvuirubkdqCRAavCyZ8tiWvdVwYVgn8qfo_el7KtLSQ5dU_e_45R3cKOfGwB92CVxeV3KMDCoukz5E8CG0uXGp76a16Owfd_4aSHPHV74A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gumtree.ie", "published": "2017-12-07T12:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "Architectural Designer (Dublin) Hi Tech Semiconductor Plant Project 217385589", "text": "Candidates will have a relevant Architectural Technician qualification and AutoCAD training with a minimum of 4+ years experience working as an Architectural Designer candidates who have Hi Tech project experience: Semiconductor and or Pharmaceutical are preferred.\nMain Duties and Responsibility\u2019s\nProduce technical drawings, specifications, compliance / DV reports, and other written technical documentation.\nSite surveys and produce softcopy documents (AutoCAD).\nSkills and Experience:\nWorking on projects that have strict cost control.\nAbility to coordinate with other disciplines to produce a construction package.\nKnowledge of software package \u2013 AutoCAD, Microsoft Excel, Word, Outlook etc\nThis role is Contract FOR Services and hourly rate is negotiable depending on experience.\nFor Further information or to apply: Please contact: Tom Doyle at kppm in Dublin on:086 8205038 or Email: tom@kppm.ie", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:10.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d9a281580e1bd6005b8ce0f869e74acc1c9d869", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSizmAud0usUNw0cP.zQvoG9IfgOktZL2oeqQYZ0kZq7OjaL_4PKHmfhFX7iAIgNVnLaFrsF6k_qP88L4zfydm3", "site_full": "vwcaliforniaclub.com", "site": "vwcaliforniaclub.com", "site_section": "https://vwcaliforniaclub.com/forums/official-forum-meets.70/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Official Forum Meets | VW California Owners Club ", "title": "Club Meets in 2017/2018", "title_full": "Cali Meet - Club Meets in 2017/2018 | VW California Owners Club", "published": "2017-11-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://vwcaliforniaclub.com/data/avatars/m/0/2.jpg?1506267258", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19698424b2dbf50e56fa416254f01c0cd498ec9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSizmAud0usUNw0cP.zQvoG9IfgOktZL2oeqQYZ0kZq7OjaL_4PKHmfhFX7iAIgNVnLaFrsF6k_qKmUby1h8rWS08tJk6Fy1MM-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "Jabberwocky", "published": "2017-11-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "j3ggo said: \u2191 We live in Market Drayton, North Shropshire.

I never post and I\u2019ve just been lurking like I\u2019m sure of some you are who\u2019s reading this.\nFirst off, if you are considering suicide, please consider calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. Acne is a difficult, painful, emotionally destabilizing, but you will get through it.\nI wanted to tell you my story over the last 10 years, and to warn you, it is quite long but it may help you if you were/are in my position. I will be going over what medications I took, and my final straw with doctor\u2019s recommendations as the last one recommended that I stay on Accutane for the rest of my life.\nI have before/after photos, but if enough people find value in a video, I will consider making one and may actually do it to spread awareness. I have a few since I was 16 the beginning and throughout my 20s. For now, I will share with you my most recent cystic acne outburst. The photo that you see with my severe acne was in Late August 2017 and the other one is a picture taken today, early December 2017 (approximately 3 months). This was actually the second worst acne breakout that I ever had. The first one occurred when I was 18 on Accutane.\nAs you can see, I still have a lot of scarring, but I don\u2019t break out anymore. The scars you see developed when I was figuring it all out after discontinuing the expensive products and topical + oral medications that I was put on. I cut those medications off in July 2017, and my face went bonkers. Why in July? Well, for one my health coverage was ending and I would be paying a much larger out of pocket expensive. To add to that, around April/May, the dermatologist I was seeing recommended that I start a new prescription of 40MG of Accutane infinitely. I was scared, nervous, and almost had a mental break down. I asked what are the side effects? Why forever? She said \u201cbecause we\u2019ve tried everything else, but you don\u2019t have to go on Accutane if you are happy continuing to take your current medications\u201d. I was frustrated. So, I decided to learn everything I could about the science of Acne, diet, skin care, bacteria, etc.\nNow before I jump into the story, to put actual figures behind my prescriptions + recommendations. At the time, spending close to ~400 a month just to keep my acne at bay WITH health insurance. Albeit, hindsight is 20/20 and some of the lotions recommended to me by my dermatologist were anti-aging creams that they encouraged. I was too foolish to question anything otherwise. It wasn\u2019t needed in solving the underlying issue. Why was I still breaking out after ALL of this? WHY? WHY ME? Questions I\u2019m sure you ask yourself too.\nI\u2019ve been through many of the same stages as you guys. First let\u2019s start with all the medications/things I\u2019ve been on or tried personally and can attest to how you may be feeling.\nOver the Counter Meds:\nBenzoyl Peroxide Wash/Gel (All strengths)\nSalicylic Acid Wash (All strengths)\nProActiv\nPrescriptions:\nMinocycline\nDoxycycline\nClindamycin\nTetracycline\nRetin-A\nIsotretinoin (Accutane) (Up to 40mg)\nTazorac\nDifferin\nAczone\nBenzaclin\nThings I\u2019ve experimented with\nJojoba oil\nTeatree oil\nMaka Honey Mask (Regular raw honey also)\nRose pedal Toner\nAloe Vera Toner\nDieting\nSweating by workout/Sauna\nSalt based cleansers\nKorean skin exfoliates\nSwimming frequently\nTanning\nNiacin\nChanging bed sheets/ bed covers often\nChanging detergent\nDifferent Hair products\nDifferent Shampoo/ Conditioners\nClean & Clear Adv\nTNS Essential Serum (Expensive)\nChinese Herbal Tea\nVietnamese Yoga\nVitamin C face lotion\nAs you can see, I have tried a lot of things. This list doesn\u2019t include the countless amount of expensive lotions/\u201cmiracle\u201d creams to help with scarring that I was recommended by people and forgot the name. I\u2019ve been to a few cosmetic dermatologist to fix my issues, and although they are amazing, I needed to stop the root cause of my acne. Why am I getting acne? Why do I continue to breakout despite the oral pills, the over the counter drugs, and the gels that are supposedly stop breaking out.\nMy answer\nSince my acne was the worst some of the dermatologist I\u2019ve met with have ever seen, they didn\u2019t know what to do but to throw the kitchen sink at it. So, I knew my answer to Acne when going on a treatment was to battle it in a multi-factor way.\nDiet + Skin Care Routine + Overall Wellness/Cleanliness\nNow let\u2019s break it down:\nDiet\nFor me diet was HUGE. HUGE. The only thing that I was never coached on by any dermatologist. It was the PRIMARY thing that was breaking me out. After consuming whatever I wanted for over 20+ years, I realized some foods were terrible for me regarding my skin condition. I needed to stay away from Chocolate, Diary Products (cheese, ice cream, pizza, etc), and Coffee.\nI converted to a cleaner diet consisting of mainly fruits + veggies + cleaner meat dishes (staying away from fried foods, heavily sauced foods, and dishes with an abundant amount of sodium).\nChanging my diet helped with the rise of new acne. I wasn\u2019t forming these nasty cystic that pops up.\nWhat can you do? Look at what you eat and keep a journey or new acne to foods you consume. Skin Care Routine\nThis was important but it was something I was doing my whole life. This was just continuing this same process but now in a systematic way.\nI clean, tone, and moisturize. Sunscreen in the day. Benzo to kill P. Acne. I also use natural exfoliates to clean dead skin cells a couple times a week. If you aren\u2019t doing this in your daily routine, DO IT.\nWhat can you do? Buy a gentle cleanser that works for you, toner, and moisturizer. It is critical to put sunscreen on. Get the non-oily versions of the sun screen. If you aren\u2019t a big fan of benzo peroxide, you can everything else first and use benzo as a last resort, even a 2.5% may help. Overall wellness/ cleanliness\nI practice these a lot throughout my years but I will bring some awareness to a few that I do.\nDon\u2019t touch your face. It may seem obvious that you want to avoid putting dirt on your face, but it\u2019s so natural to touch your face if you are stressed or embarrassed etc etc. If you really need to touch your face to scratch an itch, use your shirt or a tissue. Do remember that your phone has more bacteria on there than almost any appliance you use on a day to day basis. Wipe it down. Save your health by killing that bacteria.\nPillow covers. Change them frequently. If you are extra oily like me, do it more often than others. I change mine every night if not every other night. Yes. It is a lot of work, but until you are for sure that you can go without it, you should incorporate this habit.\nThese are some examples of overall wellness that I committed to and will continue to commit to.\nWhat can you do? The above.\nAcne scars\nThis is the next stage of my acne journey. I am in the Acne scar revision phase. I have ice pick scars, rolling scars, keloid scars, atrophic scars, and the list goes on. I will take you guys on this journey with me and hopefully in a year, there will be some great results that I can help you guys with who may be in the acne scar phase or will be in the acne scar phase.\nI feel like there are so many parts to my story that I didn\u2019t include, but over the span of 10 years is a long time to cover everything. I would be happy to answer ANY question regarding the different mediation, gels, creams, lotions, and etc that you may have. I have been on Accutane and faced severe depression. I, like some of you, have considered suicide. Don\u2019t do it. Remember, you are beautiful. I put the list of things I\u2019ve tried so we can have an open general conversation about it. I can tell you my experience in what I liked/didn\u2019t like. If I wrote each experience up, it would be a novel.\nIt took me nearly a week to do this write up (partially due to work), and also I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be in the public eye with my acne and my problems. I\u2019m rather to myself with these things. But I want to be a resource to people. I\u2019ve dealt with this for 10 years. I know the pain you may be in. I\u2019m here for you. I wish I had someone do the same for me, so I\u2019m reaching out. Comment or message me. Share your story. I will try to help as I can and will get back to your messages!\n1 person likes this", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:11.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b7b692f472dc97a3c1fd78f00944de3f99d85270", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9s7BCK1Px0NkxubFHbtUAq.K1KYPNF.WIuRy6BoaqBS0v6DFXkpXNBPOrN1TDel0czk8UiZyAJ.MJ9KABl0eJKlDHbSj69Ivd3Ygg6S2mtEO3wms3qxGh4HRyU09Mkx0-", "site_full": "www.acne.org", "site": "acne.org", "site_section": "https://www.acne.org/messageboard/forum/38-acne-and-its-treatments/", "site_categories": ["dermatology", "health"], "section_title": "Acne and its treatments - Acne.org Community", "title": "My 10+ Year Acne Story | Tried It All - General acne discussion", "title_full": "My 10+ Year Acne Story | Tried It All - General acne discussion - Acne.org Community", "published": "2017-12-07T14:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.051, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31242, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f4e5034580102902bffb32c3f75637e4dc5cd0bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9s7BCK1Px0NkxubFHbtUAq.K1KYPNF.WIuRy6BoaqBS0v6DFXkpXNBPOrN1TDel0czk8UiZyAJ.MJ9KABl0eJKlDHbSj69Ivd3Ygg6S2mtEO3wms3qxGhob_AxsoDGf8_ILhehYKNOq2aBUS3G4x4", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "huynhingskin", "published": "2017-12-07T15:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hey 99f,\nI appreciate the response.

Sorry to see what pain acne has caused you. I actually wrote up a long thread in the body acne forum similar to yours, including the diet modifications, OTCs, and Rxs that I tried and the efficacy of each.\nThe pattern of your acne breakout makes me think of demodex. Since your breakouts are largely confined to your face you may be able to treat it with topicals alone (ZZ cream, 5% permethrin, oral metronidazole oral ivermectin, or some combination of the 4).\nWhat ultimately cured me is treating demodex mites. Please see my thread for more details. It looks like your lifestyle modifications have really brought it under control, and I hope you are fully cured but I suspect that it might take some treatment against the mites to fully heal your skin once and for all.\nRegards\nEdited 2 hours ago by 99f Kicking acne's butt since 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:11.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5759863ad45ee56999bd6285407ad57e3b987024", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTEWazfMInh1HYRaCI5uGDSTifDiDrpDsV6HT6xa3uVl58RsqlLxKjjRqFutCDkRQnVNBG8SiOsj301WZR.R2PAbhuWj9s3s4UlWvo4a42RFA--", "site_full": "www.epicnpc.com", "site": "epicnpc.com", "site_section": "https://www.epicnpc.com/forums/814-Dragon-Ball-Z-Dokkan-Battle-Accounts", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting", "non_standard_content", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle | DBZ Dokkan Account Trading ", "title": "iOS - Global Full dupe system lr black+extra dupe global", "title_full": "Selling iOS - Global Full dupe system lr black+extra dupe global", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.297, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 41122, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5759863ad45ee56999bd6285407ad57e3b987024", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTEWazfMInh1HYRaCI5uGDSTifDiDrpDsV6HT6xa3uVl58RsqlLxKjjRqFutCDkRQnVNBG8SiOsj301WZR.R2PAbhuWj9s3s4UlWvo4a42RFA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DokkanTrades", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "iOS - Global Full dupe system lr black+extra dupe global", "text": "PM\u0092d.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://imgur.com/a/VBsI6"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:12.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5ecae9496c3e3643edbb3541bf6a87c7a00191ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8bdZUrfZdjlDeXkm87PmWY-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5ecae9496c3e3643edbb3541bf6a87c7a00191ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8bdZUrfZdjlDeXkm87PmWY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "#include <iostream.h>\r\n#include <math.h>\r\n\r\n#define PI 3.14159265\r\n#define eps 0.000001\r\n#define Calka_dokladna 1.5707963267948966192\r\n\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\n//funkcja sin^2(x)\r\ninline long double f(long double x){\r\n     return  pow(sin(x), 2);\r\n  }\r\n\r\nint silnia(int n){\r\n        if (n<0)\r\n          return 0;\r\n        if (n==0 || n==1)\r\n          return 1;\r\n              \r\n          return silnia(n-1)*n;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n// dziala, nie ruszac!

Bipolar like many other illnesses is not easy to manage and it is equally difficult to be the carer or loved one of someone with the disorder.\nAs you pointed out, some of the things your partner does or says would be due to his illness and the best way to address these things is encourage him to continue searching for a good psychiatrist and psychologist who can help him find the right medication. Finding the right medication is a long process, and sometimes even if you find the right medication, it works for a couple of months or years even, then it seems to stop working! This was the case with me, and I found from my experience that whilst medication really goes a long way and helps, there will always be periods of tough times and having to reassess. I think it's great that you're supporting your partner and he is finding his way out of this low. Has he been through something like this before? If so, it's always helpful to remember that it will pass, and it's all part of the illness.\nHOWEVER, the other question is you, your health. It's hard for you and it's really important that you take care of yourself so that you don't get sick too. Sometimes you need to take a break and step back from the situation. Do you have other loved ones, family or friends, to lean on? Go out, go for regular walks or swims, eat healthy and make sure you're engaging in as much self-care as possible. It might also be helpful to see a counsellor for yourself. A professional might be able to guide you in making the decision of whether or not you should walk away for your own health. I don't think others will make it for you - it's up to you to decide - but people like counsellors can guide you, can ask you the right questions so you can see what's best for you.\nRegarding the ECT, unfortunately I don't have experience with that which I can share. The treatments that work for me are medication and therapy and I have never tried ECT. However different treatments work for different people, and the best person to make a judgement is the doctor and your partner. In saying that, embarrassment, whilst understandable because there is a lot of stigma around mental health, should certainly not be a determining factor in making that decision. If the doctor does recommend ECT, then no one needs to know. But again, do ask for different medical opinions before deciding.\nJosette", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:12.028+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15094277, "moreResultsAvailable": 15094177, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512641052028&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 274}
