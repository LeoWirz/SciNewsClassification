If no photos are taken during this great occasion, then it would be very easy for people to forget the flow of events. That is why hiring a photographer is of paramount importance. But it is good to look for someone who is well-versed in this field of photography. For the best professional service for wedding photography Bay Area couples can search locally or online.\n\nWhen it comes to hiring a matrimony photographer, finding a real specialist is a plus. Remember the market is flooded with these service providers, and this makes it hard for one to choose a perfect camera expert. This, therefore, calls for a thorough legwork to ensure the right service provider is selected. Ensure that you interview several candidates before settling with one. Outlined in this article are some guidelines for choosing a wedlock photographer.\n\nExperience is the first important aspect to look at when hiring these types of photographers. You should be concerned about their existence in business. A photographer who has been around for long must be well-versed in this particular field. Look for specialists that have filmed countless wedding settings. Avoid going for inexperienced people since they may not be able to meet your needs.\n\nSecondly, ask for samples of photographs they have taken in similar occasions. A reliable photographer is always proud of giving out sample photos upon request. You should have a keen eye on such pictures to ensure that the same quality has been maintained in all the photos. If you are hunting for a specialist over the Internet, consider checking for samples in their online photo galleries.\n\nThe third aspect is about references. A quality photographer will not hesitate when asked to provide a list of referees. You need to call the references and ask questions pertaining to the photography services offered by the specialist you want to hire. If they are not complaining, then you may proceed to hire the same service provider. But if otherwise, consider looking for an expert elsewhere.\n\nAnother important aspect to consider is how these services have been priced. Every company is unique and therefore prices are quite different. It is your mandate to search for a company that is ready to work within your budget. Getting quoted from different companies and comparing them is the best way to get affordable services.\n\nA good place to start when hunting for a wedding photographer is with referrals from people around. If you know any newly-married couple in your area, you should consider asking them to recommend you the photography specialist they hired to film their matrimony. Your relatives and friends can also be a great source of information.\n\nThe Internet is also a great platform to search for these professionals. Explore the Web to find established photo studios around your area. You can use the common search engines to locate reputable companies within your locality. Before making your final decision, consider reading the online reviews to see reactions from previous clients.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can find a list of the benefits you get when you hire a wedding photography Bay Area professional at http://www.simplejoie.com right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patrick baker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bay area", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:31.140+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c701404c32d51e7560e34675a8a6de93be336b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh3yfprJbaMKoYZXqjCUms6QqGXfJnE_crx7g6_0sIn2mG2d5KrPE7OKJC71F3YbuaveWkn4D8AyQ7JSndlUROtN4P8kQ8LHRQn", "site_full": "bizpr.us", "site": "bizpr.us", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/Bizprco", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BizPR.co", "title": "Subsea Boosting Systems Market Is Estimated To Reach US$3.07 bn by 2023", "title_full": "Subsea Boosting Systems Market Is Estimated To Reach US$3.07 bn by 2023", "published": "2017-12-07T11:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4c701404c32d51e7560e34675a8a6de93be336b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh3yfprJbaMKoYZXqjCUms6QqGXfJnE_crx7g6_0sIn2mG2d5KrPE7OKJC71F3YbuaveWkn4D8AyQ7JSndlUROtN4P8kQ8LHRQn", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "someshmrr", "published": "2017-12-07T11:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "Subsea Boosting Systems Market Is Estimated To Reach US$3.07 bn by 2023", "text": "December 7, 2017 Business & Professional Services Press Release No comments \u201cThe Latest Research Report Subsea Boosting Systems Market \u2013 Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth Trends, and Forecast 2015 \u2013 2023 provides information on pricing, market analysis, shares, forecast, and company profiles for key industry participants. \u2013 MarketResearchReports.biz\u201d This research study analyzes the market for subsea boosting systems in terms of revenue (US$ Mn).

The singer-songwriter, who is of Puerto Rican and Iranian descent, is perhaps best known locally for fronting Latin dance/rock band \u00a1Chiringa!, fusing traditional sounds and songs with Western pop influences (the band name itself is Puerto Rican Spanish for \u201ckite,\u201d and was Shireen\u2019s nickname growing up).

I stayed in touch with family (on the island), but when I heard about it \u2014 the extent of it \u2014 I was in shock. \u2026 I didn\u2019t have a ton of emotion.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, music brought the situation home for her. She heard Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s song \u201cAlmost Like Praying\u201d \u2014 written and recorded as a benefit for hurricane relief efforts and featuring top Latin American artists such as Marc Anthony, Camila Cabello, Gloria Estefan and Luis Fonsi \u2014 through a Facebook support thread. \u201cThey divided up all these verses and they showed footage of these artists singing into the microphone, and I broke. I just started bawling,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was touching, but it was like, oh, yeah. The fact that all of these artists have stepped up \u2014 it finally hit me, I guess \u2014 I don\u2019t know how else to explain it. And for the first time I felt anger, too. I felt anger in my belief and opinion about our contribution to global warming and climate change that to me are undeniably linked to this sudden influx of intense hurricane weather-patterning.\u201d \u00a1Chiringa! will lead the I Heart Puerto Rico benefit show at Volcanic Theatre Pub on Saturday \u2014 the second Puerto Rico benefit to hit the venue in three weeks, following the Tom Petty tribute show Nov. 25. Amini intends the event to be a cultural celebration of the island as well, including performances from Latin Dance Bend and Portland-based Afro-Cuban rock band 1,000 Fuegos. \u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that wants to remind people that Puerto Rico is a part of the U.S.,\u201d Amini said. \u201cI haven\u2019t necessarily heard people speak as if it is not, but I do feel like it really highlights the awkward relationship that Puerto Rico has with the U.S. At the same time \u2026 the fact that I\u2019m putting (the benefit) on \u2014 I personally have an investment in connecting people to the culture of Puerto Rico and the relationship, in my opinion, that we can embrace it not like a separate country, but as a beloved part of our unique country.\u201d Ticket sales, \u00a1Chiringa! CD sales and wine sales donated by Elixir Wine Group will benefit the Community Sustainability Center created by Programa de Educaci\u00f3n Comunal de Entrega y Servicio (P.E.C.E.S.) in Punta Santiago, Humacao, on the southeastern coast of the island. The organization, which has a 30-plus year history working on economic and educational development issues in disadvantaged communities, is starting to focus on sustainability initiatives on the island. These include rebuilding houses, installing a solar-powered water filtration system, building a solar energy system for the P.E.C.E.S. alternative high school and providing legal assistance for people who need help with insurance claims or Federal Emergency Management Agency applications, according to Dayani Centeno-Torres, a communication consultant for P.E.C.E.S. \u201cThe first move, of course, was to provide water and food to the people,\u201d Centeno-Torres said recently from Puerto Rico, \u201cbecause being in a mostly isolated area, because of the hurricane, it took days for first responders from government to get to the community. So (P.E.C.E.S.) began cleaning the streets and checking on people. And eventually when roads were opened, the organization became a regional distribution center for the area. They\u2019ve been doing this for two months, but now they want to go into the next level of service, which is very natural for the work that they\u2019ve done before in terms of community work.\u201d When Centeno-Torres spoke with GO! Magazine, the majority of the island had access to water, although still under a boil-water advisory, and approximately 50 to 60 percent of power generation had been restored on the island, she said. (She spoke from the capital, San Juan, which just got power back about a week ago, she said. Humacao does not have internet or phone access.) \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that 50 to 60 percent of people have power, because generation doesn\u2019t translate into distribution necessarily,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people without power, especially in the center of the island and on the eastern coast because of the impact of the winds. And at some places, it\u2019s been said that they won\u2019t have power until February or March.\u201d Centeno-Torres said P.E.C.E.S. will probably have to keep providing basic assistance with food and water for another month. The organization should be able to move to the next level of rebuilding sometime in January, she said. A GoFundMe page it started in early October has raised more than $25,000 of its $50,000 goal. \u201cFor me, I\u2019m still in shock to think that at this point, we still have to work with water and food,\u201d Centeno-Torres said. \u201cI would love to be at another point, but it\u2019s amazing how difficult it has been for people to get back to some sense of normalcy so they can go to the next level.\u201d The organization\u2019s focus on sustainable rebuilding caught Amini\u2019s attention. Her aunt and godmother still live in Puerto Rico, and Amini reached out to them to figure out which organization on the island to hold the benefit concert for. \u201cWhat (Centeno-Torres) said to me that really struck me was that food and water is not the most helpful right now,\u201d Amini said. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful, it\u2019s great. That\u2019s what people go to; they think that\u2019s what they need. Money is most helpful right now, but money obviously going towards organizations that have good strategies in place and projects in the works.\u201d 18889275 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satur", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "camila cabello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centeno-torres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lin-manuel miranda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dayani centeno-torres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shireen amini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shireen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marc anthony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luis fonsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gloria estefan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amini", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fuegos", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "programa de educaci\u00f3n comunal de entrega y servicio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elixir wine group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal emergency management agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "community sustainability center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "p.e.c.e.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sw century drive", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "punta santiago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humacao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volcanic theatre pub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:32.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "17132243d533fbf48233dae4d294b56352d5aecd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEvNDCtQAc2ELOqqwGUo3CoQtyseDYtPUZzf.LXndR_kjQ7BDBeYAOEMsn5SCAmz63ThbrTWcZW.SINzg1s7.KJmtJaYxosNeEqFm4_pET637e0K7k1n5uRY67W5QuEkhO8-", "site_full": "otorhinolaryngologysfakianakis.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://otorhinolaryngologysfakianakis.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "OtoRhinoLaryngology by Alexandros G.Sfakianakis", "title": "Effect of Body Position on Pharyngeal Swallowing Pressures Using High-Resolution Manometry", "title_full": "Effect of Body Position on Pharyngeal Swallowing Pressures Using High-Resolution Manometry", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "17132243d533fbf48233dae4d294b56352d5aecd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEvNDCtQAc2ELOqqwGUo3CoQtyseDYtPUZzf.LXndR_kjQ7BDBeYAOEMsn5SCAmz63ThbrTWcZW.SINzg1s7.KJmtJaYxosNeEqFm4_pET637e0K7k1n5uRY67W5QuEkhO8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Effect of Body Position on Pharyngeal Swallowing Pressures Using High-Resolution Manometry", "text": "Abstract The effect of body position and gravitational pull on the complex pressure-driven process of pharyngeal swallowing remains unknown. Using high-resolution manometry (HRM), this study aims to identify positional adaptations of pharyngeal physiology by evaluating swallowing pressure patterns in a series of inverted body positions. Ten healthy adults each underwent swallowing tasks with pharyngeal HRM at six body positions using an inversion table (0\u00b0[upright], 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0[supine], 110\u00b0, 135\u00b0, and 180\u00b0[fully inverted]). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess impact of position on pressure parameters, and pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients translate. Velopharyngeal pressures varied by position ( P < 0.001), with significantly higher pressures generated with inversion \u226590\u00b0, compared with upright and 45\u00b0. Change in position did not significantly affect common mesopharyngeal pressures or swallowing pressure durations. UES valving mechanisms were preserved during inversion, with subtle variations observed in integral pressures ( P = 0.011). Pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients changed with position ( P < 0.01), increasing with inversion > 90\u00b0 compared to upright and 45\u00b0. Mechanisms of deglutition may differ with position and relative direction of gravity, particularly when at > 45\u00b0 inclination. Increased palatal pressure is generated in the upside-down position to achieve nasopharyngeal closure and prevent regurgitation. While other classically measured pressures may not consistently differ with positioning, many individuals exhibit adaptations in pressure gradients when inverted, likely due to a combination of changes in pharyngeal driving force and UES opening mechanisms. Identification of these changes, relative to position, further builds on our understanding of the adaptability of the pharyngeal swallowing system.\n\n\nfrom Swallowing and Swallowing Disorders (Dysphagia) via a.lsfakia on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2nzWiCa\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hrm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anova", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:32.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69e529e3ac6fd12312c84b4c91d6a28fd0628800", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgx1Ghi4N2YEGHshZVeQy_su122fboe7Ul5mzQYfkHWo.ZkCiMEyU1QdwUgkxaLSu9f_yXjwt9.ch9FgrQRHC6YzlNoSs7Vn9SLADP7p2E1sew--", "site_full": "filipinochannel-tf.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://filipinochannel-tf.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Filipino Channel", "title": "Hanggang Saan - 07 December 2017", "title_full": "Hanggang Saan - 07 December 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "69e529e3ac6fd12312c84b4c91d6a28fd0628800", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgx1Ghi4N2YEGHshZVeQy_su122fboe7Ul5mzQYfkHWo.ZkCiMEyU1QdwUgkxaLSu9f_yXjwt9.ch9FgrQRHC6YzlNoSs7Vn9SLADP7p2E1sew--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tony (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hanggang Saan - 07 December 2017", "text": "VIDOZA OPENLOAD ESTREAM STREAMANGO ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hanggang saan", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:32.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13fc805c36a1eb2cd7b04c7716ceebbccc29676f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KvZtRHOQUvzzuNjKVN5oGh_oqA2P6rNbYYryTob65BrBWDCZ508.6MMCPDTYpLzMHBgFcUSN_hgp.JHfLY0FSdtG1w.Us9rd6wOBxWF1M.2C4HnnoPwmfs3AeRhhbLsw-", "site_full": "www.bendbulletin.com", "site": "bendbulletin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "GOP leaders said to be mulling smaller corporate tax cuts;", "title_full": "GOP leaders said to be mulling smaller corporate tax cuts;", "published": "2017-12-07T09:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.031, "main_image": "http://statics.bendbulletin.com/images/_thebulletin/TheBulletin-facebook400x400.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 93497, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13fc805c36a1eb2cd7b04c7716ceebbccc29676f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KvZtRHOQUvzzuNjKVN5oGh_oqA2P6rNbYYryTob65BrBWDCZ508.6MMCPDTYpLzMHBgFcUSN_hgp.JHfLY0FSdtG1w.Us9rd6wOBxWF1M.2C4HnnoPwmfs3AeRhhbLsw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Damian Paletta", "published": "2017-12-07T09:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "GOP leaders said to be mulling smaller corporate tax cuts;", "text": "Published Dec. 6, 2017 at 11:24PM GOP leaders said to be mulling smaller corporate tax cuts A - \nBy Damian Paletta and Erica Werner \nThe Washington Post WASHINGTON \u2014 Leading Republicans are looking at scaling back some of the corporate tax cuts they are trying to usher into law, two people involved in the tax negotiations said, convinced that they need to find new revenue to make last-minute fixes to the giant package moving through Congress. The House and Senate passed separate tax cut packages in recent weeks, and both bills would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. But GOP negotiators are openly discussing the possibility of moving that rate up to 22 percent to free up more revenue, people familiar with the discussions said. One of those people said the 22 percent rate is \u201cseriously under discussion.\u201d The two people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations. No decisions have been made. The White House has been resistant to making this change, but President Donald Trump said casually on Saturday morning that the 22 percent corporate rate might be necessary. Each percentage point that is added back to the corporate rate would free up about $100 billion in revenue over 10 years. Still, White House officials have tried to stress to Congress in the past two days that their strong preference is to keep the corporate rate at 20 percent. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he, too, was resistant to raising the rate. \u201cNot as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still 20.\u201d The House and Senate must pass matching tax bills before Trump can sign the package into law. But there are a number of changes Republicans want that would make the legislation more costly, and the package cannot add more than $1.5 trillion to the debt over 10 years. One of the changes they are considering would repeal, or at least severely scale back, an alternative-minimum tax for corporations that tries to limit the deductions and credits companies can take. Another major change receiving growing attention would allow Americans to deduct up to $10,000 of state income tax or local property tax from their federal income tax. The House and Senate bills would only allow Americans to deduct the property tax component, but lawmakers are looking to give people more flexibility. Another leading Finance Committee member, Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., cited both of those issues in acknowledging that Republicans are looking for new revenue sources to address lingering problems. \u201cSo we all understand there are some things that are going to have to change. So we\u2019re going to have to figure out how to do that,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not predicting that we\u2019re going to go to a 22 percent corporate rate.\u201d The White House and Republican leaders have heard numerous complaints from wealthy GOP donors in California and New York who believe their taxes could go up under the new regime because of limitations on deductions. They are trying to make changes to address those concern before the package is completed. Trump referenced these complaints Wednesday when he said that the final GOP tax bill should take care of the \u201ctiny little sliver\u201d of people who don\u2019t benefit under the legislation as written. The president\u2019s comments came as House and Senate Republicans worked to iron out differences between the tax bills passed by each chamber, with the goal of sending compromise legislation to Trump before Christmas. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., endorsed one change under consideration, which would allow a $10,000 property-tax deduction in the bill to apply to state income taxes as well. \u201cThat sounds like a kind of reasonable idea,\u201d McConnell told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday. There is believed to be more than a \u201ctiny little sliver\u201d of Americans who will miss out on benefits from the GOP legislation, according to nonpartisan analyses that show the bills skew toward corporations and the wealthy despite their billing as a middle-class tax cut. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a fantastic tax bill. There are very, very few people that aren\u2019t benefiting by it, but there\u2019s that tiny little sliver,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to try to take care of even that very small group of people that just through circumstances maybe don\u2019t get the full benefit of what we\u2019re doing. But the middle class gets a tremendous benefit, and business, which is jobs, gets a tremendous benefit.\u201d According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, slightly more than 24 percent of taxpayers would see a tax increase by 2027 under the version of the bill passed by the House. Under the Senate-passed bill, 48 percent of taxpayers would pay more by then, largely because of tax breaks that are set to expire in five years. Republicans insist those tax breaks would actually be extended by a future Congress. 18950988 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hugh hewitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "damian paletta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick toomey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toomey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orrin hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erica werner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gop", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tax policy center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate finance committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finance committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-pa.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-ky.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:32.053+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6da3ca6407d7c0886ab1ee416b0bf2fbae32be44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/r9R5Oks0axSHcsPzJYKpMnEXqitxsLhIlZpfwf9aQ5hiX7k_i0wP_6SeiynRJhvZmgGsUzt0.5hFepFof5zYjdvlE28AR59Q1CC2rQkTY2g-", "site_full": "zeealgje.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://zeealgje.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": ".", "title": "Directed Energy Weapons Again in California Wildfires", "title_full": "Directed Energy Weapons Again in California Wildfires", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6da3ca6407d7c0886ab1ee416b0bf2fbae32be44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/r9R5Oks0axSHcsPzJYKpMnEXqitxsLhIlZpfwf9aQ5hiX7k_i0wP_6SeiynRJhvZmgGsUzt0.5hFepFof5zYjdvlE28AR59Q1CC2rQkTY2g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "omanieta (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Directed Energy Weapons Again in California Wildfires", "text": "\n\nGepubliceerd op 6 dec. 2017 Here\nit is again, and this one has eye witness report for real, plus the \nfact it is loaded with 6 6 6 numerology.

I love Matt\u2019s family. Really love them. But they\u2019re a large, strong-minded, active bunch. They all grew up on a farm in North Dakota, where they learned to drive a tractor at 7 years old. They\u2019re good, generous, neighborly people down to their core, but let\u2019s just say downtime \u2014 which is what I use vacations for \u2014 isn\u2019t their strength. But we\u2019re both big believers that nothing\u2019s more important than time with family. Matt\u2019s sister, who lives in Wyoming with her husband and three children, picked Steamboat Springs, Colorado, as our vacation spot because her in-laws have a condo there. Matt\u2019s younger sister and her husband drove from Bozeman, Montana, with their baby and preschooler, while his brother flew in from Fargo, North Dakota, with his girlfriend. We drove 15 hours from Edina, Minnesota, for a weeklong multigenerational ski trip over winter break.

View More Matt and I had been to Steamboat Springs years before with friends. Tucked along the Yampa River in northwest Colorado, the Western-flavored town twinkled with holiday spirit even in the offseason: The sun reflected off its dry, light snow \u2014 trademarked by Steamboat as \u201cChampagne Powder\u201d \u2014 while the party lights strung outside its apr\u00e9s-ski bars added to the festive mood. This time, to save money on rentals, we bought used ski equipment for our three kids at a hometown tent sale, then tied it to the roof of our van. We checked into the 328-room Steamboat Grand across the street from the gondola. It had a pair of outdoor saltwater hot tubs and a pool for off-slope entertainment, as well as a spa. Plus, it offered complimentary slope-side storage to make hitting the powder with kids a breeze, as we didn\u2019t need to haul skis back and forth. Our three one- and two-bedroom condos overlooked the mountains and gave kids with early bedtimes a separate room to sleep in while adults gathered in front of the fireplace at night. And, booking them separately made money matters easier. Upon arrival, our kids raced from floor to floor in search of their cousins while I swung by a nearby Safeway to stock up our kitchenette. We planned to take turns hosting dinner, not only to divide the labor and save on food costs but also to ease our stress. Eating in allowed us to accommodate slow, fast and feisty eaters alike. With nearly 3,000 skiable acres encompassing six peaks, and a gaggle of hyped-up kids ranging in age from 3 to 15, we opted to split up by ability. That put me with those destined for the confidence-building, meandering green runs \u2014 namely, my younger son and my daughter. Caleb, 9, easily coasted down his first hill and gathered speed. Soon, his helmet disappeared down below. \u201cCaleb!\u201d I hollered. A panic set in. Which way would he turn when the run split? Would he try to get on a chairlift? Would frostbite set in before we could find him, dwarfed by this humbling terrain, on one of the resort\u2019s 165 trails? Meanwhile, Anna, 7, had taken a tumble up above. \u201cI\u2019m terrible!\u201d she cried out, and my heart broke. When my sons first fell, they simply externalized it: \u201cMy skis are broken!\u201d I unbuckled my skis. \u201cYou are amazing,\u201d I said, when her eyes met mine, as I hiked up the hill to reach her. I wanted to instill in her that same determination to conquer the Rockies my sons had, and to become her rock, as my mother was for me. \u201cYou just need practice.\u201d Anna and I found Caleb waiting at the base of the slope. The next day, still unnerved, Matt and I splurged on a five-hour family ski lesson through Steamboat\u2019s SnowSports School to get us all up and running. This way, we could keep differing abilities together. We soon settled into a rhythm, thanks to the support and scaffolding a multigenerational family creates: The early risers took the first chairlift up, and those who slept in texted for a meetup place when they woke. It didn\u2019t matter whose kid you had, as long as everybody was accounted for. My husband and his brother dodged Steamboat\u2019s signature aspens with Max and Caleb, our daredevil boys, while my daughter, emboldened by her ski lesson, used giant-slalom turns to conquer Heavenly Daze \u2014 a spacious, albeit icy, blue run \u2014 with her cousin and my sister-in-law. Over lunch, we warmed up numbing fingers and toes in the crowded Thunderhead Food Court, where the eight-person gondola had let us off. To save money, we old-schooled it with bagged peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches and carrots we had left in backpacks slung from tree limbs. Occasionally, we splurged on a basket of fries or a chocolate chip cookie. While we skied, we let easy meals such as tacos, spaghetti and chili simmer aromatically in the slow cookers we had brought with us. Upon our return, our kids went to the lobby, where they sipped hot, marshmallow-piled cocoa, nibbled on candy and built gingerbread houses through the Steamboat Grand\u2019s family program while they waited for the table to be set. After dinner, we slipped into bathing suits and soaked with many others in one of the hot tubs, a salve for our sore muscles. The steam obscured our views. Mindful of our different parenting styles, we did our best to ignore kids who bickered; it was their job to work it out, and for the most part they did. There were simply too many relationships for us to try to manage. We took breaks from the extended family when we needed it, which made our time together more enjoyable. Before bed, we came together to play kid-friendly games such as \u201cBean Boozled\u201d \u2014 you spin a wheel and eat a jelly bean matching the color it lands on, but you don\u2019t know whether its flavor will be classic or gross. My son lost when what he thought was caramel corn turned out to be moldy cheese. On another night, we left the older kids in charge of the younger ones and wandered down to the Cabin Restaurant to dine on New American cuisine. Without the space that children often put between us, and with time to slow down and invest in each other, we got in a few years\u2019 worth of spontaneous, authentic conversation. The first bottle of wine peeled away the stresses of daily life. Our lives were a shared landscape. There was something familiar about the shoes each of us wore, the paths each of us walked. We were willing to expose our vulnerabilities, understanding that there, in that moment, we were getting something right. We could feel it in the connection, the synchronization of thoughts and, at last, the laughter. 18788444 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steamboat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caleb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bozeman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mount werner circle", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "the washington post", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "snowsports school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thunderhead food court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "safeway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "steamboat springs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steamboat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyoming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fargo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steamboat grand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yampa river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north dakota", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:33.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70a20e2674495bd55c019c141334d37ff6e54f1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKzFTrmfORb62ANpw_Zmec2PlwdKpVS4_SNT9BCbTJdWhesRyfTJQkhJHPokFOvks_89VN.h0X_43JmtWjkUZ4Vs", "site_full": "pokemon101.withbestprice.com", "site": "withbestprice.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["books_and_literature", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Pokemon Project Studio Blue - Pokemon 4 All", "title_full": "Pokemon Project Studio Blue - Pokemon 4 All", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.114, "main_image": "https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61M7WV419RL.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "70a20e2674495bd55c019c141334d37ff6e54f1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKzFTrmfORb62ANpw_Zmec2PlwdKpVS4_SNT9BCbTJdWhesRyfTJQkhJHPokFOvks_89VN.h0X_43JmtWjkUZ4Vs", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "Pokemon Project Studio Blue - Pokemon 4 All", "text": "\nbuy now \u00a317.97Pok\u00e9mon is here to stay, bombarding us with cute characters and addictive card games.

This article looks at Fellowes Shredder repair NJ . It is something that every office owner should know how to carry out because the device can stop working at any time and you need to have it functional again. Some high profile offices have documents that should never see the light, and this is one of the machines that will ensure that happens.\n\nThe first thing that you are supposed to do is to empty it everything and find a way you can clear all the paper jams. It is a process that has to be worked out slowly if you need it to be effective. At times, if there are particles that are not coming out then you will have to remove them with tweezers. Sometimes you need to do more checking because what is typically required is for you to do some oiling.\n\nAn import part of this machine is the head that always must be in the correct position for functionality to be enhanced. When you proceed and make some adjustments that take it out of place, then you are likely to cause it not to work well. Let the machine lie there without doing anything, and when you resume the job, it will be back to normal.\n\nOiling is mandatory to have the arts moving efficiently without a lot of friction being experienced. Get some information on the type that you need to purchase first before you proceed because not all you find in the shop are for the same purpose. Make the application using the recommended procedure, and you will be in the right place.\n\nIf you have not found the information which you require then maybe this is time you seek recommendations from your neighbors and friends. Most people have these items, and it is right to assume that they have been through a similar situation. Listen to what they have to tell you and see if it is something that can help you.\n\nIf you are still not content with every detail that you have, try and get to the internet. A lot of material that has been placed here. When you are at it, be careful so that you do not follow data that is wrong because it can misguide you to a great extent.\n\nThe hiring of professionals can still be an option for you. You have to take them through some vetting to ascertain that they are the rightful people. Not everyone that calls themselves a professional can prove they are indeed what they say. Your actions are necessitated by the need not to see someone destroy your devices.\n\nThese are some of the strategies which you can use to work in this tool. Caution and sheer precision are necessary because it does not make sense to destroy it more when you thought that you were indeed going some changes. If you follow everything carefully, then you are bound to have it working well all the time.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are searching for information about Fellowes shredder repair NJ residents can visit our web pages online today.

Using high-resolution manometry (HRM), this study aims to identify positional adaptations of pharyngeal physiology by evaluating swallowing pressure patterns in a series of inverted body positions. Ten healthy adults each underwent swallowing tasks with pharyngeal HRM at six body positions using an inversion table (0\u00b0[upright], 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0[supine], 110\u00b0, 135\u00b0, and 180\u00b0[fully inverted]). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess impact of position on pressure parameters, and pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients translate. Velopharyngeal pressures varied by position ( P < 0.001), with significantly higher pressures generated with inversion \u226590\u00b0, compared with upright and 45\u00b0. Change in position did not significantly affect common mesopharyngeal pressures or swallowing pressure durations. UES valving mechanisms were preserved during inversion, with subtle variations observed in integral pressures ( P = 0.011). Pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients changed with position ( P < 0.01), increasing with inversion > 90\u00b0 compared to upright and 45\u00b0. Mechanisms of deglutition may differ with position and relative direction of gravity, particularly when at > 45\u00b0 inclination. Increased palatal pressure is generated in the upside-down position to achieve nasopharyngeal closure and prevent regurgitation. While other classically measured pressures may not consistently differ with positioning, many individuals exhibit adaptations in pressure gradients when inverted, likely due to a combination of changes in pharyngeal driving force and UES opening mechanisms.

What distinguishes this particular case of adolescent angst is that it\u2019s the true story of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer based on the comic-book memoir by Derf Backderf, who went to high school with Dahmer in rural Ohio in the late 1970s. This portrait of the serial killer as a young man telegraphs Dahmer\u2019s future all too clearly. 107 minutes. (R) \u2014 Pat Padua, The Washington Post \u201cThelma\u201d () The title character, a college student in Norway, begins to experience strange physical seizures when she\u2019s confronted with desires considered taboo by her overprotective Christian parents. \u201cThelma\u201d is gorgeous to look at and feels like a stylish, timely allegory for the present moment. 116 minutes. (No MPAA rating) \u2014 Ann Hornaday, The Washington Post STILL SHOWING \u201cAmerican Made\u201d () Tom Cruise gives one of his most energized and charming performances in years as a real-life CIA operative who laundered millions in ill-gotten cash and flew guns and cocaine. 115 minutes. (R) \u2014 Richard Roeper, The Chicago Sun-Times \u201cA Bad Moms Christmas\u201d () The inspirationally lax trio of mothers (Mila Kunis, Kathryn Hahn and Kristen Bell) is back for another, more seasonally focused round. To add an extra layer of pressure to the holidays this year, their mothers are visiting for the holidays. The sequel never quite captures the disarming hilarity of the original. 104 minutes. (R) \u2014 Stephanie Merry, The Washington Post \u201cCoco\u201d () A bouncy and heart-tugging adventure told through the experiences of a 12-year-old boy (Anthony Gonzalez) who crosses over, while alive, from his village in Mexico to the Land of the Dead, an exciting metropolis populated by deceased humans. The visuals jump off the screen. This film also screens in 3-D and IMAX. 104 minutes. (PG) \u2014 Richard Roeper, The Chicago Sun-Times \u201cDaddy\u2019s Home 2\u201d () In this sour, cynical and profoundly unfunny sequel, touchy-feely Brad (Will Ferrell) and gruff Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) celebrate the holidays with their dads (John Lithgow and Mel Gibson), each an exaggerated version of his son. Much of the humor is of questionable taste at best, and hardly anybody talks or behaves in ways most of us can empathize with. 95 minutes. (PG-13) \u2014 Richard Roeper, The Chicago Sun-Times \u201cThe Foreigner\u201d () This action film offers the same kind of absurd satisfaction as \u201cTaken,\u201d with Jackie Chan as a sweet, older fellow that no one takes seriously, who becomes a killing machine. It makes use of his martial-arts expertise as well as the fact that he\u2019s now in his early 60s. The movie also allows Chan to demonstrate that he can act. Unlike \u201cTaken,\u201d \u201cThe Foreigner\u2019\u2019 has an intricate and well-developed plot. 114 minutes. (R) \u2014 Mick LaSalle, The San Francisco Chronicle \u201cJane\u201d () This documentary that looks at the life and work of Jane Goodall was made using more than 140 hours of never-before-seen 16 mm footage blended with Goodall\u2019s own words and set against a majestic score by Philip Glass. Director Brett Morgen went to Tanzania where he spent two days filming an interview with Goodall who at 83 recalls her work in crystal clear detail. The moviegoer gets to watch her go from a newborn researcher who grows through each blade of knowledge observed along the way. 90 minutes. (No MPAA rating) \u2014 Rick Bentley, Tribune News Service \u201cJustice League\u201d () When an intergalactic world crusher known as Steppenwolf (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) launches an invasion of Earth, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) decides he needs a team to stop it. The latest DC Comics film adaptation has enough entertaining moments to balance how the film still suffers from a disjointed plot and some painfully bad casting. This film also screens in IMAX. 119 minutes. (PG-13) \u2014 Rick Bentley, Tribune News Service \u201cKingsman: The Golden Circle\u201d () An intrepid drug lord (Julianne Moore) decides to hold the world hostage and only the private security force of the Kingsmen, with an assist from the Kentucky-based Statesmen, can bring her evil plot down. This whole affair is just a truly cynical pastiche of meaningless pop nostalgia wrapped around a nonsensical plot, sprinkled with a dusting of repulsive sexism. 141 minutes. (R) \u2014 Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service \u201cLady Bird\u201d () Greta Gerwig already has made a fine career for herself as an actress, but with \u201cLady Bird\u201d she has written and directed a film that\u2019s smart without being smug and insightful without being condescending. Saoirse Ronan delivers a pure and honest performance as the title character, a high school senior, and the work by Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts as her parents is what greatness looks like. Rating: Four stars. 93 minutes. (R) \u2014 Richard Roeper, The Chicago Sun-Times \u201cThe Lego Ninjago Movie\u201d () The young hero, Lloyd (Dave Franco), is leading a secret double life as both the son of evil villain Garmadon (Justin Theroux) and the Green Ninja that saves the city from Garmadon\u2019s destruction. It\u2019s a light, serviceable romp around the Legos, but doesn\u2019t come close to the high-key antics of the first two films in the series. 101 minutes. (PG) \u2014 Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service \u201cLoving Vincent\u201d () To tell this story about a mystery surrounding the 1890 death of artist Vincent Van Gogh, the filmmakers assembled a cast, found period-appropriate costumes and sets, and shot the film. Then every frame was hand-painted over in oil paint in the style of Van Gogh, by a team of more than 100 artists. The result is a curious and often exquisite blend of two art forms. 94 minutes. (PG-13) \u2014 Moira Macdonald, The Seattle Times \u201cThe Man Who Invented Christmas\u201d () As Charles Dickens (Dan Stevens) writes \u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d the characters come to life \u2014 and in the case of Scrooge (Christopher Plummer, sensational), mocking him and challenging him. This unabashedly sentimental story is a lovely antidote to crassly commercial lumps of coal like \u201cDaddy\u2019s Home 2.\u201d 104 minutes. (PG) \u2014 Richard Roeper, The Chicago Sun-Times \u201cMurder on the Orient Express\u201d () Sir Kenneth Branagh slips into fastidious Belgian detective Hercule Poirot\u2019s signature splendid mustache in a star-studded, big-budget remake, which he has also directed. The murder mystery set aboard a train from Istanbul to Calais is the kind of old-fashioned romp we don\u2019t often see anymore, executed with a thoroughly modern sense of verve and rhythm. But as the mystery deepens, reveals itself and grows darker, it becomes sad, delving into the aftermath of trauma and how it reveals itself. 114 minutes. (PG-13) \u2014 Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service \u201cRoman J. Israel, Esq.\u201d () After a long career of working behind the scenes for L.A.\u2019s downtrodden, a socially inept legal savant (Denzel Washington) goes to work at a law firm run by a slick shark (Colin Farrell) who represents everything he despises. The strong performances are ultimately lost in the fog of a strange and confusing and bumpy and sometimes implausible story line. 129 minutes. (PG-13) \u2014 Richard Roeper, The Chicago Sun-Times \u201cThe Square\u201d () This Swedish satire of the kind of impotent, progressive relativism that has infected modern art and thought, won the Palme D\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It\u2019s long, always interesting and pointed in its observations, even if all the film\u2019s elements aren\u2019t quite integrated. If \u201cThe Square\u201d has a point it\u2019s that the visceral aspect of life cannot be fully suppressed and shouldn\u2019t be denied. 145 minutes. (R) \u2014 Mick LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle \u201cThe Star\u201d () This animated fable about the first Christmas reimagines the Nativity story from the perspective of an entire menagerie of comical Holy Land critters, led by a miniature donkey. It isn\u2019t great by any means, but has enough good qualities that viewers looking for faith-based family fare as Christmas nears will probably say, \u201cAmen.\u201d 86 minutes. (PG) \u2014 Jane Horwitz, The Washington Post \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d () This is the funniest film in the Thor franchise with a stunning new villain in Hela (Cate Blanchett) and enough big action scenes to fill a half dozen movies. An ancient prophecy looks to be coming true when Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki\u2019s (Tom Hiddleston) sister, Hela, arrives and drives the brothers out of Asgard. . This film also screens in 3-D. 135 minutes. (PG-13) \u2014 Rick Bentley, Tribune News Service \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d () The story of a grieving mother (Frances McDormand) trying to shame the police chief (Woody Harrelson) into solving her daughter\u2019s murder provides some of the strongest laughs and most poignant moments of heartbreak of any movie in recent memory. Somehow writer-director Martin McDonagh has taken the bleakest of subject matters and treated it seriously while also serving up one of the best dark comedies I\u2019ve ever seen. 115 minutes. (R) \u2014 Richard Roeper, The Chicago Sun-Times \u201cWonder\u201d () The story of Auggie (Jacob Tremblay), a young boy with a genetic facial deformity attending school for the first time was adapted from R.J. Palacio\u2019s book. It isn\u2019t just Auggie\u2019s story and experience, it\u2019s the story of so many people around him. The messages of \u201cWonder\u201d are ones we should all take to heart: to choose kindness and to define ourselves through our deeds. 113 minutes.

It\u2019s the most specific finding to date about physical damage, showing that whatever it was that harmed the Americans, it led to perceptible changes in their brains. The finding is also one of several factors fueling growing skepticism that some kind of sonic weapon was involved. Medical testing has revealed the embassy workers developed changes to the white matter tracts that let different parts of the brain communicate, several U.S. officials said, describing a growing consensus held by university and government physicians researching the attacks. White matter acts like information highways between brain cells. Loud, mysterious sounds followed by hearing loss and ear-ringing had led investigators to suspect \u201csonic attacks.\u201d But officials are now carefully avoiding that term. The sounds may have been the byproduct of something else that caused damage, said three U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. They weren\u2019t authorized to discuss it publicly and demanded anonymity. Physicians, FBI investigators and U.S. intelligence agencies have spent months trying to piece together the puzzle in Havana , where the U.S. says 24 U.S. government officials and spouses fell ill starting last year in homes and later in some hotels. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Wednesday he\u2019s \u201cconvinced these were targeted attacks,\u201d but the U.S. doesn\u2019t know who\u2019s behind them. A few Canadian Embassy staffers also got sick. Doctors still don\u2019t know how victims ended up with the white matter changes, nor how exactly those changes might relate to their symptoms. U.S. officials wouldn\u2019t say whether the changes were found in all 24 patients. But acoustic waves have never been shown to alter the brain\u2019s white matter tracts, said Elisa Konofagou, a biomedical engineering professor at Columbia University who is not involved in the government\u2019s investigation. \u201cI would be very surprised,\u201d Konofagou said, adding that ultrasound in the brain is used frequently in modern medicine. \u201cWe never see white matter tract problems.\u201d Cuba has adamantly denied involvement, and calls the Trump administration\u2019s claims that U.S. workers were attacked \u201cdeliberate lies.\u201d The new medical details may help the U.S. counter Havana\u2019s complaint that Washington hasn\u2019t presented any evidence. Tillerson said the U.S. had shared some information with Havana, but wouldn\u2019t disclose details that would violate privacy or help a perpetrator learn how effective the attacks were. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve said to the Cubans is: Small island. You\u2019ve got a sophisticated intelligence apparatus. You probably know who\u2019s doing it. You can stop it,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d The case has plunged the U.S. medical community into uncharted territory. Physicians are treating the symptoms like a new, never-seen-before illness. After extensive testing and trial therapies, they\u2019re developing the first protocols to screen cases and identify the best treatments \u2014 even as the FBI investigation struggles to identify a culprit, method and motive. Doctors treating the victims wouldn\u2019t speak to the AP, yet their findings are expected to be discussed in an article being submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Association, U.S. officials said. Physicians at the University of Miami and the University of Pennsylvania who have treated the Cuba victims are writing it, with input from the State Department\u2019s medical unit and other government doctors. 18946831 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh lederman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elisa konofagou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "konofagou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "columbia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canadian embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cuba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "havana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:35.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51f324b17abe70b76e6820485f63628b6e30d032", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950Kd2SI3sDyOm1", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender - 4chan", "title": "/ftmg/ - female to male general", "title_full": "/lgbt/ - /ftmg/ - female to male general - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-02T16:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 248, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.073, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a45ef633d9605375aaffa8bb04b395fdbfebc9ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950KRaW7KJgGW5SUNPTpqDP3Y8-", "ord_in_thread": 186, "author": "Elliot roger-sama", "published": "2017-12-06T00:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9242194\nThanks mate\n>>9243047\nYeah thats a bunch of empty t viles in a pill bottle.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:35.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51f324b17abe70b76e6820485f63628b6e30d032", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950Kd2SI3sDyOm1", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender - 4chan", "title": "/ftmg/ - female to male general", "title_full": "/lgbt/ - /ftmg/ - female to male general - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-02T16:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 248, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.073, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3c5f0c0f2f4317f97ccbc97ee70f2becb312c886", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950KRaW7KJgGW5SH68sq.BHPQ8-", "ord_in_thread": 176, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-05T18:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I started testosterone and love the effects...\nexcept for the fact that my libido completely dropped off.

It reinforced its refusal to join a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. \nHowever, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear that he doesn't want a new election, and Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz reversed course. \nAt a previously scheduled party congress Thursday, Schulz is seeking members' approval for a resolution approving talks on \"whether and in what form\" the Social Democrats can support a new government.

But making that goal a reality relies on something they\u2019ve not really invested in \u2014 well-trained employees with the kinds of wages and regular hours that make them want to stick around. This illustrates traditional retailers\u2019 dilemma. In the face of existential threats such as e-commerce and declining mall traffic, more generous pay might improve service. But it comes at the risk of spooking skeptical investors, who are already closely monitoring costs and margins. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a delicate tightrope, where retailers that are watching their profit squeezed need to figure out where to cut,\u201d said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Instinet LLC. \u201cLooking at the people who drive that business as an asset instead of a liability is difficult.\u201d As they boost payrolls during the crucial holiday shopping season, chains are mostly sticking to low-wage and part-time positions. With unemployment at an almost 17-year low and a broader shortage of workers, it\u2019s a tough time to change the long-established model. While some major players, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp., have announced plans to increase pay, low wages persist. Workers say they can\u2019t get the flexible hours they want, and hiring part-timers remains a common way out to avoid spending more on benefits and perks. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a tighter job market, but the wage power is all with the employer,\u201d said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James Financial Inc. in St. Petersburg, Florida. Chains don\u2019t see the need to increase compensation or add full-time positions, he said. \u201cRetail is usually seen as being low on the food chain, so you\u2019re not going to see much pressure, even during the holidays.\u201d S. Mahmud, who works two part-time retail jobs in New York, sees the industry as a temporary stop before moving on to something better. She had hoped to earn extra cash this holiday season, but so far has been unable to do so. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to give you full-time,\u201d said Mahmud, who asked that her first name not be used. \u201cAlthough they need people, they\u2019re distributing the hours.\u201d Neither of her two employers is willing to move her up to a full-time position with regular benefits. Her wages have barely changed. The only concession she\u2019s been able to secure is more predictable hours. She\u2019s in a management-training program after having completed her four-year degree and doesn\u2019t expect to always work in retail. \u201cRetailers say they\u2019re trying to staff up, but the easiest thing to do would be to offer their part-time workers full-time jobs,\u201d said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. Forty-seven percent of frontline employees \u2014 such as sales associates and cashiers \u2014 work part-time, according to a survey from the Fair Workweek Initiative. Part-time workers reported an hourly wage of 32 cents less than their full-time colleagues, with hours fluctuating from 16 to 29 per week. One in three workers said they hadn\u2019t received a raise in the last two years. That may need to change, and soon, if retailers mean what they say about creating memorable experiences to win over shoppers. This often requires a bigger workforce, such as an initiative by Macy\u2019s that deploys 250 stylists to help shoppers create outfits. Nordstrom, meanwhile, has opened a store with no inventory: Customers work with fashion experts to build a wardrobe that is then shipped to their homes. Some of the largest retailers, such as Target and Wal-Mart Stores, are also bumping pay higher to improve customer service and public perception. Others, such as the Container Store, are already known for comparatively higher wages, while Home Depot shares profit with workers. But these aren\u2019t indicative of a broader trend for the industry. Average hourly earnings in retail are now lagging behind overall worker pay by a record amount, according to Labor Department data. Even though some companies are boosting pay, the median U.S. retail sales employee salary was only $22,900 in 2016, according to the figures. The industry also faces an unstable workforce: Retailers\u2019 September turnover rate was 4.2 percent, indicating they lose about 50 percent of their sales staff over a full year. Lauren Johns, 31, a visual merchandiser who creates window displays and arranges outfits at the H&M in New York\u2019s Times Square, is one of the few who have been able to turn retail employment into a steady gig. She\u2019s worked in the field since she was 21. Now a member of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, she has been with H&M for four years and makes $22 an hour with regular, full-time hours. The ease with which retailers can bring in part-time workers is part of what keeps staff from being able to ask for more, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a way for retailers to hold you hostage in a sense because everybody needs a job,\u201d Johns said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to do it, there\u2019s the door because someone else will. That\u2019s the mentality in retail in general, if not at H&M specifically.\u201d At H&M, Johns says she\u2019s never seen an external applicant get the \u201chandful\u201d of full-time positions that open before someone already working there: \u201cThere\u2019s so many people who want them.\u201d This dynamic drives the \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d approach to worker pay, Raymond James\u2019s Brown said. The flip side is that workers have come to expect so little from these jobs. \u201cWhen you have employers who don\u2019t invest in their workforce, either through training or providing sustainable hours, you are not going to have a workforce that\u2019s really invested in the work that they do, and they\u2019re not going to have the skills to do their job well,\u201d said Nina Terhune, of the Center for Frontline Retail, a nonprofit. 18946213 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lindsey rupp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shobhana chandra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuart appelbaum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauren johns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s. mahmud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simeon siegel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nina terhune", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "home depot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "target corp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond james financial inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department store union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal-mart stores", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nordstrom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "h&m", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for frontline retail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "container store", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal-mart stores inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labor department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instinet llc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. petersburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:35.042+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51f324b17abe70b76e6820485f63628b6e30d032", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950Kd2SI3sDyOm1", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender - 4chan", "title": "/ftmg/ - female to male general", "title_full": "/lgbt/ - /ftmg/ - female to male general - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-02T16:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 248, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.073, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51ca92a76d74e114d45aa3cc6f97b3c4517537f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950KRaW7KJgGW5SALDZ17Fuds0-", "ord_in_thread": 182, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-05T20:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9242423\nI don\u2019t know a lot of gay guys.

The new search feature enables users to search for specific terms and advanced topics.\nThe ability to 'drill-down' into the data has been added to the Workware Performance Review report, providing interactive charts and graphs on team and individual performance and allowing users to explore the detail behind the summary data.\nAbout ActiveOps\nActiveOps - Manage Differently\u200b\nSince 2005, ActiveOps has been committed to helping organisations improve their operational efficiency by helping managers and teams deliver their best possible performance.

The House and Senate passed separate tax cut packages in recent weeks, and both bills would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. But GOP negotiators are openly discussing the possibility of moving that rate up to 22 percent to free up more revenue, people familiar with the discussions said. One of those people said the 22 percent rate is \u201cseriously under discussion.\u201d The two people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss sensitive negotiations. No decisions have been made. The White House has been resistant to making this change, but President Donald Trump said casually on Saturday morning that the 22 percent corporate rate might be necessary. Each percentage point that is added back to the corporate rate would free up about $100 billion in revenue over 10 years. Still, White House officials have tried to stress to Congress in the past two days that their strong preference is to keep the corporate rate at 20 percent. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he, too, was resistant to raising the rate. \u201cNot as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still 20.\u201d The House and Senate must pass matching tax bills before Trump can sign the package into law. But there are a number of changes Republicans want that would make the legislation more costly, and the package cannot add more than $1.5 trillion to the debt over 10 years. One of the changes they are considering would repeal, or at least severely scale back, an alternative-minimum tax for corporations that tries to limit the deductions and credits companies can take. Another major change receiving growing attention would allow Americans to deduct up to $10,000 of state income tax or local property tax from their federal income tax. The House and Senate bills would only allow Americans to deduct the property tax component, but lawmakers are looking to give people more flexibility. Another leading Finance Committee member, Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., cited both of those issues in acknowledging that Republicans are looking for new revenue sources to address lingering problems. \u201cSo we all understand there are some things that are going to have to change. So we\u2019re going to have to figure out how to do that,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not predicting that we\u2019re going to go to a 22 percent corporate rate.\u201d The White House and Republican leaders have heard numerous complaints from wealthy GOP donors in California and New York who believe their taxes could go up under the new regime because of limitations on deductions. They are trying to make changes to address those concern before the package is completed. Trump referenced these complaints Wednesday when he said that the final GOP tax bill should take care of the \u201ctiny little sliver\u201d of people who don\u2019t benefit under the legislation as written. The president\u2019s comments came as House and Senate Republicans worked to iron out differences between the tax bills passed by each chamber, with the goal of sending compromise legislation to Trump before Christmas. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., endorsed one change under consideration, which would allow a $10,000 property-tax deduction in the bill to apply to state income taxes as well. \u201cThat sounds like a kind of reasonable idea,\u201d McConnell told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday. There is believed to be more than a \u201ctiny little sliver\u201d of Americans who will miss out on benefits from the GOP legislation, according to nonpartisan analyses that show the bills skew toward corporations and the wealthy despite their billing as a middle-class tax cut. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a fantastic tax bill. There are very, very few people that aren\u2019t benefiting by it, but there\u2019s that tiny little sliver,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to try to take care of even that very small group of people that just through circumstances maybe don\u2019t get the full benefit of what we\u2019re doing. But the middle class gets a tremendous benefit, and business, which is jobs, gets a tremendous benefit.\u201d According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, slightly more than 24 percent of taxpayers would see a tax increase by 2027 under the version of the bill passed by the House. Under the Senate-passed bill, 48 percent of taxpayers would pay more by then, largely because of tax breaks that are set to expire in five years. Republicans insist those tax breaks would actually be extended by a future Congress. 18950988 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hugh hewitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "damian paletta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick toomey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toomey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orrin hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erica werner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gop", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tax policy center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate finance committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finance committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-pa.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-ky.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:36.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77db9d92f64e6a94fbe1bb76521d66c3ce463e1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oudzGU6BTRmb3YPrPkb4.wKQgaUs2p6BGguXm7eLnXV4eIV1U9Pglb9mNH0VqcnytewHZKNRx0lm1d98trjc2JF22opZpP34R0vxu55ybtr3kQuCyNMF0LmAwIwtFblGJvEbgTXKxpZLS3GubSAJ1kmpXtCgnHhWvYFs7TEzUwQ8eN2IVtyWJozpruK2Cc3hV3Xz6I4QGRnwL15dajcnu.dBqA7Pf.rXFFy85zEIF3SkNkETqYg3uL8YhzkLBWJG95dglogAPW1fFI7txVk4yd.b1rL.WDzdIuu9GfDn6HyCnOji.LgC2mtT2HVIZ.AfiEdxYLlTQF7KvGbDA6THZJ6t0CPX9SSz.qFb2b3WkDMxP79IScbw96tGeZUVgt1lm2fsnFTrH1uHxpEU3PVDIP0-", "site_full": "www.amazon.ca", "site": "amazon.ca", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.ca/b/ref=sd_allcat_audca_bks?ie=UTF8&node=16256501011", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.ca: Audible Audiobooks: Books: Literature &amp;

The House approved the bill, 231-198, largely along party lines. Six Democrats voted yes, while 14 Republicans voted no. The measure would allow gun owners with a state-issued concealed-carry permit to carry a handgun in any state that allows concealed weapons. It now goes to the Senate. Travel ban \u2014 Three federal appeals court judges who blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s second travel ban earlier this year had some skeptical questions about his third and latest set of restrictions on travelers from six mostly Muslim nations during oral arguments Wednesday. Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judges Ronald Gould, Richard Paez and Michael Hawkins heard arguments in Seattle on Hawaii\u2019s challenge to the ban. The hearing came just two days after the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it was allowing the restrictions to go into effect at least until the 9th Circuit panel and their colleagues on the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th Circuit had a chance to rule on separate lawsuits against the ban. Contraceptives and breast cancer \u2014 Women who rely on birth control pills or contraceptive devices that release hormones face a small but significant increase in the risk for breast cancer, according to a large study published Wednesday. The study upends widely held assumptions by women, who have believed that newer hormonal contraceptives are much safer than those taken by their mothers or grandmothers, which had higher doses of estrogen. The researchers, who followed 1.8 million Danish women for more than a decade, estimated that for every 100,000 women, hormone contraceptive use causes an additional 13 breast cancer cases a year. Flynn and Russia \u2014 Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, told a former business associate that economic sanctions against Russia would be \u201cripped up\u201d as one of the administration\u2019s first acts, according to an account by a whistleblower made public Wednesday. Flynn believed that ending the sanctions could allow a business project he had once participated in to move forward, according to the whistleblower. The account not only is the strongest evidence to date that the Trump administration wanted to end the sanctions immediately but also suggests that Flynn had a possible economic incentive for forging a closer relationship with Russia. Gay marriage in Australia \u2014 Gay rights advocates celebrated outside Australia\u2019s Parliament House on Thursday in anticipation of same-sex marriage being legalized within hours. Scores of men and women joined in singing ahead of what was scheduled to be Parliament\u2019s final sitting day of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s an historic day for Australia today and I think the celebrations around the country when we finally \u2026 achieve marriage equality are going to be immense,\u201d Janet Rice said. Rice is a minor Greens party senator who was only able to remain married to her transgender wife of 31 years, Penny, because Penny remained listed as male on her birth certificate. Atlanta mayor \u2014 For the second time in eight years, the leadership of Atlanta is likely to be settled after a recount. Fewer than 800 votes separated Atlanta\u2019s two candidates for mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms and Mary Norwood, after officials tallied more than 92,000 ballots that were cast in a runoff election Tuesday. The margin was narrow enough that Norwood, seeking to become Atlanta\u2019s first white mayor in more than 40 years, said she would ask for a recount once provisional and absentee ballots were counted this week. Even so, Bottoms and her allies declared victory Wednesday.

Staffed with 800 people and costing $180,000 a day, the ship received an average of 36 people a day as outpatients or inpatients \u2014 and that number swelled only after a public furor erupted over the ship\u2019s empty beds.

A wise client takes time to talk to the individuals, who have been working with this specific expert so as to have an idea of what you should expect. Also, it would be wise to go to the website and see what other client comments about the work done so far. If the views are pleasing, then you can go ahead and work with him or her.\n\nOne should identify an experienced lawyer from that who is not experienced by checking in the documents of merits. One should be keen to inquire about the cases handled and get to know if you can be allowed to contact other customers or not. If there is no problem with talking to others who have received the same services, you can be sure that the lawyer will handle your case in a right way.\n\nAn individual, who does not rush to dialogue before you talk, is the best to deal hire. Many specialists fail to listen to their client problem keenly pretending to know much, which leads to frustration. One should take time to get an expert, who knows the sense of having excellent communication skills. It would be wise to be a good listener, who responds to things in the right way.\n\nThe lawyer you want to hire should be friendly and focused on helping you achieve your goals. One should avoid any expert, who is not ready to answer your calls when you want to reach him or her. It is usually tricky to have all the time you need with your lawyer, and hence one should find an understanding attorney. Make sure that you believe in him or her so as to gain confidence to represent you.\n\nThere is nothing good like making sure you are dealing with an honest expert, who is ready to face reality and give you the best in future. Counselors, who are not upright to their clients lead to frustration. It is good to be confronted with the truth that will help you sort out things in the right way despite the situation. Honesty is a virtue that many lawyers lack.\n\nExperts, who work day and night to meet the demands of the customers, are the best to deal with in the field of law. The individuals can take time to do research on the case at hand and come up with a solution that is valid. Lazy lawyers should be avoided at all cost.\n\nTo get a good lawyer is a hard task that many people take for granted. A lot of time is spent to make sure the choices that would be made will be worth the salt and stand on your behalf in the right way. Note that, inexperienced individuals will lead to your failure since the possibility of winning the case will be low.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are searching for information about Florida foreclosure attorneys , come to our web pages today.
