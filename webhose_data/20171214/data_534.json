The PSAR, Developed by Welles Wilder, is designed to determine the point in time when there emerges a better than average probability of a trend switching directions. This is a common tool used by traders and investors to try to gauge potential reversal of a trend. \nThe parabolic SAR is shown on the charts as a series of small \u2018dots\u2019 that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. The basic use of the Parabolic SAR is to buy when the dots move below the price bars (signaling an uptrend) and sell/short-sell when the dots move above the price bars (signaling a downtrend). \nInvestors may be trying to get an edge by following current technical levels for Statoil ASA (STO). In terms of Moving Averages, the 50-day is 20.16, the 200-day is at 18.04, and the 7-day is 20.21. Using a longer term moving average such as the 200-day may help block out the noise and chaos that is sometimes created by daily price fluctuations. In some cases, MA\u2019s may be used as strong reference points for finding support and resistance levels. Employing the use of the moving average for technical equity analysis is still highly popular among traders and investors. The moving average can be used as a reference point to assist with the discovery of buying and selling opportunities. \nStatoil ASA (STO)\u2019s   14 day Williams %R currently sits at -68.29. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would point to an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would signal an oversold situation. The Williams %R was developed by Larry Williams. This is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. \nStatoil ASA (STO) currently   -53.92. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \nCurrently, the 14-day ADX for Statoil ASA (STO) is sitting at 11.91. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would identify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would lead to an extremely strong trend. ADX is used to gauge trend strength but not trend direction. Traders often add the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to identify the direction of a trend. \nThe RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a widely used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued.

Poulnabrone is worth a minimum of 30-45 minutes and a stop at the Cliffs will likely require 2 hours. That puts you at 5 hours -- after just those two stops.

It also matters how important the Burren and Loop Head are to your plans -- AND What the rest of your plans involve. Does Galway enter into the mix? What about Dingle and Killarney? How much time (days on the ground) do you have to work with?\nI tend to 'lecture' a bit and try to be rather specific, because I truly wish to convince -- rather than just 'Poo Poo' a plan. First Timer's to Ireland rarely understand just how different Ireland is. Although only roughly the size of a moderate State in the USA, distances can be VERY deceiving. It's filled from edge to edge with photographic splendor, ancient ruins and compelling vistas. Yes, the roads are narrow and winding. Yes, there can be obstacles like tractors, cows and sheep on the roads, as well. These CAN contribute to slower drive times. The truth is, though, that there is SO MUCH to see that you wouldn't want to drive all that fast -- even IF you could!\nLet's assume a Noon departure from the Airport. Driving directly to the Cliffs (63.2 Km and 1 hour +/- of Drive Time -- According to Google). I would counter that IF you make it in 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 hours, then you will have done VERY well. Now, in all likelihood, it is between 1 and 1:30 PM. Add 2 hours to visit the site (and you could easily spend longer) and that makes it between 3 and 3:30 PM.\nNow, drive to Kilkee (another 52.8 Km and 1 hour -- Google, again. I say another 1 1/4 - 1 1/2) and it's between 4:30 and 5 PM.\nIn May, you'll have daylight for another 2 hours or so -- BUT Your body will still be on Minnesota time -a six-hour discrepancy, I believe) -- so, it will 'Feel' like 11 AM on the day after your departure -- with only whatever sleep you managed to secure on the over-night flight -- which is seldom restful.\nWorst-case scenario is I am totally wrong, and you arrive in Kilkee full of vim and vigor, around 4 PM. Then, you are WELL positioned to 'scoot down' to Loop Head. The alternative is to find yourself somewhere near the Cliffs on the narrow, coastal R478 -- still over an hour plus from your B&B -- struggling to stay awake.\nI've made the trip from Florida to Ireland over twenty times and I am usually able to 'hang tough' until about 2 PM. After a two hour nap, I'm then usually good until 10 or 11 PM -- which then puts me firmly on 'Irish Time'.\nI realize that everyone handles jet lag differently -- but I would strongly urge you to err on the side of safety.\n2 destinations mentioned in this post 1 Minnesota United States 2 Florida United States See all 2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:00.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c4ce399bc1449147992ab4deefea629d684cdfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvAVxs6a_QJ.WAycJU4hEGUQ71v3tKflo1WoQ0IerK21.j0GRFkteSq136gZlOxV7kiyoVnzFPXbLitt91VOWLIrzgiiF_W_bFXBq94_eX8JaO5O01X6J4.MvV05q_ESDKQ--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.za", "site": "tripadvisor.co.za", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/ShowForum-g186591-i88-Ireland.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Ireland Forum, Travel Discussion for Ireland - TripAdvisor", "title": "Itinerary review - Shannon to Kilkee via the indirect route - Ireland", "title_full": "Itinerary review - Shannon to Kilkee via the indirect route - Ireland Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-05T23:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10000, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1decad7c0da1662c8135edb3af0aeb8c694b4668", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvAVxs6a_QJ.WAycJU4hEGUQ71v3tKflo1WoQ0IerK21.j0GRFkteSq136gZlOxV7kiyoVnzFPXbLitt91VOWLIrzgiiF_W_bFXBq94_eX8JaO5O01X6J4.MO_frqEOSOhX1ufEeHUsDq", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Mark M", "published": "2017-12-07T03:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thanks remprimo.

It is operated by Nasdaq Nordiq, a 13-year-old subsidiary of Nasdaq, Inc.\nNasdaq Nordiq was established in 2003 for the primary purpose of overseeing the stock exchanges in Nordic countries. Aside from the Nasdaq Stockholm, it also operates the Tallinn Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Baltic; the Riga Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Baltic; the Iceland Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Iceland; the Helsinki Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Helsinki; the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Copenhagen; and the Armenia Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq OMX Armenia.\nThe Nasdaq Stockholm has been present since 1863, making it one of the oldest European stock exchanges. It has only adopted electronic trading on June 1, 1990. Prior to this, floor trading had happened at the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building.\nThe regular session on the Nasdaq Stockholm commences from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. every business day. That is the time for Evolution Gaming Group AB to count its gain.\nThe OMX Stockholm 30 Index (OMXS30) is the market-capitalization-weighted index that monitors the 30 most active stocks on the Nasdaq Stockholm. Numerous sectors make up the OMXS30; and the top three largest sectors are Industrials, Financials, and Consumer Services. Being the benchmark index in Sweden, it is a crucial indicator of the Swedish economy.\nThe OMXS30 is rebalanced twice a year, ensuring a strong indication of how well the Swedish equity market is. As such, some components may be dropped to give way to other companies that are more competitive. Several factors such as liquidity, market capitalization, and industry representation play major role in a stock\u2019s inclusion to the OMXS30.\nBy the Numbers As of the end of the first quarter of 2016, the Nasdaq Stockholm has a market capitalization of nearly $1.30 trillion with over 300 stocks listed on it.\nMeanwhile, the OMXS30 holds an all-time low of 98.86 points, which was last seen in November 1987. Sweden is one of the many countries that had suffered from Black Monday, a remarkable global equity market meltdown in history that began with the sinking of stocks on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HK).\nGradually, the Swedish economy was able to overcome all other challenges through the years. In April 2015, the OMXS30 had reached an all-time high of 1,719.93 points.\nThe Nasdaq Stockholm is one of the most valuable and most competitive stock exchanges in Europe. Because of an attractive borrowing environment in European Union (EU) countries such as Sweden, many investors are flocking the Swedish equity market. There is no better way to take advantage of these growth opportunities than to invest in European stocks such as those listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm.

So beispielsweise das optionale Abschalten der automatischen Zuweisung von Skills und Gegenst\u00e4nden auf der Hotbar. Ein Lucky Charm eines einzelnen Charakters, kann nun zudem auf die komplette Gruppe \u00fcbertragen werden. Ebenfalls ein Komfortgewinn ist die Tatsache, dass Dietriche und Werkzeuge zur Fallenentsch\u00e4rfung automatisch \u00fcber die Funktion Magic Pockets geteilt werden. \nDazu gesellt sich eine lange Liste an Verbesserungen und Bug-Fixes, welche unter anderem das User Interface und den Game Master Mode betreffen. Larian verspricht nun auch eine verbessere Kompatibilit\u00e4t mit Mods.

The current level of the shares currently stands at 9.57 at the time of writing. \nThe main usage of the Parabolic SAR is for trailing stops and exit points. The principle of trading using this indicator is easy. A long position should be maintained as long as the indicator is moving above the price levels, whereas a short position \u2013 while it is below them. In addition, when the SAR changes its direction and crosses the price levels, not only the current position should be closed, but it is suggested that the opposite one should be opened at the same price levels. \nHowever, it should be used only when the market has the defined trend (around 30% of the time) and is smoother. When the trend is absent or the market is volatile, this system generates a lot of incorrect signals. Moreover, the indicator should be adjusted depending on the characteristics of the underlying shares. \nActive traders have a wide range of technical indicators at their disposal for when completing technical stock analysis.

\u2013 Great Fast", "text": "For more, visit TIME Health . \nDuring the summer, when the air is soft with humidity, your skin is unlikely to dry out even if you take multiple daily showers. So there\u2019s no reason to choose between an evening or a morning rinse. You can enjoy both\u2014and both have obvious appeal. \n\u201cA morning shower can help shake off sleep inertia and get you going, while an evening shower can be a relaxing part of a pre-bed routine,\u201d says Michael Grandner, director of the Sleep and Health Research Program at the University of Arizona. \nThat may seem contradictory. How can the same activity both wake you up and help you get to sleep? The answer may have to do with how your body\u2019s internal temperature helps control its circadian sleep rhythms. TIME Health Newsletter Sign Up Now \nYour core temperature naturally begins to drop in the evening and remains low while you sleep. (This is why many sleep experts caution against nighttime exercise: physical activity can raise your core temperature, and so forestall sleep.) While a shower before bed will briefly heat up your skin, you\u2019ll quickly feel colder after toweling off because\u2014as with sweat\u2014the evaporation of skin moisture leads to skin cooling. This cooling effect may facilitate the onset of sleep, research has shown . \n\u201cA shower might also have the benefit of giving you some time to think and wind down before bed, rather than distract yourself in front of the TV,\u201d Grandner says. \nOn the other hand, when you hop out of bed in the morning, a shower gets you on your feet and helps reinvigorate your senses. Since you\u2019re likely to be on the move after your shower\u2014headed to work, or to run errands\u2014and your body\u2019s circadian rhythms are driving your core temperature upwards, the shower won\u2019t have the same soporific effect it does at night. \nBut sleep or wakefulness aside, there are other considerations. \n\u201cEspecially [during winter] when the humidity drops, dry skin becomes a more frequent problem,\u201d says Dr. Brandon Mitchell, an assistant professor of dermatology at George Washington University. Limiting yourself to one ( or fewer ) showers a day can help. Even so, applying moisturizing cream after bathing is important to keep your skin from drying out, Mitchell says. \nBecause many creams or lotions take time to absorb into your skin\u2014and it\u2019s uncomfortable to put on clothes while that sinking-in is still happening\u2014Mitchell says an evening shower may make more sense. \u201cGiven our schedules, taking the time to apply a cream or lotion is often more feasible at night,\u201d he says. \nMORE : You Asked: Should I Get A Facial? \nAnother major benefit of nighttime showers: When you\u2019re out and about during the day, your body\u2014and especially your hair\u2014can collect all sorts of airborne allergens and irritants, says Dr. George Cotsarelis, a professor of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIf you come in with pollen or chemicals on your body and go to bed without showering, you\u2019ll contaminate [your bed],\u201d he says. While that\u2019s a greater concern when seasonal allergies are peaking, it could still be an issue during the winter. \nOn the other hand, Cotsarelis says that going to bed with wet hair is bad for your follicles. Lying against a pillow can trap moisture in your hair. \u201cYou have different layers to each follicle, and the inner cortex can swell with water if not dried properly,\u201d he explains. That swelling can cause the hair cuticle to rupture, and over time can lead to damage and a \u201cweathering effect,\u201d he says. (Of course, drying your hair thoroughly before bed solves this problem.) \nA final morning-vs.-night shower consideration has to do with when you trim your whiskers. A hot, steamy shower can help soften hairs for a more comfortable shave. Especially for men with thick beards who need to shave in the morning just before work, an A.M. shower can make his morning routine more comfortable. \nPut all this together, and before-bed showers seem to have a slight leg-up\u2014especially for people with allergies. Just be sure to dry your hair properly before hopping in bed.

It is not typically recommended, however to use it as a stand-alone to generate trading signals. Since it is time and price based it is not adept at measuring the actual strength of a trend, merely its direction and duration. It is a good idea to use it in conjunction with additional indicators that can help determine the trend\u2019s strength. \nInvestors may be trying to get an edge by following current technical levels for Vanc Pharmaceuticals (VATE). In terms of Moving Averages, the 50-day is 0.02, the 200-day is at 0.02, and the 7-day is 0.02. Using a longer term moving average such as the 200-day may help block out the noise and chaos that is sometimes created by daily price fluctuations. In some cases, MA\u2019s may be used as strong reference points for finding support and resistance levels. Employing the use of the moving average for technical equity analysis is still highly popular among traders and investors. The moving average can be used as a reference point to assist with the discovery of buying and selling opportunities. \nVanc Pharmaceuticals (VATE)\u2019s   14 day Williams %R currently sits at -18.32. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would point to an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would signal an oversold situation. The Williams %R was developed by Larry Williams. This is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. \nVanc Pharmaceuticals (VATE) currently   67.25. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \nCurrently, the 14-day ADX for Vanc Pharmaceuticals (VATE) is sitting at 17.01. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would identify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would lead to an extremely strong trend. ADX is used to gauge trend strength but not trend direction. Traders often add the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to identify the direction of a trend. \nThe RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a widely used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. After a recent check, the 14-day RSI is currently at 56.73, the 7-day stands at 60.28, and the 3-day is sitting at 60.89.

Dolan (I believe the message was entitled \u201cNothing Impossible with God\u201d). I have restructured the message, however; want to ensure I give proper credit. \nTITLE: MARY\u2019S SIDE OF THE STORY \nSCRIPTURE: PHILIPPIANS 4:4-7 / ST. LUKE 1:26-38 \nToday marks the first Sunday of Advent. I always look forward to preach the Advent season as well as HOLY WEEK in the Spring. Advent represents the waiting period leading up to the GREATEST ANNOUNCEMENT THE WORLD HAS EVER HEARD. I enjoy the Advent season as there is so much we continue to learn leading up to the Birth of our Lord and Savior. \n\u2022 Advent comes from the LATIN word \u201cADVENTUS\u201d which means \u201cCOMING\u201d or \u201cARRIVAL\u201d \n\u2022 In Western churches, Advent begins four Sundays before Christmas, or the Sunday closest to November 30th \n\u2022 The Advent Season lasts through Christmas Eve \n\u2022 Advent is a season of Spiritual Preparation for the Birth of Jesus Christ \n\u2022 Advent is not only a way of remembering Christ\u2019s first coming as a human baby, but also for his continued presence with us today through the Holy Spirit \nIt is a peculiar thing, this coming of God. It takes us all by surprise even when we know it is coming. After all, we know the narrative. We are not surprised and perplexed like Mary was when she heard the news. We know the whole narrative, cover to cover, start to finish. Yet, somehow each time we hear it, we are touched in a different way. \n\u2022 It is like your favorite song, the one that makes you cry every time you hear it \n\u2022 You know the words, you know it is coming, and then somehow, you are surprised when on cue those tears start flowing \nDid you know there are ACTUALLY TWO VERSIONS OF THE CHRISTMAS NARRATIVE in the New Testament? Although scholars debate the differences and try to reconcile the two accounts, I think there is a fairly simple explanation. \n\u2022 Matthew tells Joseph\u2019s story \n\u2022 Luke tells Mary\u2019s story \n\u2022 If you doubt that, just go back and read the two versions in comparative fashion \n\u2022 Matthew tells the story like a man would tell it \n\u2022 Luke emphasizes the things a woman would consider important \nLet me try to explain my point. I recall when Michelle and I were stationed in Germany when our first child and the first grandchild on both sides of the family was born.

Today NRS publish life expectancy in Scottish areas. These estimates show how life expectancy in different places within Scotland differs from the national figures. \nWe always report life expectancy separately for males and females, as women consistently outlive men. This is something which is seen not just in Scotland but all over the world in every country and population. \nBetween the 32 council areas in Scotland, life expectancy differs by as much as 7 years for men and 4.7 years for women. A baby boy who was born between 2014-2016 could expect to live until he was 80.3 years old if he was born in Orkney Islands. If however he was born in Glasgow City, he could only expect to reach 73.4 years old. \nA baby girl on the other hand could expect to live for 83.5 years if she were born in East Renfrewshire or East Dunbartonshire, but if she were born in nearby West Dunbartonshire, she could expect to live for 78.8 years. \nEnter your council area on this interactive visualisation to find out how life expectancy at birth compares to other council areas or to Scotland as a whole. \nSo why do we see such a difference in life expectancy across Scotland? One answer might lie in how urban or rural the area is that people live in. The Scottish Government\u2019s \u2018Urban-Rural 6 fold classification\u2019 [*1] is a system that classifies small areas into six groups depending on the number of people living there and the distance from larger towns. \nIn the \u2018Life Expectancy in Scottish Areas\u2019 publication, NRS compare life expectancy for people who live in the different urban-rural areas. Both males and females live longer in more rural areas compared to more urban areas. There are many possible reasons for this, for example, air pollution is much lower in rural areas, meaning that people are less likely to develop diseases in their lungs and airways. It is also possible that people in the countryside have more active lifestyles, resulting in lower incidences of heart disease and obesity related diseases. Females could expect to live 2 years longer in \u2018Remote Rural\u2019 areas than in \u2018Large Urban\u2019 areas. Males are expected to live 3.6 years longer in \u2018Accessible Rural\u2019 areas than in \u2018Large Urban\u2019 areas . \n\nThe \u2018Life Expectancy in Scottish Areas\u2019 publication also reports on how deprivation affects life expectancy. To do this, NRS statisticians use the Scottish Government\u2019s \u2018Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation\u2019 [*2] (SIMD) which gives each small area across Scotland a rank depending on how they score on a series of deprivation measures (i.e. access to health care, employment, income and housing availability amongst others). NRS divides these small areas into five groups based on their SIMD score and calculates life expectancy for these groups (known as quintiles). \nThe statistics show that males living in quintile one (which represents the 20 per cent most deprived areas of Scotland) can expect to live for 10.5 years shorter than males who live in quintile five (the 20 per cent least deprived areas). For females, there is a difference of seven years between those living in quintile one and quintile five. \nThe difference in life expectancy between different SIMD quintiles is larger than the difference between council areas and much larger than the difference between urban and rural areas. This suggests that life expectancy in Scottish areas is more affected by deprivation than by location or rurality. \nIf you would like to know more about life expectancy in Scotland, please visit the NRS website. The publication \u2018 Life Expectancy for Areas within Scotland, 2014-2016\u2019 includes life expectancy estimates for Council areas, Health boards and Scottish Parliamentary constituencies as well as estimates for areas by SIMD and Urban-Rural classification. \nIf you would like to know more about life expectancy for areas across the UK, please visit the ONS website . The ONS also produce estimates of healthy life expectancy and disability free life expectancy as part of their life expectancy publication.

Companies like DNO ASA A NK -,25 enjoy to be the part of German stock exchange.\nGerman Stock Exchange The German Stock Exchange consists of eight stock exchanges located throughout Germany. DNO ASA A NK -,25 were included in one of its units as well. The biggest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the FWB Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse, which is owned and operated by Deutsche B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt. These companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange alone represent 80% of the overall market capitalization in Germany.\nThe second largest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Stuttgart Stock Exchange or the B\u00f6rse Stuttgart. Most financial companies are listed here.\nOther major components of the German Stock Exchange include the B\u00f6rse Berlin-Bremen, the B\u00d6AG B\u00f6rsen AG, and the Hamburg Stock Exchange or the Hamburger B\u00f6rse.\nThe B\u00f6rse Berlin-Bremen, which is located in Berlin-Charlottenburg, was established in 2003 from the union of the Berlin Stock Exchange and the B\u00f6rse Bremen.\nMeanwhile, the B\u00d6AG B\u00f6rsen AG, which oversees trade in Hamburg and Hanover, was established in 1999 from the union of the Hamburg Stock Exchange and the Hanover Stock Exchange.\nBenchmark Index The major index on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is the German Stock Index, commonly known as Deutsche Aktien Xchange 30 (DAX 30), which is the benchmark equity market index in the country.\nDAX 30 tracks the top 30 companies in terms of market capitalization listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Consequently, DAX 30 is a vital indicator of the health of the German economy and investor sentiment as well. Many investors are interested in such DAX companies as DNO ASA A NK -,25.\nThe companies tracked by DAX 30 are capped at 10% weight in order to meet its provisions. This also prevents index heavyweight that might result from mergers and acquisitions (M&As).\nDAX 30 has two versions: 1) performance index, which is usually Quote: d; and 2) price index, which is similar to indices Quote: d in other countries.\nThe index has a base value of 1,000 since December 1987. DAX 30 indices are calculated using XETRA since June 1999. Since 2006, they are being calculated after every second.\nThe movement on DAX 30 is in 0.50 increments. The margin requirement among most brokers is 2% while the minimum trade size is one index.\nDAX 30 had its longest period of glory days around 2003 to 2007. During that time, it had peaked at \u20ac8,105.69. However, after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, DAX 30 had hit \u20ac3,580.\nBeing able to fully recover from the repercussions of the turmoil in the earlier decade, DAX 30 had recorded its all-time high in September 2013 at \u20ac8,736.\nThe performance index, on the other hand, had hit the 12,000 mark in March 2015. DAX 30 had attained its all-time high a month later at 12,374.73 after reaching an intraday high of 12,390.75. Its all-time low had been posted in November 1974 at 372.30.\nBecause of the world-renowned success of the DAX 30, more and more investors are betting on the German equity market.

Germany's DAX gained 0.2 percent to 13,028.86. Futures augured flat opening on Wall Street. Dow futures remained unchanged while S&P futures added 0.1 percent. \nASIA'S DAY: Asia closed mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5 percent to 22,498.03 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5 percent to 5,977.70. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed earlier losses, adding 0.3 percent to 28,303.19.

Republican leaders are pushing to send a final blended package to President Donald Trump to sign before Christmas. \nGEOPOLITICAL ISSUES: Market reaction was muted to President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, ending decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on the issue. In other global developments, the British and Irish prime ministers spoke, seeking to overcome a logjam in Brexit talks, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. \nU.S. JOBS: A report from payroll processor ADP showed private employers added 190,000 jobs last month, slightly better than expected. The report comes two days before a government jobs report, among the last key economic indicators before the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. \nOIL: Benchmark U.S. crude recovered slightly. It added 7 cents to $56.13 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the contract sank $1.66 to settle at $55.96 per barrel.

Add Marijuana as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Marijuana news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Marijuana Add Interest Dr. Byron Maas surveys a supply of marijuana products for dogs that lines a shelf in his veterinary clinic. They're selling well.\n\"The 'Up and Moving' is for joints and for pain,\" he explains. \"The 'Calm and Quiet' is for real anxious dogs, to take away that anxiety.\"\nPeople anxious to relieve suffering in their pets are increasingly turning to oils and powders that contain CBDs, a non-psychoactive component of marijuana. But there's little data on whether they work, or if they have harmful side effects.\nThat's because Washington has been standing in the way of clinical trials , veterinarians and researchers say. Now, a push is underway to have barriers removed, so both pets and people can benefit.\nThose barriers have had more than just a chilling effect.\nWhen the federal Drug Enforcement Administration announced last year that even marijuana extracts with CBD and little or no THC - marijuana's intoxicating component - are an illegal Schedule 1 drug, the University of Pennsylvania halted its clinical trials. Colorado State University is pushing ahead.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned companies that sell marijuana products online and via pet shops and animal hospitals that they're violating laws by offering \"unapproved new animal drugs.\" The FDA threatened legal action.\nBut, seeing potential benefits of CBDs, the American Veterinary Medical Association's policy-making body said last summer it wants the DEA to declassify marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug \"to facilitate research opportunities for veterinary and human medical uses.\" It asked the board of the national veterinarians' organization to investigate working with other stakeholders toward that goal. The board is awaiting a recommendation from two group councils.\n\"The concern our membership has is worry about people extrapolating their own dosages, looking to medicate their pets outside the realm of the medical professional,\" Board Chairman Michael Whitehair said in a telephone interview. \"This is an important reason for us to continue the research.\"\nUtah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a conservative Republican, became an unlikely champion of this push when he introduced a bill in September that would open the path for more clinical research. While Hatch said he opposes recreational marijuana use, he wants marijuana-based drugs, regulated by the FDA, produced for people with disorders.\n\"We lack the science to support use of medical marijuana products like CBD oils, not because researchers are unwilling to do the work, but because of bureaucratic red tape and over-regulation,\" Hatch said.\nDawn Boothe, of Auburn University's College of Veterinary Medicine, is waiting for federal approval to begin a study of marijuana's effects on dogs with epilepsy . The classification of marijuana products containing CBD as a Schedule 1 drug, the same category as heroin and LSD, creates a \"major, major, major, terrible roadblock\" for researchers, Boothe said in a phone interview.\nResearchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine were studying CBDs' effects on dogs with osteoarthritis and pruritis, or itchiness, until the DEA released its policy statement.\n\"The ambiguity in this process has really brought us to a screeching halt,\" said Michael DiGregorio, director of the university's clinical trials center. \"It is research that needs to be done, because there are a lot of CBD products out there.\"\nWhen it clarified that marijuana CBD extracts are Schedule 1 drugs, the DEA said it was assigning a code number to those substances to better track them and to comply with international drug control treaties.\nDiGregorio complained that researchers seeking federal approval to study CBD products are told to provide certain data, but that data isn't normally available until the study is done.\n\"If you don't have the data, you can't get the registration to do the work,\" he said.\nOn a recent morning, Maas took a break from seeing four-legged patients in the Bend Veterinary Clinic. A stethoscope dangling from his neck over green scrubs, Maas said his clients have reported CBDs help relieve pain, arthritis , anxiety, loss of appetite, epilepsy and inflammation in their pets.\n\"Unfortunately there's not a lot of research out there, especially on animals, on CBD compounds,\" Maas said. \"The research is really necessary to help us understand how to actually use these compounds on our pets.\"\nVeterinarian Janet Ladyga of the Blue Sky Veterinary Clinic, also in Bend, said she doesn't recommend marijuana products because of the unknowns.\n\"We don't have a lot of evidence right now, so we don't know the toxicity or the safety profile ... and we don't have any good evidence to show either if it's safe or efficacious,\" she said.\nThe study at Colorado State University aims to provide some data. The roughly two dozen dogs in the arthritis study and the 30 in the epilepsy tests are given either CBD oil or a placebo. For the arthritis study, activity monitors are attached to the animals' collars, to determine if they're more mobile when they're taking CBD.\nPrincipal investigator Stephanie McGrath said she hopes the results will be a stepping stone for longer and more diverse studies, and that they provide useful information for human medicine.\n\"Every medication we're taking has been given to a dog first,\" the University of Pennsylvania's DiGregorio noted.\nMeanwhile, Boothe said she had everything ready to start her study in January, and was waiting for a green light from federal officials.\n\"I don't know what's taking so long,\" she said.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky \n  Scientists call on US to allow research on pot meds for pets         First  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dawn boothe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew selsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke byerly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet ladyga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "byerly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robbie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "byron maas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael whitehair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael digregorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie mcgrath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orrin hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digregorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boothe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abc news internet ventures", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "abc news network", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "american veterinary medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blue sky veterinary clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auburn university's college of veterinary medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania school of veterinary medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shares star the associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drug enforcement administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zalubowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ore.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:02.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4a0107f298f01d3ffefdd00ed990842f9825f15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_UhpLseQfp9yHiC_qMdTzfdguopwHCFvyl4IRxVmUs.0pmDrzcZzcqagalZpLMqe.h_I4Jl97ABA--", "site_full": "www.metalunderground.com", "site": "metalunderground.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/metalunderground", "site_categories": ["music", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "MetalUnderground.com", "title": "Entheogen (Chaos Moon, Etc.)

( BBC News ) \n\nBut the George Eliot hospital, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, misplaced the document and she was artificially fed for 22 months. The Hospital Trust admitted liability and in an out-of-court settlement agreed to pay \u00a345,000. In a letter, it stated: \"It is accepted that the trust failed to act in accordance with the deceased's advance directive and failed to store the advance directive in a way that it could easily be noted.\" \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brenda grant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george eliot", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ny times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hospital trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warwickshire", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nuneaton", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:03.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d5ddc2b97d9f01e72b7c2aea052378480a2c38af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9vfXE04I9791TmrBiqcOGMczfgC1rwznAalzWT.8V.ER2zmwMjaowNj4ITj37yaH9Ky5JsrEWwYOxN.2ZuHiZ5alnVUFKmno5fZX4QIPGVIRGCsAlYU2_GKHby__hS0jYReZE942UP.8U34MJWFl.E5.cZKmeKzU8-", "site_full": "www.net-news-express.de", "site": "net-news-express.de", "site_section": "http://www.net-news-express.de/rssfeed.php", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Net News Express Feed", "title": "Das Gesch\u00e4ft mit der Wahrheit: Wie Medien gesteuert werden", "title_full": "Das Gesch\u00e4ft mit der Wahrheit: Wie Medien gesteuert werden", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d5ddc2b97d9f01e72b7c2aea052378480a2c38af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9vfXE04I9791TmrBiqcOGMczfgC1rwznAalzWT.8V.ER2zmwMjaowNj4ITj37yaH9Ky5JsrEWwYOxN.2ZuHiZ5alnVUFKmno5fZX4QIPGVIRGCsAlYU2_GKHby__hS0jYReZE942UP.8U34MJWFl.E5.cZKmeKzU8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Das Gesch\u00e4ft mit der Wahrheit: Wie Medien gesteuert werden", "text": "Weiterleitung", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "weiterleitung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "das gesch\u00e4ft", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wie medien", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:03.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bff9f8d5873ba9deacfbd2cd46497565ec61432f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog64RomttMIJpwnn3s_yzulDgcUrJftNfThmAfXqd8cxlxL3bXY390ecjFC2cSa0ArtgsVLjD.BdGLUlWyigXENiB1faQBKrRS7VO8uEpK8DbI_JJEQv5fslJ9zNUUDZgbXw--", "site_full": "community.thomsonreuters.com", "site": "thomsonreuters.com", "site_section": "http://community.thomsonreuters.com/ts/rss/Community?interaction.style=group", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "rss.livelink.threads-in-node", "title": "+44-8004049463 Bittrex Support Number", "title_full": "+44-8004049463 Bittrex Support Number", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2520, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bff9f8d5873ba9deacfbd2cd46497565ec61432f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog64RomttMIJpwnn3s_yzulDgcUrJftNfThmAfXqd8cxlxL3bXY390ecjFC2cSa0ArtgsVLjD.BdGLUlWyigXENiB1faQBKrRS7VO8uEpK8DbI_JJEQv5fslJ9zNUUDZgbXw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BittrexSupport", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "+44-8004049463 Bittrex Support Number", "text": "1.)

The current level of the shares currently stands at 4.41 at the time of writing. \nSAR stands for stop and reverse and it is a trend following indicator, designed to identify the turning point in price action. The parabolic SAR is shown on the charts as a series of small \u2018dots\u2019 that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. \nWhen the share price closes above the upper Parabolic SAR, a trader could interpret a buy signal. The Parabolic SAR will move from being above price to below price and the trader would cover any existing short positions and reverse direction and buy long. \nWhen the price closes below the lower Parabolic SAR, a trader could interpret a sell signal. The Parabolic SAR will move from being below price to above price and the trader would sell any existing long positions and reverse direction and go short. \nInvestors and traders using technical analysis to examine stocks may be interested in taking a look at the ATR or Average True Range. Currently, Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises I (BW) has a 14-day ATR of 0.29. The Average True Range is an investor tool used to measure stock volatility. The ATR is not used to figure out price direction, just to measure volatility. The ATR is an indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder.

However, Coca-Cola started to design and develop a new proprietary Fanta packaging shape, applicable to both PET and glass bottles, in order to provide a protectable new global standard for the brand and Sidel has collaborated with TCCC to develop the new \u201cspiral\u201d PET bottle. \nAs part of the rejuvenation project, TCCC involved experienced supply partners in this design challenge. Sidel has played a key role in the packaging project development, namely qualifying the new Fanta bottle for industrial production. \u201cBy embedding the supplier\u2019s knowledge and experience from the very first steps of this journey, we have ensured viable bottle forming, filling and performance,\u201d explains Gregory Bentley , Coca-Cola Packaging Engineer in charge of global project coordination. The new bottle shape required precise understanding of how PET behaves under pressure, particularly with regard to how the carbonation of the beverage can potentially deform the bottle sections, which could lead to the drink spilling. Just like its predecessor, the new bottle was to be produced to be 100% recyclable. Dealing with Asymmetry and Stability \nThe new creative and differentiating bottle in PET designed by Drink Works, winning agency in a 5 way pitch, represents a \u201crule-breaker\u201d in terms of bottle design for CSD (carbonated soft drinks). It features a spiral, inspired by the twisting of an orange to release its juice. It is based on a series of ribs decorated with small bubbles, including a torsion in the bottom half. This spiral gives the Fanta bottle an unusual, asymmetric structure which presented a real challenge in terms of developing a container able to withstand deformation and stability issues. \u201cIt is definitively critical that all opposing sides of the bottle have the same developed length to avoid issues with perpendicularity,\u201d explains Je\u0301rome Neveu , packaging expert at Sidel. \u201cWe optimized the grip profile and the angular base orientation to retain the bottle geometry once filled.\u201d \nThe new design of the Fanta bottle features a spiral, inspired by the twisting of an orange to release its juice (\u00a9 Sidel) \nThe Spiral bottle required full design testing and refinement, achieved through more than 60 technical drawing iterations and FEAs (Finite Element Analysis) to test performance using computing analysis. Moreover, it involved the production of 15 pilot molds and feasibility tests successfully managed with Sidel to achieve validation of the final bottle design. \nA similar bottle shape has been deployed for the whole Fanta bottle family and it is now available for 500 ml, 1 l, 1.5 l and 2 l formats. When it comes to the 1.5 l and 2 l bottles, the Spiral design offers easier gripping and an improved pouring experience for the consumer. Leveraging the successful cooperation with Sidel, an alternate 500 ml Spiral bottle has been developed to ensure stability specifically for gravity-fed inclined shelves which are typically implemented in cold chain distribution. This required specific design rules to be adopted, with very precise bubble numbers and locations around the ribs which constitute the spiral. A consideration throughout the development of the PET bottle was the capability to also transfer the new shape to the glass bottle, an objective which was also successfully achieved. Today, the new Spiral Fanta bottle in PET is sold in Italy, Poland, Malta, Serbia, Finland, Romania and the UK, with plans for global roll-out over the coming months.

Yes By Lethbridge Herald Opinon   \nResearch shows complex problem carries a huge cost for society in assorted ways \nAl Barnhill \nDuring a recent flight between Vancouver and Calgary, I sat next to a young teacher. Like many passing conversations, we casually asked, \u201cWhere are you from? What do you do?\u201d \nWhen she asked the latter question, in part I responded by saying, \u201cI am writing a book about alcohol-related issues.\u201d When I told her the name of the manuscript, \u201cIrrepressible Maggie \u2013 rebounding from alcohol impaired decisions,\u201d* she picked up on the sub-title. She wanted to know more about the book, especially about Maggie\u2019s experiences. \nThe young woman was a \u201crecovering alcoholic,\u201d largely with the support of her friends and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). What was most memorable about her revelations were the words \u201cI didn\u2019t know that my life wasn\u2019t about fighting with my family, conflict with my partner, hangovers, puking, crying jags and misery.\u201d Her words of anguish resonate with me to this moment. \nFortunately, the young, well-educated teacher is moving on. She has found healthier alternatives for her life \u2026 ones with which she seems well satisfied. But, as she and many others have claimed, \u201cRecovery is on-going. You\u2019re never fully recovered from this addiction.\u201d What was especially inspiring about our conversation was her admittance to being an alcoholic. Like Maggie, most drinkers with alcoholic dependence refuse to admit they have a problem. They are deniers. \nAfter more than five years of doing research and writing this book, the harsh realities of alcohol abuse are almost overwhelming. What became very evident was the dramatically increasing abuse of alcohol by women. Consider just some of the hard evidence: \nBased on a 13-year international study in 35 nations, Dr. Sharon Wilsnack claims there is a \u201cglobal epidemic\u201d in women\u2019s drinking. Gabrielle Glasser, a New York Times national health trends reporter, has documentation that American women are drinking more often and in larger quantities. \u201cYoung women alone are not driving these statistics \u2013 their moms and grandmothers are, too.\u201d A leading Canadian journalist, Leah McLaren, has stated: \u201cAll over the Western world, women are drinking more than we ever did before. The latest Statscan figures show a startling 30 per cent rise in the number of Canadian women in risky drinking \u2026 from a decade ago.\u201d \nThe adverse effects are not limited to women per se. Their children and subsequent generations are being seriously harmed. In Alberta, an estimated 36,000 mothers have Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD). One of their teenagers set my house on fire and destroyed it in 2001. In a shocking \u201cGood Housekeeping\u201d article, Heather Millar provided a factual account of children beginning to drink alcohol at the young ages of 9, 10, 11 years of age. \nAlcohol abuse is one of the most complex, costly challenges facing Canadian society. Alcohol kills more people than HIV, AIDS, TB and violence combined (Washington Post, May 12, 2015). Heavy or regular alcohol consumption increases the risk of developing cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, breast, colon and rectum (United States National Institute of Health, 2013). Alcohol-related health care, law enforcement and lost productivity cost Canadians $14.6 billion in 2013 (Canadian Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 2013). Globally, in 2013 more than 3.3 million people died as result of alcohol consumption, up 32 per cent from 2011 (World Health Organization, May, 2014). \nSuch are the human costs. What are the benefits? \nAl Barnhill of Lethbridge is a former Professor of Management at the University of Lethbridge who has worked in the fields of teaching, counselling, management consulting and international development. His new book, \u201cIrrepressible Maggie \u2013 rebounding from alcohol-impaired decisions\u201d* (University of Lethbridge, 2017) is available at the U of L Book Store and Chapters Lethbridge); all proceeds will be donated to Alcoholics Anonymous and Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD).
