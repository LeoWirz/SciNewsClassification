Exposure should be 500/focal length (to keep stars pinpoint sharp), then raise the ISO until you get clear stars. Oh, and enable Slow shutter NR (dark frame NR). You will probably have to use manual focus and figure out where exactly infinity focus is on your lens (and zoom setting), as AF is no use out in the field.\nBut for astrophoto its also important to go somewhere dark, far from city lights, aim at clear skies. This means you usually have to travel a little. You can use some skymap app to figure out where interesting constellations will be.\nBeyond that, you can do multiple exposures and blend them in specialty programs and so on.\nEdit: I would also recommend to set the camera menu colour to red and bring along a flashlight\nThanks for all the info. That'll help a great deal. I would never have thought to change the menu color to red! There's a very rugged area in the Owyhee Mts. just south of where I live. It's out away from the city with some very cool looking rock/cliff formations that should add some interesting detail to the images.\nPost added 12-05-17 at 03:27 PM", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:37.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d64488417896a40d1a70002f38e65bee9684c22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3J9lINDyYWhKt4n3cbg_wtCr5MK04b1EyJoNADDcl0A.G0hCM5sChoKbBQSKgdwerHjLFhL.SyX30sb.9ib2n5PKfVhkiccZ1c-", "site_full": "epicresearch.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://epicresearch.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Epic Research Stock Advisory Company", "title": "EPIC RESEARCH OPENING BELL", "title_full": "EPIC RESEARCH OPENING BELL", "published": "2017-12-07T12:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d64488417896a40d1a70002f38e65bee9684c22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3J9lINDyYWhKt4n3cbg_wtCr5MK04b1EyJoNADDcl0A.G0hCM5sChoKbBQSKgdwerHjLFhL.SyX30sb.9ib2n5PKfVhkiccZ1c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "aarna singh (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "EPIC RESEARCH OPENING BELL", "text": "\n\n\u25a0\u25a0 The #BSE #SENSEX OPEN @ 32615.05 (+17.87) \n\n\u25a0\u25a0 The #NSE #NIFTY OPEN @ 10063.45 (+19.35) \n\n\u25a0\u25a0 #BANKNIFTY OPEN @ 24935.30 (+83.50)\n\nFor more information & more Stocks to buy today . \n\nCall us \u2706 \u2013 0731-6642300 or\n\nVisit http://www.epicresearch.co \n\nConnect with our social media sites\n\nFacebook Twitter YouTube Pinterest Linkedin Google+ Follow @Epic_Research http://epicresearch.blogspot.com/sitemap.xml ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook twitter youtube pinterest linkedin google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:38.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7731759e3d8a5ff82073755c758cd177caa8e1ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r264xOCLb4X9fxagtDRL8NH0GftsmCyAbdbITQAq7TjlJj3ljuxMmO500_cHEI5TsaR.Jy4WqdwPcH3WDwEDCsT.sbg4EmqvV3Wm7N3kTB1SCgcZ1PGTOwK.nz3RQH33MSo3RVFGZuNpohgtCWextdk2p6XedrVm0efnyFMU1.Enheic9NCL.LHU-", "site_full": "www.chennaiclassic.com", "site": "chennaiclassic.com", "site_section": "http://www.chennaiclassic.com/feed/1/posts", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Chennai  - ChennaiClassic.com", "title": "Hiring for Civil Design Engineer- Industrial in Chennai, for Exp. 6 - 10 yrs at AMRA Associates., in (Chennai Job)", "title_full": "Hiring for Civil Design Engineer- Industrial in Chennai, for Exp. 6 - 10 yrs at AMRA Associates., in (Chennai Job)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 64302, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7731759e3d8a5ff82073755c758cd177caa8e1ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r264xOCLb4X9fxagtDRL8NH0GftsmCyAbdbITQAq7TjlJj3ljuxMmO500_cHEI5TsaR.Jy4WqdwPcH3WDwEDCsT.sbg4EmqvV3Wm7N3kTB1SCgcZ1PGTOwK.nz3RQH33MSo3RVFGZuNpohgtCWextdk2p6XedrVm0efnyFMU1.Enheic9NCL.LHU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hiring for Civil Design Engineer- Industrial in Chennai, for Exp. 6 - 10 yrs at AMRA Associates., in (Chennai Job)", "text": "Hiring for Civil Design Engineer- Industrial in Chennai, for Exp. 6 - 10 yrs at AMRA Associates., in (Chennai Job) Reply to: (Not Shown) (Please mention ChennaiClassic.com when contacting) Job Description: Prepare Design data & amp Design calculation, basic and detailed civil design, drawings & amp Layouts. undertake technical and feasibility studies, site visit, Dealing with engg consultants & amp vendors.

I looked high and low, thinking that there probably was one, but couldn't seem to find it. I downloaded the Google Earth night sky app and it shows the area I plan on shooting from. It's just outside the green area, about 7 o'clock from the yellow push pin (my home), about a 35 mile drive, so I should have some relatively dark skies. Also Download Deep Sky Stacker for stacking multiple frames to get much more depth of light. They also have some hints on their site. I am waiting for some more clear weather to try. I used an M135 f/3.5 with the Pentax O-gps1 astro tracer but it was windy and 2:20 is too long an exposure with a 135mm. Go as low an ISO as you can while getting images and stack to get better contrast is the only thing I have learned so far.\nGood luck and dress warm!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:38.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d4bc8dc5f578751a723ce047ec314f8905425ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ApQiAEWQSsNC4xs9vhPGBK8rlQyLrFaVItQRINLER4IL3vryKZZI93gEq.geNYv1sATCCni5JJFNHZn6tRx2MFmXP66qgrTmRgkbtsbW_8A--", "site_full": "www.babycenter.ca", "site": "babycenter.ca", "site_section": "http://www.babycenter.ca/g25018573/december-2017?startIndex=70", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "December 2017 - Page 8 - BabyCenter Canada", "title": "Toddler sick... hoping baby stays in a bit longer.", "title_full": "Toddler sick... hoping baby stays in a bit longer. - December 2017 - BabyCenter Canada", "published": "2017-12-03T22:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://www.babycenter.ca/webassets/countries/en_CA/logo_200x200.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82588, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3b5df322af09e70303206038ec6cc71183d07ea7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ApQiAEWQSsNC4xs9vhPGBK8rlQyLrFaVItQRINLER4IL3vryKZZI93gEq.geNYv1sATCCni5JJFNHZn6tRx2MFmXP66qgrTnT2aAHB6qxPMIfjAuC5nHI9fW18C0QWjg-", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "Nanaimo_0", "published": "2017-12-03T22:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "My experience is the toddler will always be sick (especially 2yr olds!!) and it\u2019s hard/impossible to keep it from spreading within the house, but if you are exposed to it and breastfeeding your baby will always get your immunity during the most fragile months, up to about 6mos.

The measures will only apply to those who buy new sim cards, either on monthly post-pay or pre-pay basis, and include non-Thai individuals. All existing sim card systems are to be terminated as the country is moving toward a digital era. \nIn the initial stage, the NBTC has introduced the new procedures in the three southern border provinces plus four adjacent districts of Songkhla province. About 2,000 cellphone users have been legally obliged to register their sim cards at 25 service points throughout the southernmost region under an Emergency Decree. The measure was designed to prevent the use of cellphone sim cards in the possible provocation of unrest. Additionally, such registration has been provided to some 1,000 sim card numbers at five locations in Bangkok. \nThe main cellphone operators, namely AIS, DTAC, True, TOT and CAT, will provide the registration of sim cards with the pre-pay system at over 60,000 venues throughout the country from 15 December, while those using the monthly post-pay system will be provided for at a later date at various spots nationwide. \nThakorn Tanthasit, secretary general of the NBTC, insisted that individual users\u2019 personal identity data will be safely stored and maintained, and will guarantee safe usage of sim cards.

I'll save you about 30 to 60 minutes of standing out in the cold. In the afternoon before going out, take the camera and lens out and focus on something a mile or two away - a ridge line (preferably using liveview). Then use some tape (Gaffers tape works well) and tape down the focus ring on the lens, and put the camera body in manual focus. You will be all ready to go. The rule of 500 (500/focal length) works ok to figure out your exposure time. Here is an online calculator that works better. Put in your crop factor, sensor resolution, focal length.

Panto Dame, Phil Beck, all set for Jack and the Beanstalk at the Spa.

Phil Beck \nPhil is writing this year\u2019s pantomime Jack and the Beanstalk presented by Tony Peers at Scarborough Spa. \nSo he has to have an eye and ear out for topical references which spice up pantos across the land. \u201cYou might write the script in August but you have to be prepared to be fluid,\u201d said Phil. \u201cSomething could happen during the run which you just have to put in,\u201d he said. \nHe is also playing Dame Tilly Trott and directing the show which features two Scarborough actresses, Lori Kellett as Jill and Charlotte Buxton as Fairy Sweet Pea. \nAs an aside Lori\u2019s sister Devan is playing Alice Fitzwarren in Peers\u2019 Dick Whittington and his Wonderful Cat at Parkway, Beverley. \nIt is the third year he has played dame and the sixth panto he has worked in for Tony. \nBorn near Nottingham and brought up in Peterborough, Phil\u2019s parents were involved in amateur dramatics. His dad was a dame of some renown. \n\u201cPeople have different ways of playing dame, for some the character is a man in a frock for others it is a mumsy role \u2013 I\u2019m somewhere in the middle,\u201d said Phil who was lucky enough to work with one of the best in the business, Nigel Ellacott. This year Nigel is in panto in Wycombe. \nPhil will be donning outrageous costumes, garish make-up, huge wigs and high-heels and reeling off the naughty but nice lines that have the audience in stitches. \n\u201cMy dame is an amalgam of all the women who have had an influence on my life \u2013 including my mum and my wife \u2013 a caricature and tongue-in- cheek characterisation of all those women. \n\u201cThe dame is the glue that sticks most pantomimes together,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThe good thing about Scarborough Spa panto is you cannot get a truer, more traditional panto right through the songs, dances and routines.\u201d \nThis year there will be never-before-seen props and gags as well as the routines \u2013 including the ghost scene \u2013 the audiences expect. \nPhil has been involved professionally in the entertainments business since he was 18 and, at his parents\u2019 insistence, also trained as an accountant. \nHe moved to Flamborough 12 years ago and worked as the entertainments manager for a holiday camp. \nHe loved the area so much that he and wife Clair and 16-month-old son Jaxon have made it their home. \nAs well as panto he works in shows during the year and sings in hotels. \n\u201cI have been very lucky in my career. Put it this way, I have never needed to fall back on the accountancy training.\u201d \nSharing the stage with Phil, Lori and Charlotte will be Louise Willoughby as Jack, Nick Fawcett as the King, Mike Carnell as Silly Billy and Dave Kustard as Fleshcreep. \nDancers from the Scarborough-based TLC of Dance are also performing.

You can use that knowledge and choose to frame your shot with elements that would look good as silhouettes. Alternatively you could light paint the landscape or rely on light pollution for a little bit of illumination.\nHaving a little moonlight can really bring your night landscape to life but it will make the stars and Milky Way appear dimmer. One way to balance these elements is to shoot through a moonrise or moonset and do some exposure blending with a no moon sky and moonlit landscape.\nHere is an example of using light pollution for the foreground. There was a small town a few miles away behind me here and that provided the light for the rocks and tree. The shot may have been decent without that light but I feel like it really brought the foreground to life and improved the photo.\nIMGP4687\nIf you are camping a campfire can help with this too.\nYep, Matt.... what you've got is something similar to what I envision. I think the rock formations, cliffs and surrounding mountains in the area where I'll be shooting would provide some very interesting benefits. I realize it's going to be totally uncharted territory for me. My first time out with a UWA lens and my first time to try astrophotography.... but I always did like a challenge. I'm thinking it will take several trips out to my chosen spot, both with and without moonlight. Each will provide different effects. The good part of it is, it's not far from home, however the snow will be coming soon. That will make it difficult to access.... and I sold my 4x4 last year! Trust me, it's NOT a place where you'd want to find yourself stuck! I've never been there at night time, but maybe tonight? An almost full moon would provide some dramatic lighting. A question: Would it be possible to shoot one shot, short exposure time to provide detail in the moon, then shoot another time exposure shot and meld the two images? I would have the detail in the moon AND the surrounding landscape would be well-lit? I've never tried \"stacking\" images before. As you can tell, this is truly unfamiliar territory for me but I can see where it would be a real hoot!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://flic.kr/p/GXxCjz"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:39.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a699eaf71c1d3bfea31cb65f303447410db23f39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHhdzglx.ii.nD_me2VrTk6B5nfu5JU_Y1DFdx8whMtTAkK8ToDfsqCg--", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "https://markets.financialcontent.com/mi.sunherald/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6517", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "MarketWatch", "title": "FTSE 100 heads for a win, even as China warning drags down miners", "title_full": "FTSE 100 heads for a win, even as China warning drags down miners", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a699eaf71c1d3bfea31cb65f303447410db23f39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHhdzglx.ii.nD_me2VrTk6B5nfu5JU_Y1DFdx8whMtTAkK8ToDfsqCg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "FTSE 100 heads for a win, even as China warning drags down miners", "text": "December 07, 2017 at 04:57 AM EST FTSE 100 heads for a win, even as China warning drags down miners U.K. stocks edged higher Thursday, aided in part by continued weakness for the pound which has been weighed by Brexit uncertainty, but mining shares were a drag on London\u2019s blue-chips benchmark.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:39.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6fb79548b92e876866194538f5bcfb1bde42f5ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAW7upMr11oaWIJ4i7hc_j_OC9_ss_P1D6VCqrtUk.sI5Si66ubDDPJ9DJMSJZohEiLBXBTyyyRAaZlZv3m8AdRtEHW4DC1uFYA6HTBZVWME6fB8Dde9On_ag--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-kitchen-organizer-storage/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Kitchen Storage &amp; Accessories - Buy Kitchen Storage &amp; Accessories at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Suoernuo Irony 3-layer Storage Rack", "title_full": "Suoernuo Irony 3-layer Storage Rack | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-10-20T11:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.154, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a3b4ab0e9a682edf47b5a12414898d229f786f52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAW7upMr11oaWIJ4i7hc_j_OC9_ss_P1D6VCqrtUk.sI5Si66ubDDPJ9DJMSJZohEiLBXBTyyyRAaZlZv3m8AdRtEHW4DC1uFYA6HTBZVWME6c7YlCK7MCz92AooN5rbkMU", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Siti N.", "published": "2017-12-04T10:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Item Cukup Lengkap", "text": "Barang diterima item lengkap cuma tak stabil sikit jer...but nice", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:39.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa090233c4047898b8873c7b661831e3ace11648", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r264xOCLb4X9fxagtDRL8NH0GftsmCyAbdbITQAq7TjlJk3erSG25K324KVVeV7R4zvfaZJ_OesCCFW6HAOGqqik7BgVN3jhhgJrx5DE_bG4nfUXSCaLilrfi8.ioTgjkg2y3mGktjZL1TDUZrcuumbZaIYvOeZfwk3WxDa7DanAPxZsIVlH7QG1_3ALKnj6EXA--", "site_full": "www.chennaiclassic.com", "site": "chennaiclassic.com", "site_section": "http://www.chennaiclassic.com/feed/1/posts", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Chennai  - ChennaiClassic.com", "title": "Hiring for Mechanical Design Engineer(autocad/pro E/catia) in Bengaluru/Bangalore, Chennai for Exp.

(AP) \u2014 A white former South Carolina police officer committed second-degree murder when he shot an unarmed black motorist to death and should expect to spend about two decades in prison, a judge said Thursday as he prepared to sentence the ex-officer for a federal civil rights violation. Before U.S. District Judge David Norton announced the punishment, he had to decide whether Michael Slager's shooting of Walter Scott in April 2015 was manslaughter or murder. After the judge's decision, he said he'd work from guidelines that recommend Slager spend 19 to 24 years in prison. A formal sentence was expected later Thursday, after the judge hears testimony from Scott's family and friends. Scott's mother, Judy Scott, said through tears that her faith in God gives her the ability to forgive Slager. Scott's brother Anthony Scott echoed that sentiment. \"I'm not angry at you, Michael. Michael, I forgive you, and Michael, I do pray for you now and for your family, because we've gone through a traumatic time,\" he said. Attorneys for ex-North Charleston Officer Michael Slager said he shot 50-year-old Walter Scott in self-defense after the two fought and Scott reached for Slager's stun gun. They said race didn't play any role in the shooting and that Slager never had any \"racial animus\" toward minorities. Still, Slager pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott's civil rights. As part of the plea agreement reached in May, prosecutors dropped state murder charges. A year ago, a state judge declared a mistrial when jurors deadlocked. A bystander captured the shooting on a cellphone, and it was shared around the world, setting off Black Lives Matter protests across the U.S. as demonstrators said it was the perfect example of police officers' mistreatment of African-Americans. The bystander started recording after the struggle between Slager and Scott. The video showed Scott running away from Slager and the officer firing eight times. Scott was hit in the back five times. After the shooting, Slager picked up his stun gun and placed it next to Scott. Slager contends he was securing the weapon. Prosecutors think he put it there to bolster his self-defense story. The judge also found that Slager, 36, obstructed justice when he made statements to state police after the shooting. On Wednesday, Scott's youngest son spoke so he could return to his high school classes. Clutching a photograph of his father, Miles Scott said he has had trouble sleeping ever since his father's death. He said he misses watching football games with his dad and can't fathom not being able to watch with him the game they both loved. \"I miss my father every day,\" Miles Scott said through tears. \"I would like you to sentence the defendant to the strongest sentence the laws allows because he murdered my one and only father.\" Federal officials recommended 10 to nearly 13 years in prison. His attorneys argue Slager should face far less time. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP . Read her work at https://apnews.com/search/meg%20kinnard .

Here's some of the areas in consideration. All are within a half mile of each other. So, I guess what I'm wanting to do is a mixture of landscape and astrophotography combined. That takes the difficulty level up a notch but I applaud your goals.\nJust think about the elements that will be either helping or hindering your efforts, often some of each for different elements of your shot at the same time.\nMoonless nights produce the best Milky Way shots but without any moonlight your landscape will be very dark, most likely completely black. You can use that knowledge and choose to frame your shot with elements that would look good as silhouettes. Alternatively you could light paint the landscape or rely on light pollution for a little bit of illumination.\nHaving a little moonlight can really bring your night landscape to life but it will make the stars and Milky Way appear dimmer. One way to balance these elements is to shoot through a moonrise or moonset and do some exposure blending with a no moon sky and moonlit landscape.\nHere is an example of using light pollution for the foreground. There was a small town a few miles away behind me here and that provided the light for the rocks and tree. The shot may have been decent without that light but I feel like it really brought the foreground to life and improved the photo.\nIMGP4687\nIf you are camping a campfire can help with this too.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://flic.kr/p/GXxCjz"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:39.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "955e2c2e4b6502b52579120c6e3de3102de9b4ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.ZD40en7iKBGektdN8RCGpdRh08Vz1k7RJ8ijwMXmFKJ0_l_jRcqze4TaEhnetY87OZFUJSjnmtcsJeNEy5ph570RQ2D17uA-", "site_full": "www.monteozlive.com", "site": "monteozlive.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "John Mayer undergoes emergency appendectomy | Monte Oz Live", "title_full": "John Mayer undergoes emergency appendectomy | Monte Oz Live", "published": "2017-12-06T12:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.972, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.monteozlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fdfgdsfgsdgf.jpg?fit=620%2C290&ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "955e2c2e4b6502b52579120c6e3de3102de9b4ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.ZD40en7iKBGektdN8RCGpdRh08Vz1k7RJ8ijwMXmFKJ0_l_jRcqze4TaEhnetY87OZFUJSjnmtcsJeNEy5ph570RQ2D17uA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Monte Oz", "published": "2017-12-06T12:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "John Mayer undergoes emergency appendectomy | Monte Oz Live", "text": "tweet \nRock singer-songwriter John Mayer on Tuesday went into emergency surgery for removal of his appendix, forcing his band featuring former members of the Grateful Dead to postpone a show. \nThe 40-year-old Mayer \u201cwas admitted into the hospital for an emergency appendectomy\u201d early on Tuesday, a representative said in a statement without further detail. \nDead and Company \u2013 featuring Mayer along with Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann \u2013 postponed a concert scheduled for Tuesday in New Orleans, saying it would be rescheduled. \nThe group has been touring since 2015 when the Grateful Dead, the legendary jam rockers of the hippie era, officially retired.

He said he felt a need to explain it after President Donald Trump, Steinle\u2019s parents and many other commentators and social media users said they were disappointed with the decision. \n\u201cThey appear to be confused by the verdict,\u201d Van Stockum said. \u201cI was not confused.\u201d \nGarcia Zarate had been deported five times before the shooting, and had been set free at the time of the shooting when the San Francisco sheriff\u2019s department ignored a federal immigration detainer request and released him after dropping an old marijuana charge. \nSan Francisco is sanctuary city and officials are limited in the cooperation they can give federal immigration authorities. \nVan Stockum, a mechanical engineer, said he and other jurors were able to put aside their feelings about immigration and the news coverage the case received before the trial. \n\u201cThe evidence did not show beyond a reasonable doubt he intended to kill anyone,\u201d Van Stockum said. \u201cPolitics had nothing to do with it.\u201d \nVan Stockum said acquitting Garcia Zarate of involuntary manslaughter was a closer call. He said the jury instructions directed them to first determine if Garcia Zarate \u201cbrandished\u201d the gun before it fired if they wanted to find him guilty of involuntary manslaughter. \nHe also said the evidence showed that a minuscule amount of gun powder was found on the hands of Garcia Zarate, supporting his claim that the gun was wrapped in a T-shirt when he picked it up and it fired. \nTrump pointed to Steinle\u2019s death while campaigning for president as another reason why the United States should build a wall on it southern border and tighten immigration restrictions. \nThe jury did convict Garcia Zarate of being a felon in possession of handgun. His public defender Matt Gonzalez said he will ask a judge to toss out that conviction. \nA federal grand jury in San Francisco indicted Garcia Zarate Tuesday on two gun and immigration charges. Gonzalez did not return a call seeking comment Wednesday. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steinle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garcia zarate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gonzalez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "van stockum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose ines garcia zarate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kate steinle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phil van stockum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt gonzalez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:40.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e09d5d6ef3d4a773008f8a9bf39946ae498d6902", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZST7YWtflywBoy98l1ELEqsuyizvXf04S2p0CHQ6nq1C1fX0oP_kLqgU98R.qsbw7PUVI6x95dBjJ1nANxh0utVf66yrsKd3Vk-", "site_full": "www.careerpointkenya.co.ke", "site": "careerpointkenya.co.ke", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/careerpointkenya", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "Career Point Kenya", "title": "8 Top Accredited Colleges In Kenya You Can Enroll At", "title_full": "8 Top Accredited Colleges In Kenya You Can Enroll At", "published": "2017-12-07T11:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 52506, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e09d5d6ef3d4a773008f8a9bf39946ae498d6902", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZST7YWtflywBoy98l1ELEqsuyizvXf04S2p0CHQ6nq1C1fX0oP_kLqgU98R.qsbw7PUVI6x95dBjJ1nANxh0utVf66yrsKd3Vk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tobias Kibet", "published": "2017-12-07T11:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "8 Top Accredited Colleges In Kenya You Can Enroll At", "text": "STAND OUT from the competition with a professional CV.

He\u2019s been awarded his doctoral degree and now he\u2019s published a collection of poems. \n\u201cI was born a refugee\u201d, Hekmat Dirbas says. \u201cAnd I became a refugee again in the Netherlands.\u201d 40-year-old Dirbas, whose roots are Palestinian, grew up in a camp just outside Aleppo. He arrived in the Netherlands in 2011, where he obtained his doctorate at Leiden University for his work on personal names which derive from animal names. \nNow he has written a collection of poems: 27 poems, in Arabic, published in Lebanon. \u201cI wrote most of the poems in the Netherlands: thirty per cent in Syria and seventy per cent here\u201d, he explains. His work is based on personal experience. \u201cBut I use poetic and symbolic language, as you do in poetry.\u201d \nDirbas is Palestinian in origin and grew up in Camp Neirab in the countryside close to Aleppo in Syria. The title of the little book\u2019s first part, \u201cBarracks number 10\u201d, refers to the place of his childhood: a container. \u201cThe military camp was established during the French mandate for Syria in order to receive the British air forces during World War II against the German forces. Later, a group of Palestinian refugees (obliged to leave their homeland) were hosted in this camp, meaning from a military camp to a refugee camp: a tragic paradox.\u201d \n\u201cMy grandparents were alloted a room in barrack number ten\u201d, Dirbas continues. \u201cThe barracks were miserable, but my grandmother, a fantastic woman, turned them into a paradise. That\u2019s what I call it: Paradise. She came from the mountains, which were full of plants and wildlife. She planted flowers and trees and kept lots of pets, dogs and cats. Later, I realised that she wanted rebuild her childhood home.\u201d \nAt Mare\u2019s request, he has translated one of his poems (see below). \nDirbas: \u201cIt\u2019s about a paradox, about when I realised that Paradise was a \u2018camp\u2019. I had heard people mention that word, but I didn\u2019t know what it meant until I was older and learnt about the political background. There\u2019s a magical place I knew as a child and there\u2019s an ugly, political place. I didn\u2019t have an address. There were no street names, only the numbers of the barracks. I needed an address to enrol at university, so I put down \u2018Kamp Neirab, barracks number 10\u2018. That\u2019s how it\u2019s registered in the civil records.\u201d \nHe arrived in the Netherlands in 2011, as a PhD student. The war in Syria broke out two months later. \u201cI became a refugee once more\u201d, he recalls. \u201cThe situation forced me to apply for asylum after two years. First, my existence as a refugee was part of a collective, as a Palestinian. Now, I\u2019m experiencing it as an individual.\u201d \nThe second part of the collection is called Barracks no. 329. \u201cBecause I lived on Willem de Zwijgerlaan, at number 329.\u201d He explains that the apartments in Leiden-Noord don\u2019t actually resemble a refugee camp. \u201cIt\u2019s something you leave behind. A temporary place. Not your real place.\u201d \nAs we grew up, the mystery disclosed.

It was the first international court to investigate and prosecute allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide since the tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo after World War II. \nAt a council meeting before the tribunal ends operations Dec. 31, its president, Judge Carmel Aguis, said the court proved to be \u201ca bold and innovative response to conflict\u201d that has written \u201ca very important page in the history of international justice and the fight against impunity.\u201d \nHe expressed hope that the tribunal\u2019s \u201clegacy and judgments\u201d won\u2019t be undermined by the dramatic death of Croat ex-general Slobodan Praljak, who took poison Nov. 29 after judges at the tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, confirmed his 20-year-sentence for war crimes in Bosnia. \nDeputy U.S. Ambassador Michele Sison said the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia \u201cestablished key precedents in international criminal law\u201d and \u201chas created a legacy of the greatest importance.\u201d \nRussia\u2019s deputy ambassador, Petr Iliichev, disagreed. He said the court was based on \u201ca one-sided, anti-Serb interpretation of the tragic events of the 1990s in former Yugoslavia\u201d and didn\u2019t play an impartial and independent role. \n\u201cWe are convinced that a whole range of its decisions have discredited the very idea of international justice,\u201d Iliichev said. \nAccording to the court, it indicted 161 people and concluded proceedings for all of them \u2014 convicting and sentencing 90, acquitting 19, referring 13 to national courts, and sending two to be retried by a \u201cresidual\u201d court that is wrapping up the tribunal\u2019s work. It said 37 people had their indictments withdrawn or died. \nIliichev complained that more than 60 percent of the convictions dealt with Serbs whose sentences totaled more than 1,000 years while the other parties to the conflict \u2014 Croats and Bosnian Muslims \u2014 often received \u201ca range of non-guilty sentences.\u201d \nSison highlighted the Nov. 22 conviction of Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb general whose forces rained shells and snipers\u2019 bullets on Sarajevo and carried out the worst massacre in Europe since World War II at Srebrenica. He was convicted of genocide and other crimes and sentenced to life in prison. \nIliichev called Mladic\u2019s sentence a continuation of the \u201cpoliticized and biased line\u201d against Serbs. \nCroatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic said her country shares the assessments that it \u201cgreatly lived up to the expectations of the international community\u201d by fighting against impunity and ensuring accountability for war crimes. \n\u201cEqually important is the tribunal\u2019s role in giving voice to over 100,000 victims of horrific crimes,\u201d she said. \nSerbia\u2019s justice minister, Nela Kuburovic, noted that Serbs accounted for 109 of the 161 people indicted by the tribunal. \n\u201cThese numbers speak tellingly about the selective justice of the tribunal, especially in the context of its mandate to establish the truth about the armed conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and bring about reconciliation,\u201d she said. \nSerge Brammertz, a prosecutor for the court, said reconciliation in the Balkans remains a significant challenge, noting that convicted war criminals \u201ccontinue to be seen by many as heroes, while victims and survivors are ignored and dismissed.\u201d \n\u201cThe reality is that there is still no true will within the region to accept the immense wrongdoings of the past and move forward, sadly most of all among the political leadership,\u201d he said. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "iliichev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolinda grabar-kitarovic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petr iliichev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "serge brammertz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "slobodan praljak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nela kuburovic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michele sison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mladic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmel aguis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ratko mladic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sison", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srebrenica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the hague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balkans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bosnia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yugoslavia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nuremberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "serbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarajevo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:40.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "090a62fd310fa857e70ae2fe5efede80de1c8748", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqZ8hfaOPmtwXhLZqhic0xUwrszwFnBMDAnxKlgh.4rLcpc5ODx3Gg7K5RoKcv0d33BQuYzBKjTCehgU8iVBa6W2l525tt2lWAQ3JgugOAmhgpu_zKFcFa5", "site_full": "techpoint.ng", "site": "techpoint.ng", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bluechip Technologies launches BluePrime for your Analytics solution", "title_full": "Bluechip Technologies launches BluePrime for your Analytics solution", "published": "2017-12-07T13:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.783, "main_image": "https://techpoint.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BluePrime-feature-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "090a62fd310fa857e70ae2fe5efede80de1c8748", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqZ8hfaOPmtwXhLZqhic0xUwrszwFnBMDAnxKlgh.4rLcpc5ODx3Gg7K5RoKcv0d33BQuYzBKjTCehgU8iVBa6W2l525tt2lWAQ3JgugOAmhgpu_zKFcFa5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sponsored Post", "published": "2017-12-07T13:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Bluechip Technologies launches BluePrime for your Analytics solution", "text": "2 Comments IN: Sponsored \nBluechip Technologies launches BluePrime, a market leading Analytics solution that delivers valuable insight into customer experience and satisfaction while using your products.

Those that think they lost everything have been given the second chance and can make through the raging devastation and certainty that with rain comes a rainbow. \n\n\nGuns N' Roses - November Rain https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SbUC-UaAxE&feature=share ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:40.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ab261f47445952389b5dcde862c93aa53fe9a0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWbZfCnO1f5qvsoeX.RXDrxyAHg19P0eXLvGxwG4Av9XcmmXoUFQ0qbFX4Smav405LeNB7pWp25gNgBke8RYs27D", "site_full": "heavy.com", "site": "heavy.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Al Franken Hasn\u2019t Decided to Resign Yet, His Office Says | Heavy.com", "title_full": "Al Franken Hasn\u2019t Decided to Resign Yet, His Office Says | Heavy.com", "published": "2017-12-07T00:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.104, "main_image": "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/gettyimages-881759484-e1512599264770.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=all&#038;w=782", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2634, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ab261f47445952389b5dcde862c93aa53fe9a0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWbZfCnO1f5qvsoeX.RXDrxyAHg19P0eXLvGxwG4Av9XcmmXoUFQ0qbFX4Smav405LeNB7pWp25gNgBke8RYs27D", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tom Cleary", "published": "2017-12-07T00:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Al Franken Hasn\u2019t Decided to Resign Yet, His Office Says | Heavy.com", "text": "Dec 6, 2017 at 6:17pm Published Dec 6, 2017 at 5:34pm Getty Senator Al Franken. \nSenator Al Franken has not yet decided whether he will resign, his office s aid Wednesday night in a tweet that disputes a report by Minnesota Public Radio. Franken has been accused of sexual misconduct by eight women, including two who came forward on Wednesday. \nMPR News, citing an unnamed Democratic official, reported that Franken would be announcing his resignation during a Thursday announcement. The official told MPR News that he or she had spoken to Franken and separately to Frnaken\u2019s staff. Franken was at his Washington home to discuss plans with his family, according to MPR. \nFranken\u2019s official Twitter account responded to MPR and the reporter who published the story, Brian Bakst, writing, \u201cNot accurate, @mpr @Stowydad. No final decision has been made and the Senator is still talking with his family. Please update your story.\u201d Not accurate, @mpr @Stowydad . No final decision has been made and the Senator is still talking with his family. Please update your story. \n\u2014 Sen. Al Franken (@SenFranken) December 6, 2017 \nIn a second tweet, Franken\u2019s office said, \u201cSenator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\u201d Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate. \n\u2014 Sen. Al Franken (@SenFranken) December 6, 2017 \nFranken faced a wave of calls for him to step down on Wednesday, with 32 Democratic senators, including 13 women and 19 men, telling him to resign, according to CNN. \nNew York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand was the first to call for Franken to resign on Wednesday. \u201cWhile Senator Franken is entitled to have the Ethics Committee conclude its review, I believe it would be better for our country if he sent a clear message that any kind of mistreatment of women in our society isn\u2019t acceptable by stepping aside to let someone else serve,\u201d she wrote on Facebook. \nSeveral other women senators joined Gillibrand with statements Wednesday, including Claire McCaskill, Maggie Hassan, Patty Murray, Tammy Baldwin, Debbie Stabenow, Dianne Feinstein, Tammy Duckworth, Kamala Harris, Maria Cantwell and Dianne Feinstein. \nIn a statement from her office, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota\u2019s other senator, said Wednesday, \u201cSenator Klobuchar personally spoke with Senator Franken this morning. As has been reported, he will be making an announcement tomorrow morning.\u201d \nSenator Bob Casey was the first male colleague of Franken\u2019s to call for him to step aside Wednesday. He has since been joined by several others, including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez also called for Franken to resign. \nIf Franken does resign, his seat will be filled by Minnesota\u2019s Democratic Governor Mark Dayton. The interim senator would serve until 2018, when voters would pick someone to finish the final two years of Franken\u2019s term. \nThe calls for Franken\u2019s resignation came on the same day that two more women came forward with accusations against him. \nA former Democratic Congressional aide, whose name was withheld to protect her identity, told Politico that Franken tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006, three years before he became a senator. The woman said she had accompanied her boss to Franken\u2019s studio. After her boss left the room following the taping, she was gathering her belongings when she said she came face to face with Franken. \n\u201cHe was between me and the door, and he was coming at me to kiss me. It was very quick, and I think my brain had to work really hard to be like \u2018Wait, what is happening?\u2019 But I knew whatever was happening was not right, and I ducked,\u201d the woman told Politico. \u201cI was really startled by it, and I just sort of booked it towards the door, and he said, \u2018It\u2019s my right as an entertainer.'\u201d \nFranken, who has called for an ethics investigation into the accusations to be conducted, denied the former aide\u2019s accusation, telling Politico, \u201cThis allegation is categorically not true and the idea that I would claim this as my right as an entertainer is preposterous. I look forward to fully cooperating with the ongoing ethics committee investigation.\u201d \nLater Wednesday, Tina Dupuy the former communications director for Democratic Congressman Alan Grayson, wrote in The Atlantic that she was groped by Franken in 2009. \nYou can read more about Dupuy at the link below: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claire mccaskill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "debbie stabenow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tammy baldwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dianne feinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamala harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy klobuchar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frnaken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan grayson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "klobuchar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tammy duckworth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tina dupuy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maggie hassan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom perez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian bakst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dupuy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria cantwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob casey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark dayton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mpr news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic congressional", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic national committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota public radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mpr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:40.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2115719ff49c9afd43c65ec61f04ea0180da796e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvve2Hryq86tAR4PrymX5D7lOF5it.pCndbIw8SxzDvxWACU6VJSoCt.U8G4Z..OrI67XkTvuQ7.ElDVUP_qF_h52OUZRt2NEJFdmm3qng6JO9FZKaCRuR35faFwUaNXQuTh5nWjm5bflf96xFJ.LaDt3iU.FihtDhA9RzWtxQfAgxMoR4H2W92GyIaWWMGfpoSU6nAgjPpnkQ-", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "Asia-Pacific Colorectal Cancer Therapeutics in Markets to 2023: Market will be valued at $7.9 billion in 2023, growing from $4.7 billion in 2016", "title_full": "Asia-Pacific Colorectal Cancer Therapeutics in Markets to 2023: Market will be valued at $7.9 billion in 2023, growing from $4.7 billion in 2016", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ea3896f324492112f5f5010e4b2f32645c0f89d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvve2Hryq86tAR4PrymX5D7lOF5it.pCndbIw8SxzDvxWACU6VJSoCt.U8G4Z..OrI67XkTvuQ7.ElDVUP_qF_h52OUZRt2NEJFdmm3qng6JO9FZKaCRuR35faFwUaNXQuTh5nWjm5bflf96xFJ.LaDtzhDNmTKHHxG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Asia-Pacific Colorectal Cancer Therapeutics in Markets to 2023: Market will be valued at $7.9 billion in 2023, growing from $4.7 billion in 2016", "text": "Dublin, Dec. 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Colorectal Cancer Therapeutics in Asia-Pacific Markets to 2023 - Launch of Premium Targeted Therapies and Increasing Prevalence to Drive the Market\" report has been added to Research and Markets' offering. \n\nThe report Colorectal Cancer Therapeutics in Asia-Pacific Markets to 2023 - Launch of Premium Targeted Therapies and Increasing Prevalence to Drive the Market analyzes the CRC pipeline and stratify pipeline therapies by stage of development, molecule type and molecular target. Furthermore, this report helps to understand the current clinical and commercial landscape by considering disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and the treatment options available at each stage of diagnosis, including a clinical comparison of marketed therapies.\nChina has the most newly diagnosed CRC cases in Asia-Pacific (APAC). In 2011, there were 310,200 incident cases in the country and this rose to 376,300 in 2015. CRC is the most common malignancy among Chinese males, with an estimated incidence of 215,700 men and 160,600 women in 2015. Mortality in 2011 stood at 149,700, and in 2015 rose to 191,000 (Chen et al., 2016). \n\nIn Japan, the incidence and mortality of CRC have substantially increased. In 2012, the incidence of colon and rectum cancer in Japan was 87,800 and 46,800 cases respectively, and mortality was 32,200 and 15,100 cases (NCC, 2016a). CRC is a major cause of death in Japan, where it accounts for the largest number of deaths from malignant neoplasms among women, and the third largest among men (Watanabe et al., 2015). In 2016, there were an estimated 147,200 new CRC cases and 51,600 deaths in the country (NCC, 2016b). \n\nIn Australia, the five-year survival rate increased from 50% between 1984 and 1988 to 69% between 2009 and 2013. Improvement in survival from CRC may be due to earlier diagnosis and the availability of better treatment options (AGCA, 2017). The incidence of CRC is still several folds lower in India than in most developing and developed countries (Mallath, 2014). However, the country has witnessed a steady increase in numbers in line with its increasing urbanization.\n\nCompanies mentioned in this report: \n\nMerck & Co.

What effect will patent expirations of currently branded therapies have on market value? The CRC pipeline is large and diverse, with an strong presence of mAbs and targeted therapies. \nWhat are the common targets and mechanisms of action of pipeline therapies? Will the pipeline address unmet needs such as the lack of targeted therapies available for BRAF-mutant CRC patients? What implications will the increased focus on targeted therapies have on the future of CRC treatment? Numerous late-stage pipeline therapies with a strong clinical record have the potential to enter the market over the forecast period. \nHow have the late-stage therapies performed in clinical trials? How would the approval of encorafenib plus binimetinib to treat BRAF-mutant patients affect the competitive landscape, with no targeted therapy currently available to address this patient subset? The market forecasts indicate that Japan will contribute the most to the Asia-Pacific market value due to the emergence of novel therapies. \nHow will the annual cost of therapy and market size vary between the five assessed Asia-Pacific markets? How could changes in risk factors such as population age, obesity and lifestyle influence the market? Licensing deals are the most common form of strategic alliance in CRC, with total deal values ranging from under $10m to over $3 billion. \nHow do deal frequency and value compare between target families and molecule types?

As part of the new financing, Carol Gallagher , Pharm D, Partner at NEA, will join the company's board of directors.  With the new financing, Metacrine has raised approximately $60M since it began operations in early 2015.\n\nOver the course of the past year, Metacrine has advanced its lead asset, MET409, an oral non-bile acid FXR agonist, into late stage IND-enabling studies.  First-in-human studies of MET409 are planned to be initiated in the first half of 2018 and completed by year end.  Based on extensive profiling and benchmarking against other FXR agonists in development, MET409 has been purposefully designed to have a differentiated profile to position it as best-in-class for efficacy and safety.  FXR has been clinically validated to be a key target in hepatobiliary diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\n\"We have had a keen interest in new therapeutics for patients with NASH.  We look forward to working with the experienced management team at Metacrine to support their mission to discover and development innovative medicines,\" said Dr. Gallagher. \nIn addition to advancing MET409 into clinical development, the Series B proceeds will also be used to fund drug discovery efforts against novel targets in liver inflammation and fibrosis.  Metacrine is also advancing a FGF1 program, a first-in-class insulin sensitizer, in collaboration with Novo Nordisk.\n\"We are thrilled to have NEA as a new investor along with the addition of Dr. Gallagher to our board,\" said Ken Song , MD, President and CEO of Metacrine.  \"NASH represents one of the largest unmet medical needs in medicine today.  We believe FXR is a compelling NASH target and that our program addresses the gaps in delivering a best-in-class molecule.  In addition to NASH, we have outlined a strategy to pursue FXR in other clinical indications.\"\nAbout Metacrine\nMetacrine is a privately held biotechnology company headquartered in San Diego, CA.

This powerful upgrade adds Neustar\u2019s state of the art WAF (web application firewall) solution to the award-winning Neustar SiteProtect solution to extend network protection to the application layer. A new real-time user interface provides consolidated in-depth trend analysis and gives brands unprecedented access to attack forensics that are not currently available through traditional defense services. \n\u201cYears of experience and cybersecurity engineering capabilities have gone into the development of the SiteProtect NG defense network and operating portal,\u201d said Barrett Lyon, Vice President, Research and Development, Neustar Security Solutions. \u201cNeustar is investing in the future of DDoS defense from an architectural standpoint and sees the expansion and closer integration of its security solutions portfolio as a long term strategic commitment for the company.\u201d \n\u201cNeustar\u2019s clients have the best protection, best user experience, broadest selection of configurations, and powerful analytics at their disposal. DDoS attacks will continue to present brands across the globe with significant challenges to their operational efficiency for the foreseeable future, and our investment in mitigation solutions will continue at pace,\u201d added Lyon. \nSiteProtect NG breaks with the tradition of designing network protection that makes use of a high volume of small scrubbing centers with fewer, highly fortified and highly connected locations. SiteProtect NG network has deployed large, full scale, nodes, each with its multi-terabit scrubbing capacity in North America, Europe, and Asia with South America, Africa, Australia, and India slated for early 2018. \n\u201cDDoS attacks reached unprecedented levels in 2017 and all trends Neustar is mapping indicate that 2018 is going to see the situation worsen dramatically. Cybercriminals, both private and state funded, have the wherewithal to surgically target individual brands, or initiate brute force attacks with the potential to cause catastrophic damage on a global scale. For many cybersecurity professionals, there is no respite, with attackers probing and often breaching defenses on a daily basis,\u201d commented Rodney Joffe, Senior Vice President and Fellow, Neustar. \n\u201cFuture proofing mitigation networks to stop attacks before they reach their target destination will save brands billions each year from the impact of DDoS attacks. Neustar\u2019s R&D spend is reflective of the very real need to continually innovate in the face of such adversity and today protects thousands of brands from an increasingly diverse threat landscape. SiteProtect NG is a product that leverages the latest innovations in internet security and evolves to meet existing and future requirements.\u201d \nNeustar is giving clients more control and more functionality to build stronger defenses for their brands against DDoS attacks than ever before. The SiteProtect NG mitigation network combines innovative technologies and advancements from existing Neustar security solutions with powerful data traffic analytics powered by machine learning data analytics. This gives brands in-depth trend and attack analysis, leaving them with invaluable insights, which enable them to make smarter decisions about the configuration of their network security moving forward. \nAbout Neustar Security Solutions Neustar Security Solutions defend against network threats, inform you of potential network vulnerabilities, accelerate online asset performance, and monitor client website performance through multiple services and offerings.

Short for Eximbay Coin , this venture focuses specifically on tourists traveling between Korea, Japan , and China , but has the potential to enhance tourism all over the world.\nEBCoin seeks to address the expensive obstacles that tourists currently face when shopping abroad. Chief among these is consumption taxes. In theory, tourists can recoup the costs of these taxes through refunds, but the complexity and high cost of the refund system means that most travelers regain, at most,  a fraction of the money they lost. Combined with the cost of exchanging currencies, this limits both the number of people who are willing to travel in the first place and the amount that those who do travel are willing to purchase.\nBy providing a decentralized platform for claiming tax refunds, EBCoin allows tourists to recoup most of the money they lose through consumption taxes. Releasing a new coin that can be exchanged for multiple other fiat and digital currencies, along with a decentralized exchange platform, further saves tourists money by reducing the cost of exchanging their money. These efforts should make it substantially easier for Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and other citizens to travel and shop across the globe.\nAddressing the Limits of Tax Refunds \nOne of the most important factors that affects how much tourists spend when visiting other countries is those countries' taxes. Consumption taxes often make up a large portion of national, provincial, and local government budgets. This is particularly true in European countries, where such taxes can account for upwards of 15 percent of the cost of retail goods. While consumption taxes are generally accepted as fair by citizens, who benefit directly from the services that they pay for, they are an unqualified loss to tourists. For this reason, many countries offer foreign visitors refunds on the consumption taxes they pay while in the country.\nWhile refunds have the potential to attract more tourists, in practice, they are of limited effectiveness. This is because the system for reimbursement is so difficult. To claim a refund, tourists must record their purchase histories and present them to customs authorities in airports and other designated locations. But because there are only so many of these locations, this tends to require waiting in long lines. Combined with the complexity of filling out the necessary paperwork and making sure that their refunds are the correct sizes, this leads many tourists not to bother to claim tax refunds. As a result, roughly USD $24 billion in refunds goes unclaimed.\nEven when tourists do claim their refunds, they often do not receive the full value that they deserve. The current system for processing refunds is highly expensive, consuming as much as 30 percent of the total value of tax reimbursements. This makes it less worthwhile for tourists to seek refunds in the first place.\nIn order to simplify refunds and lower administrative fees, EBCoin provides an app where tourists can enter all the relevant information on their own. Users must scan their passports and enter the information into the app; this confirms their identity and their country of citizenship. They can then scan the receipts from different items they buy during the trip, creating a reliable purchase history that can be used to calculate the total amount of consumption taxes they've paid. The platform uses this information to claim the user's refund, which it pays to them in its own digital currency.\nBecause the EBCoin platform is highly decentralized, there are no intermediaries who charge fees for processing refunds. There is also no need for users to stand in line at airports or go through a complicated process of recording and verifying their purchases. More users are thus likely to claim their rightful refunds, and in doing so, they will receive close to the total value of those refunds. This has the potential to put billions of dollars back in the pockets of tourists, giving them an incentive to travel more and make more purchases abroad.\nCurrency Exchange & the Eximbay Coin \nBesides allowing users to claim tax refunds, the EBCoin platform is releasing its own digital currency. These Eximbay coins (EBC) are backed by the Korean payment services firm KRP, which serves more than 6,000 businesses across Japan , China , Korea, and other parts of East and Southeast Asia . Many of these businesses are likely to begin accepting the coins for purchases, allowing tourists to use EBC rather than having to obtain the local currency. The EBCoin platform also allows users to exchange the coins for local currency, their home countries' money, or other national and digital currencies.\nAs with refund processing, EBCoin offers a decentralized means of exchanging its own and other currencies. This eliminates intermediary fees and other currency exchange charges, lowering the cost of traveling and shopping abroad. Releasing its own currency also provides EBCoin users a standard against which to measure the value of other currencies, making it easier for them to make sure they are getting a good deal on exchanges.\nEBCoin plans to create 1.5 billion of these coins, exactly half of which will be issued to the public through token sales. The platform will release 150 million of these coins during a pre-sale in December of 2017, and will then distribute 375 million during an ICO in January of 2018. The coins will initially be pegged at a value of 6,000 EBC for one ETH. This value will likely change as the platform grows in popularity and demand for Eximbay coins increases.\n \nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/taking-care-of-tourists-ebcoin-aims-to-enhance-international-shopping-300567673.html \nSOURCE EBCoin", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ebc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:41.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a55abd8b10dcde2c20ae1afa238ec56e669c970c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ApQiAEWQSsNC4xs9vhPGBK8rlQyLrFaUef2MjqyDK3mvAz1hskLCoE1eXd3l9QU1fFNKB8iBqSg--", "site_full": "www.babycenter.ca", "site": "babycenter.ca", "site_section": "http://www.babycenter.ca/g25018573/december-2017?startIndex=70", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "December 2017 - Page 8 - BabyCenter Canada", "title": "Is this early labour?", "title_full": "Is this early labour? - December 2017 - BabyCenter Canada", "published": "2017-12-03T22:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.babycenter.ca/webassets/countries/en_CA/logo_200x200.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82588, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a55abd8b10dcde2c20ae1afa238ec56e669c970c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ApQiAEWQSsNC4xs9vhPGBK8rlQyLrFaUef2MjqyDK3mvAz1hskLCoE1eXd3l9QU1fFNKB8iBqSg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "OliviaR1988", "published": "2017-12-03T22:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Is this early labour?", "text": "Is this early labour?

Securing more than a dozen awards in 2017 alone the company recently added five Best in Biz awards to the list. Winners are chosen by a panel of editorial thought leaders who evaluate companies' social and economic impact. \nFinancial Finesse's programs, which are delivered as an employee benefit to a fast-growing roster of the nation's largest Fortune 1000 companies, beat out hundreds of firms to become the \"Most Awarded\" company by Best in Biz, passing giants like Ernst & Young and Aflac for innovations in the financial industry. \nAlong with four other awards, the company took home the coveted Gold award for the Most Innovative Product of the Year for its proprietary Behavioral Change Model\u2122. \nThe company's Behavioral Change Model\u2122 is rapidly setting the standard for the financial wellness industry due to its success in both reducing employer bottom line costs and improving employees' financial wellness. It provides employees with unlimited access to personalized financial coaching through a combination of in-person consultations, phone-based coaching, group education, online and mobile services. All services work seamlessly together to deliver the ongoing financial coaching and guidance employees need to achieve their financial goals. Eighty-nine percent of employees who participate in the company's programs make at least three significant changes to their finances within 30 days, with the most common changes being reducing their debt, cutting expenses, and increasing savings for long-term financial goals. \nAccording to Davidson, the Behavioral Change Model\u2122 is at the core of the company's innovation strategy. Nick Lapworth , who heads product development for the firm adds, \"our Behavioral Change Model\u2122 has created a whole new paradigm that puts the employee at the center of the experience and builds a support structure and system of accountability based on the way they manage their financial life.\" \nDavidson says being recognized by Best in Biz is a tremendous honor, crediting her team for their commitment to continual innovation in what is a very rapidly changing market. She adds that Financial Finesse's team is passionate about helping other companies focused on making a significant social impact innovate their products and services. She recognizes that the majority of innovation is driven from small teams with big ideas and a new way of looking at problems. The firm is in the process of developing a series of best practices webinars on innovation and other key business strategies that will launch in January, 2018.

Had thought yesterday\u2019s inept batting collapse was pretty bad news until I read this.\nMy reading s that Beaufort has failed to raise the funds and we have had to run to Peterhouse to keep us afloat.\nThe plan had been to raise this 500k and then another 500k early in the new year and this would have enabled us to achieve full 2shift production and profitability . Now this second funding is clearly unavailable without diluting us all into oblivion. How has it all gone so sour in such a short time.?\nThe boards reliance on Beaufort and a drip by drip approach to funding has always worried me. Beaufort clearly are very poor fundraisers and equally hopeless at managing our PR. They have left us in the sorry position of stumbling at the penultimate fence and in danger of not making the finishing line. The BOD has to take the blame for taking its eye off the share price which this drip drip approach has undermined and ultimately left us languishing with a ridiculously low SP .\nAll is not lost however and we should be capable of raising the required finance through a J/V or asset financing although we shall be negotiating from an unnecessarily weak position. At least we will not face any more equity raising\nSo when i get back I shall buying in again at this low low price but i would like to hear some more positive news from the board about asset disposals elsewhere PDQ.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:41.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6c5f4b5c4ae64183614d664bad9b8391b580019c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTkYS739gSaUobAEW.tUrFNNiZKVOWtM6k6KpMFC8AtXHzIXhSeD9FzSOc3b3NwdxRIa9Kxmy.G7II2YdNHw0LK3Sx3Y6zWGF12ix6.ZQl3Sj6kMYL6FQjbAfds45wd9fzUER6VzAzII0bZIhIW9ec937GmBtDC6h6hAhicZIvM8G38BwDGZTfai2hsrglrVU5i3GwUFTG00TN1YOrlzvnZR1YGaXzMD7RsDEX.JI5CazBYiNdaKC4Z.93NHcBdPh8p4Rx5ALhuaeyzPTcSHvGE5Z1Xj_oTiHnR_GnlNVwQI0tJ8j3Tv6q2", "site_full": "steelasophicaluk.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://steelasophicaluk.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Excited to see @BoxTreeEvents renewing with us today Have you seen the Michelin starred Box Tree Restaurant?

but this now needs to be considered a great buy in/top up opportunity.\nYou must not forget this was 2p only 3 months ago and the share price rose from 0.8p to 2p in a month (from beginning to end of August) which does show this has the potential to move and gain momentum quite quickly, this was on the back of the placing shares being soaked up over a few weeks, then the strategic tranche buyer stepped in (who I feel will enter the frame here in 1 shape or another). It could be deja vu.\nIm no ramper but this could honestly be the most undervalued play on AIM at present on a fundamental asset valuation basis and has the potential to multi bag over the next few months.\nYou must not forget we nearly sold Mankayan for $70m a few years ago, with 4.3 million ounces of gold and 1.3 million tonnes of copper which is Jorc compliant - now with Gina ousted the Philippines is far more mining friendly - if you would have asked me a year ago if I thought Mankayan would be sold, I would have said no. Things have changed and there is significant interest in the project at present, if a price of, lets say $10m was achieved in cash it would be a great result and would instantly transform the company. That transaction would make it the cheapest per ounce Copper/Gold porphory acquisition worldwide.\nNow looking at Eureka there are world class copper grades of over 1% in Argentina with some gold credits, which on the back of strong copper prices would easily be worth $4-5 million cash. We have spent around $6m on acquisition and exploration ourselves.\nLooking at Choco a lot has been achieved in the past 12 months with the independent scoping study, option payment, mining camp, processing plant, infrastructure, secondary plant, verified grade to bedrock. This has substantially de-risked the project for an in country partner, we have done the hard work in providing this model works and the grades are economical. It's simply a matter of time now before we get that partner to fund us.\nNow you're telling me a \u00a32m valuation for BZT is fair?! This has just been an unfortunate series of events which meant we cant commit to the ramp up ourselves and so are doing the right thing in halting the project, conserving the cash, look to get the sales/JV deals done for Eureka & Mankayan then move forward with securing that partner.\nThere is no point thinking in hindsight regarding raising money when the SP was at 2p in September, which I agree should have been done but thats life!\nThis situation does remind me of JOG's drilling of a duster a few months ago, then the subsequent crash then the new drilling that made the discovery shortly after.

(EDI), a global leader in advanced high-efficiency zero emissions plug-in hybrid and electric drivetrain solutions today announced the integration of the EDI PowerDrive\u2122 6000 and EDI PowerSuite\u2122 vehicle control software into three 12-meter Foton buses. The company also set a new record for most mileage driven with its EDI PowerDrive\u2122 6000 system, hitting over 3.1 million miles traveled since 2015. \nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171207005423/en/ \nThe recent integration of the EDI PowerDrive\u2122 6000 system and EDI PowerSuite\u2122 vehicle control software into the Foton platform represents the sixth major bus OEM integration of Efficient Drivetrains\u2019 technology in China. The EDI PowerDrive 6000 was certified by the government in 2015 after undergoing significant durability testing, and the current fleet of 120 buses continues to demonstrate strong reliability and performance overall. Recently OEMs that have integrated EDI technology have reported more than 40% savings in fuel expenses, significantly reduced emissions for the community, and ROI in under 3 years. \nThe new fleet of Foton buses was a result of the successful deployment of 38 transit buses running in Tianshui city. The fleet operator experienced significantly improved fuel economy, reduced emissions, and ease of operations for their bus drivers. In partnership with EDI\u2019s local integration and support partner, ENCA, EDI was able to quickly deploy its technology onto the new OEM platform. Foton will also be evaluating the drivetrain system for integration into future production quantity programs. \nAdoption of plug-in hybrid and electric buses continues to see tremendous growth in the Asia Pacific region, with China leading the charge. In 2016, the country procured over 115,000 electrified buses, with projection of future sales to account for more than 20% of new bus sales over the next three years. To continue the strong trend, local cities and governing bodies are mandating emissions reductions, and offering financial subsidies to expedite adoption of e-buses. OEMs adopting buses with EDI\u2019s electrification technology are able to rapidly bring electrified solutions to market, while taking advantage of the available government funding programs. \nNews Highlights: \nThe EDI PowerDrive\u2122 has surpassed over 3.1 million miles in a commercial fleet setting of city buses deployed in rural and city routes across China and Taiwan Efficient Drivetrains has added to its available OEM platforms in China with the integration of the EDI PowerDrive\u2122 6000 drivetrain and EDI PowerSuite\u2122 Vehicle Control software into the Foton buses The company currently has over 120 models of 8, 10.5, and 12 meter buses operating across Asia on major OEM platforms including Ankai, Shaanxi, Xiamen Jinlong, Yaxing Motor Coach, Master Transportation, and now Foton Efficient Drivetrains has long standing history in electrification of buses, with active programs running in Asia and North America, featuring its EDI PowerDrive\u2122 6000 and EDI PowerDrive\u2122 7000 series of drivetrain systems and EDI PowerSuite\u2122 vehicle control software The EDI PowerDrive\u2122 system received China government certification after undergoing durability testing in late 2015 OEMs implementing technology from Efficient Drivetrains are able to quickly bring electrified vehicle solutions to market, while offering performance that meets or exceeds that of the traditional vehicle with the added benefits of reduced emissions and fuel consumption Fleet operators adopting electrified buses benefit from zero-emissions driving, clean-air for the surrounding community, and significantly reduced fuel and maintenance costs Supporting Quotes: \n\u201cElectric bus adoption continues to grow exponentially in China.
