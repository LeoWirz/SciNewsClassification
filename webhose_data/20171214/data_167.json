UK.gov Data Protection Bill additions \u2018risk undermining ICO\u2019", "text": "in General The UK\u2019s data protection watchdog has raised concerns with the government over new clauses slipped into the Data Protection Bill at the last minute, which critics say could undermine the law.The clauses, inserted at the Bill's final committee stage in the House of Lords last month, are likely to receive heavy scrutiny at next week\u2019s report stage. Plans - Secretary - State - Document - Framework They set out plans to allow the secretary of state to draw up a document - a Framework for Data Processing for Government - with guidance for how their department can process personal data.However, some of the provisions in the new clauses (175-178; PDF, p99-101) have sounded alarm bells, with opponents saying they risk undermining the powers of the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. Concerns - Bill - Secretary - State - Powers Concerns are that, as it stands, the Bill grants the secretary of state broad powers to determine the content of the framework and who it applies to, while making it hard for the ICO to either challenge that content or even enforce data protection law.Campaign group MedConfidential argued that the clauses \u201clegalise government using data for anything it wishes\u201d, saying that the secretary of state has the power to define and alter the framework with ease. Framework - Epitome - Sam - Smith - Coordinator \"This framework is the epitome of secretive, invasive, and nasty,\u201d Sam Smith, coordinator of MedConfidential, said. \u201cThe decision to include it undermines public confidence in data, it undermines the ICO, it undermines the rule of law.\u201dData protection expert Chris Pounder raised similar concerns, describing it as \u201ca framework to undermine the ICO\u2019s ability to enforce the new Data Protection Bill across the public sector\u201d. Register - Concerns - Ministry - Fun - Government When The Register put such concerns to the Ministry of Fun, it said the government had consulted the ICO about the preparation of the new clauses.However, the ICO said that, although it \"recognises the need to clarify the legal basis for data processing in government...   www.theregister.co.uk 1  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris pounder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam - smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam smith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "house of lords", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "information commissioner\u2019s office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of fun", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:44.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89baecef48050a3f8f264eb2c807e05a6d2b3881", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8W1YmK76haHHcsQAqiFFUlPxKkEF2AQq.t2IVAIQ2QEeE5IX7CCFHz", "site_full": "www.ptab.us", "site": "ptab.us", "site_section": "http://www.ptab.us/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "PTAB.US", "title": "plantronics", "title_full": "plantronics", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89baecef48050a3f8f264eb2c807e05a6d2b3881", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8W1YmK76haHHcsQAqiFFUlPxKkEF2AQq.t2IVAIQ2QEeE5IX7CCFHz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "James Long (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "plantronics", "text": "2469 Ex Parte Bontu et al 13627647 - (D) HOMERE 103 Fish & Richardson P.C.

In October, the academy broke with tradition and made Harvey Weinstein just the second person ever expelled from the Oscars' governing body. \nThe new code of conduct stipulates that the academy is no place for \"people who abuse their status, power or influence in a manner that violates standards of decency.\" \nThe academy's board may now suspend or expel those who violate the code of conduct or who \"compromise the integrity\" of the academy. \nThe standards of conduct were drafted by a task force launched by the academy in October. It was formed after Weinstein was accused by dozens of women of sexual harassment and abuse. Weinstein, who won an Academy Award for \"Shakespeare in Love,\" has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. \nHudson told members that more details on the process by which offending members will be judged will be announced later. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

For Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\" the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \"Today, I am delivering.\" Those were words to savor for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed - sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns. Repealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump's frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. The president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. On Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. Steve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. Observers were divided on how to score the president's action. \"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" But Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" A host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. But after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. An email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" Critics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. Aaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" Trump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" The president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. During a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" Trump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "catherine lucey associated", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:46.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b9f8d48127e21032f12e4a6faebb928b82d021bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR.UoNypw7foWzlqJ3JrN93goJpDC_aUaM19PVVKusgFx8pUFt1cDjDyS7MenG44jAqYRgsdDyMEYQjJpNO4YAJ", "site_full": "huntinglife.com", "site": "huntinglife.com", "site_section": "http://huntinglife.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "Hunting and Conservation News", "title": "Preliminary deer harvest higher than last year", "title_full": "Preliminary deer harvest higher than last year", "published": "2017-12-07T11:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://omgeni.us/hlife/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/HL-Logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b9f8d48127e21032f12e4a6faebb928b82d021bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR.UoNypw7foWzlqJ3JrN93goJpDC_aUaM19PVVKusgFx8pUFt1cDjDyS7MenG44jAqYRgsdDyMEYQjJpNO4YAJ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HLNews", "published": "2017-12-07T11:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Preliminary deer harvest higher than last year", "text": "  \nLINCOLN, Neb. \u2013 Preliminary deer harvest in Nebraska is 3 percent ahead of last year\u2019s pace.

The average age of bucks declined slightly, with 33 percent of whitetail bucks estimated at age 3 or older. \nBiologists also collected lymph nodes for chronic wasting disease (CWD) testing from more than 1,200 deer in Panhandle and southwest units. Results should be available by the end of December. Game and Parks will only notify a hunter if his or her deer tested positive for CWD. \nArchery and muzzleloader seasons close Dec. 31. The late antlerless season ends Jan. 15. \nHunters are reminded that mule deer does are protected in many management units and public lands across the state. Refer to the 2017 Big Game Guide for details. \nHunters who wish to donate venison can use the Hunters Helping the Hungry and Deer Exchange programs. Go to OutdoorNebraska.org for more details.

As someone who was invested in Trials of Osiris and the Osiris lore in Destiny 1, it sucks to see an in-game character who is a reflection of myself, treated like a joke and played for laughs.\nReddit phrases it better than I can. Spoilered for length. I'm just bummed how poorly CoO handled my favorite lore.\nIt's so stupid. Like, I don't even give a shit about brother vance, but like.\nDon't make a shitty character to then have jokes about the shitty character. Especially don't make it a shitty character who I then have to interact with.\nMake Brother Vance a serious guy who is warning us about danger, and how we need to find Osiris. Have Osiris be a mysterious character who doesn't say much, but leaves lots of writings for us to follow.\nWho the fuck wrote this expansion? Who had the idea to do the story this way?\nDon't take a shit on your own lore and expect people to think its cool. When you set up Osiris as like this awesome, mysterious character, and then set up the people who care about him to be internet fanboys, all you're doing is making fun of the people who PLAY YOUR FUCKING GAME The dumping on Brother Vance actually really got to me during my story playthrough. I play a warlock and I get waaaay into the warlock lore. I imagined meeting Osiris would be right up there with finding Toland and an Ahamkara as \"this will be so cool, omfg\" best moments ever.\nWhen I started the first mission, I equipped my Vigilance Wing (with Book of the Dead ornament!) in honor of the warlock badass I was about to meet. I looked at the lore Quote: on the gun detail page: \"You may not know the legend of Osiris or ever dared our trials, but should we call on you, will you honor the heralds who earned this weapon's honor and continue the hunt?\u201d Hell yes, I'm ready to answer the call, mysterious cultist dude!\nAnd then the reveal: we find out that Vance is just some guy who basically doodles \"Vance + Osiris 4 eva\" on his trapper keeper. Hmm. That doesn't seem quite as cool.\nAnd I look down at the gun I'm carrying and the excitement I felt and I was pretty embarrassed for my own character. As Brother Vance was played off for laughs, all I kept thinking was \"that's someone like me we're all meant to laugh at. Someone who gets way too into it, who believes in these stories way too much.\"\nI quietly put Vigilance Wing away and went back to using Origin Story out for the rest of the missions , which is the gun I use for almost everything and doesn't really have a story of its own, despite its name. And I felt bad for letting myself get so excited about all of this.\nIt's quite a feat of writing, I think, to create a powerful reaction like that. But not in a good way.\nThe line \"I felt bad for letting myself get so excited about all of this\" is apropos for the whole of Destiny 2 right now.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/404/nTSXU56BPPCK3.jpg", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/046/nYUDKMXPCM88M.jpg", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/520/nJJQ5542JXEW9.jpg", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/634/n3VD6XP7M394D.gif", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/824/nTR9G47BE728X.jpg", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/543/nC2D6UPBRKBEL.jpg", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/933/nAAUR1KBGY5IA.jpg", "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7hwq4g/how_did_brother_vance_go_from_mystical_follower/", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/707/nH18SE7B7X35K.png"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:46.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fdaa058b39ac3cb04c7cfe0099335f997a15390f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je_JfKdOeWt_pyyZepXde7qbKgcNjeIlguflyG8eVd_F8E0JoeRtm2iEEgTm48boHWFxAbYE0Pe5IqjpT5hXFRQsI4Q7VlTKqnpIjK3uj8NkVKU_1JReslp.9xMNhGIk8RusJHia7_kOQ--", "site_full": "copenhaverconstructioninc.com", "site": "copenhaverconstructioninc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Universal Garage Door Opener with Homelink | Ford How-To | Ford - Copenhaver Construction Inc", "title_full": "Universal Garage Door Opener with Homelink | Ford How-To | Ford - Copenhaver Construction Inc", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.41, "main_image": "http://copenhaverconstructioninc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/universal-garage-door-opener-with-homelink-ford-how-to-ford.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fdaa058b39ac3cb04c7cfe0099335f997a15390f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je_JfKdOeWt_pyyZepXde7qbKgcNjeIlguflyG8eVd_F8E0JoeRtm2iEEgTm48boHWFxAbYE0Pe5IqjpT5hXFRQsI4Q7VlTKqnpIjK3uj8NkVKU_1JReslp.9xMNhGIk8RusJHia7_kOQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cci.Concrete Hotmail.Com", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Universal Garage Door Opener with Homelink | Ford How-To | Ford - Copenhaver Construction Inc", "text": "Next Post Next 10 Cheapest Pickup Trucks in the world 2016/2017.

By ERIC OLSON - 12/7/17 2:48 AM \nHardcore college football fans across the country undoubtedly will be tuned in for the College Football Playoff. But what about casual fans outside SEC, ACC and Big 12 country? \nWith the Pac-12 and Big Ten not represented in the four-team playoff, a TV sports viewership analyst said interest could be tempered on the West Coast, upper Midwest and Northeast. \nThe campuses of Clemson, Georgia and Alabama are in close proximity in the Southeast \u2014 Clemson and Georgia are just 75 miles apart. Oklahoma is the outlier, a good day\u2019s drive west of Alabama. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s too regional this year,\u201d said Jon Lewis, editor of Sports Media Watch. \u201cThat hurts in every sport \u2014 unless it\u2019s the Super Bowl.\u201d \nThat said, Lewis expects a potential loss of viewership could be offset because the semifinals will be played on New Year\u2019s Day, the traditional college football holiday. The last two years the semifinals were on New Year\u2019s Eve, when the games competed with parties and other celebrations. \nAn additional boost might come from the Alabama-Clemson semifinal in the Sugar Bowl being a rematch of the last two national championship games. \nBut, Lewis said, \u201cI still think the numbers are going to be well short of the first year of the playoff.\u201d \nIn 2015, the inaugural playoff semifinals matching Oregon-Florida State and Ohio State-Alabama each drew better than 28 million viewers on ESPN, according to the Nielsen company. The Oregon-Ohio State title game had 33.4 million. \nViewership the last two years ranged from 15.5 million to 19.8 million for the New Year\u2019s Eve semifinals, and the Clemson-Alabama title games drew 26.7 million in 2016 and 26 million in 2017. \nLos Angeles sports radio host Petros Papadakis acknowledged the regional flavor of the playoff \u2014 \u201cI hope Oklahoma can at least strike a blow for the people west of the Mississippi,\u201d he joked \u2014 but said he didn\u2019t think it would put a damper on fans\u2019 enthusiasm nationally. \n\u201cCall me crazy, but I think we\u2019ve reached a point in our society where football fans put football on,\u201d Papadakis said. \u201cIf there is live football and it\u2019s a big game that\u2019s on, people are watching. \u2026 I really do feel like the College Football Playoff is transcendent like the Super Bowl, where people are just going to watch because it\u2019s championship-level football.\u201d \nStill, Lewis said it can\u2019t be overlooked that much of the nation is left with no rooting interest. He noted the Big Ten and Pac-12 have larger geographic footprints (never mind the Big 12\u2019s eastern outpost of West Virginia) and there is some overlap between the SEC and ACC. \n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have the SEC represented. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s good to have two SEC teams represented,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cAnd when you talk about the conferences, the Big 12, ACC and SEC are very similar in terms of their makeup, in terms of their regions. You don\u2019t want it to be too regional.\u201d \nAn interesting test will be the Rose Bowl, where the traditional Big Ten-Pac-12 matchup gives way to the playoff semifinal between Oklahoma and Georgia. \nPapadakis said the Rose Bowl obviously would have more local interest if Southern California or UCLA were participating, but the fact the game is a playoff makes it intriguing. \n\u201cThe key for the Rose Bowl is that they\u2019re big, blue-blooded traditional college football programs,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s a big blue blood, people will come out to Los Angeles and the game will feel big. There are so many transplants in LA, and I would argue there are more Georgia and Oklahoma people in this town than Oregon people who would come to the game.\u201d \nBrandon Heideman, who bartends at The Lodge Sports Grille in Seattle, said there was standing-room only at his establishment last year when the hometown Washington Huskies were in the playoff. The absence of a Pac-12 team in this year\u2019s playoff, let alone the Huskies, probably will temper enthusiasm. \n\u201cAs long as someone in the Pac-12 is playing in a game, we\u2019re very busy,\u201d Heideman said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have more people than usual in here for the playoff, but it won\u2019t be like it was last year.\u201d \nAli Jones, a bartender at Bunkers Sports Bar and Grill in Dayton, Ohio, said she and her patrons are disappointed Ohio State didn\u2019t make the final four. Still, she expects a full house for the semifinals and the Jan. 8 final and that folks probably will be pulling for Oklahoma, which beat the Buckeyes in the regular season. \nWhat about Alabama, the team that edged out the Buckeyes for a playoff spot? \n\u201cWe won\u2019t be rolling any Tides over here,\u201d Jones said. \nMore AP college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 TAGS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric olson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "papadakis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heideman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ali jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petros papadakis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandon heideman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cfp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bunkers sports bar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "college football playoff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the lodge sports grille", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buckeyes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huskies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington huskies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose bowl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dayton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "midwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state-alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:47.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5fbc6f3f826daed92da2b8d960b60a4b29189eb7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6m5_DJ5Wv6RdXp9Qi0xfHiKw0L.4vQqDpuU6KK_G12BU9QYHXkyh.yD1WUIvieWurDqGlgVm_MmHkrCWNJkejgiiP3r.1PPxrEq_JS2fPB08QFl7AHAc0ve90coaGx8ldqR5cUfCr_6HgzobUsccbQcxK7Em2BOI-", "site_full": "www.longroom.com", "site": "longroom.com", "site_section": "https://longroom.com/discussions/feed.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Long Room", "title": "BREAKING: HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS VOTE OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST IMPEACHMENT", "title_full": "BREAKING: HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS VOTE OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST IMPEACHMENT", "published": "2017-12-07T11:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://spartamain-nmdkn3u1w3nph91q.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Impeachment.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5fbc6f3f826daed92da2b8d960b60a4b29189eb7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6m5_DJ5Wv6RdXp9Qi0xfHiKw0L.4vQqDpuU6KK_G12BU9QYHXkyh.yD1WUIvieWurDqGlgVm_MmHkrCWNJkejgiiP3r.1PPxrEq_JS2fPB08QFl7AHAc0ve90coaGx8ldqR5cUfCr_6HgzobUsccbQcxK7Em2BOI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kaliela101", "published": "2017-12-07T11:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "BREAKING: HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS VOTE OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST IMPEACHMENT", "text": "The tally is 364 to 58, with four voting present.

The partnership leverages the unique features of 3D at Depth\u2019s subsea LiDAR data and the power of iQ3\u2019s innovative augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) platform to transform the value of offshore survey data. \u201cPowered by iQ3\u2019s\u201d cloud-based software platform, customers can access 3D at Depth\u2019s subsea LiDAR data through a secure, optimized web-based portal. The technology creates an immersive VR environment with true 1-to-1 3D scale models generated using repeatable, millimetric subsea LiDAR data inputs. Using a laptop, desktop or smart device geographically dispersed teams can collaborate within a single VR session and be present in the same scene. \niQ3Connect\u2019s underlying technology runs from a computer-aided design (CAD) based platform allowing simulation of structures overlaid with subsea infrastructure. The ability to explore and experience 3D content as if you were actually onsite with a digital representation of physical assets or the surrounding environment creates a seamless workflow environment from reality capture to virtual immersion. Subsea LiDAR 3D data can be viewed and discussed with minimal changes to current installed geographic information systems (GIS) or big data hosting platforms.

It changes the definition of marriage from solely between a man and a woman to \"a union of two people\" excluding all others. The legislation passed with a majority that wasn't challenged, although four lawmakers registered their opposition. \n\"What a day. What a day for love, for equality, for respect. Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told Parliament. \nThe Senate passed the same legislation last week 43 votes to 12. The government later announced that same-sex couples will be able to apply to marry starting Saturday, with the first weddings potentially from Jan. 6. \nChampagne and tears flowed in the halls of Parliament House as gay celebrities including Olympic champion swimmer Ian Thorpe and actress Magda Szubanski hugged lawmakers and ordinary folk in a party atmosphere. \n\"What an amazing day, I'm a little bit delirious, it's extraordinary,\" said Szubanski, who sat in the public gallery during Thursday's daylong debate. \nThorpe thanked \"our straight brothers and sisters\" for strongly backing marriage equality in the two-month postal survey. \n\"Quite literally without them voting for us, this would never have happened,\" Thorpe said. \n\"It means that we've created an Australia that is more equitable, it's more fair, it's more just,\" he added. \nJanet Rice, a minor Greens party senator, hugged and kissed her transgender wife of 31 years, Penny Whetton, after the decision. They have been allowed to remain married because Whetton is listed as male on her birth certificate. \n\"I'm overwhelmed,\" Rice said. \"It' been such a huge thing that we've been living with for so, so long and we've finally achieved equality.\" \nAmendments meant to safeguard freedoms of speech and religion for gay-marriage opponents were all rejected, though those issues may be considered later. The government has appointed a panel to examine how to safeguard religious freedoms once gay marriage is a reality in Australia. \nLawmakers advocating marriage equality had argued that the national postal survey in November mandated a change of the marriage definition alone, so changing the law should not be delayed by other considerations. \nGay marriage was endorsed by 62 percent of voters who responded to the postal ballot. \n\"It is now our job as members of Parliament to pass a fair bill that does not extend or create any new discriminations,\" an emotional government lawmaker Warren Entsch, who helped draft the bill, told Parliament. \"It is a strong bill that already strikes the right balance between equality and freedom of religion.\" \nMost gay rights advocates believed the government should have allowed marriages years ago and saw various ideas for a public survey as a delaying tactic. The U.N. Human Rights Committee had called the ballot survey \"an unnecessary and divisive public opinion poll.\" \nThe current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from anti-discrimination laws. \nOne of the rejected amendments would have ensured Australians could speak freely about their traditional views of marriage without fear of legal action. It was proposed by Attorney-General George Brandis and supported by Turnbull, both gay marriage supporters. \nFormer Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a high-profile advocate of traditional marriage, told Parliament that Turnbull and opposition leader Bill Shorten had failed to deliver detailed protections for freedoms of speech, conscience and religion in the bill. \n\"A promise was made by the leaders of this Parliament and the promise has not adequately been delivered on,\" Abbott said. \nAbbott pointed to an Australian teenager who lost her job for advocating against gay marriage on social media and an Australian Catholic bishop who was taken before a state anti-discrimination tribunal over a pamphlet he published extolling traditional marriage. The complaint against the bishop was dropped. \n\"The last thing we should want to do is to subject Australians to new forms of discrimination in place of old ones that are rightly gone,\" he said. \nGovernment lawmaker Trevor Evans ruled out an Australian equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court case in which a baker who refused to provide a wedding cake for a gay couple argued he was exercising artistic freedom and was exempt from Colorado anti-discrimination laws. \n\"Let's be honest here, for a case like that to arise in Australia, it would require a gay couple who care more about activism than about the success of their own wedding, to find a business operator who cares more about religious doctrine than the commercial success of their own small business, and for both of them to commit to having a fight,\" Evans told Parliament. \n\"Typical Australians would genuinely question the bona fides of the players in a case like that and the slim prospect of that occurring doesn't warrant the pages and pages of commentary and debate that have been dedicated to it,\" he added. \nSeveral gay marriage opponents in Turnbull's conservative coalition have regarded marriage equality as inevitable and have welcomed an end to an issue that has long divided the government ranks. \nThe result is a political win for Turnbull, who became prime minister after deposing Abbott in 2015 in an internal government leadership ballot. \nAbbott was head-butted by a gay rights advocate during the postal survey campaign in September. Kevin Rudd, a center-left Labor Party prime minister whom Abbott defeated in elections in 2013, blamed the postal ballot for an assault on his 19-year-old godson as he campaigned for marriage equality a week earlier. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show that four, not five, lawmakers voted \"no.\" Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The reality is that is not easy for Gaga to have hits. You might say that me saying this sounds crazy considering the fact that at this point she has had many hits, but she is the exception and not the rule. And those hits never came all that easy. Gaga naturally gravitates towards the abstract, the weird, the different, and the artistic side of music. Meanwhile the GP gravitates towards the simple, generic, and trendy side of music. In other words, Gaga's musical experiments and her need to provide something new every era is constantly clashing with what is trendy with the GP. When she released TF/TFM they said that her music was to dancy or electronic for radio. When she released Born This Way people said that she was too weird, gay, and pretentious. When she released ARTPOP people said that she was to artsy and crazy. When she released Joanne people said that she was too country and too simple. The point is that she is not afraid to \"flop\" and take risks. She always follows her own direction and hopes that the fans and the GP are on board.

From articulated knees and elbows to adjustable waistbands and inseams, this gear is made to go the distance.

GWG\u00ae invites you to explore the 5 sub collections of our new Fall 2017 Mossy Oak\u00ae Break-Up Country\u00ae hunting line below: \nThe Artemis Midweight Collection features a durable water repellent Poly Span exterior and a high pile, minky soft fleece interior for added warmth. Artemis is breathable, highly waterproof and windproof; it knows no boundaries. A redesigned fit provides 4-way stretch and articulated joints (knees and hips) for a second-skin feel that moves with your body. Artemis features zippered accessory pockets, an asymmetrical design, and GWG\u00ae\u2019s signature adjustable waistband tabs and inseam snaps. The Artemis Midweight 3 Layer Softshell Collection is available in a jacket, a vest, and a pant. \nThe Kilima Reversible Puff Jacket is a redesign of the GWG\u00ae customer favorite reversible puff jacket from Fall 2016. The outer shell fabric has been refinished with Cire, giving the exterior a high sheen, protective coating. The interior has been upgraded with 80 grams of Primaloft Silver HI-LOFT, a high warmth-to-weigh ratio, water resistant insulation originally developed for the U.S. Army. This jacket is reversible from Mossy Oak\u00ae Break-Up Country\u00ae camo to gun metal grey and packable in its attached storage bag. Perfect as an outer layer or a layering piece. \nThe Aoraki Lightweight Pant is similar in fit and finish to her midweight sister Artemis, minus the high pile, minky soft interior, making Aoraki the perfect early season, warm weather hunting pant. Aoraki features a durable water repellent Poly Span breathable exterior. A redesigned fit provides 4-way stretch and articulated joints (knees and hips) for a second-skin feel that moves with your body. Aoraki features zippered accessory pockets, an asymmetrical design, and GWG\u00ae\u2019s signature adjustable waistband tabs and inseam snaps. \nThe Stalker Collection helps you build a stronger foundation so you can know no boundaries.

The Stalker Base Layer Collection is available in a 1/4 zip long sleeve, a short sleeve tee, and a pant. \nThe Ayton Jacket is an innovative, highly water resistant fleece jacket, designed as a compliment to the Fall 2017 Mossy Oak\u00ae Break-Up Country\u00ae Collection from GWG\u00ae. Ayton is a hoodless, semi-relaxed fit jacket, perfect for those mid-season hunts. With its water and wind resistant bonded 3 layer fleece shell, the Ayton can protect you from the elements without compromising on warmth or movement.

You can do things in Skywars that are not related to PvP. Though people brainwashing others, that to play SKyawrs you need to PvP good. You don't need to PvP good, it is just something I want to mention. Click to expand... True it really doesn't matter. Look at my stats. It's terrible I don't even have a positive k/d /) yet I can consider myself decent to good at just general Rod pvp. Obviously you can do things in skywars that are not related to pvp such as trapping. But that won't get you much kills nor will it give you much wins.\nIdk where I'm going with this but yes there is more to skywars than pvp but, skywars is still pvp. You're fighting people with swords and rods so being good does matter (if that made any sense). You have to pvp well to win more games of skywars because the majority of players use rods and speed and stuff like that and to deal with those kinds of people, you have to be good yourself.

Maize gone up to N360.000.00 per ton from the price of N27.000.00   and because of this we have no option than to seek for import so as to rescue PAN members. The measure is temporary, and we will not go back to importation\u201d said PAN President. \nHe therefore pledged that PAN would work together with MAAN to ensure off take of maize production for feeds so as to encourage farmers into more accelerated cultivations that would meet the local needs and even export. \nFurther findings revealed that outbreak of various diseases, climate change challenges, inadequate capital and finance, poultry processing, storage facility and the increasing nature of poultry feeds jointly hinder the progress of poultry production in Nigeria. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "richard olafare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibrahim mam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olafare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ezekiel ibrahim mam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "poultry association of nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seeds producers association of nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:50.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c45f55d36b2cc04a0b8a7a59ed3afae61a25481b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFePNUbmeEBNU4Xmnobd0Ysp8pXsAkw5ACNnBHGjj.sUES4Klgb0Dm0zXst9TF3y7B1V_eUQA2Rq1e9P.552BO.UNwuk4H7s6aGVBInvrcycb8WWk7v55oTPQ66qmTracgpG0vs_tO_SIVCFCfmJFKsNsGwK7E07itl", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/shop-tv-video/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Video and TV with Best Price and Deals in Malaysia - Lazada", "title": "(EXCLUSIVE) Google Chromecast 2 HDMI Streaming \u2013 TVDongle(Genuine/1Year Warranty)", "title_full": "(EXCLUSIVE) Google Chromecast 2 HDMI Streaming \u2013 TVDongle(Genuine/1Year Warranty) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2000-12-31T18:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 263, "participants_count": 227, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6410cf52d665204ef7ee3fc0dd0545832ccc88d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFePNUbmeEBNU4Xmnobd0Ysp8pXsAkw5ACNnBHGjj.sUES4Klgb0Dm0zXst9TF3y7B1V_eUQA2Rq1e9P.552BO.UNwuk4H7s6aGVBInvrcycb8WWk7v55oTPQ66qmTracgpG0vs_tO_SIVCFCfmJFKsNvYukSb63sdLcDJis6wJJSc-", "ord_in_thread": 250, "author": "Lazada Customer", "published": "2017-12-01T08:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "Fast delivery, easy set up", "text": "Good product.

There is no advantage to having multiples of the same class except if you're particularly mental,about completing the exotic and Armor sets for one class and one class only.
