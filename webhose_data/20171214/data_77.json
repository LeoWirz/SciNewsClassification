I like to start the day with darker colors and work into the lighter colors as the sun gets higher. My personal choice is still Hookup Baits. Even though it seems like everyone is using them these days, they still out perform swimbaits for me.\nGood luck and let us know how it goes! Hey man, thanks alot. Lots of great info!!

Jordan McPherson/SEC Country Ryan Young Posted 6 hours ago \nGAINESVILLE, Fla. \u2014 Through the first six games of the season, Florida showed what it can look like when all of its offensive weapons are clicking. \nThe last two games, the Gators showed what happens when they aren\u2019t \u2014 and coach Mike White is hoping the players take a hard lesson from that. \nNo. 5 Florida trailed by as many as 13 points and trailed most of the game in general against Loyola-Chicago on Wednesday night on the way to a 65-59 loss inside Exactech Arena at the O\u2019Connell Center. \nTwo nights after a humbling 83-66 home loss to Florida State that left White searching for answers in his postgame comments, the Gators (5-3) delivered another ice-cold offensive performance while shooting 36.9 percent from the field and only 2 of 19 from 3-point range. \nThe Gators didn\u2019t have a single player score in double figures. Jalen Hudson (3 of 11 from the field, 0-5 on 3s) and Chris Chiozza finished with 9 points each, KeVaughn Allen (3-of-11, 1-5 from 3) and Keith Stone scored 8 and Egor Koulechov (3-of-13, 0-3 from 3) and Deaundrae Ballard scored 7 each. \nThe Gators have shot a miserable 18 percent from 3-point range (8 of 44) in the last two games, and including a hard-fought loss to No. 1 Duke on Nov. 26 they have now dropped three in a row overall after shooting up the rankings with their high-scoring 5-0 start. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can get any lower than this,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re out of the rankings. I mean, none of that even matters, but this is as low as we can get. We\u2019ve got to completely change everything that we\u2019re doing and go back to the basics.\u201d \nWhite is hoping that sentiment has sunk in throughout the team after these last two games, going from nearly beating the top-ranked team in the country to taking back-to-back defeats to a pair of unranked opponents. \u201cWe\u2019re a team that has been told for about two months how good they are. It\u2019s been at an all-time high in the past 10 days, so hopefully we\u2019ve been humbled a little bit,\u201d White said, harping on the Gators\u2019 defensive struggles. \u201cWe can not shoot our way into being an elite team. It\u2019s not going to happen. Hopefully our guys know why now. You have to learn how to win games when you\u2019re not making shots at a high level. And this group has zero buy-in with that aspect. Hopefully more buy-in now. Hopefully it will start improving, not that I wish for a loss ever.\u201d \nLoyola-Chicago (9-1), out of the Missouri Valley Conference, peaked its lead at 13 points midway through the first half before the Gators cut the deficit to just 1 in the final minute before halftime on a steal and basket by Allen. \nThe hosts then took a 39-38 lead early in the second half when the visiting Ramblers sailed an inbounds pass too far, Kevarrius Hayes intercepted it at midcourt and took it the rest of the way for a go-ahead dunk. \nBut it was short-lived as Loyola-Chicago regained the lead on its ensuing possession and got up by as much as 8 points from there. \nFlorida cut its deficit to 61-59 with 1:28 remaining on a steal and driving basket from Chiozza. After Loyola-Chicago missed on the other end, the crowd came alive as Florida had a chance to tie or take the lead, but Hudson missed a corner 3. \nAggressive help defense by Chiozza forced a tie up and a jump ball, with the alternating possession giving it back to the Gators with 35.6 seconds left. Allen missed a layup and Hayes appeared to tip in the tying basket with 22.2 seconds on the clock, but it was waived off as the referee ruled he interfered with the ball while it was still in the cylinder. \nCameron Satterwhite hit two free throws at the other end to push the Ramblers\u2019 lead to 63-59 with 15.9 to go and that was the beginning of the end. \nChiozza missed a layup, Florida retained possession, Hudson missed a corner 3 and Koulechov missed a shot under the basket to end the comeback hopes. \nWhite said he didn\u2019t want to use the word \u201cembarrassing,\u201d but he threw it out there nonetheless. Hudson, meanwhile, didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI can\u2019t put a word on it. It\u2019s pretty embarrassing. You know what I mean, so embarrassing,\u201d he said. \nAundre Jackson led Loyola-Chicago with 23 points on 10-of-12 shooting as the Ramblers shot 52 percent overall as a team, taking advantage of open 3s and other defensive lapses. \nWhile Florida came in ranked second in the country in scoring at 94.7 points per game and again fell way below the standard it set through the first six games, it was the defensive struggles that frustrated White the most. \u201cIt\u2019s just not our strength right now. Physicality, sitting down in a stance, learning how to get stops, stringing together stops. It\u2019s not who we are right now,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo games in a row, that\u2019s who needed to be because we couldn\u2019t find the hole. If it hadn\u2019t sunk in now with our guys, I don\u2019t know that it will. \u2026 \u201cIt starts with me. We are not a very good defensive team. We\u2019re not very tough, and that starts with me.\u201d \nFlorida hosts No. 17 Cincinnati on Saturday, giving the team a couple days of practice to try to address its issues. \nFor Hudson, that means starting over. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s happening. If I knew, I\u2019d be able to share it, be able to fix it. It\u2019s not one thing. It\u2019s a lot of things. \u2026 We\u2019re not ready to play. We don\u2019t start the game ready to play, we don\u2019t finish the game. I mean, we\u2019re not hitting shots, we\u2019re not guarding. Guards aren\u2019t guarding, bigs aren\u2019t guarding. It\u2019s like nobody is doing anything,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cObviously we thought we were on our way to something, and we don\u2019t know where it fell apart. We\u2019ve got to go back to the beginning in order to build the foundation from the beginning again.\u201d \nNOTES: White gave Ballard, a freshman, his first career start while having his leading scorer (Hudson) and third-leading scorer (Allen) come off the bench. \u201cI thought Deaundrae Ballard played harder than anybody on our team two nights ago in a game where we were embarrassed at home, so I was going to start him. Not necessarily penalizing anybody else, but I was going to start him,\u201d White said. \u201c\u2026 I want to set a tone with our team that starting doesn\u2019t matter to me; winning matters to me. And I\u2019m going to reward guys that are doing what we\u2019re asking them to do.\u201d Leave a Comment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jalen hudson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kevarrius hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chiozza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevaughn allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egor koulechov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hudson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koulechov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris chiozza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deaundrae ballard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ballard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameron satterwhite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith stone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loyola-chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aundre jackson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "missouri valley conference", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gators", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exactech arena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duke", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fla.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o\u2019connell center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chiozza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gainesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan mcpherson/sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hudson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cincinnati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loyola-chicago", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:12.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9a67a0c137dd98c910b32000a9e8203e7b44ac3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9vTIyJ4Yv8oaA9To1mvdKot8oU7aoTZ.yk4kWOdwflUjP26yOzGhjOIGs7AzCz4qK0SWFH5V7ruz873nIgWwHkHE0zXlazCFw-", "site_full": "www.pesgrazy.com", "site": "pesgrazy.com", "site_section": "http://www.pesgrazy.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "GILAPESKU", "title": "PES2018 Kits Pack v3.0 by AndresKits For Smoke X1.4", "title_full": "PES2018 Kits Pack v3.0 by AndresKits For Smoke X1.4", "published": "2017-12-07T11:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9a67a0c137dd98c910b32000a9e8203e7b44ac3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9vTIyJ4Yv8oaA9To1mvdKot8oU7aoTZ.yk4kWOdwflUjP26yOzGhjOIGs7AzCz4qK0SWFH5V7ruz873nIgWwHkHE0zXlazCFw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kimizan (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "PES2018 Kits Pack v3.0 by AndresKits For Smoke X1.4", "text": "PES2018 Kits Pack v3.0 by AndresKits For Smoke X1.4 DOWNLOAD \nCOMPLETE: LALIGA SANTANDER, BUNDESLIGA and MORE ADD NEW TEAM LOGOS AND NATIONAL TEAMS ADD SLEEVE BADGE FOR PL AND LA LIGA!

I have been through traumatic things in my life before, things that made it so I struggled to sleep that one night of the day the thing happened, things that made me want to talk about it constantly, things that made me still feel upset for a little while afterwards. But this particular thing affected me in a way unlike any of the other things I\u2019ve experienced.\nThe tl:dr is that I\u2019m doing way way better this week. I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m going to be okay.\nBut I wanted to write some more about all this.\nAfter morning through midday last Friday (December 1st) writing up my last post about how I couldn\u2019t stop crying , I still was a wreck. I then proceeded to be fired from my volunteer organization, as if that wasn\u2019t going to be adding insult to injury especially when I had unresolved extreme fear/trust/walking on eggshell issues from September based on them treating me super unfairly back then, 3 months ago, and I just\u2026 and I still wasn\u2019t sleeping, and I was adding EXTRA stress to myself about needing to wake up at the ridiculous hour of 3:45 AM to catch a shuttle to the airport that I almost forgot to book\u2026\nSo it shouldn\u2019t be that surprising that by dinner-time hours that night after I had kept being distracted by things all freaking day that it\u2019d been about 26 hours since I\u2019d eaten a meal (although around the 20 hour mark I\u2019d shoved some plain cheese in my mouth from the fridge), I semi-tearfully told my brother how I wished we had hot dogs in the house or something so that I wouldn\u2019t have to actually put any effort or even just patience into my dinner and he offered to go to the store and buy them for me. I asked if he really wanted to do that for me, and he chuckled a little nervously and seemed almost scared of\u2026 okay not scared of me, but out of his comfort zone with my grief and like he did want to help, and said maybe not like he super wanted to but he\u2019d do it .\nAnd it shouldn\u2019t be all that surprising, either, that trying to sleep for 6 hours that night I still could not, I was an adrenaline fueled total mess, and at one point I started literally shaking in my bed, and I don\u2019t think I was shivering out of any cold temperatures under my heavy comforter etc; it didn\u2019t quite feel like that kind of shaking anyway. I got out of bed and put my pantyhose on that I planned to wear with a skirt to the airport because I was planning to be properly dressed for the funeral when I left the house at 4:00 AM. I put my pajama shorts back on, on top, and I tweeted my freak out briefly, and when I got back in bed I wasn\u2019t shaking.\nMy friend on twitter told me:\nThis from https://www.helpguide.org/articles/ptsd-trauma/coping-with-emotional-and-psychological-trauma.htm sounds like what you\u2019re going through.\n\nAnd I think that helped me a lot to read\u2026\nThat article in general did help, not just the excerpt.\nIt\u2019s probably true that something about:\nWhile traumatic events can happen to anyone, there are risk factors that make some of us more likely to experience psychological trauma following a disturbing event. You\u2019re more likely to be traumatized if you\u2019re already under a heavy stress load, have recently suffered a series of losses, or have been traumatized before\u2014especially if the earlier trauma occurred in childhood.\nis affecting me too, that previous traumas are piling up on me. I\u2019d just, earlier that month, finished vidding and writing up an explanation of my breakup from back in May . I had to dwell on some of the intense feelings, especially at the end of the vid, and I think the way Robert broke up with me was kinda a trauma; I was very suddenly and confusingly abandoned. I\u2019d felt similarly again when Recovering from Religion as an organization suddenly suspended me as a volunteer for no good reason in September, like I was having flashbacks to my breakup almost in a very vague sense, even if they decided to end my suspension and let me back in later. It all felt really unfair. I tried so hard, put my all into a relationship of some kind, and got this in return. I found myself really upset by sudden shifts to my life, I\u2019d recently been sent to tears at work by a co-worker accusing me of being a liar who was trying to destroy her career when I completely didn\u2019t do anything and I was kinda a stressed and an ashamed wreck over how \u201csensitive\u201d I\u2019d been and how crying at work probably made it all worse. My supervisor and her supervisor both got involved to help me and they were super nice to me throughout the incident, but I\u2019m left now still having a super chilly relationship with that co-worker\u2026 and that upsets me because I was really starting to feel like she could be a friend before all this. Obviously I have had childhood trauma too \u2026. Even Thanksgiving week my aunt was acting frustrated by the tiniest of things and like everything we all did personally was offending her, and it wasn\u2019t that bad but it kept things kinda tense that whole \u201cvacation\u201d staying at her house for 5 days. My dad, my brother, and I discussed it once we got back home, like it made everything \u201cless fun\u201d\u2026 and I just\u2026\nThings have probably been building and building for me and that\u2019s part of why I finally burst and broke last week.\nI\u2019d already been remembering back to 2.5 years ago with this comment thread and started re-reading that stuff a little out of curiosity. I wanted to understand WTF was happening with me, with my body, with my reaction.\nEventually I also reminded myself of the sentiment in this comment too by re-reading more, a sentiment I\u2019d seen plenty of places in my life but still it never felt as real until right now\u2026\n\nAs Siggy said:\nIn many ways, I find that the rapist as ordinary person is much scarier than the rapist as monster. It means that I can\u2019t tell rapists apart from other people, and that there are many more than I imagined. And what\u2019s worse, I care about their feelings.\nBut back to what I was saying, I then read through that article on trauma Friday morning because, like I said, friend linked me to it after I was explaining my\u2026 Symptoms. This whole week I was utterly a mess and a lot was resonating in the article. I think that\u2019s all part of what I was probably dealing with this week, this event from in one of my very closest friends\u2026 it \u201cshatter[ed my] sense of security\u201d and in a weird way did involve \u201ca threat to life or safety\u201d . Like.\nIt was me seeing someone I thought I knew inside-and-out \u2013 someone who when he quit our podcast for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d and wouldn\u2019t tell me why I instantly correctly guessed exactly what his reasons were, that he was too ashamed to tell me his wife threatened to leave him and also that he thought not doing the podcast might save his marriage \u2013 like I knew him that well that without him telling me I just knew all that! \u2013 a person who only seemed suicidal at worst\u2026 This person ended up being capable of killing a person he loved and spent tons of time with and that just\u2026 even though I don\u2019t really think I ever once during that week started to fear anyone else specific in my life was capable of murder, it still shook me to my core.\nIt probably didn\u2019t help that I got more Facebook messages and emails that I can easily tally up from people who \u201cThought of me first\u201d when they heard the news that Scott had done this. So many people knew how freaking intimate my friendship with Scott was. Even, perhaps, how directly after his wife and kids I was like the person he was \u201cclosest\u201d to. All these people expressing condolences and whatnot to me was appreciated and kind and made me feel loved but it also made me feel reminded of how obvious it was in certain circles that Scott was someone super close to me. That I can\u2019t just get away with minimizing our intimacy and relationship in my head as a coping mechanism even if I wanted to because people keep reminding me. That I trusted Scott so much and what\u2026 what is the chance that someone in closer proximity to me than Texas could also be someone I trust that much and then do something like this.\nI think deeper down my instincts were that if I could trust someone like Scott so fully and this happen, I just could not psychologically handle it, could not cope and know how to go forward from that, at least not immediately. It was so different than other traumatic things I\u2019ve been through, because all my other traumas were just\u2026 not about someone I trust and ultimately assumed never could do something violent actually murdering someone in their intimate circle.\nEnough people, even if it was only like a handful of women in my circles, were unpacking all the times Scott had made them uncomfortable or told jokes that went too far, which also didn\u2019t help. I had plenty of times Scott made me uncomfortable, even so much so that I\u2019d drawn pretty hard boundaries occasionally or been sent to tears over a couple fights of ours. And I knew he wasn\u2019t a flawless person. But even so, I never fathomed this would be possible coming from him. And besides, I can\u2019t just super easily write it all off as he is someone we all shouldn\u2019t have trusted at all and in fact, instead suspected of being extremely dangerous to befriend. Because I can\u2019t pinpoint any particular way he was so much worse than a number of other people in my life. And for those few people listing ways they saw him as sexist/misogynist, I\u2019ve been just as uncomfortable from women too. Like. It\u2019s all such a confusing and scary mess to even try to begin to unpack.\nOne of my friends (in fact, the friend I\u2019d been thinking I would love to have co-host the podcast with me after Scott had quit) told me:\nI don\u2019t have much of an opinion except to say that therapy would probably help you talk about this in a way that accounts for all your emotions and that shows you ways to be healthy and kind to yourself. I mean, let\u2019s be real: Someone you were close with just did something incredibly brutal ; many people seek therapy for much, much lesser shocks.\nAnd I mean\u2026 I can\u2019t stop thinking about his \u201cincredibly brutal\u201d way to phrase it. Because that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s just the crux of it, isn\u2019t it all. He is very wise. I have been feeling so much guilt that I didn\u2019t stop this from transpiring too, feeling it especially strong the first week \u2013 which is ridiculous, I need to find a way to fully believe that I couldn\u2019t have stopped it. That it was so much bigger than just me and he didn\u2019t show homicidal warning signs to a number of folks in his inner circle and I wasn\u2019t actually the only person in his life. I was all the way across the country and less likely to be able to fully help than some others. But this feeling of responsibility was probably tied into my sudden trauma of feeling like \u201cI really should\u2019ve seen it coming\u201d . Since I completely didn\u2019t see it coming, I\u2019m not actually safe. My \u201cnot seeing it coming\u201d truth, which itself is the trauma, manifested as me trying to take back control and convince myself I did see it coming and just didn\u2019t properly do the right things to stop him. Because if I have that kind of control the world, going forward, is less scarier. And it\u2019s\u2026\nI\u2019m pretty sure realizing all of this and framing it this way in my head has already been helping me move past it all. All the while though, I also lost a close friend. I have to deal with a real grief for the loss of a real human being, regardless of the traumatic stuff I was feeling. I have to deal with after a year of being particularly scared of people I know dying by suicide\u2026\nI thought harder about my uncle who died by suicide 4 years ago at the end of a day I spent with him and walked in a suicide prevention walk with him as the main person I was walking for Although I was also walking for all the suicidal people I\u2019d spoken with on Recovering from Religion\u2019s helpline and who I felt helpless to help and I wanted to fund research for them. I stopped taking calls a while ago probably in part because of how burnt out I was talking to suicidal people I had issues with my former queerplatonic partner Robert making me wonder if he might be suicidal on a couple of occasions even if I still never knew for sure it was a concern, but I still dwelled on this I talked a random acquaintance on tumblr struggling hard with schizophrenia out of suicide at least for that day and the next day after an intense back and forth and a lot of begging and stress a fandom friend of mine spoke to me about her mom seemingly attempting suicide in live time as she and her siblings waited for her to wake up a year ago my own abusive mom who I\u2019m no contact with started leaving more of the \u201cI\u2019m not dead yet\u201d type voicemails or \u201cI won\u2019t be around forever\u201d ones that made me reminded she probably struggles with suicidal ideation I made a new friend a few months back who had pretty recently lost his legs in a suicide attempt\u2026 he\u2019s excited to probably get prosthetics to walk with soon Wow when I tally it all up like this\u2026\nAnyway so my friend. In addition to the murder, I have to deal with the fact that he died by suicide. That\nA) it was, even if you complicated the fuck out of it by adding in murder, it was indeed suicide, after the year or so I\u2019ve had. Like REALLY dude? Really, Scott? You donated to my suicide prevention fundraiser. You knew I was visiting the surviving wife and child of my uncle who died by suicide over Thanksgiving and remembered my story well of how I\u2019d been there in the museum where he jumped. You knew the 23rd, Thanksgiving Day this year, was the anniversary of that death. You didn\u2019t know all of the suicide stuff I dealt with this year but you knew a lot. You even met our disabled-because-of-the-suicide-attempt friend who was a big fan of our podcast and tried to maybe record his story for an episode of our show!! You chose unprompted to explicitly tell me 1 week prior you weren\u2019t suicidal, and now you do this.\nAnd that\nB) you are dead. I have to mourn your loss. I have to mourn my podcast because of you doing this to me but that\u2019s basically nothing in comparison to the fact that I also have to cry every time I think of a happy memory. The worst grief I\u2019ve had to endure before was probably my breakup with Robert, even though he\u2019s alive, because of how much I let him color so many parts of my life. The worst grief over a loss was the stuff I wrote about here 1 year ago: https://luvtheheaven.wordpress.com/2017/01/01/personal-updates-and-a-grief-fueled-rant/ and you were very nice to me those days. You and Robert both were a big part of my memories associated with Monday December 5th 2016, the day of my grandmother\u2019s funeral, where Robert decided to pick the worst possible time to want to get back together and I had to record an interview with you that I let you carry completely because I was too emotional to focus. I can\u2019t help but remember much that happened in the 2+ years we\u2019ve known each other well. I have reminders of you everywhere. I cry when I watch The Atheist Experience promoting the fundraiser for your daughters and see in the front of the hosts the Flying Spaghetti Monster and how freaking much you LOVED the Flying Spaghetti Monster, used the spaghetti emoji for fun all the time, etc. I search your Facebook and see how even before I met you you shared your oldest daughter having drawn The Flying Spaghetti Monster or that you became an ordained minister in the Pastafarian parody religion. I just.\nI cry when my uncle sends me an odd grief care package in the mail too.\n \nScott was such a big fan of adult coloring books (I think he had just discovered them last year which was part of his excitement), such a big fan that he wanted to recommend them as a therapeutic resource \u2013 \u201cResource of the Month\u201d for our Recovering from Religion podcast Christmas episode last year as a good gift idea \u2013 and my uncle would\u2019ve had NO idea but my uncle is\u2026 is kinda like Scott actually, now that I think about it. Weird dudes all around and hide plenty of pain with humor and just the hugest jokesters, etc. My uncle donated to my anti suicide fundraiser too and had confided in his message that he had struggled with suicidal thoughts too but thankfully not in a very long time.\nIt\u2019s mainly this extremely political ridiculous coloring book and I don\u2019t even have colored pencils to properly color it in. And I don\u2019t know if I really want to. But I kinda almost do. It\u2019s a really odd gift. I\u2026 I think my uncle created this coloring book himself. He\u2026 it really triggered memories I wasn\u2019t prepared for which hurts but is also good. I\u2019m crying but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a bad thing and it also made me smile even if I do nothing with it. It\u2019s from A to Z so 26 pages for coloring. Okay maybe I should look harder to see if we have colored pencils, or buy some. I just. didn\u2019t know how to react. Other than cry. And maybe laugh a little. And my family is ridiculous. And ultimately, I love that I have at least some extended family who are this kind to me. I thanked him via email. He replied with a pretty long email, and part of it was: Emily,\nHang in there. Life throws crap at all of us and you have had more than your fair share.\nI created that coloring book after I quit my job as [Government something.]\nIt was really a silly cathartic rant after producing propaganda for so many years. I even considered doing video podcasts where everyone particpating would be wearing bags on their head like the \u201cUnknown Comic.\u201d\nOne person suggested to me, about coloring it in\u2026 Maybe do one a month, and include a note to your future self. Then read them all on month 27. This seems like a good idea\u2026 I was trying to think what would my notes be though. But then I realize we had 29 podcast episodes. I already re-listened to one and a half kinda but maybe I could listen to one per month and color and also write up each time my thoughts in reaction to the episode? I\u2019d finish the coloring book with only one to two episodes left at that point. Maybe that would work for me. I just. I don\u2019t know. I could save the Grief/Death/Mortality Episode we did to listen to last\u2026 or\u2026. Well, I\u2019ll keep thinking. I also decided to try to see professional help after all this. Even if I probably would be okay without it\u2026 I\u2019ve had a job for over a year now, I should be able to see a therapist on my insurance, I live near a city that doesn\u2019t feel overly religious, I really should be able to do this. I worry I will struggle to find someone who understands what a podcasting partners relationship can be like, someone completely secular and able to respect my atheist activism and lack of beliefs in any god or an afterlife, AND who is aromanticism and asexuality competent, which will probably end up being important to me too because asexuality is a huge part of my entire life\u2026 I\u2019m not going to try therapists on The Secular Therapy project quite yet but\u2026 It could come to that.\nIt feels really troubling that Scott told me he couldn\u2019t sleep, he was at the lowest point in his life, and he was clearly experiencing finding out his wife was seeing another man (even if it turns out \u2013 I found out from a close friend of his after his wife\u2019s funeral \u2013 that his wife had said it had been an emotional and not physical affair) as a trauma, and I had just assumed it was grief he had to work through but that he\u2019d be okay eventually. I think it\u2019s\u2026 almost ironic? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m using that word right, that he was so traumatized that he did something that then, in a chain-like-fashion, then traumatized me (and who knows how many other people in his family\u2019s life have been traumatized, but I think a lot of his friends and probably every person in his extended family).\nAlso on Friday, the day before my sense of calm finally came, before my last night of feeling scared by just how unable to sleep I was, an online friend on tumblr (whose name other than a username I don\u2019t even know) said one of the most helpful things I\u2019ve been told in the days since last Monday when Scott killed his wife and himself.\nThese are the types of comforting words in the midst of this nightmare that I find myself wanting to frame and preserve.\nFor context, I had directly before this said: \u201cIt\u2019s still making me cry every time I read those types of \u2018I hope you know it\u2019s not your fault\u2019 messages so I guess I don\u2019t actually know that yet. But I\u2019m trying.\u201d\nSo she said:\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been through what you\u2019ve been through right now. But I\u2019ve been through trauma. Hearing it wasn\u2019t my fault made me cry too. It\u2019s equal parts scary and reassuring. Scary because it means admitting it was a scary, horrible, painful thing that happened that you had absolutely no power to stop. That\u2019s scary. Are reassuring because really, you did nothing wrong. There was no magical way you could have stopped this. You bear no fault for what happened. But let me say this: If he didn\u2019t have you, the community you both belong to, and other friends, if he didn\u2019t have those friendships and connections, his life would have been worse. And perhaps the end of it would have been too. It\u2019s really hard to look at a tragic thing like this and realize it, because all we can see is how horrible it is (not without good reason) but that doesn\u2019t negate the love you give. Or the difference you make in people\u2019s lives. You found someone out there in the world reaching out for connection and you gave it to him and no matter the end, you still made a positive difference.\u201d\nThis makes me cry a lot just copying and pasting it from tumblr messages to this post and having to re-read the kind words. But I just want to say it really helped. And I felt like sharing.\nLots of people have done tons of things that have really helped. But this was just particularly powerful in terms of its effect on me.\nI\u2019m not sure anyone else said anything very similar about\u2026 About how me being in Scott\u2019s life mattered, or any of us who tried being there for him did. I think it\u2019s why it hit (and hits) me so hard that I started crying again just trying to type this. Anyone acknowledging that Scott was so so much more than an evil murderer, anyone caring about how sad and hurt and full of trauma Scott was at the end the way I truly cared, or acknowledging at least that they can tell I cared and that this was a good instinct in me to extend what I could as a friend to him long before I knew how his family\u2019s story would end. This kind of thing is what helps me feel like it\u2019s ok to this friend and wouldn\u2019t make them uncomfortable if I truly grieved Scott too. If I felt bad for him, thought he was a victim too. And that plus more is what is so powerful to me. \nSo idk what exactly I\u2019ll talk to my new therapist about, but I will at least try talking and seeing if it helps. I also hope maybe a professional might have unique advice that random people who are just trying to help without expertise might not. It\u2019s certainly helped me plenty to talk to friends but I think I\u2019ve run a lot of my friendships to the maximum amount of compassion a reasonable person can be asked to have for me.\nI\u2019ve made appointments with two different therapists next week, one on Monday after work and the other on Thursday after work. I want to see which I like better or if I still feel I need to try a third\u2026\nI\u2019ve been calmer, able to basically sleep if I try, since I got to San Antonio Saturday December 2nd, and I think it might\u2019ve been the 4 hour plane ride in the dark, calmly listening to music and crying about how much the lyrics applied to my life or Scott\u2019s for the latter half of it, that helped a lot. I think understanding what I was experiencing with my lack of ability to sleep and how stuck in a stressed state the trauma had made me and finally really eating 3 meals a day and stuff all helped too.\nI\u2019ve had some feels about being aro asexual since this all happened, and like The Asexual Agenda\u2019s question of the week this week has touched on indirectly, one of the big things I have actually been thinking ever since the end of October when I found out about Scott\u2019s marriage situation was that I just intrinsically will never, ever understand or get lots of aspects of attraction, cheating, or \u2013 and this is a big one \u2013 jealousy. I don\u2019t know how to properly empathize with how it must feel to be jealous, especially to the degree Scott seemingly turned out to be. It\u2019s possible jealousy wasn\u2019t the main motivation but it seems likely it played a part. The research here: https://www.officer.com/on-the-street/body-armor-protection/article/10744560/murdersuicide-when-killing-yourself-isnt-enough \nseems to reflect that\n\u201cAmorous jealousy\u201d, involves one half to three quarters of all murder-suicides in the U.S. \nand well, while I\u2019m sure the majority of people who are typical straight cis men like Scott also cannot relate to what he ended up doing either, I feel like I\u2019m further away from it on a deeper level, perhaps.\nI also have been thinking about how platonic all my relationships in my life are, how much I want to use the word \u201clove\u201d to describe what I felt and feel for both Scott and for all the supportive people around me in my life in the aftermath. I\u2019ve been taking advantage of more than 10 friendships with men, confiding in and venting to them, and the majority of these men are straight but I still feel entirely safe and pretty much the exact same way I feel toward the more than 10 friendships with women I\u2019ve also been\u2026. utilizing to my advantage in this difficult time. (There are pretty much no nonbinary people in my super inner circle these days who I\u2019ve been confiding in but I\u2019m sure I\u2019d feel the same towards them too!)\nI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about my relationship with Robert too, which I can\u2019t think of without remembering how queerplatonic we were because of the aro ace factors. He knew more about my relationship with Scott than almost anyone. He met Scott in person the same weekend I did and had the same two meals with him. Robert listened to our podcast. Robert discussed the nitty gritty details of my fights with Scott and my discomfort with his jokes and my ideas for the future of the podcast with me. Robert liked the way my voice sounded better on the microphone Scott gave me that time we met Scott in-person rather than how I sounded on the headset I\u2019d been using before. Scott had sent Robert candy as a care package when Robert was on his civilian contractor deployment in Afghanistan! Scott had comforted me over BOTH of my breakups with Robert and when Scott\u2019s marriage was ending and I wanted to empathize and be sympathetic to losing a 16 year relationship the only thing I had in my life experience to compare it to was the pain of losing my 2 year relationship with Robert. Robert being radio silent since the breakup and ending our friendship so completely for no understandable reason to me that he almost might as well be dead has been so painful to me, and I\u2019ve been so tempted to reach back out to him in my grief and see what happens because Robert has to have an opinion!! The time Robert was in my life and the time Scott was overlap to such a high degree \u2013 I knew Robert only a few months before meeting Scott, and I knew Scott only 6 or so months past Robert being gone from my life. And it\u2019s just.\nSo if I want to talk about it, and who Robert was to me, and why I\u2019m thinking about THIS, I have to address the \u201cI\u2019m asexual and my \u2018boyfriend\u2019 wasn\u2019t really a boyfriend and I feel like my dating pool is a puddle that may have already evaporated and I\u2019ve missed my chance to ever have a significant other again\u201d side of it and\u2026\nI told most of the people (friends of Scott\u2019s and Jennifer\u2019s) who I met in San Antonio about being asexual. I apparently can\u2019t help but talk about it constantly. I talked about how I plan to present at asexuality related workshops for the Creating Change conference at the end of January. I talked about when asexuality came up in my relationship with Scott. I just. I talked about it. When asked if I might do another podcast now that Recovering from Religion has fired me I discussed how asexuality activism is more on my mind anyway and I\u2019m less inspired by atheism stuff these days so if I did, idk I\u2019d probably wait a while but might do a podcast on a niche topic like the intersection of asexuality and fandom.\nI\u2019m just\u2026 I wanted to share with all of you where I\u2019ve been at mentally and emotionally. The comments I got on the previous blog post have meant the world to me, and helped greatly. This has been such an intense time in my life and I\u2019m still sad and crying at least a few times every day but I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m a lot better than I was a week and a half ago.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emily", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wtf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "domestic violence and abuse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san antonio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:12.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd0300e3bb219bf7a97456925abc7619e743d850", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSK8EMKwXpBTLNj7vghnKDGlaw_7hqHtG9vA0G1EQip5bRyK1zXOUNmr7.lQbvIO.B04J_LJ1W8B603S8BYcGDCaXAnJh5YCjuPhApgLbLiyS_zveW4plGRDo6uspENigIdx8tAugXw9w--", "site_full": "www.seccountry.com", "site": "seccountry.com", "site_section": "http://www.yardbarker.com/rss/school/508", "site_categories": ["football", "baseball", "sports"], "section_title": "Yardbarker: Florida Gators", "title": "Florida officially announces partnership with Jordan Brand and iconic Jumpman logo", "title_full": "Florida officially announces partnership with Jordan Brand and iconic Jumpman logo", "published": "2017-12-06T21:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/cmgverticals/image/upload/c_crop,g_north_west,h_770,w_1460,x_0,y_24/f_auto,q_auto/h_624,w_1183/v1512587078/Jumpman_qa5f8f.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 47190, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd0300e3bb219bf7a97456925abc7619e743d850", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSK8EMKwXpBTLNj7vghnKDGlaw_7hqHtG9vA0G1EQip5bRyK1zXOUNmr7.lQbvIO.B04J_LJ1W8B603S8BYcGDCaXAnJh5YCjuPhApgLbLiyS_zveW4plGRDo6uspENigIdx8tAugXw9w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T21:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Florida officially announces partnership with Jordan Brand and iconic Jumpman logo", "text": "Florida officially announces partnership with Jordan Brand and iconic Jumpman logo Florida has aligned with Jordan Brand, the school announced Wednesday.

Lukas Einmal aussterben reicht, deswegen greifen Bryce Dallas Howard und Chris Pratt in \"Jurassic World - Das gefallene K\u00f6nigreich\" rettend ein. Weiteres zur Handlung und zur Vorbereitung auf den Trailer gibt\u2019s hier! Achtung, diese Meldung enth\u00e4lt Spoiler! \nUpdate: Mit einer \"Companion Featurette\" geht es bei Jurassic World - Das gefallene K\u00f6nigreich weiter. Weiter in Richtung Trailer! Diese Featurette gew\u00e4hrt uns einen Blick hinter die Kulissen und sogar auf R\u00fcckkehrer Jeff Goldblum , enth\u00e4lt viele neue Filmszenen und betont vor allem, wie sehr diesmal wieder auf animatronische Dinosaurier gesetzt wurde, nachdem Jurassic World ja doch recht CGI-lastig daherkam. Zum Anschauen einfach runterscrollen. \n++++ \nAm Ende fiel Jurassic World , so wie einst der erste Jurassic Park . Daraus leitet sich wohl der Untertitel von Jurassic World - Das gefallene K\u00f6nigreich her. Diesen Freitag (in den USA schon am Donnerstag) bekommen wir endlich einen Trailer zu sehen, den uns Universal Pictures schon mit mehreren Teasern schmackhaft gemacht hat. Und der Countdown l\u00e4uft weiter: mit einem witzigen Promo-Video, in dem Chris Pratt und Bryce Dallas Howard neben YouTube -Star Zach King auftreten und den Trailer zu ver\u00f6ffentlichen versuchen. \nEin erstes Szenenbild und erste Storydetails bringt uns Entertainment Weekly . Was ist schlimmer, als sich auf einer Insel voller randalierender Dinosaurier zu befinden? Ganz einfach: sich auf einer Insel voller randalierender Dinosaurier befinden, auf der ein Vulkan ausbricht. Dadurch macht Jurassic World - Das gefallene K\u00f6nigreich seinen Protagonisten das Leben noch schwerer als ohnehin schon. Das Sequel spielt mehrere Jahre nach Jurassic World und (zumindest teilweise) wieder auf der Isla Nublar, wo jener Vulkan die Dinos, die den Park \u00fcberrannt haben, zu verbrutzeln droht. Nicht auszudenken, wenn sie erneut aussterben w\u00fcrden! Aber wenn es jemand verhindern kann, dann Dino-Trainer Owen Grady (Pratt) und Ex-Parkmanagerin Claire Dearing (Howard). \nLetztere hat inzwischen eine Organisation, die \"Dinosaur Protection Group\", gegr\u00fcndet und findet eine M\u00f6glichkeit, um all diese Dinosaurier von der Insel runterzuschaffen, erkl\u00e4rt Howard. Sie kontaktiert Owen, um ihn dar\u00fcber zu informieren. Offenbar hat sich die Beziehung der beiden nicht ganz so entwickeln, wie man h\u00e4tte denken k\u00f6nnen. Nicht ganz so romantisch also. Wenn wir sie am Anfang dieser Geschichte sehen, werden wir auf den aktuellen Stand gebracht, verspricht Howard. Es soll nicht unbedingt das sein, was man erwarten w\u00fcrde. \nJustice Smith und Danielle Pineda ( The Originals ) spielen neue Charaktere, die Claires Dino-Rettungstrupp angeh\u00f6ren, und Jeff Goldblum feiert nach zwanzig Jahren sein Comeback als Dr. Ian Malcolm. Regisseur Juan Antonio Bayona war gepl\u00e4ttet, Goldblum nach so langer Zeit wieder vor der Kamera stehen und \u00fcber Dinosaurier reden zu sehen. Uns wird es bestimmt \u00e4hnlich ergehen, wenn Jurassic World - Das gefallene K\u00f6nigreich ab dem 7. Juni 2018 die Kinos\u00e4le f\u00fcllt. \n\u2014 Zach King (@FinalCutKing) 5.

However, Clijsters was tempted back in 2009 and she completed a remarkable sporting achievement by winning that year's US Open in just her third tournament and while still unranked . She won two further major titles before retiring for good in September 2012. \nFirst grand slam back - 2009, won US Open \nMargaret Court \nCourt won 21 grand slam singles titles before taking time out in 1971 and 1972 for the birth of her first child, son Daniel. In 1973 she triumphed at the Australian, French and US Opens . She had a daughter, Marika, in 1974 and again returned to the tour, but there would be no more grand slam trophy success. Her 24 singles majors remains a record, with Williams one behind. \nFirst grand slam back - 1972, reached US Open semi-finals \nEvonne Goolagong Cawley \nAustralian Goolagong Cawley stepped off the tour in late 1976 after finding out she was pregnant, but she was soon back after giving birth to daughter Kelly in May of the following year. In 1977, a scheduling quirk meant there were two Australian Opens, and Goolagong Cawley returned to action in time to win the second of those in December. She also won Wimbledon in 1980, her seventh singles triumph . \nFirst grand slam back - 1977, won Australian Open \nLindsay Davenport \nAmerican Davenport gave birth to son Jagger in June 2007, and just three months later the former world number one was back on tour and winning a title in Bali. A lthough she did not add to her three grand slam singles crowns, she collected four titles before announcing she was pregnant again in 2008 . That marked the end of Davenport's singles career but she won one more doubles tournament in 2010. \nFirst grand slam back - 2008, reached Australian Open second round \nVictoria Azarenka \nWilliams will be following in the footsteps of her good friend Azarenka, who gave birth to son Leo last December before returning to the tour in June. She lost in the second round of her first event in Majorca then reached the fourth round of Wimbledon. Azarenka's career has since stalled again because of a custody battle with her former partner.

He was scheduled to be out of town for work until just before Christmas. But the thought of going most of the holiday season without a tree was downright depressing. So against my husband\u2019s advice, my six-year-old and I decided to \u201csurprise\u201d Daddy with a tree all by ourselves. \nWhile I promised my son we would get a tree immediately, I had no solution to the following problems. \n-How will I hoist a tree atop our car and tie it down myself? \n-How will I get the tree OFF of the car, up our deck stairs and into the living room? \n-When it was time for actually putting UP the Christmas tree alone, how would I achieve the UP part of that? \n-And most importantly, how will we do all of this with a very clingy 18-month-old in the mix? \nIt was a near disaster. But I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. Mom Putting Up A Christmas Tree Alone\u2026 (No one was injured in the getting of this tree.) \nNow the only problem is how to BABY PROOF the Christmas tree?!? I\u2019ve Googled \u201cHow to Babyproof a Christmas Tree.\u201d Most people say put a gate around it or place it in a room with a door. My daughter is a climber. No baby gate is going to stop her. We have an open floor plan, hence, no door. The best I\u2019ve come up with so far is this very ugly barrier of heavy boxes with a lame-o red cloth on top. The Baby-Proof Barrier. Ugly but functional. \nDo you have an idea for babyproofing the Christmas tree? Please send it to me, stat. I\u2019ll be eternally grateful. Kids in front of the tree/tree barrier. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:13.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ec40965f673cbc055df749649c006559a091a21d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTj8J.OXSHlSDSn6r2hu9HE4YTc3fnLzcRmYZhg.OWUxaVejQA9dAi7pyTnnx7J4msMl96Gatk_3gIF8Snqr2GVHOBP8s4XtAI-", "site_full": "dailyconfession.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://dailyconfession.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Larger Catechism, week 49 \u2013 Daily Confession", "title": "Larger Catechism, week 49", "title_full": "Larger Catechism, week 49", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ec40965f673cbc055df749649c006559a091a21d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTj8J.OXSHlSDSn6r2hu9HE4YTc3fnLzcRmYZhg.OWUxaVejQA9dAi7pyTnnx7J4msMl96Gatk_3gIF8Snqr2GVHOBP8s4XtAI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "RubeRad", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Larger Catechism, week 49", "text": "Q. 189.

She won her biggest singles title of her career in Miami and followed that up with a run to the Wimbledon semi-final, which sent her to number four in the world. \nBut that proved the high point of her campaign and a poor run of form in the autumn saw her part ways with Fissette in October. \nAfter a lengthy recruitment process she has now appointed Joyce, who worked with Sharapova for seven years between 2004 and 2011 and helped the Russian to two grand slam titles and the world number one ranking. \nThe American, whose highest rank as a player was 64 in 1996, has most recently worked with another former world number one Victoria Azarenka. \nKonta has retained Gill Myburgh as her strength and conditioning coach, Milly Mirkovic as her physio and Elena Sosa as her mental coach.

Multiple news outlets reported Wednesday that the two warned Trump over his statement about recognition of Jerusalem al-Quds as the Israeli capital and relocation of the American embassy to the Israel-occupied city. \n\u201cSecretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis opposed the move from Tel Aviv,\u201d Reuters  said  in its report, citing US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, US Vice President Mike Pence and David Friedman, the pro-Israeli US ambassador, \u201cpushed hard for both recognition and embassy relocation.\u201d Trump, however, says he intends to stick to his campaign pledge to move the embassy from Tel Aviv, which led to an  announcement  earlier in the day. Trump reportedly leaned towards the more pro-Israel figures in his administration in order to make that pledge. \u201cIn making his decision, Trump overruled more cautious counsel from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, who expressed concern about endangering US diplomats and troops in Muslim countries,\u201d the Associated Press  said  in its report, citing officials speaking on condition of anonymity. In his statement, the Republican president admitted that \"there will of course be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement,\u201d yet arguing that \u201cwe are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a place of greater understanding and cooperation.\" He added that he intends \"to do everything in my power to help forge\" a peace agreement. Recognizing Jerusalem al-Quds as the Israeli capital could spark further tensions in the region as Palestinian and the Muslim population consider the city as Palestine\u2019s capital. Trump\u2019s latest announcement has  drawn condemnation  from many world countries. Hailed as a \u201cgreat friend to the Jewish people\u201d by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump has mended ties with Israel that had gone sour under former President Barack Obama. The Israeli regime, meanwhile, continues its atrocities and expansionist policies in the region.

Anyone who can deliver at this level will certainly be looked at,\u201d Miles said. \nVisavidiya arrived in Invercargill from India in 2015 to study at the Southern Institute of Technology on a John Wright Scholarship. \nHe made an immediate impact in club cricket racking up five centuries in a short space of time. \nHarsh Visavidiya moved from India to Invercargill earlier this year after he picked up a John Wright Scholarship to study at the Southern Institute of Technology. He has made an immediate impact in club cricket and has now been selected in the Southland Hawke Cup team to play their first competition game against North Otago in Oamaru this weekend. \nHe is likely to bat at No 3 in the order and will also play a role with the ball through his leg-spinners. While Visavidiya\u2019s focus is on helping Southland at the moment his goals in New Zealand extend beyond Hawke Cup level. \nThe Southland Times quizzed the new Indian recruit on his background and how he ended up playing up in Southland. \nWhere in India are you from? \nI belong to Ahmedabad in Gujarat, India. \nHow did you end up in such an offbeat, unconventional and cool career? \nI wanted to build my interest in sports and develop it further, so I decided to come to the Southern Institute of Technology. I had enough practical knowledge in the game of cricket but I wanted to build my knowledge in a varity of sports as well, which would make me grow as a person in my sport of cricket. \nWhat are you studying at the Southern Institute of Technology? \nI am studying \u2018Diploma in Sports and Recreation\u2019. \nTell us about how you got started playing cricket in India and how long you have been playing for? \nI started at the age of 15. Coming from the family of sport lovers and players, I was inspired to play cricket at a young age because of my father. My father was already a successful Ranji Trophy player in India, I was inspired to grow up into an another one. I have the same dream of playing cricket and my passion for the game is the same as my father as well. \nIt has been 12 years since I have been into playing cricket. \nWhat was the highest level you played at in India? \nI have played at State Level in India. I have played in the All India University Tournament and a first class practice selection match before I came to Southland, New Zealand. \nHave you played with or against any cricket stars in India? \nYes I have played with the star players of India, such as Ravindra Jadeja, Cheteshwar Pujara, Parthiv Patel, Siddharth Trivedi, Amit Singh, Akshar Patel, Harshal Patel, Rakesh Dhruv and VenuGopal Rao. \nYoung Indian cricketers are known for training a lot; tell us how much you would train each week back in India? \nSix days a week, 40 to 50 hours a week. \nHow have you enjoyed Southland so far? \nI have been enjoying Southland, it is a new place and new experiences. \nFacing new challenges each day and learning from the practice and other co-players, as well as coaches, has helped me a lot to achieve my goals. \nWhat are the big differences from playing cricket in India compared to Southland? \nWhether conditions. Due to the uncertain whether conditions, we face trouble having outdoor practices here in Southland. \nYou have already scored two centuries while playing in Southland, how many centuries have you scored all up playing cricket? \nTen in all. \nWhat are you hoping to achieve while playing cricket here in Southland? \nI want to achieve my goals step by step with short term goals only.

(Hons.), NALSAR (National Academy of Legal Studies and Research University) Class of 2011, has gained entry into the hallowed portals of Yale Law School, in its LLM class. Awarded the Commonwealth Scholarship for Law, 2011 which also opens the doors of Cambridge University for him, we shall find out why he chose Yale over Cambridge and a host of other things. \nOriginal Link : \nhttp://www.clatgyan.com/the-window/scholarships-success-ttette-aditya-singh-commonwealth-scholar-2011/ \n1. Tell us about your schooling and background. What inspired you to   uncommon career? \nI grew up in Meerut and did my schooling at St. Mary\u2019s Academy, Meerut Cantt. I decided to join law school because it was clear to me that it would allow me to work with varied career choices. I read about how top politicians, journalists and management professionals had studied law and this freedom and mobility attracted me. So it was not so much a decision to become a lawyer but more about studying law and developing skills that would help me in thinking through difficult situations and taking the right decisions irrespective of what I eventually do. \n2. Editorial board position. What work does it entail and how has that contributed towards you growth? \nI have edited the Indian Journal of Law & Economics at NALSAR. It was a great experience. I had the chance to interact with some accomplished scholars as I edited their papers. I also had the opportunity to engage with a range of practitioners and academics who work on law and policy issues during the creation of a board of advisory and consulting editors. \n3. Mooting. Unnecessarily glorified or a stepping stone? \nMooting is a great academic exercise and deserves all the attention it gets. I have represented NALSAR in both international and domestic moots and strongly believe that it is one the most academically rigorous activities available to Indian law students. All the moots I have done have exposed me to a new area of law that I would not have studied otherwise. It requires exhaustive research on a specific area of law and it is difficult to get such a deep understanding of complex issues in usual classroom learning. And additionally, it\u2019s a great way to meet and exchange ideas with students from other law schools and also visit exotic places! \n4. What according to you was the clinching factor for admission to the Yale Law School and the Commonwealth scholarship and in your opinion what exactly do they look for? \nThere is no clinching factor in any of this. I don\u2019t think one can plan for this and there is certainly no formula. For both Yale Law School and the Commonwealth Scholarship, I was clear in my application about why I wanted to study further and what my expectations were from the programs. Results are really secondary because there is a huge element of luck involved. But what is wonderful about writing applications and preparing for interviews is that it is a deeply reflective exercise. I have greatly benefited from the application process as I had an opportunity to think about my past, the mistakes I have made and what I have learned from them and more importantly, what I want to do in the coming years. \n5. Yale Law School or University of Cambridge. Which one and why? \nI will be joining the Yale Law School and will forego the Commonwealth Scholarship. Yale\u2019s masters program, unlike other Universities, has a very small class size (around 25 students) which allows for greater interaction with faculty. Also, compared to law schools in the UK, Yale offers a broad array of courses and this works best for me because I am not going in with a specific area in mind but looking to explore a variety of interesting courses. A very generous scholarship and financial aid package from the Yale Law School made it easy for me to not accept the Commonwealth Scholarship. \n6. The entire NALSAR experience. The journey that is over and how it helped mould you. Any person(s) you would like to mention. \nJoining NALSAR was the best decision I have ever made. It is a remarkable place which has given me opportunities I could not have even thought of. Many individuals, both within and outside law school have contributed to making this such a wonderful experience. A bunch of great friends and classmates made the NALSAR experience completely worthwhile. In terms of faculty, Prof. Amita Dhanda\u2019s courses were fantastic. Also, the fact that Prasad Krishnamurthy and Swethaa Ballakrishnen were at NALSAR for a year each made a huge difference and added greatly to the experience. During this time, I have had the chance to work with the most inspiring individuals, particularly Vikramaditya Khanna and Menaka Guruswamy, who have always been willing to guide and mentor me. \nBut most importantly, I am lucky to have an extremely supportive family that always respects my decisions and never doubts my convictions. \n7. The world beyond the race for \u201cwho-wants-to-be-the-next-amarchand-partner\u201d. Your take. In other words, please elaborate on the alternative career choices that a person graduating from a Law School today would have, other than \u201cplacements\u201d. \nI believe it is important to not view anything as alternative, conventional or usual as you start law school. Law students today have a range of wonderful opportunities. Surely the world of a law firm partner is as exciting as a law professor or a World Bank lawyer or a practicing counsel but the key lies in discovering what is best for you and what interests you. Law school offers opportunities to get a sense of the many things you could do after graduation and one should use this time with no preconceived notions. Personally, I am still discovering different options and have not zeroed in on a specific career. \n8. Your interests in the world beyond law. \nI am extremely interested in Indian politics and like to read about political figures. I would love to be a Psephologist but seems unlikely at the moment! And I\u2019m addicted to news channels and a worrying number of TV shows! \n9. Your word for CLAT aspirants in general and those who shall be joining NALSAR this year, in particular. \nThe usual (but important) stuff. Keep believing that you can crack the law entrance exams and never let a failure deter you. To those who are joining NALSAR \u2013 make the most of it. You\u2019ll have a world of opportunities and don\u2019t hesitate to try anything that looks interesting. Go in with a completely open mind and be willing to experiment with courses, activities and everything else that comes your way.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed that there is no alternative to the two-state solution and that Jerusalem is an issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the parties.\u201cIn this moment of great anxiety, I want to make it clear, there is no alternative to the two-state solution. There is no Plan B,\u201d Guterres told reporters at UN Headquarters in New York. Pakistan and other Islamic nations have warned that the move would be detrimental to any peace effort, a concern shared by China and Russia and many other countries. The lead-up to Trump\u2019s announcement was peppered with warnings from world leaders that he was making a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d that would erode if not outright collapse any broader peace plan in the Middle East. But the decision moves toward fulfilling a Trump campaign promise to relocate the embassy to Jerusalem. According to American media reports, Vice President Mike Pence pushed the change in the US policy on Jerusalem, which is supported by many evangelical Christians. Trump said Pence, who stood behind the president during the announcement, would travel to the region. Pence was \u201cone of, if not the most, vocal advocate to the president to make the decision to, one, recognize Jerusalem, but also to ultimately move the embassy the way that he\u2019s doing it,\u201d a senior administration official told POLITICO, an online news service. But US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defence Secretary James Mattis were both said to oppose US President Donald Trump\u2019s approach towards Jerusalem. Multiple news outlets reported that the two officials warned Trump over US recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and relocation of the American embassy to the Israel-occupied city.\u201cSecretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defence Secretary Jim Mattis opposed the move from Tel Aviv,\u201d Reuters said in its report, citing US officials. The Palestinian Hamas movement declared a day of rage on Friday to protest the move. The US consulate in Jerusalem issued a security warning barring government employees and their families from personal travel in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City or the West Bank, including Bethlehem and Jericho.\u201cA decision such as this is both morally wrong and politically dangerous,\u201d Yousef Munayyer, executive director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, said in a statement. \u201cNot only is Donald Trump deliberately insulting the Palestinian people, but also Arabs and Muslims around the world. In doing so, he is relinquishing what little credibility the United States had left in a region that is already rife with conflict and division.\u201d Egypt\u2019s President Abdel Fatah el-Sissi on Tuesday pushed the US not to relocate the embassy and said in a statement he spoke with Trump by phone about the issue. The Saudi foreign ministry issued a statement saying the move would \u201cprovoke sentiments of Muslims throughout world.\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, meanwhile, said the US recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital would be a \u201cred line\u201d for Muslims. In a televised speech after Trump\u2019s announcement, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Jerusalem is the \u201ceternal capital of the State of Palestine.\u201d Abbas added that the US president\u2019s speech was \u201ctantamount to the United States abdicating its role as a peace mediator.\u201d Meanwhile, Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip staged a demonstration against the US and Israel, condemning Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said in a statement that the Palestinian people \u201cknow how to respond properly\u201d. He added that the decision \u201cwill not change the facts of history and geography.\u201d As many protesters have gathered outside the US consulate in Istanbul in reaction to Trump\u2019s announcement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry denounced the speech as an \u201cirresponsible statement.\u201d Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also said Trump\u2019s recognition does not automatically make Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, UK Prime Minister Theresa May, and French President Emmanuel Macron, also said that Jerusalem\u2019s status must be resolved through direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Pope Francis, who met earlier Wednesday at the Vatican with a Palestinian delegation, voiced his own opposition to the US shift in Israel, urging a continuation of \u201ceveryone\u2019s commitment to respect the city\u2019s status quo, in conformity with the pertinent United Nations Resolutions.\u009d\u201cMy thoughts go to Jerusalem and I cannot keep silent my deep concern for the situation that has been created in the past days,\u201d the pope said. \u201cI pray to the Lord that its identity is preserved and strengthened for the benefit of the Holy Land, the Middle East and the whole world and that wisdom and prudence prevail to prevent new elements of tension from being added to a global context already convulsed by so many cruel conflicts.\u201d Within the Trump administration, some saw the warnings as overblown, according to media reports. One senior White House official compared the decision to Trump\u2019s move to pull the US from the Paris climate pact\u201d a move that was preceded by dire warnings but was ultimately, if grudgingly, accepted by world leaders.

It got me randy. \nThat was a short-lived union. Or rather, a short-lived infatuation.\nThe day before I left home, my dad called his friends to give me a pep talk. I think because being the firstborn, he had this panic attacks and he was sort of the helicopter dad for the longest time. In my teenage rebellion, I naturally resented it. {The hovering, not him inviting his friends to talk to me. That I found amusing}. So they did the classic \u2013 \u2018preached\u2019. I think the cool thing about teenage is the rebellion. Otherwise there\u2019s no point being a teenager if you can\u2019t rebel {he-he}. That\u2019s why I take it easy with the teenagers around me. And they are many. Anyway, one lady told me to always picture this glass wall between me and any girl in campus because STIs were on the prowl for young men like me. I cackled, but heeded that advice nonetheless. That and many other priceless gems from that wise lot. They guided me through the tricky and sometimes treacherous campus life.\nThe next morning, buoyed with excitement, I rolled my loaded suitcase out my dad\u2019s compound to go on a journey of self-discovery. In pursuit for knowledge. I went to study literature. My kid bros escorted me to the bus terminus. In my infinite discernment, I knew they were envious. They were envious because they were still in school; Rodger in high school and Shelton in primo. They were still condemned to wearing uniforms, and for Rodger, eating bad food laced with kerosene. I had emancipated myself from that shit. I was walking into a free world. A world of endless possibilities. The world was now my oyster. \nI arrived and went through the tedious \u2013 and annoying \u2013 registration process. Public universities had no portals yet. The orientation week was quite uneventful for me. \nI booked myself into some private hostel in a \u2018student\u2019s village\u2019 outside campus because I could not stand the congested hostels in campus and their pathetic clock rooms. Heck, those freaking hostels could pass for concentration camps. I even wondered how guys got laid in such squalor and wretchedness. \nClasses began about a week later and I was bemused by how first years were socked in confusion; trouble reading their course codes and trying to find specific lecture halls. It was fun to see a guy \u2013 often times a continuing student- spotting a visibly confused fresh woman, walking right up her, confidence oozing out of his pores, and leading her where he wanted. The gold rush was at its apogee. \nThere\u2019s this morning, about a month in, when the confusion had tapered down and guys were pretty settled. I prance into the auditorium where a common unit, Fundamentals of computing, was to take place. It\u2019s like ten minutes to seven. There\u2019s chatter and banter as guys are settling down. Morning guys, those. A few others who don\u2019t like talking in the morning are tucked away, buried in their phones. Few others are reading. \nI spot her. My heart throbs.\nShe\u2019s neither engaged in banter, nor buried in her phone, nor reading. She\u2019s just sitting there. Still. That piqued my interest. In this age and time, how many of us can sit still without feeling the urge to fish out our gizmos? I think there\u2019s something about people who can just sit still without the urge to look at their phones, and yet not feel pressured to strike a conversation with the next person. I think such people are well centered. \nI walk up to her and tell her she\u2019s lighting up that room real bad. She smiles, revealing a perfect set of snow white teeth. She has high cheekbones, and her hair is pulled back into a ponytail. Her skin is rich and flawless. She\u2019s got this innocent look about her. I\u2019m sold. Smitten. We stroll from the lecture room after class. I\u2019m carrying this thick office point notebook in my left hand, my right hand deep in the pocket of my khaki pants. A small brown leather bag with a long thin strap hangs from her shoulder. Her hands are crossed on her chest, holding an A4 size note book. I pick her number. I feel like I have hit a massive jackpot. I feel like doing summersaults. But I play the nonchalant cool guy. I\u2019m outdoing myself with presence here. {lol}. That evening I refrain myself from calling because I don\u2019t want to come across as too eager. I want to come off as a different kind of cat, because I had just read somewhere that \u201cshowing that you\u2019re impressed lowers your market value\u201d. I shoot her an sms the following day at lunch time just to \u201ccheck\u201d on her. She happens close by. We link up for lunch at some caf\u00e9 near the library. Nothing fancy. We hit it off.\nTo be continued\u2026", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rodger", "sentiment": "none"},
