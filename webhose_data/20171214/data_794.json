Presenting traditional as well as less-known Christmas music, the Girls Choir will be joined by Rachel Hellwege-Vaughan, featured soloist. This amazing soprano will sing solo selections alone as well as a combined piece with the Girls Choir. Also assisting the choir will be Jeanette Hill on flute. Admission to all PSGC concerts is always free. However, all donations and proceeds from the sale of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory bars will go toward the Girls Choir\u2019s summer trip in August 2018 to New York City. \u201cThis trip is a large undertaking, but it is so important for our girls to experience the arts in a world-class city,\u201d said director Linda Parker. The NYC trip will cross curricula by including not only attending performances of classical music and musical theater. The girls will also see many historical sights. The trip will include visits to the Statue of Liberty, the 9/11 Memorial and the Empire State Building. The girls will also participate in a workshop at the Museum of Modern Art. \u201cOur girls have benefited immensely over the years from the summer trips that have been provided by our organization. The Pagosa community has fulfilled dreams for the girls by supporting our efforts through their generosity. While we are dependent largely on donations, the girls do their part as well to raise funds for summer educational trips by selling chocolate, hosting bake sales and performing at our annual \u2018Over the Rainbow\u2019 fundraiser,\u201d Parker said. PSGC has traveled to Santa Fe, N.M., to see the opera; the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, area to see professional and community musical theater; Vail, Colo., to see the New York Philharmonic; and last summer took them to Salt Lake City to see and hear the famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir. This concert is sure to get you into the holiday spirit. Come hear the beautiful singing of these lovely young musicians. Join us Thursday, Dec. 7, for \u201cJingle All the Way\u201d at the Community United Methodist Church beginning at 7 p.m.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeff laydonthe pagosa springs g", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda parker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel hellwege-vaughan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeanette hill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pagosa springs girls choir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york philharmonic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "girls choir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "community united methodist church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "museum of modern art", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psgc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa fe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas/fort worth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.m.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "empire state building", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salt lake city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colo.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pagosa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:07.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e35358112f3a08d3f1c42d7c05cc4edeed5644ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbU1RQqGLQ7tgqRFImdosWxlx.NiA4Yy.57Uar4aFt_g2WS2oX.p7yKNQ8tVfiNSmzr1okPJh.UkBG5p0MFXGxfC_CoaGu66vCQ--", "site_full": "www.expedia.fr", "site": "expedia.fr", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.fr/Castenaso-Hotel.d5746.Voyage-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotel Castenaso - R\u00e9servez au meilleur prix avec Expedia.fr", "title": "Grand Hotel Elite", "title_full": "Grand Hotel Elite (Bologne, Italie) | Expedia.fr", "published": "2017-10-05T19:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21453, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "79754536e8f1e26a4d63917e285d70c92df0766c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbU1RQqGLQ7tgqRFImdosWxlx.NiA4Yy.57Uar4aFt_g2WS2oX.p7yKNQ8tVfiNSmzr1okPJh.UkBG5p0MFXGxfCfkY_uN2zjMOeELmEGYIB9WcZTH7F8UosUO7E4GoZrmQ--", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-05T19:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Grazie alle posizione dell hotel ho girato Bologna a piedi tranquillamente .

Your journeys began in disparate parts of the galaxy, on Alluvion, or Miridem, or too many other worlds to list, but they\u2019ve all had the same things in common. Just starting it meant losing your whole world, and to make it this far has cost you anything you had left. \" \u2015LCDR Ambrose addresses the potential trainees. \nArriving in Onyx's orbit on July 7th, 2544, the recruits were shuttled down to the planet's surface on Pelican dropships and landed just before sundown in the fields surrounding Camp Currahee , the SPARTAN-IIIs' dedicated training facility. There, the hundreds of children were met by Lieutenant Commander Ambrose, who gave a speech about what they would be doing there and what they would become, having a pair of drill instructors in SPI armor appear with him to further impress and interest the recruits. Informing them of their chance at training to exact revenge or become heroes as Spartans, they would have to go through one last pretest, the same as had been given to Alpha and Beta companies before. The children were herded back into the Pelicans, where drill instructors outfitted them with Falcon Wing parachute harnesses and ordered them to jump once the dropships had lifted back off. Nearly every recruit made the jump, only twelve finding they lacked the nerve, and one critically injured when he failed to deploy his chute soon enough. These were each taken back aboard a prowler and away from Onyx, with Beta-5's agents wiping their memories to protect the secrecy of the SPARTAN-III program. The remaining 343 children, however, were given numerical Spartan tags and had completed their transition from candidates, to recruits, to trainees. When they first arrived on Onyx, many of the potential Spartans were little more than scared children. \nThe following day, the trainees were first subjected to the intensive physical and mental conditioning composing the first phase of their training. Hours before dawn, they were forcibly woken by their drill instructors and began a series of different exercises each day, from calisthenics and runs to more specialized games, some of which, like Ring the Bell , had been used in the SPARTAN-IIs' training, while others developed by Ambrose himself specifically for the SPARTAN-IIIs were even more challenging. These exercises were broken only by three high-nutrition meals and a prolonged rotation in one of a handful of classrooms on the base, where they continued, or in some cases began, academic study. The trainees had been previously sorted into classes based on assessments of prior knowledge made before their recruitment, and for the first few weeks, the lower-level classes were instructed much more rigorously in order to bring every trainee up to the same level, which was made possible by individual attention and tutoring from Deep Winter . The AI served as their instructor for all basic subjects, while specialized topics were taught by expert members of the base staff. The aspiring Spartans' days would only come to an end well after the sunset of Onyx's extended 28-hour rotation. Individual Development Edit \nIn a year, the trainees had reached the pinnacle of physical condition for their age. Now that they only needed to maintain their physiques as they grew, the exercise routine was relaxed, allowing time to be spent on developing the trainees' skill sets. While the proper ways to maintain their appearances, address superiors and march in formation had already been drilled into them, and information about tactics, military structure, and chain of command had been passed on in the classroom, they now began to learn the basic functions of soldiering in earnest, such as combat training and first aid. This included their introduction to firearms, though the recruits were forbidden from actually firing a weapon, deemed still too young to be trusted with live rounds. Instead, they were tested on their recognition of every weapon employed by the UNSC and knowledge of its use, as well as ability to assemble, disassemble, and maintain them. The principle weapon given to each trainee for their individual practice was the MA5K carbine , modified to use specifically tactical training paint rounds . Samples of Covenant equipment had also been brought to Onyx for the trainees' benefit, with lessons emphasizing what types of Covenant troops carried each weapon and how to specifically counter them. \nCamp Currahee would also receive two new drill instructors that year who would prove invaluable assets, though their procurement came at a great cost. As Gamma Company's cadets were running drills and practicing their aim, their predecessors in Beta Company were already taking the fight to the Covenant in high-risk operations across human space and beyond, far behind Covenant lines. When a new Covenant fuel refinery was discovered on the border of UNSC space in June of 2545, an installation which could allow the Covenant to launch strikes deep into human territory, plans were drawn up for the Spartans of Beta to assault and destroy the facility: Operation: TORPEDO . Within minutes of their landfall on the moon of Pegasi Delta , however, a grievous tactical error was realized as seven Covenant warships docked at the fuel depot deployed their troops as reinforcements. Beta Company was slaughtered, but the members of Team Foxtrot managed to complete their mission by blowing up the refinery and taking the Covenant ships with it, at the cost of half their team. This left Tom-B292 and Lucy-B091 the only survivors of the operation, and the latter traumatized to the point of being unable to speak. Although Colonel Ackerson wanted to recruit Tom as a personal agent and have Lucy classified unfit for duty, Ambrose interceded on their behalf and secured both as instructors for future Spartans. Veteran Spartans and graduates of Camp Currahee, Tom-B292 and Lucy-B091 would make ideal mentors. \nTheir arrival couldn't have come at a better time, as the trainees were just starting to learn about the Semi-Powered Infiltration Armor they'd soon be using. When the time came, Tom and Lucy sped the process of acclimatizing the Gamma trainees to their armor through what they'd picked up about its quirks in the field, insights not even the washout instructors of Alpha or Beta had. In addition, Tom took it upon himself to mentor several of the younger Spartans who were lagging behind, having himself been among the lower-ranked members of his company before them. Their presence, however, led to curiosity among the trainees about where the rest of their company was, and soon, these questions made their way to Ambrose. Though it was a matter of some concern, Ambrose decided to be straightforward with his charges. The trainees were shown what little records existed of Alpha and Beta companies' fates, forcing the Gammas to confront the reality that even with the best equipment and training available, the types of missions they were likely to take on meant they could very likely all die fighting the Covenant. Some had already accepted this reality and reacted by throwing themselves further into their instruction, but the fact that many did not share the typical revenge-motivated background meant many trainees needed time to process the realization. In time, however, it would leave the trainees with a strengthened sense of resolve and lead them to work harder in the interest of their own survival, and not one of them requested to stop. Feeling more confident because of this than he'd been with either of their predecessors, Ambrose found himself more willing to consider taking chances with them. Team Assignment Edit \nOnce they'd become well-versed in every aspect of using both their armor and equipment, more than capable fighters individually, the trainees were divided into randomly-assigned five-man teams each day and put through challenges that forced them to work as a unit, sometimes in coordination with other teams and applying tactics and strategies they'd learned in the classroom. Mastering maneuvers quickly, the teams went on to capture-the-flag, assault, and territory-control games first against automated turrets and armed DIs, then against rival teams. Meanwhile, each trainee's individual teamwork skills and psychological profiles were being carefully monitored by the staff as data to determine the permanent team rosters, finalized in 2547. At Ambrose's discretion, more risks were taken in experimenting with team compositions, such as placing one of the company's most skilled leaders, Jake-G293 , in charge of four of their worst and most undisciplined soldiers to form Team Jian . Though Jian did not turn out to be a success, other experiments, most notably Teams Saber and Katana , excelled in comparison to even the best normally-formated 'control' teams, such as Gladius . Excruciating care was taken in the selection process, aiming to find the highest-performing permutations possible of the entire company, as these teams were expected to work with and rely upon each other for the remainder of their lives. \nThese rigorous methods were in preparation for the most brutal form of training Ambrose ever devised: Trial by Fire. In the cases of both preceding classes of SPARTAN-IIIs, widespread loss of discipline had led to disaster. First, during Operation: PROMETHEUS , Alpha Company lost their ability to function as a unit in the face of overwhelming Covenant reinforcements. Cut off from extraction and direction, its disorganized members were left to be hunted to exhaustion by a constant stream of fresh Covenant troops, run down, and killed in one small, defenseless group after another. To keep this from repeating in Beta Company, Ambrose stressed the importance of independent initiative, but in Operation: TORPEDO, the inexperienced soldier chosen as their commander would panic and give the Omega-Three order, abandoning the mission and dashing any hopes of a second attempt by scattering the Spartans in a disorganized retreat, dooming them. Only by disobeying did members of Team Foxtrot survive, completing the mission at the cost of half their squad. To make certain such a catastrophic end would never befall the Spartans of Gamma, Ambrose designed a War Game meant to prepare the trainees for instances of extreme stress by putting them through exactly such situations, first implementing it in early 2548. Members of a newly-formed team adjust to working together. \nAfter the company's finalized five-trainee teams had acclimatized to working closely together, adopting a naming convention based on close combat weapons such as Dao and Rondel, the first Trial by Fire exercise began by dropping off each team at a random location in a kilometers-wide swath of Onyx's wilderness. Given limited supplies and rations, they were instructed to use any means necessary to outfight and outcompete the other teams until only one was left standing. In addition, the jungle within the boundaries of the zone had been laid thick with traps, from simple snares to automated machine gun turrets, while TTR-armed drill instructors would hunt them constantly, herding them into further conflict with their environment and each other. These exercises could last for days, taking a heavy toll on the trainees' physical and psychological endurance. While success in placement was important, the ability of a team leader to keep his or her comrades in check and maintain effective teamwork was looked on as far more favorable, but few teams were capable of such restraint their first time. Some who failed to adapt to such extreme stress were given leave of a few days to recover, and a few even washed out entirely, their memories wiped and sent off-world altogether. Yet, Ambrose continued to push them harder, his fear of a repeat of Alpha and Beta Companies' demise blinding him to the brewing unrest. Operation: JAILBREAK Edit \nThe exercises were hard on all of Gamma's trainees, most of whom understood and pitied the few who had broken for nearly succumbing themselves. Already discontent with the sharp increase in the harshness of their training, the trainees were outraged upon learning several of their friends and teammates, who'd already shouldered the burdens of years of training alongside them, had washed out over the events, exacerbating the company's fraying temperaments. Instances of insubordination and fighting rose exponentially, and Ambrose, taking this lack of restraint as a sign of exactly the loss in discipline he'd feared, only cracked down even more with curfews and inspections. The mood in Camp Currahee might have gone so far as to become dangerous, were it not for the actions of a few rebellious trainees. On July 7th, 2548, as Gamma Company assembled on the parade ground to be loaded into Pelicans and deployed on another Trial by Fire exercise, a whole section of the camp's perimeter fence suddenly went up in an explosion, leaving a massive gap straight into Onyx's dense jungles. It was then a cry went up from several sources amongst the company: jailbreak. Members of teams Machete, Scimitar , Xiphos , Shoto , and Jian, most of them among the less serious-minded teams with not as much to lose in the ranked standings, had collaborated to organize a company-wide breakout of Gamma's trainees, intending to break free of the drill instructors' tyranny. \nMore than two-thirds of Gamma Company decided to follow, fleeing en masse into the jungle as base staff tried ineffectually to capture the runaways. While a few were restrained, Gamma's far superior numbers allowed the vast majority to escape while the instructors had to take time to properly organize a response, the remaining third of the company looking on in shock. Ambrose was furious, but more than that, afraid. The renegade trainees had fled north, directly for Zone 67 . The ONI-restricted site was off-limits to the trainees, and for good reason; during Beta Company's training, a team of recruits had lost contact and were never found after straying into its boundaries. Now that they were free of the instructors' control, the children were guaranteed to want to break the rules and cross its border, and Ambrose feared they might suffer the same fate. With this close in mind, he asked Deep Winter to devote more assistance and directed the search efforts himself. The escaped trainees, meanwhile, were thoroughly enjoying themselves. Excited by the unprecedented revolt, once they made it what they deemed a safe distance away, the Gammas began doing whatever they pleased, playing, swimming, and climbing to their hearts' content. Several teams regrouped, and these 'platoons' put the equipment they'd been issued for the day's exercise\u2014MA5Ks with TTR rounds, flashbang grenades, rations, etc.\u2014together, intending to resist when the drill instructors inevitably came after them. \nOver the course of the next week, the trainees retained their independence in spite of weathering a fierce storm, coordinated capture attempts by the instructors, and eventually the involvement of the trainees who'd stayed behind or been captured already as a means to pursue the renegades. The pursuit nearly turned lethal on several occasions, resulting in numerous injuries but no actual fatalities, even when the last few escapees crossed Zone 67's border. Incidents there which took place would be sanctioned with the highest levels of classification. But, at the escapade's end, the young Spartans of Gamma had been given an opportunity to blow off steam and become all the closer for resisting authority together, and Ambrose realized with some assistance that he'd been driving the candidates too hard. While Trial by Fire exercises were still used, their frequency was relaxed in favor of more team-building War Games, individual development, and focus on leadership training. The whole affair eventually became something of a joke looked on fondly by Gamma's members, wryly dubbed in hindsight as \"Operation: JAILBREAK.\" Final Preparation Edit The death of SPARTAN-073 in augmentation was just one of the many files shown to the Gamma candidates. \nBy early 2550, Gamma Company had received the most extensive and advanced training in the UNSC, collectively proficient as commandos in every field of military science and combat to a degree that could rival some of the best special forces units, but were untested, and the most dangerous phase still had yet to come. Even after they had passed every test and challenge set before them, over a hundred trainees in both Alpha and Beta Companies had fallen victim to side-effects of the SPARTAN-IIIs' bioaugmentation procedures and died because their genetic profiles were incompatible or physical bodies couldn't handle the process' stress. Since Gamma Company's inception, however, Kurt had commissioned a washout of Beta Company named Aspen-B145 to research and develop improvements and countermeasures to the side-effects in hopes of boosting the survival rate, but knowing the inherent risks to the trainees were still great, Kurt found he couldn't commit his charges to the danger blindly. In May, just before final preparations began, Kurt personally led a briefing for the entire company in which he showed the trainees recordings of what had happened to the subjects of both previous SPARTAN-III classes and the SPARTAN-IIs before them, successful and failed alike. Once they understood the process would irrevocably change, if not maim or outright kill them, Ambrose gave them an open offer to opt out of the program if they so chose, albeit with a wiped memory. To his surprise, not one of the trainees took him up on it, having come too far to simply give up. Now that they'd made the choice again to remain with the program, old enough to be fully aware of the risks involved, Ambrose authorized the start of preoperative conditioning. \nThe pacing of scrimmage exercises was drastically reduced, and replaced with more calisthenics and, to the delight of the trainees, free time. This was to help ensure the trainees' psychological heath as the base's medical staff began giving them injections to induce an artificial early puberty, a developmental phase necessary to prevent their bodies from fatally rejecting the augmentations. Naturally, this was a stressful time in the childrens' lives, and the unnaturally rapid changing of their bodies and minds only compounded problems. As their bodies grew, the trainees were perpetually compensating for changes in their anatomy and struggled to re-learn skills they'd had almost since the beginning of training, leading to enormous frustration. Worse, for the first time they were experiencing attractions and feelings they were unprepared to deal with, which led to many embarrassing and distressful situations. The exercises, however, gave them something to focus on, and the abundance of personal time allowed them to process feelings and indulge their own interests, or find them for the first time, helped considerably. By the end of the nine-month-long treatments, still only twelve years old on average, the trainees' age appeared to be at least fifteen and well on their way to adulthood. \nBut before being approved for augmentation, each trainee had to pass a final, individual test. These trials were designed by the base staff using data accumulated from throughout all the years they'd spent on Onyx, and were unique to each trainee. They focused on what were perceived as each's greatest weaknesses, be it in temperament, knowledge, or skill, and challenged every one to overcome problems they'd routinely displayed in the course of their training. Though not always easily, and to varying degrees of satisfaction, not one failed to rise to the challenge presented to them, and augmentation procedures for the company were authorized. The number of those who'd advanced to this stage, however, exceeded the three hundred slots Colonel Ackerson had approved the company for, and Ambrose faced the impossible decision of identifying thirty who'd rightfully earned their place to be cut at random. Finding he didn't have the heart to go through with it, Ambrose submitted a petition for thirty additional slots for augmentation, and Ackerson was only too happy to oblige. At last, the most critical stage in the making of Spartans arrived. Augmentation \" They\u2019re ready. I hope we are. We\u2019re taking a hell of a risk. \" \u2015LCDR Ambrose, aboard the UNSC Hopeful . [1] Built from a pair of scrapped refit stations, the Hopeful was converted by a private medical company and appropriated by the UNSC to become the largest mobile hospital in history. \nIn January of 2551, the UNSC Hopeful , a civilian station retrofitted as a battlefield hospital, was recalled by Admiral Margaret Parangosky herself, head of ONI. Its commander, Vice Admiral Ysionris Jeromi , was ordered to take his vessel to a remote, top-secret location in deep space, where it would play host to Gamma Company's augmentation procedures as it had with Alpha and Beta. Ambrose and a cadre of ONI's own medical staff came aboard several days early to make preparations, clearing a whole eight decks surrounding where they would actually take place to protect the program's secrecy. Then, on February 19th, the trainees arrived and were taken to individually-partitioned compartments, each going through the painful procedures alone. They would not be the only ones, however. A handful of those whom had supposedly 'washed out' of the program had instead been taken to the far side of Onyx to begin an even more intensive, specialized training geared towards high-risk missions behind enemy lines, operating independently for what could be very extended periods. Known as the Headhunters , these few were brought aboard separately and kept on the far side of the surgical floor, where they too underwent the same augmentations. Furthermore, Aspen's work expanding the range of those who could survive the procedures allowed for some of the Alpha and Beta washouts, whom had been kept within the program as instructors, to go through the process. While it would entail more risk than the Gammas, who were in the ideal age range for augmentation, many of those who'd aspired to be Spartans before jumped at the chance to realize their old hopes. [2] \nThe first twenty-four hours of the process were the most critical, as the initial surgeries and introductions of various chemical agents into their bodies were the leading causes of death for the previous Spartan classes. Though latent improvements to the procedures prevented an untold number of complications from ever occurring, many augmentees still experienced dramatic, potentially lethal side-effects. Fortunately, a multitude of reactive treatments had been developed to counteract these inevitabilities, such as cardiac arrest crashes caused by the muscle densifiers or horrible disfiguration from skeletal structures outstripping the rest of the body's growth, which saved many of the patients' lives. By the period's end, however, every one of Gamma's trainees had survived the processes, and initial tests indicated they would all survive the week-long period of supplemental procedures to come. For all intents, they had graduated as full-fledged Spartans, and Kurt congratulated them all personally. Before doing so, however, he was summoned by Vice Admiral Jeromi, who though suspicious of ONI's interference with his vessel in the past, had never gotten involved before. Jeromi presented Kurt with a slipspace COM probe of unknown origin, and lent him the secure captain's office to listen. The sender was Deep Winter, who discovered the augmentation list had been tampered with, and before his fragment expired, warned Kurt to halt the procedures. Kurt disregarded this warning, however, and instead contacted ONI to have Winter's memory purged before the AI was decommissioned\u2014Kurt had been responsible for the modifications himself. \" [T]his is a mutagen that alters key regions in a subject's frontal lobe. It enhances aggression, making the animal part of the mind more accessible in times of stress. Someone so mutated has reserves of strength and endurance no normal human could call upon. Such a person could also continue to fight under the influence of wide systemic shock that would instantly kill another Human. The mutagen, however, depresses the higher reason centers of the brain over time. The antipsychotic and bipolar integration drugs counter this effect. As long as the SPARTAN-III's have these agents in their system, they compensate. You must halt the protocol. Brain mutagens were specifically outlawed by the UNSC MED CORPS in 2513. The moral argument algorithms are robust. \" \u2015Deep Winter's warning to Kurt Ambrose. [3] \nThese additions were in the form of brain-altering mutagenic compounds, targeted to increase aggression and resist systemic shock in the recipient to keep them standing and fighting long after their bodies should have shut down. Such mutations had been outlawed by the UNSC Medical Corps for over half a century, but Kurt had conspired with Colonel Ackerson to have them included regardless. Made desperate by the loss of two generations of children he'd trained, Kurt had resorted to this as the last possible edge he could give Gamma Company, despite the risk of potentially fatal side-effects later on in life. While many would live to eventually pay dearly for his actions, it went undiscovered for the time being. Once the procedures were finished and the Spartans given enough time to start their recovery, enduring rough physical therapy to get used to their remade bodies, they were returned to Onyx to complete their training. While most of their scars would heal within the first month, the heightened speed, strength, and reflexes they now possessed made them clumsy, and it would take several more just to reach the point at which they'd previously been. By the end of six months, however, the young Spartans had adapted completely and exceeded all their previous achievements. Not only did they learn to combine the advantages of augmentation with their armor and weapons individually, but it was accounted for in their tactics, developing new strategies which made use of speed and mobility impossible for anyone without their enhanced abilities. It became dangerous for their drill instructors, with the exceptions of Tom and Lucy, to engage them in even mock combat, and the Gammas were left with only each other to scrimmage against. Defended by a fleet of five hundred ships, an assault against the massive command-and-control station would have spelled doom for Gamma Company as surely as PROMETHEUS and TORPEDO. \nAt this point, Gamma Company was in top shape and ready for its first taste of combat, but were delayed by Kurt's own intervention, for reasons both justified and unjustified. This late in the war, the Covenant had long ago obliterated or forced the UNSC to lose contact with all but a few of the Outer Colonies and had rapidly swept through the core worlds. With their situation looking increasingly hopeless, High Command was already considering a mission for Gamma Company's first deployment which had the same projected outlook as PROMETHEUS and TORPEDO before. The groundwork for what was dubbed Operation: HUMILITY had been based on insights gleaned from intercepted Covenant fleet communications about a massive new weapon being built to lead a fleet tasked solely with the destruction of humanity's most heavily-defended worlds. If undertaken, the mission would involve a boarding of the battleship in space, regardless of its state of completion. Knowing all too well what could go wrong in such EVA missions from personal experience, Kurt petitioned with Ackerson and Parangosky against the operation, stating he wanted to keep the Gammas on Onyx for observation a little while longer to watch for side-effects of the illegal augmentations he'd added. He was able to sway them, and their influence was enough to postpone the mission for at least two months, during which the colony of Merken, the only remaining world distant enough to serve as a launching point for an operation that deep in Covenant space, was glassed, leading plans for Operation: HUMILITY to be scrubbed. Though relieved he'd saved his proteges from disaster, Kurt knew had the Spartans been deployed that they might've been able to do something about Merken, and had to bear the guilt of those possibilities squarely on his shoulders. \nThe company, in the meantime, were given more time to familiarize themselves with the strategies and skills of their enemies, including receiving a new shipment of the latest recovered Covenant weapons and technology, and further develop their own. To keep them from distracting themselves with thoughts of real warfare, Kurt announced that Gamma Company's training would finish with a competition for top honors, naming the company's commander as the leader of the winning team. The teams highest in the standings immediately redoubled their efforts, while those near the bottom went on with business as usual. The tournament consisted of not only head-to-head scrimmage matches between teams, but tests of teamwork and individual skill, all contributing to a point total which would determine the winner. While they waited, however, word reached Onyx of the Fall of Reach , the military center of the UNSC. With its destruction, the members of Gamma Company understood the backbone of humanity's fighting force was broken, but rather than fear, found resolve in knowing their place within it would be that much more important. The lead-up to the tournament lasted nine months, until Kurt activated it as his last stall against ONI. Over a three-month period, each time strove to make its mark by placing as high as they could, until three final contestants were declared: Teams Saber, Katana, and Gladius. The tournament had pushed every team to its limit, and more, each team had pushed themselves to their limits, even the lowest among them far exceeding expectations. Deployment Edit Shepard-G127 : \" Hey Machete, this is Shoto. We're being sent just a few hundred miles north of you guys, so if you end up needing help, give us a call. \" Kodiak-G114 : \" No one gets in trouble like us, Shepard. If it's enough to get us in over our heads, you guys wouldn't be enough to bail us out. \" Viggo-G132 : \" Scimitar's orders take us to the same front. Don't worry about it, guys, we'll watch their backs. \" Victoria-G013 : \" Rapier will be down there, too. We all will. Stay sharp, Gamma. \" \u2014 Com chatter between teams as Gamma Company disembarks aboard Pelicans for Earth. \nIn mid-October, 2552, a veritable fleet of ONI's prowler stealth vessels started arriving in the Zeta Doradus System, bringing with them word that Earth had come under attack and Gamma Company was to deploy immediately in response. By this time, however, certain teams had already left. Though Kurt had managed to delay the full company's deployment, a number of factions within ONI and the UNSC had turned their eyes on the abundance of highly-capable new operatives, and in several cases, Kurt had no recourse to object. These teams were picked out of Gamma Company before the top honors competition to serve as covert or special ops forces in various branches and subdivisions of the military, not to be reunited with other members of the company for a very long time. Those who remained, however, were shuttled aboard the prowlers with the exceptions of Saber, Katana, and Gladius, who would remain on Onyx to compete in the final phase of the tournament. On October 25th, the prowlers departed, marking the last time any of them would ever see Onyx as they were taken to see their first\u2014and for many, last\u2014combat action. Unlike Alpha and Beta Companies, Gamma would not deploy as a single unit, the desperate and widespread Battle of Earth demanding their presence in theaters of war across the planet. Some teams, meanwhile, were deployed to completely different solar systems for missions of critical importance, such as quelling insurrection on planets being hastily prepared as military and civilian fallback points for ships evacuating Earth, should it fall. Thrown into the most desperate and pitched battles of the war, many teams would endure their first casualties, but for every loss, other Gammas would serve with distinction against the most impossible odds, each a testament to the unit's training and capability to prove their brethren worthy of the title Spartans. Though dispersed between myriad paths of military service and civilian lives, the members of Gamma Company would go on to lead remarkable lives. \nThose left behind on Onyx would find themselves in a battle of their own soon enough, as within a week of the company's departure, the standby signal for the Halo Array set in motion by the Master Chief activated the Shield World lying beneath Onyx's surface, beginning the Battle of Onyx . Gladius and two members of Team Saber perished in the fighting, and the rest retreated into the Shield World with Blue Team shortly before the planet shook itself apart, to be recovered months later in February, 2553. By this time, the Battle of Earth and, consequently, Human-Covenant War were over, leaving the survivors of Gamma Company without a war to fight nor home to go back to. Without immediate orders, many teams assisted in the clean-up of Earth, hunting down pockets of Covenant holdouts or participating in search-and-rescue ops. Shortly after Saber and Katana's recovery, however, their plight came to the attention of Margaret Parangosky, head of ONI, who after the arrest of Dr. Catherine Halsey for the ethical failings of the SPARTAN-II program, had Gamma Company, and many other SPARTAN-III units, disbanded. Their members were given a choice to reintegrate to civilian life, being given a second chance at the lives that had been taken from them, or join the SPARTAN-IVs in the newly-formed Spartan Branch . Most chose the latter, officially losing their tags and being referred to by their restored last names, though some stubbornly clung to their identity as SPARTAN-IIIs. Others, already shuffled into the commands of other branches of service, continued serving outside the authority of either, though a select few indeed accepted retirement happily, going so far as to have their augmentations removed to what degree was possible, though they still lived under constant ONI supervision and sanctions, resulting in frustrating social isolation for some. \nThe illegal brain alterations which were implemented alongside their approved augmentations would eventually lead to complications for many Gammas in the later years of their lives. Some gradually lost their higher brain functions as their booster shots, the reason for their necessity not fully understood for a while, were neglected, and a few even died from complications. It should also be noted that Gamma Company had the highest number of rogue Spartans of any group ever produced, and some classified theories exist that these alterations to their thought processes are what caused so many to defect. Rogue Spartans were highly sought after by the UNSC and ONI to keep their secrets under wraps, and to combat Spartans, other Spartans were dispatched\u2014including Gammas, bringing former comrades into opposition. Regardless, the variety and extent of the roles Gamma Company took up has made them arguably the most prolific group of Spartans behind only the SPARTAN-IIs, leaving a significant mark on the galaxy. Augmentations Main Article: Project CHRYSANTHEMUM A medical readout of Project: CHRYSANTHEMUM. \nWhile the most intensive phase of augmentation occurred in 2551, the final preparation of Gamma Company's recruits for the process began nine months earlier in May 2550, with Commander Ambrose briefing them on the extent and risk of augmentation and offering them the choice to go through with it, which all three-hundred and thirty candidates accepted. They were introduced to a modified diet which contained several vitamin and mineral supplements to maximize their physical development, in addition to mild growth hormones, artificially inducing puberty in the candidates to accelerate their bodies' growth to full maturity. [4] On February 19th, 2551, Gamma Company was brought aboard the UNSC Hopeful to undergo the chemical augmentation procedures themselves, and required a final recovery phase to heal and adapt to the results which lasted for more than a year. \nThe augmentations themselves were based upon the procedures performed on their SPARTAN-II predecessors, but with the benefit of more than two and a half decades' worth of advancement making them much safer for the augmentees. Since Alpha Company, the augmentations had been induced chemically rather than surgically, a practice which continued with Gamma. Though the procedures administered to each class prior to Gamma had experienced a high rate of fatal complications, research by Beta Company washout Aspen-B145 was able to finally bring the casualty rate of the SPARTAN Program down to zero percent, with every member of Gamma surviving augmentation. In individual partitions, the candidates were sedated and infused with shock reducers, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, anticoagulants, and pH buffering drugs to stabilize them while the body-altering augmentations took effect, which included: 8942-LQ99, a carbide ceramic ossification catalyst which hardened the subject's skeletal structure to the point of being virtually unbreakable. 88005-MX77, a fibroid muscular protein complex which increased the density and strength of muscle tissue. 88947-OP24, a retina-inversion stabilizer which significantly improved the eye's sharpness and granted the subject virtually-perfect night vision. 87556-UD61, a drug which reacted with the augmentations' colloidal neural disunification solution to boost reaction time. \nUnknown to all but Lieutenant Commander Ambrose, Colonel Ackerson, and a handful of ONI personnel, however, three additions were made to the drug compounds which modified the brains of Gamma Company's members in direct violation of the UNSC Medical Corps ' ban on brain alteration procedures: Cyclodexione-4, a bipolar integration drug. Miso-olanzapine, an anti-psychotic drug. 009762-OO, a non-carcinogenic mutagenic compound which altered critical regions of the brain's frontal lobe. \nThese additions were secretly pushed for by Ambrose, under the belief that they would provide the Spartans with a better chance of survival. In situations of extreme stress, the Gammas would be able to access a more primal and aggressive part of their brain and call upon boundless reserves of strength and endurance, while ignoring the effects of normally-lethal system-wide shock. The cost at which this came, however, was potentially devastating. Without monthly boosters of cyclodexione and miso-olanzapine, the mutagen would have a negative effect on higher brain function and could potentially be fatal. \nThese consequences have manifested only two known times, and differently in each. The first occurred in the infamous traitor Simon-G294 after his separation from the UNSC, and resulted in the development of an alternate persona which was dubbed \"Stray,\" potentially a side-effect of being denied the bipolar integration drug. The second was in Amber-G330 after her desertion, and irrevocably altered her previous personality and morals to the point of being unrecognizable. In 2558, however, through helping Simon deal with the effects of the mutagen, derelict Spartan Cassandra-G006 developed a drug compound which permanently eliminated the need for boosters in a member of Gamma Company, effectively curing those who acquired it of the condition, though any damage already done was irreparable.

JobAider for Capturing, Sharing, Managing Expertise \nBusiness leaders are looking for faster, better and cheaper ways to support their workforces and sharing expert job aids with JobAider is a great way to do that. Past News Releases \nRSS SANTA ROSA, Calif. (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 Peregrine Performance Group announced today JobAider\u2122, the enterprise app for creating and using job aids. With the rise in mobile learning and support, JobAider\u2122 helps an organization\u2019s workforce create job aids and make them instantly available for their co-workers to use. With JobAider\u2122, workers can share and access expertise and performance support informally and just-in-time. Russ Powell, co-founder and principal of Peregrine Performance Group stated, \u201cBusiness leaders are looking for faster, better and cheaper ways to support their workforces and job aids are a great way to do that. We all know that training can get expensive. When you have a great, useful job-aid\u2014for your workers or your customers\u2014you can reduce the need for training.\u201d Since learning and support increasingly take place anywhere and everywhere, JobAider\u2122 is a mobile tool that goes where the workforce goes. Experts use JobAider\u2122 to quickly capture what they know and do\u2014using video, audio, photos, and text\u2014and then instantly share that information across the enterprise to help others build their own expertise. When a worker needs to know how to perform a task, they can turn to JobAider\u2122 to quickly figure out what to do and how to do it\u2014from an expert. Job aids are effective learning and support tools because they provide relevant guidance to workers in small, easy-to-follow chunks at the time of need. Job aids can be used to break down simple tasks and very complicated processes into micro-learning moments. In some organizations, informal learning accounts for up to 70% of all learning activities. And it\u2019s rare to have that informal learning tracked or measured. That\u2019s another great benefit of JobAider\u2122\u2014it not only helps workers learn informally and get the support they need, it also enables business leaders to track those activities, and make more informed decisions as a result. JobAider\u2122 uses the Experience API (xAPI) to track all job aid activity on any Android or iOS device. It helps business leaders confirm assumptions and answer questions such as What are the most difficult and complex tasks my teams perform? What are the best ways to perform these tasks? Who are my experts? What tasks do my teams have trouble with the most? And what solutions are they turning to the most? JobAider can present the data it collects in an easy-to-read dashboard that provides insight for managers and learning executives so they can make more informed decisions.

Variable importance is really hard to interpret and it is really hard (or meaningless?) to set a cut-off on it. You do not know whether variable importance is about the variable itself or about interactions, plus you are losing out on non-linear transformations of variables. \nIt depends in part of what you want to do. If you want good predictions, maybe you should not care too much about whether your method is a traditional statistical model or not. \nOf course, there are plenty of things like the elastic net, LASSO, Bayesian models with the horseshoe prior etc. that fit better into a traditional modeling framework and could also accomodate e.g. splines for continuous covariates.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "lasso", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:10.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2553e28c6fe6121675a25992accc5d07350a1050", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdYO6OrZ2sDWQHsZ6NIaEmX4pXeIJdQxjnrexBClhMlZWiiHZk71lJu_TB7SBHyHCWWBmOv8G1xzQ--", "site_full": "chemistrycachet.com", "site": "chemistrycachet.com", "site_section": "http://www.chemistrycachet.com/feed", "site_categories": ["science", "chemistry"], "section_title": "Chemistry Cachet", "title": "Easy Christmas Hot Chocolate Bar with Different Flavor Options!", "title_full": "Easy Christmas Hot Chocolate Bar with Different Flavor Options!", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://chemistrycachet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Easy-Christmas-Hot-Chocolate-Bar-with-dairy-free-options.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2553e28c6fe6121675a25992accc5d07350a1050", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdYO6OrZ2sDWQHsZ6NIaEmX4pXeIJdQxjnrexBClhMlZWiiHZk71lJu_TB7SBHyHCWWBmOv8G1xzQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexis", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Easy Christmas Hot Chocolate Bar with Different Flavor Options!", "text": "Easy Christmas Hot Chocolate Bar with Different Flavor Options! December 7, 2017 \nI just love the Christmas season! This easy Christmas hot chocolate bar is the perfect way to celebrate the season with friends! \nPlus, there are so many fun flavor options you can use, there is something for everyone! \nSince many of our readers need dairy-free options, I am also including the easiest dairy-free hot chocolate you can whip up to go with this. \nOne of my favorite memories as a little girl, was getting to have my best friends over to exchange Christmas gifts then have a sleepover. We would stay up all night drinking hot chocolate, eating Christmas cookies, and dreaming about Christmas day. The fun thing is, we used these exact same mugs that you see in the photos \ud83d\ude42 I was always so excited when my mom got these out each Christmas. \nFor this years hot chocolate bar, I wanted to create some fun flavors using our favorite Christmas mugs \ud83d\ude42 PIN THIS: EASY Christmas Hot Chocolate Bar with #AToraniHoliday Things you need: Toppings (marshmallows, whipped cream, cinnamon, peppermint sticks) Festive Christmas Cookies How to get it ready: \nSet up your space with Christmas lights, decorations, and anything else to set the mood. \nDepending on how many you have, you can make a big batch of hot chocolate on the stove, or individual mugs. \nSet up all your fun Torani flavors so everyone can add there favorite flavors individually! \nHave all the fun toppings sitting out on the table so everyone can choose their favorites. \nAnd of course, you always have to have festive Christmas cookies! Making Different Flavors: \nFor a regular mug of hot chocolate (8 oz), you can add a teaspoon or two of flavor to each mug. I like to do 2 teaspoons! Feel free to add as much as you want for flavor! \nOur favorite flavors are the eggnog, cinnamon vanilla, and peppermint . They make great hot chocolates! \nFor those that need sugar-free, you can do a sugar-free hot chocolate (like the one below with stevia), then choose a sugar-free flavor. Dairy-Free Hot Chocolate Recipe 1 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk 2 tablespoons dairy-free chocolate chips 2 tsp cocoa powder (or 1 for less chocolate taste) Raw honey (1 to 2 tablespoons depending on how sweet you like it) \nDirections: \nHeat ingredients on the stove top until smooth and creamy. I like it really chocolately, so I add in the cocoa powder. It will still taste great without it, but it adds in that extra boost! \nI like raw honey for sweetener, but you can use stevia for a sugar-free option too!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:11.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a17126f172dadb7eae6ce5943c1da4bebc831330", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqmcLz1vVYzcU_aSIWbbsqlG3WCVU9dBMwTSHFPuIfIV2rYixjOIEArznFBf5C_tfdfzieC77S6O4sL0B9_RGjY", "site_full": "timinphuket.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://timinphuket.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "tim in phuket", "title": "Eating dancing shrimps", "title_full": "Eating dancing shrimps", "published": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a17126f172dadb7eae6ce5943c1da4bebc831330", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqmcLz1vVYzcU_aSIWbbsqlG3WCVU9dBMwTSHFPuIfIV2rYixjOIEArznFBf5C_tfdfzieC77S6O4sL0B9_RGjY", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tim Laven (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Eating dancing shrimps", "text": "\n\nWell I had a mouthful and happy to have tried a spoonful but I would not have it again.

(AP photo) - + KUALA LUMPUR: Embattled Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Thursday it would be a \u201cnightmare\u201d for ethnic Malays if the opposition wins elections next year. \nOpening a three-day annual assembly of his United Malays National Organization, which has ruled Malaysia since independence in 1957, Najib poked fun at the opposition coalition led by former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, saying the octogenarian was in the same league as former Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe. \nUMNO is the linchpin of Malaysia's ruling National Front coalition but its support has dwindled in the last two elections. It lost the popular vote for the first time to the opposition in 2013. \nDespite being plagued by an epic corruption scandal that involved hundreds of millions of dollars passing through his bank accounts, Najib has clung to power and his coalition is likely to win elections due by August. \nThe opposition coalition was in disarray but has converged under 92-year-old Mahathir after he made a high-profile return to politics in a bid to oust Najib. Mahathir was Asia's longest serving leader for 22 years before stepping down in 2003, and is still influential among ethnic Malay Muslims who account for about 60% of Malaysia's 32 million people. Chinese and Indians make up the rest. \n\u201cIt is odd that there are still people who are willing to be led by someone in his twilight years. Former Zimbabwe President Mugabe, who is the same age as he is, has already been rejected by his own people,\u201d Najib said. \nHe urged UMNO's more than 3 million members to stay loyal and prevent the country from falling into the opposition's hands. \n\u201cWe are at a monumental crossroad. The fate of the nation is in our hands. The nightmare that will befall us is unthinkable\u201d if the party loses, Najib said, warning that Malays will be stepped on and disparaged in their own land. \nNajib has fired critics in his own government, including an attorney-general and deputy prime minister and muzzled the media since the corruption scandal erupted two years ago. The US and several other countries are investigating allegations of cross-border embezzlement and money laundering at 1MDB, a state investment fund set up and previously led by Najib to promote economic development but which accumulated billions in debt. \nThe US Justice Department says at least $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB by associates of Najib, and it is working to seize $1.7 billion taken from the fund to buy assets in the US, potentially its largest asset seizure ever. \nIts complaint filed with a US District Court says more than $700 million landed in the accounts of \u201cMalaysian Official 1,\u201d which it did not name but through descriptions of that official's role in the fund and government, as well as other details, made clear was Najib. Malaysia's attorney-general has said the millions in Najib's accounts were a political donation from the Saudi royal family that was mostly returned. Najib has denied any wrongdoing. \nAnalysts said the 1MDB scandal didn't resonate with rural Malays, who were more irked by rising cost of living. Aided by a stronger economy, Najib recently promised financial handouts to rural folks, cut income tax, abolished tolls on several major highways and boosted infrastructure spending in the 2018 national budget. \n\u201cHe is the best prime minister of all because he takes care of our welfare,\u201d said Aisah Mahidin, who was listening to Najib's speech. \nShe said there was no proof that Najib took the money and that the US investigation was a move to smear Najib's image.

Try hand drumming Photo courtesy Paul RobertsParticipants in the hand-drumming class delight in the joy of making music. \nBy Paul Roberts Special to The PREVIEW Join musician and music therapist Paul Roberts for a free hand-drumming class at the Pagosa Lakes Clubhouse on Tuesday, Dec. 5, at noon. The class offers a welcoming environment that encourages fun, creativity, playfulness and connecting with others. Hand drums are provided for those who don\u2019t have one. Even participants who have no experience playing a musical instrument can immediately get into the groove. Stuart Brown is president of the National Institute for Play, a nonprofit that encourages the study and promotion of play. Brown claims that we\u2019re suffering from a national play deficit. \u201cIt\u2019s a public health problem,\u201d he warned. \u201cDepression, anxiety and irritability are all symptoms of a lack of play.\u201d \u201cWe almost have a guilt about it,\u201d said Susan Magsamen, senior adviser to the Johns Hopkins Brain Science Institute and Science of Learning Institute. \u201cGiving yourself permission to enjoy things makes all of your life fuller and richer. When children play, they\u2019re learning how to collaborate, empathize, solve problems and persevere. Play awakens the sort of thinking that leads us to write novels, compose music, design buildings and make scientific discoveries. Our exceptional capacity for play sets the stage for all of humanity\u2019s great advances.\u201d Albert Einstein said, \u201cPlay is the highest form of research.\u201d Adults often dismiss play as just fun; however, research suggests play is essential to our social, emotional, cognitive and physical well-being. The joy of music is a portal to the magical world of play. The drumming class is an opportunity to help reverse our national play deficit, to joyfully engage in a creative process, share a bonding experience with others, exercise brain and body, refresh and recharge. \u201cWhen I left Paul\u2019s drumming class, I felt like my brain had been massaged,\u201d said a participant. \u201cPaul\u2019s drumming sessions are delightful,\u201d said Pam Spitler. \u201cIt almost feels like when he guides me through the rhythms that I\u2019m able to get in touch with a primal, creative part of myself that must have been hiding some place.\u201d For more information about the hand-drumming class, email banjocrazy@centurytel.net or call 731-3117.

The event is Asia\u2019s largest for the automotive parts, accessories and services industries, and represents the entire supply chain for business exchange, marketing, networking and education on a global scale. This year\u2019s edition once again demonstrates the show\u2019s impressive growth path, with the final figures for this year exceeding all expectations: Visitors: 130, 928 (2016: 120,671) - 9% increase Exhibitors: 6,051 (2016: 5,756) - 5% increase Scale: 340,000 sqm (2016: 312,000) - 9% increase \nThe success of the fair and its expanded sector representation was clearly reflected on the show floor, particularly through the brand new REIFEN Zone for tyres, wheels and rims, as well as in the expanded Electronics & Systems sector and the E-Mobility & Infrastructure Zone. Visitors were impressed with the exciting displays within the Motorsports & High Performance Zone, and also with the increased number of international pavilions on offer during the fair. \nOn top of this, even more positive feedback came from Automechanika Shanghai\u2019s many concurrent fringe events, which this year totalled 57. These included the highly anticipated Connected Mobility Conference, as well as the AIAG Auto Parts Purchasing Leadership and Suppliers Summit and the 3rd Summit: Merger and Acquisition Strategies for Chinese Automotive Corporations in the Overseas Markets. The fair\u2019s participants considered each of these aspects to be a vital source for expanding their business across Asia\u2019s entire automotive industry, and have expressed their satisfaction with this year\u2019s edition. \nA detailed final report will be available soon.
