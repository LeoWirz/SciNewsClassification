The talented cast and orchestra produced spontaneous applause with their sparkling performance.\nPitlochry Theatre attracts its share of middle-aged to elderly audiences but, on this occasion, any falling into that grouping left looking at least 10 years younger. Such were the bursts of laughter and the happy smiles on the faces of the audience that it seemed there was almost an argument for tickets to be made available on the NHS .\nI could convince myself that some of those who had arrived supported by walking sticks left with them looped over an arm, while others who had arrived limping left with a spring in their step.\nIt was an outstanding and imaginative production all round.

REUTERS/KCNA \nSEOUL \u2014 Two American B-1B heavy bombers joined large-scale combat drills over South Korea on Thursday amid warnings from North Korea that the exercises and U.S. threats have made the outbreak of war \u201can established fact\u201d. \nThe annual U.S.-South Korean \u201cVigilant Ace\u201d exercises feature 230 aircraft, including a range of the U.S. military\u2019s most advanced stealth warplanes, and come a week after North Korea tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to date which it says can reach the mainland United States. \nA spokesman for the North\u2019s foreign ministry blamed the drills and \u201cconfrontational warmongering\u201d by U.S. officials for making war inevitable. \n\u201cThe remaining question now is: when will the war break out?\u201d the spokesman said late on Wednesday in a statement carried by North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency. \n\u201cWe do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it.\u201d InterAksyon \nChina, North Korea\u2019s neighbor and lone major ally, again urged calm and said war was not the answer. \n\u201cWe hope all relevant parties can maintain calm and restraint and take steps to alleviate tensions and not provoke each other,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement. \n\u201cThe outbreak of war is not in any side\u2019s interest. The ones that will suffer the most are ordinary people.\u201d \nTensions on the Korean peninsula have risen markedly in recent months after North Korea\u2019s latest missile and nuclear tests, conducted in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and international condemnation. \nSTRATEGIC BOMBERS \nOn Wednesday, a U.S. B-1B bomber flew from the Pacific U.S.-administered territory of Guam to join the exercises, which will run until Friday. \nThe flights by the B-1B, one of America\u2019s largest strike aircraft, have played a leading role in Washington\u2019s attempts to increase pressure on North Korea to abandon its weapons program. \nIn September, B-1Bs were among a formation of U.S. military aircraft that flew further north up North Korea\u2019s coast than at any time in the past 17 years, according to the U.S. Pacific Command. \nThat prompted North Korea\u2019s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, to warn that the North could shoot down the U.S. bombers even if they did not enter North Korean airspace. \n\u201cB1-B bombers have been regularly dispatched to the Korean peninsula over the past years; however, it seems that the U.S. Air Force might have enhanced its training to better prepare for actual warfare,\u201d said Yang Uk, a senior fellow at the Korea Defence and Security Forum. \nWhile B-1Bs are no longer equipped to carry nuclear weapons of their own, they would be key to any strike targeting major North Korean facilities, he said. \n\u201cThat\u2019s why North Korea has been making such a big deal when B1-B bombers are flying overhead.\u201d \nESCALATING TENSIONS \nBoth sides insist they don\u2019t want war, but blame each other for provocations while saying they will act to defend themselves. \nWhite House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said over the weekend that the possibility of war with North Korea was \u201cincreasing every day\u201d. \nU.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged the Pentagon on Sunday to start moving U.S. military dependants, such as spouses and children, out of South Korea, saying conflict with North Korea was getting close. \nThe Pentagon said it has \u201cno intent\u201d to move any dependants out of the country. \nNorth Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and the United States and says its weapons program are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. \n\u201cRecently, as the U.S. is conducting the largest-ever joint aerial drill on the Korean peninsula targeting the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, its high-level politicians are showing alarming signs by making bellicose remarks one after another,\u201d the North\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman said, using North Korea\u2019s official name. \n\u201cThese confrontational war-mongering remarks cannot be interpreted in any other way but as a warning to us to be prepared for a war on the Korean peninsula,\u201d he said. \nNorth Korea\u2019s latest missile test prompted a warning from the United States that North Korea\u2019s leadership would be \u201cutterly destroyed\u201d if war were to break out, a statement that drew sharp criticism from Russia. \nU.S. President Donald Trump has said the whole of North Korea would be destroyed in the event of war. \nThe rising tensions coincide with a rare visit to the isolated North by United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman this week, the highest-level U.N. official to visit North Korea since 2012. \nFeltman met North Korean Foreign Minister Ri on Thursday, following his meeting with the vice foreign minister a day earlier, KCNA said.

BUSINESSWORLD FILE PHOTO \nMANILA \u2013 More than three quarters of the total office supply projected to come online in 2018 are located in Bonifacio Global Center (BGC), as investors continue to flock to the central business district despite rising leasing rates, according to Santos Knight Frank, Inc. \nThe real estate services firm said on Wednesday it expects 946,782 square meters (sq.m.) of leasable office space to be added to the current office supply in 2018. Of this number, 76% or 409,377 sq.m. will be located in BGC. \nSantos Knight Frank noted rental rates in BGC already breached the P1,000 per sq.m. mark as of the third quarter. At P1,027.27 per sq.m., BGC is the second most expensive place to rent office spaces after Makati central business district (CBD), where rental rates stood at P1,263.15 per sq.m. \n\u201cRental growth in Metro Manila over the last 12 months have been the highest across Asia, due to the strong, continued demand in the office market. One thing is very clear, BPO (business process outsourcing) is sustainable,\u201d Santos Knight Frank President and Chief Executive Officer Rick Santos said in a press briefing in Para\u00f1aque on Wednesday. \nLeasing rates in the Bay Area, which covers the reclaimed land on Manila Bay, are also starting to pick up. As of the third quarter of 2017, rental rates in the Bay Area is the fourth highest at P725.43 per sq.m., next to Makati CBD, BGC, and Quezon City. InterAksyon \n\u201cWe are seeing an emergence of the Bay Area, that\u2019s being led by both BPO take-up and also the emerging online gaming industry,\u201d Morgan McGilvray, director for occupier services and commercial agency at Santos Knight Frank, said. \nBy the end of 2017, the company expects more than 600,000 sq.m. of office space to be taken up, still driven by BPOs, which account for around 60% to 70% of the take-up. However, Santos Knight Frank noted this is a slightly lower share compared to previous years, as demand from gaming firms spiked to around 30% of the total take-up. \nWith this, Santos Knight Frank Senior Director for Research and Consultancy Jan Custodio noted gaming firms would be something to watch in the property sector in the following years. \n\u201cBecause they have the flexibility of occupying any kind of space. So it\u2019s just a matter of them fitting that space to their requirements. We\u2019ve heard of gaming companies occupying old office spaces that are really antiquated,\u201d Mr. Custodio said in an interview. \nMr. Santos, meanwhile, noted the demand for BPOs will continue despite concerns on the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) taking over most BPO jobs in the next few years. A 2013 study by Oxford University, for instance, noted that 47% of all jobs are at risk in the next 50 years due to computerization. \nIn the Philippines, however, Mr. Custodio said the effects of AI has been very minimal so far, and would unlikely make any significant changes in the near future. \n\u201cFor one thing we don\u2019t have the infrastructure for that yet. Internet connection, we all know the state here is not that good yet. And AI is reliant on that kind of connectivity. So that being said, not really that much unless something drastic happens. But not in the near future,\u201d Mr. Custodio said.

It was a moment that provoked controversy, as the France international midfielder seemed to be caught out by the unusual body position of the Gunners defender. Pogba has protested that the incident was an accident and said he had misread the situation.\"I didn't really speak after the game - I didn't have time - but I think Hector, I know him as well, and I would never give him a tackle like this,\" he said.\"Unfortunately for me I thought he would put his feet and he was in a position that was a disadvantage for me so I have done it.\"It looks very bad, but the intention wasn't like that. They had the decision, the referee got the red card and that's football.\" Pogba played the full 90 minutes in Tuesday's Champions League match against CKSA Moscow, with Jose Mourinho's side coming from behind to claim a 2-1 win thanks to goals from Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford.

FILE PHOTO BY MIGUEL DE GUZMAN, PHIL. STAR \nMANILA \u2013 On the heels of President Duterte\u2019s tagging of the communist party and the New People\u2019s Army as \u201cterrorists\u201d, the Department of Justice took twin moves to have the courts formally declare them as such, and cancel the provisional liberty of their leaders who were released to join the now-scuttled peace talks with government. \nJustice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre on Thursday directed the Office of the Prosecutor General to immediately file the proper petition with a lower court for the purpose of formalizing the terrorist declaration, amid earlier concerns from legal circles that President Duterte cannot simple tag them terrorists overnight. \nTo carry out the President\u2019s wish to brand the communist rebels as \u201cterrorists\u201d and cancel peace talks, Aguirre had issued Department Order No. 779 right after Duterte issued his proclamation on Tuesday. \nAguirre also directed the Prosecutor General to coordinate with relevant agencies for the implementation of the department order. \nThe basis for declaring the communist party and its armed wing \u201cterrorists\u201d is the Human Security Act, which Sen. Francis Escudero said Thursday should be strictly followed by the government, as he warned against getting innocent parties caught in the middle of any reckless implementation of the President\u2019s orders. InterAksyon \nBACK TO DETENTION \nMeanwhile,DOH has filed a motion for recommitment and cancellation of bail against the communist leaders and consultants, who were earlier given provisional liberty so they can join the peace negotiations in the Philippines and in Norway. \nAmong them are the husband-wife team of Benito and Wilma Tiamzon, as well as Adelberto Silva, Randall Echanis and Vicente Ladlad. \nIn its motion with the Manila Regional Trial Court, the DOJ pointed out there is no longer any legal ground for the provisional liberty of these people, since Duterte has cancelled the peace talks. \nThe DOJ sought cancellation of the communist leaders\u2019 bail so they can be recommitted to prison. \nHuman rights lawyers, however, had earlier cried foul over the Duterte administration\u2019s fast-tracking of the cancellation of the talks and the bail, saying there is a process to be followed, as set by law. \nPANELO: NO MORE REASON TO KEEP THEM FREE Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo disputed the lawyers\u2019 cautionary remarks, telling Radyo 5\u2019s Punto Asintado there remains no reason for letting the communist leaders roam free. In a phone patch interview, Panelo said: \u201cEh unang-una, dati namang may mga kaso iyong mga iyan, eh. Kaya lang sila na-release sapagkat humingi tayo ng permiso sa hukuman na makalabas muna sila pansamantala. So since wala nang usapan, then the reason for their release is being terminated. Wala nang reason para hindi sila bumalik sa kulungan.\u201d [First of all, those people had prior pending cases. They were released only because we asked the court for their temporary freedom. But since there are no more peace talks, the reason of their release is gone. There\u2019s no longer any reason not to return them to jail]. \nIt\u2019s still the courts, he said, which will issue the arrest warrants, but it would be better if those concerned simply yield to authorities. \n\u201d If I were them, (unclear) mag surrender na lang, para wala nang problema,\u201d Panelo said. \nAsked by Punto Asintado host, News5 reporter Maricel Halili, what exactly the terrorist declaration on the NPA means, and whether being a mere member of the group was enough basis for an arrest, Panelo said: \u201cSiyempre, they are still entitled to due process. Kailangan pa rin silang idemanda o puwedeng magkaroon ng (unclear) unless they\u2019re caught during the commission of a crime. Ibig sabihin hindi ko kailangan mandamyento de aresto [They still need to be charged for a crime, unless they\u2019re caught during the commission of the crime, at which point no arrest warrant is necessary].\u201d. Panelo elaborated: \u201cAng mahalaga lang diyan, hindi na sila basta-basta makaka . . . hindi na sila iyong ordinaryong mamamayan na merong karapatan na they can go anywhere they want [What is important there is that they can no longer just roam freely with the same rights as ordinary citizens]. Kasi, since they have been declared as terrorist, necessarily by self instinct of preservation they will be carrying a gun, di ba [right]? Kaya may problema sila diyan. May problema sila kung ayaw nilang magpa-aresto, siyempre gagamit sila ng armas. Di ba sabi ni Presidente, since declared kang terrorist at siguradong papatayin mo iyong mga mag-aaresto sa iyo eh uunahan ka kung meron kang armas. \n[They have a problem there because, if they don\u2019t want to be arrested, they\u2019d logically bear arms. And didn\u2019t the President say that if you\u2019re declared a terrorist and you\u2019re certainly expected to kill the ones who\u2019ll try to arrest you, then they \u2013 the government \u2013 would certainly beat you to it, if you\u2019re bearing arms?] \nUPHOLD STRINGENT MEASURES OF HSA AMID NPA TAG \u2013 CHIZ \nRelatedly, Senator Chiz Escudero has reminded the police and the military to strictly observe the provisions of the Human Security Act (HSA) in the conduct of their operation after the government officially declared the CPP-NPA as terrorist organizations. \nEscudero, former chairman of the Senate Committee on Justice and Human Rights, said President Duterte\u2019s declaration removes the possibility of peace talks. \u201cAnd given the government policy, we don\u2019t negotiate with terrorists.\u201d \nRepublic Act 9372 or the HSA defines terrorism, as well as provides for the procedure should the government seek to tag a group as terrorist. It creates an anti-terrorism council and grievance committee to implement the law and see any violations of the law, respectively. \n\u201cI hope this terror tag on CPP-NDF is just a hiccup or a negotiating tactic in the peace process. I am still optimistic that peace talks between the government and the CPP-NPA will soon resume and prosper under cooler situation,\u201d he said. \nThe senator said with the terror tag on the CPP-NPA, the military and the police should adhere to the measures and procedures provided under the HSA, especially on the matter of safeguards to protect human rights against abuse by the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). \n\u201cAny offense committed under HSA necessitates stronger evidentiary requirements. You can\u2019t just file murder, illegal possession of firearms or any non-bailable offense. Government has to follow and adhere to the stringent requirements provided by the law, and these requirements carry corresponding penalties against violators,\u201d Escudero said. \n\u201cAng nakakalungkot dito, marami na namang maiipit na iba\u2019t ibang lugar sa bansa at mga sibilyan dahil sa umpugan ng NPA at ng gobyerno. At magpapatuloy pa rin ang patayan ng Pilipino at kapwa Pilipino [The sad thing here is that many people are bound to be caught again in the crossfire between the government and the NPA. and Filipinos will kill fellow Filipinos],\u201d he said. \n\u201cI believe that peace negotiation should be exhausted to bring the armed conflict to a permanent and just closure,\u201d Escudero added.

(Photo by Jill Tan Radovan/InterAksyon) \nBased on the extended version of the Palanca-winning crime novel of the same title by F.H. Batacan, \u201cSmaller and Smaller Circles\u201d tells the story of two Jesuit priests who try to solve the mystery behind the serial killings of young boys in the slums of Payatas. \nAcclaimed actor Nonie Buencamino plays the lead as Father Gus Saenz, one of two Jesuit priests tasked to analyze forensic evidence involving the murders. His colleague and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Father Jerome Lucero, is played by Sid Lucero. \nCarla Humphries plays a sleuthing journalist; Bembol Roco and Christopher de Leon play the NBI director and his deputy, respectively; and Ricky Davao plays Cardinal Meneses. \nIt took some time for Nonie to realize that he was actually portraying the lead role \u2014 and it was both a pleasure and a challenge for him. \nHe explains, \u201cMeron akong proseso na meron akong pinaplano, step by step, kasi ang daming opportunities para mag-build, para i-build yung character ni Father Saenz. Pasalamat lang ako na once in a while meron akong chance for these.\u201d Nonie Buencamino and Sid Lucero in \u2018Smaller and Smaller Circles.\u2019 InterAksyon \nAs extraordinary his role may be, Nonie poured as much passion into it as previous ones. \u201cFor me it\u2019s just like any other job, any other role that I play, that I study and go through all the details of my character. And learn it. Learn all the objectives, motivations, and all the given circumstances. So it\u2019s a normal thing that I do, process,\u201d he said in an interview with InterAksyon. \nBeing part of a film that deals with such controversial themes has expanded Nonie\u2019s view of the Catholic Church. \nHe shares, \u201cIt reinforces the fact about the Catholic Church belonging to, I mean\u2026which consists of human beings, people, who are also weak, who also commit mistakes, and who also need prayer. And who also need help from the community. In terms of dealing with problems. It brings it out in the open, and nowadays, I would like to believe that it is being addressed by \u2014 this issue of abuse and everything \u2014 is being addressed by the new leader, who is our Pope Francis, and it\u2019s not being swept under the rug.\u201d \n\u201cThe fact that my character as a priest, I\u2019m a priest and I\u2019m pursuing people within the clergy who are committing those abuses and trying to rectify, means that within the Church, I would like to believe that there is a struggle within the Church to correct or to fix whatever problems they are facing. \n\u201cSo it makes me respect the Catholic Church or the clergy even more because they\u2019re human and they\u2019re trying to improve, and trying their best to own up to and correct the mistakes that they\u2019ve made.\u201d \n\u201cSmaller and Smaller Circles\u201d stars Nonie Buencamino, Sid Lucero, Carla Humphries, Bembol ROco, Christopher de Leon, Ricky Davao, TJ Trinidad, Junjun Quintana, Alex Medina, Roselyn Perez, Jess Mendoza, Madeleine Nicolas, Ross Pesigan, Cholo Barretto, and Gladys Reyes. \nThe script was written by Moira Lang and Ria Limjap based on the novel by F.H. Batacan. The film, directed by Raya Martin and produced by TBA Studios, is now showing in cinemas.

The company teamed with APCO Insight to poll 1,200 adults online in March 2017.\nAmong the retired boomers who participated, 43 percent said that they were spending more than expected on health-care expenses. That's not surprising, considering that a healthy 65-year-old couple that retire this year can anticipate spending $275,000 on medical expenses \u2013 not counting long-term care, dental work or over-the-counter medications \u2013 once they've stopped working, according to Fidelity.\n\"There has never been a generation as healthy, active and well-off as this one,\" said Heather Lord, senior vice president and head of strategy and innovation at Capital Group.\nLonger lives and higher health-care costs can hurt retirees' wallets, so they ought to plan for these expenses with their financial advisors as early as possible.\n\"The implication is that there's a need for a conversation on long-term goals and helping them prepare,\" Lord said.\nHere are the other surprise expenses that are sapping retirees' finances:\nThe pain of travel costs \"Travel is the most popular activity for retirees, but it costs them more than expected,\" said Lord of Capital Group.\nIn fact, four in 10 retirees said they were spending more than anticipated on traveling.\nBoomers with less savings tend to slash their travel and entertainment budget in order to manage their cash flow. Thirty-five percent of retirees said they take fewer trips than they would have liked, while nearly 30 percent said they spend less on entertainment.\nUncle Sam takes a bite Despite the fact that retirees no longer have to worry about payroll taxes and their income may be in a lower tax bracket, Uncle Sam takes a large bite out of boomers' budgets. More than three in 10 retirees said they were spending more than expected on taxes.\nRetirees can help manage their levies by moving to tax-friendly locales. Florida, for instance, has no income or estate taxes . ( See below for a map from Kiplinge r , detailing which states are most and least tax-friendly.)\n\u00a9 Provided by CNBC But income levies are only part of the picture: Retirees should also be aware of sales and property taxes they'll face if they relocate .\nWhat you can control It's hard to forecast health-care costs and taxes far into the future, but Capital Group's Lord had three suggestions for savers to prepare themselves:\nWatch your fees: Fund costs that are too high take a bite out of your returns , which can hamper your savings in the long run. Diversify your portfolio: Even though more than half of boomers expect that the market will continue to rise over the next 10 years, it's probably not the best idea to concentrate all of your savings into stocks or any other investment. \"Retired boomers believe having a diversified portfolio is key,\" said Lord. Protect yourself against downturns: When the market slumps, don't just go with your gut. Work with your financial advisor to plot a course of action. Three in 10 boomers in the survey said they wish they knew sooner how to react amid turbulent markets.

Kiplinger Why consumers have fewer choices than ever The last two decades have seen slew of corporate mergers, which often benefits the companies, but is leaving consumers with fewer options in the marketplace. CNN Money Why Facebook is the best place to work in 2017 Glassdoor just ranked Facebook as the most desirable place to work in the United States.

But he's got a good feel for the game, and he lets it come to him.\"   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nQuentin Snider added a season-high 16 points, and Ray Spalding had 10 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks for Louisville (5-2), which led by only a point with 15:26 to play before reeling off 18 straight points. \nLouisville had 15 blocks in all as it rebounded from last week's consecutive losses to Purdue and Seton Hall that had knocked the Cardinals out of the Top 25. \nMahmoud said Padgett yelled at him at halftime, and Mahmoud called his four turnovers \"unacceptable.\" But he was dominant for much of the game and helped spark the Cardinals in the second half. \n\"All we did was play Louisville basketball in the second half,\" Mahmoud said. \"We have to create our own energy, and we have to come out and play in the second half every single game from now on.\" \nSammy Friday had 15 points and 15 rebounds for Siena (2-6), which shot just 31.1 percent (19 of 61) from the floor. \nSiena gave Louisville all it wanted early. The Saints had a 10-0 first-half run to take a 31-27 lead. The Cardinals regrouped to regain a 39-36 lead by halftime. Siena pulled within 48-47 before four straight points by Mahmoud started the 18-0 run. \nPlaying in the city famous for the Kentucky Derby, Siena coach Jimmy Patsos compared his team's performance with a thoroughbred trying to get the distance at Churchill Downs. \n\"We got them at the first turn and second turn,\" Patsos said. \"Just couldn't make it down that stretch.\" \nMahmoud exited the game with 3:38 to play. Padgett said he didn't consider putting him back in just so he could try to get a triple-double. \n\"It's remarkable achievement to have nine (blocks) in a game,\" Padgett said, \"but the only stat we're interested in is the final score.\" \nBIG PICTURE \nSiena: The Saints hung around for a while by leading Louisville in some key categories. Siena got 18 offensive rebounds en route to a 21-9 advantage in second-chance points. \nLouisville: Mahmoud tied a career high in points one game after being held scoreless and not attempting a shot against Seton Hall. His rebounds and blocks were also career highs. \nUP NEXT \nLouisville will host Indiana on Saturday in a border-state battle, then face Bryant at home on Monday. \nWednesday night's game was part of the round robin of the Gotham Classic, in which Louisville, Siena, Bryant, Memphis and Albany all play each other over the next two weeks, with Louisville's Dec. 16 game against Memphis in New York's Madison Square Garden the marquee matchup. Siena will host Albany on Saturday in its next game.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "quentin snider", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nico clareth", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mahmoud", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "quentin snider mahmoud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sammy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patsos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david padgett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ray spalding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "padgett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy patsos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anas mahmoud", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "siena 86-60 siena", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "siena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardinals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saints", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "churchill downs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seton hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "purdue", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madison square garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky derby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:17.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67e4876986ce925824c5620f3cd9e2a4819862b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSglkMGFkBB4Afa4PXXhzv7QlvT2mo.Q7u0Pvj.tkGOsOD.rVOaRBOoTlO4xSvVcY09keurRboGHTqkqS.nHFOJMQDrvrcpboyIvOPEovr71Q--", "site_full": "www.mindbodygreen.com", "site": "mindbodygreen.com", "site_section": "http://www.mindbodygreen.com/rss/feed.xml", "site_categories": ["alternative_medicine", "health"], "section_title": "mindbodygreen", "title": "7 Things You Need To Know Today (December 7, 2017)", "title_full": "7 Things You Need To Know Today (December 7, 2017)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://mindbodygreen-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_720,h_378,g_auto,q_85,fl_lossy,f_jpg/crp/stocksy_txp68d4e71cpsl100_medium_1025394-1400x770.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4342, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 15, "comments": 0, "shares": 15}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "67e4876986ce925824c5620f3cd9e2a4819862b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSglkMGFkBB4Afa4PXXhzv7QlvT2mo.Q7u0Pvj.tkGOsOD.rVOaRBOoTlO4xSvVcY09keurRboGHTqkqS.nHFOJMQDrvrcpboyIvOPEovr71Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lindsay Kellner", "published": "2017-12-07T11:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "7 Things You Need To Know Today (December 7, 2017)", "text": "SMS 1. Use this emerging body of research as an excuse to work less. \nA new body of research shows that all work and no play leads to increased risk for heart disease, strokes, depression, and even death. On the flip side, taking your vacation days and breaks during the day leads to increased productivity during working hours, and people who take their vacations often get raises and bonuses more than their counterparts who don't. ( BBC ) 2. Even if you have paid maternity leave, women are prone to more judgment than men. \nWill you take your full leave? How much will you disconnect\u2014will you work from home? These are questions pregnant female leaders are constantly confronted with. But what about men? Sadly, \"the truth is that their choices will never be scrutinized as heavily by others, and few people will really question whether it matters if they are good fathers as well as good business leaders.\" ( Quartz ) Arrow Article continues below 3. Have your drink, and eat it, too. \nA new company called Lolistraw is now churning out straws that are both compostable and edible. Made from a seaweed-based material, they are designed to feel and look like plastic, without the waste. ( Fast Company ) 4. Going for a walk outside is almost always a good idea, unless you're dealing with massive pollution. \nAccording to new research out of the Lancet journal on people over age 60, exercising on polluted streets rather than in open spaces like parks essentially cancels out any health benefits you're getting from regular exercise. \"When you walk, your airways open up...and your blood vessels dilate, or open up...and these effects can last for a few days,\" said study author Dr. Fan Chung. \"When you do this in a polluted place, these effects are much smaller, so you've lost the benefits of exercise.\" ( CNN ) 5. Researchers may have figured out a way to prevent obesity. \nAccording to new research out of the Washington University School of Medicine, mice who had been engineered with genes to activate a protein pathway didn't gain weight after eight weeks of eating a high-fat diet. Those who didn't have that pathway activated, however, became obese. ( Science Daily ) Arrow Article continues below 6. Sadly, you might be one of Time's people of the year. \nThe year 2017 has been powerful for women's voices, as they've stepped forward to demand equality, respect, and for their mistreatment to be seen. To acknowledge this huge moment in history, Time magazine has named the women of the #metoo movement as their people of the year, calling them the Silence Breakers. \"Even more powerful than the fact that women are finally standing up against the harassment and abuse is the fact that they're standing together,\" mbg wrote about the powerful story. ( mindbodygreen ) 7. New research validates your FOMO. \nIf you think everyone's life looks better than yours on social media, you're not alone. A new study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that people believe other people's lives are richer and more active than their own, despite consistently ranking ourselves as happier, smarter, healthier, and more moral than our peers.

The author would like to thank Brian Clappier, Mara Denny and Claude Lawrence for research assistance on this article. An earlier version of this article was awarded second prize by the Al Kawakibi Democracy Transition Center project on \u201cTransitional Justice in the Arab Region.\u201d\nIn recent decades, a broad range of tools, collectively known as \"transitional justice,\" have been developed to help individuals and societies heal from the effects of past violence. Throughout history, violent conflict and government repression have frequently led to widespread violations of human rights. In most cases, the perpetrators of such abuses have not been held accountable for their deeds, and victims have rarely seen justice done. Since the middle of the twentieth century, however, governments have sometimes taken steps to try to address the human suffering produced by past violence. 1 The International Military Tribunals at Nuremberg and Tokyo and related domestic war-crimes prosecutions in Europe and Asia after World War II marked the first widespread effort to hold perpetrators of gross human-rights violations accountable. The tribunals prompted the development of the modern human-rights system through the creation of the United Nations and the broad acceptance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. During the so-called Third Wave of democratization that began in southern Europe in the mid-1970s, democratizing societies were confronted with the \"torturer problem,\" namely how to deal with perpetrators of human-rights abuses. 2 As democratization efforts spread across the developing world, several institutional innovations were created to pursue justice for past abuses in the context of political transitions.\nToday, transitional justice encompasses a variety of measures. 3 The development of transitional justice is based on an understanding that domestic stability, security and democratic governance in the aftermath of repression and mass violence are strengthened by a commitment to justice and accountability. It is widely accepted among policy makers and activists that openly facing the past is essential for establishing the rule of law, promoting human rights, addressing the suffering of victims, and preventing the recurrence of future human-rights abuses. Yet, scholars disagree as to whether different transitional-justice \"mechanisms\" are beneficial for transitional societies. One mechanism is trials. In ideal circumstances, a court impartially weighs evidence and testimony to determine the guilt or innocence of alleged perpetrators of human-rights abuses. For those found guilty, the courts decide on a punishment. Trials are favored for their ability to remove perpetrators from positions of power, promote the rule of law, and deter future human-rights abuses, among other things. 4 Yet, other research finds that trials undermine human-rights promotion unless balanced with amnesties. 5\nA second mechanism of transitional justice, the truth commission, is a nonjudicial body that \"(1) is focused on past, rather than ongoing, events; (2) investigates a pattern of events that took place over a period of time; (3) engages directly and broadly with the affected population, gathering information on their experiences; (4) is a temporary body, with the aim of concluding with a final report; and (5) is officially authorized or empowered by the state under review.\" 6 Many promote truth commissions for their ability to potentially help victims heal by giving them an opportunity to tell their stories, having their suffering officially acknowledged, and uncovering details about the fate of their loved ones. Producing an authoritative version of history might curtail historical myth making and encourage reconciliation. Commission recommendations also may lead to other transitional-justice measures and the implementation of reforms that are designed to prevent human-rights abuses in the future. Some recent research argues that truth commissions promote human rights, 7 while others find the opposite. 8\nA third mode of transitional justice, reparations programs, involves monetary and nonmonetary awards granted to victims to compensate for the suffering inflicted upon them. Relatively little research has dealt with the impact of reparations programs. A fourth measure of transitional justice, vetting, was popularized by Eastern Europe as the means of choice to deal with the legacy of communism. In many of these countries, individuals were punished for their contribution to maintaining the oppressive regime. Rather than face prison time, those found responsible for human-rights abuses sometimes were banned from politics or from serving in the government bureaucracy. Finally, although they seem contrary to the pursuit of justice, amnesties are frequently employed to address histories of violence and repression. While some argue that amnesties promote impunity and reward violence, others see them as pragmatic tools to give perpetrators incentive to relinquish power.\nAs democratization efforts spread from Latin America in the 1980s to Eastern Europe and Africa in the 1990s, countries frequently used one or more of these transitional-justice tools to address histories of violence and repression. Intergovernmental organizations and global human-rights NGOs have developed significant knowledge of transitional-justice experiences in these countries. In fact, many experts were intimately involved in earlier experiments as judges, lawyers, commissioners and the like. The United Nations has been responsible for setting up several transitional-justice processes and disseminating best practices. 9 As a result, when tentative political liberalization began to occur in some parts of the Middle East after 2010, there was a significant body of experience upon which to draw. Often overlooked has been the earlier transitional-justice experience of other countries of the Middle East. This article critically examines the experiences of Iraq, Algeria and Morocco and outlines what other societies in the region should reasonably expect from transitional justice.\nIRAQ'S PUNITIVE APPROACH After Saddam Hussein came to power in Iraq in July 1979, his regime quickly became renowned for its brutality. Suspected opponents were subject to torture, execution and arbitrary detention with alarming frequency. An estimated 300,000 people are believed to have been \"disappeared\" during Saddam Hussein's 34-year rule. 10 With the government dominated by Sunni Arabs, the Shia and Kurdish populations faired particularly poorly. During the 1980-89 Iran-Iraq War, an estimated 50,000-70,000 Iraqi Shia were imprisoned or vanished, with an additional 500,000 for\u00adcibly expelled to Iran. 11 A brief Shia rebellion following the 1991 Gulf War resulted in thousands more executed, imprisoned or missing. The Kurds suffered a similar fate. For example, between February and September 1988, more than 100,000 Kurds are believed to have been executed during the genocidal Anfal campaign. 12\nGiven the human-rights abuses of Saddam Hussein's regime, it is unsurprising that demand for transitional justice was high following the March 2003 U.S. invasion. A mid-2003 survey found widespread support among Iraqis across ethnic and regional boundaries for public trials of those responsible for human-rights abuses under Hussein's government. 13 In fact, in the years since the Baathist regime was overthrown, a variety of transitional-justice measures have been implemented. However, by and large, they have not promoted reconciliation and state-building. Rather, transitional justice has been politicized and manipulated to settle old scores. As one account summarized, the Iraqi tribunals suffered from (1) a lack of international participation, (2) poorly trained judges and legal counsel, (3) political manipulation, (4) controversy over the use of the death penalty, (5) procedural and evidentiary shortcomings, and (6) security problems. 14 The numerous reports of revenge killings and other actions against former Baath party members are indicative of the sentiment that has prevailed. 15 As a result, transitional-justice initiatives have exacerbated tensions and jeopardized future stability.\nClearly, there was strong legal and ethical justification for prosecuting Saddam Hussein and many top officials in his government. Shortly after the U.S. invasion, separate assessments by the U.S. government and the United Nations found the Iraqi legal system wholly inadequate for conducting trials of past abuses. 16 A new body was needed for the task. After several months of deliberation by the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC), the statute for the Iraqi Special Tribunal for Crimes against Humanity (IST) was issued under CPA Order No. 48 on December 9, 2003. The IST statute gave the tribunal jurisdiction over all Iraqis for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes under existing Iraqi law that had occurred in Iraq, Iran and Kuwait. 17\nProblems emerged from the very beginning. Pre-invasion planning for transitional justice was largely ignored following the invasion. Despite the extensive research done by Iraqi expatriates and non-Iraqi experts as part of the U.S. State Department's Future of Iraq Project's \"Working Group on Transitional Justice,\" 18 interagency rivalries and political divisions within the Bush administration caused decision makers to ignore its findings. The Iraqis and the Bush administration both preferred a national court, due to a shared mistrust of the United Nations. The global human-rights community, by contrast, argued that Iraq was not ready for free and fair trials and favored an international tribunal. As a result, the architects of the IST benefited less from international transitional-justice expertise and the lessons learned from other tribunals, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL). 19 Rather, it was constructed and supported largely by a team of legal advisors from the U.S. Departments of Justice and State.\nFrom its inauspicious beginnings, the IST quickly became subject to political manipulation. The IGC's Salem Chalabi gained control of the establishment and administration of the IST as well as the selection of judges and prosecutors. Because his uncle, Ahmed Chalabi, had close ties to the Bush administration and the U.S. Department of Defense, Salem Chalabi's appointment damaged the IST's legitimacy in the eyes of some Iraqis. 20 Eventually, after being indicted by an Iraqi court on unrelated charges in August 2004, Salem Chalabi resigned his post with the IST. However, the resignation did not restore the IST's reputation. It continued to be seen as victors' justice in some circles.\nTarnished by its connection to the U.S. occupation, the IST was retooled by the Iraqi government after the handover of sovereignty. On October 9, 2005, the Transitional National Assembly (TNA), to which the CPA handed power, ratified Law No. 10, creating a new Iraqi High Criminal Court (IHCC) to replace the IST. Nonetheless, the IHCC possessed many of the weaknesses of its predecessor. The Dujail Trial was the first held before the IHCC. The court's activity coincided with the growing insurgency in Iraq. Even before the trial began, five tribunal employees and a defense attorney had been killed. 21 After opening on October 19, 2005, the trial lasted just over a year before finding Saddam Hussein and seven other defendants guilty of crimes against humanity for torture, forced deportation, imprisonment, willful killing and other inhumane acts committed against Shias in retaliation for an assassination attempt on Hussein in 1982.\nDuring the course of the proceedings, the Higher National De-Baathification Commission (HNDBC) removed several court officials in what appeared to be an attempt to influence the course of the trial. Moreover, the prime minister and members of parliament pressured the IHCC to render a decisive verdict. A similar pattern emerged with the Anfal Trial of Saddam Hussein and Ali Hassan al-Majid (Chemical Ali), which began in August 2006. In particular, the removal of presiding judge Amiri signaled blatant interference with the independence of the judiciary. Moreover, Saddam Hussein's December 2006 execution prior to the conclusion of the Anfal Trial precluded a full accounting of other crimes he had committed.\nAlthough the high-profile targets of the IHCC ensured it much-deserved attention, with an estimated total Baath party membership of 2 million out of 24 million Iraqis as of early 2003, 22 the process of de-Baathification has had broader and more pernicious effects on post-invasion Iraq. One of the first U.S. acts after taking over Iraq was to establish a process to purge the Iraqi government of Baath members. On May 16, 2003, CPA Order No. 1 established the parameters of de-Baathification. 23 Articles 2 and 3 outlined the criteria, which included \"Senior Party Members\" 24 and individuals regardless of party rank holding positions in the top three layers of the government bureaucracy, state-owned corporations, and other public-sector institutions. However, the CPA provided no clear policy for distinguishing those who had committed human-rights abuses (and may have numbered in the tens or even hundreds of thousands) 25 from those who joined the party simply because it was a prerequisite for many of the most prestigious and high-paying jobs in Iraq. The failure to adequately consider individuals on their own merits had dire consequences. In total, the CPA dismissed an estimated 500,000 military and intelligence personnel and a further 30,000 public-sector employees. Iraqis with critical administrative and policing skills were dismissed, which hampered reconstruction and weakened the security situation. In fact, many dismissed and unemployed former Baath party members became sympathetic to the insurgency movement. 26\nBy August 2003, the management of de-Baathification had been transferred from the CPA to the newly formed HNDBC under the IGC. 27 The HNDBC was a modest improvement over the U.S.-run process. It extended a selective appeals process under which an estimated 9,000 ex-Baathists previously disqualified under CPA orders had returned to work in the government as of 2005. 28 However, the HNDBC refused to consider appeals by former senior Baath members, military officers or members of Iraq's intelligence services. 29 More generally, led by Ahmed Chalabi, a bitter opponent of Saddam Hussein's regime, the HNDBC remained politicized and vengeful. 30\nIn the face of growing opposition from Prime Minister Allawi, other IGC members and U.S. military commanders, the CPA withdrew its approval of the HNDBC in June 2004 and authorized the IGC to abolish and replace it. However, Allawi lost the January 2005 elections, and the HNDBC persevered. The process finally underwent reform in January 2008 with the passage of the Law of the Supreme National Commission for Accountability and Justice. It established a new Accountability and Justice Commission and introduced four main changes to the de-Baathification process. First, it established an independent appeals chamber. Second, it created a public-prosecutor's office to investigate allegations against individual former Baath party members. Third, the law made some mostly low-level former Baathists eligible for a pension. Finally, it allowed tens of thousands of low-level officials who had been dismissed to return to work without going through the formal appeals process.\nWhile the Accountability and Justice Commission is a marked improvement in the management of de-Baathification, it remains problematic. By and large, the HNDBC was melded into it, including members who have been accused of using the process for political ends. The ICTJ, for example, argued that the process has not gone far enough to judge individuals based on their past actions rather than Baath party membership. 31 It further called for greater accountability of commissioners. This is exemplified by the role the commission played in the 2010 Iraqi national elections. In January 2010, nine predominately Sunni political parties and 458 individuals were banned from participating in the March 2010 parliamentary elections. A month prior to the elections, the commission briefly lifted the ban before reinstating it. In the end, only 26 of 177 individuals who appealed the ban were allowed to run. 32 The commission's credibility was further damaged by the fact that its leader, Ali al-Lami, was himself a candidate. 33\nOverall, the transitional-justice effort in Iraq has been botched. With the origins of most policies, particularly the most punitive ones, in the CPA, they smack of victor's justice. This perception is compounded by the relative impunity U.S. forces enjoyed after the invasion. Since the Iraqi government resumed authority in mid-2004, there has been relatively little improvement. The IST and de-Baathification have been politicized and lack broad credibility. As such, they have fomented further tension rather than promoted peace, let alone reconciliation. These measures also do comparatively little for victims. The CPA and the TNA studied potential reparations options. However, it was not until late 2005 that the Iraqi parliament approved measures to establish the Political Prisoners' Foundation and the Martyrs' Foundation (for those killed by Saddam Hussein's government) to manage reparations for these two groups of victims.\nFinally, there has been periodic talk of a truth commission. 34 The idea is attractive because it could potentially provide a broader picture of the brutality of Saddam Hussein's regime and the violence and chaos that followed the 2003 U.S. occupation. However, while the idea has merit, a truth commission requires administrative and fiscal capacity as well as security, three things the Iraqi government has failed to deliver thus far.\nALGERIA'S MANUFACTURED AMNESIA Algeria was ravaged by violence and terror after multiparty elections that were set to be won by the Islamic Salvation Front (Front Islamique du Salut, FIS) were cancelled in 1992. The military declared a state of emergency and instituted a five-member High Council of State to take power. 35 The FIS was banned. Foiled at the ballot box, some FIS members took up arms against the government. Increasingly, the insurgents also targeted civilians they perceived as backing the government. For its part, the government, along with militias it had armed, committed massive human-rights violations in an effort to put down the rebel movement. Although the level of violence has fallen dramatically since the 1990s, and two amnesties have been offered to the Islamists in a bid to coax them to lay down their arms, violence and human-rights abuses continue. Official estimates put the number killed in the government's battle against the Islamists at between 150,000 and 200,000. 36\nFollowing the return to civilian rule in 1999, the government embarked on an amnesty policy in an attempt to curb the violence. New Algerian President Abdelaziz Boutleflika proposed the Civil Harmony Law, which was adopted by parliament and later approved in a national referendum. The law provided immunity from prosecution for all armed rebels who surrendered within six months of the law's entering into force, which occurred on July 13, 1999, and made a full disclosure of past behavior. Individuals who had committed particularly heinous crimes \u2014 murder, rape, violence that led to permanent disability, bombings of public places \u2014 were ineligible for the amnesty, though they could receive reduced sentences by coming forward.\nAt the provincial level, probation committees were established to judge whether individuals should be granted amnesty. The commissions generally operated opaquely and appear to have done little actual investigation of individual stories. 37 Presidential Decree 2000-03, issued on January 10, 2000, provided even more generous terms. Individuals from any organization who laid down their arms were granted full amnesty and blanket immunity from prosecution. An estimated 5,500 Islamist fighters took advantage of the measures, but no official figures have ever been released. 38\nUnder pressure from victims and human-rights groups, the Algerian government appointed a 43-member National Consultative Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in September 2003. The commission was given a mandate to help \"appropriate authorities undertake all necessary measures to find the persons declared as 'disappeared' and to proceed to identify any bodies that are found.\" 39 In March 2005, the commission gave the government a report concluding that government forces were responsible for over 6,000 disappearances. However, it did not investigate the cases. The commission had been given no power to compel cooperation by government officials or to subpoena documents. 40 Moreover, it concluded that the disappearance cases were not the result of official government policy, but the behavior of rogue elements. 41 To date, the government has not released the commission's report. The commission reviewed over 13,000 claims from families of disappeared individuals who were eligible for compensation of up to 1 million Algerian dinars (U.S. $9,058.94). 42 It is unclear how many eventually received compensation, but Tlem\u00e7ani reports that no more than 50 million dinars in compensation had been issued as of 2008. Victims' groups have been thwarted in their attempts to promote a more genuine truth-seeking process. 43\nIn 2005, the government tried again to entice individuals to leave the insurgency. Bouteflika called a referendum on his Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation. The charter again offered immunity and clemency to Islamist fighters and measures for Islamists who had lost their jobs in the 1990s. In addition, it absolved government forces and armed militias from responsibility for human-rights abuses. While denying government responsibility for thousands of disappearances that had taken place since 1992, the charter proposed recognizing victims' suffering and promised compensation. Nearly 80 percent of voters participated in the September 2005 referendum, over 97 percent of whom supported the plan. The president promoted the charter as the only effective way to foster economic and social development in Algeria. Not everyone agreed. The Socialist Forces Front and the Rally for Culture and Democracy, the two main opposition parties, boycotted the referendum. Victims' groups and human-rights activists also opposed the amnesty.\nOrdinance No. 06-01 of February 2006, which implemented the charter, substantially broadened the proposal contained in the referendum. In particular, it provided blanket immunity for security forces and government-sponsored militias. In addition, it extended eligibility for the amnesty to members of armed groups who had committed murder and acts of violence that led to permanent injury. Only individuals who had committed massacres, rape or public bombings were excluded. Approximately 300 more fighters surrendered under the terms of this amnesty, and about 2,200 others were released from prison. 44 To further reinforce the government's desire to put the past behind it, the decree made it a criminal offence to discuss the issue of disappearances in a way that would \"undermine the good reputation of [state] agents who honorably served the country or to tarnish the image of Algeria internationally.\" 45\nSince civilians returned to power in 1999, the Algerian government has been more forthcoming in acknowledging that massive violence occurred during the 1990s, but it continues to deny official responsibility. As a 2009 Amnesty International report describes, \"Algerian authorities continue to argue in national and international forums that security forces and state-armed militias demonstrated great patriotism and even heroism and made invaluable sacrifices in the face of terrorism that threatened to destroy the nation.\" 46 The amnesty processes have not been transparent and have not involved victims' groups. The government claims that most of the disappeared were not killed by government forces but actually joined the Islamist insurgency. 47\nFamilies of disappeared individuals have filed hundreds of complaints in Algerian courts, but neither further information nor accountability has been forthcoming. 48 Although their numbers are diminished due to deaths, amnesties and moves to continue jihad elsewhere in the world, if anything, Islamist forces have been further radicalized by continued repression and impunity \u2014 as is evident from the emergence of Al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb. The al-Qaeda affiliate's presence also has muted international criticism of the Algerian government's transitional-justice policy. In February 2011, the government lifted the 19-year state of emergency in response to public protest and recently held flawed elections. However, if precedent is any guide, these limited steps will not be a prelude to accountability for past abuses.\nMOROCCO'S TRUTH-SEEKING EXPERIMENT Morocco produced the first truth-commission experiment in the Arab world. Like Iraq's transitional-justice activity, the workings of the Moroccan Equity and Reconciliation Commission (Instance Equit\u00e9 et Reconciliation, IER) received extensive coverage by Al Jazeera and other regional news outlets. In many respects, the IER has much to recommend it. The commission was granted significant resources and was led by a set of credible and capable commissioners. Nonetheless, the unique circumstances under which it was created may limit its applicability elsewhere. The IER was established after the dynastic succession of King Mohammed VI, so it was at least partially intended to legitimize the new regime. Moreover, the investigation avoided recent human-rights abuses and Morocco's thorniest human-rights problem, Western Sahara. 49 Finally, those interested in holding perpetrators accountable for past human-rights violations in Morocco have thus far been disappointed.\nAlthough the IER helped mark a break from King Hassan II's reign, it was not a complete shift in human-rights policy. In his final years, some initial measures were taken to address Morocco's history of human-rights abuses, most notably the Independent Commission of Arbitration. Following the succession of King Mohammed VI on January 7, 2004, the Moroccan government accepted the recommendation of the king's Advisory Council on Human Rights (CCDH) to establish the IER and, within a few months, the legal framework for it was crafted. The IER was made up of 17 commissioners from a variety of backgrounds, including several lawyers and journalists, a physician and a historian. The commissioners were widely respected and included victims and human-rights activists among their ranks; most had a history of human-rights activism. Throughout its work, the IER consulted with political parties, unions and other civil-society groups in order to ensure its work was relevant and legitimate. 50\nThe IER was given a daunting task: to investigate human-rights violations by government forces that occurred between Morocco's independence in 1956 and the creation of the Independent Commission of Arbitration on August 16, 1999. The IER's mandate called for it to establish the facts about past human-rights abuses. In addition, it was to serve an educational function by helping the country learn from its past. Through its investigation, it also was charged with facilitating victim healing and reconciliation. Finally, the IER was to serve as a mechanism for providing compensation for victims. The statute establishing the commission defined victims narrowly, limiting its investigation to forced disappearances and arbitrary detention. The government asked the commissioners to do all of this in just under two years.\nTo fulfill its mandate, the IER decided to establish three separate units: Investigations, Reparations, and Research and Study. The Investigations Unit conducted interviews of witnesses and collected evidence around the country in order to shed light on past human-rights violations. In the course of its investigation, the IER identified nearly 600 people who had \"disappeared\" during the period. It found that an additional 300 people had been killed by government troops during anti-government protests over the years. A further 174 had been murdered while being arbitrarily detained by the government. The IER statute required government officials to cooperate with the commission, but the IER's final report states that it did not receive full cooperation.\nThe commission held seven public hearings in different locations around the country, which were broadcast on television and radio. Individuals who volunteered to participate in public hearings were briefed on rules of conduct, including a prohibition on naming alleged perpetrators. They also received psychological support both before and after their appearance. A final element of the IER's work was the staging of several televised roundtable discussions of issues related to Morocco's future political, legal, economic and cultural development. Overall, the IER's public hearings have been credited with promoting significant public discussion regarding human rights and Morocco's past. 51\nThe Research and Study Unit conducted several studies designed to enhance and provide context to the individual abuses examined by the Investigations Unit. For example, it developed relationships with civil-society organizations to allow the IER access to their documentation of human-rights abuses. The unit also organized research colloquia. Finally, the Research and Study Unit consulted with global transitional-justice experts, including the International Court of Transitional Justice (ICTJ) and veterans of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, to learn from other countries' experiences.\nThe Reparations Unit provided a range of goods and services designed to assuage the harm suffered by victims. Before the IER's end, the Reparations Unit heard nearly 17,000 claims. In total, the IER recommended monetary compensation for nearly 10,000 individuals. In addition, it established a unit to provide medical and psychological care for victims and recommended the establishment of a long-term medical program. Moreover, the Reparations Unit established relief for those who had lost their jobs as a result of government repression. The IER ultimately recommended the professional rehabilitation of nearly 2,000 victims. The large number of claims is remarkable, as victims had only one month early in the commission's work in which to apply for reparations. The Reparations Unit hired over 100 temporary staff to manage the flood of cases. 52 The process had the benefit of providing the IER with needed information for its investigation and facilitated a more timely response to victims' needs. However, the brief window of opportunity gave victims little time to reflect on such a potentially re-traumatizing course of action.\nOn November 30, 2005, the IER submitted its final report to the government. In a speech two weeks later, King Mohammed VI ordered the report's public release. He further pledged to implement the IER's recommendations. Two months prior to the IER's conclusion, the commission held a three-day public National Forum to discuss its draft reparations program with hundreds of government officials and civil-society representatives. 53 Ultimately, the government gave IER reparations a budget of $50 million-$70 million to be split among the victims. 54 In early 2007, the government began making payments to victims through the CCDH.\nThe IER put forward several other recommendations in its final report. For instance, it urged significant economic-development assistance for regions in which past human-rights violations were most common. Second, the IER called for the decommissioning of former detention centers, which is in progress. Third, the commission recommended constitutional reforms to specify Moroccans' fundamental rights and freedoms. Fourth, it suggested institutional reforms to help prevent future human-rights abuses. In particular, the IER recommended a stronger, more independent judiciary and greater oversight of the military. Fifth, the IER recognized that it should not be the final word on past abuses and called on the government to investigate unresolved cases. Finally, it pointed to the need to ensure that the commission's records remain accessible in order to encourage ongoing public discussion.\nThe IER is viewed in different ways by observers, either as a democratic initiative or as a public-relations exercise for the new king. 55 Human-rights groups were critical of the IER's mandate, which forbid it from identifying perpetrators. One group actually published its own list of alleged torturers to fill the void. Civil-society groups also chided the IER effort because, due to the narrow set of human-rights abuses it was authorized to investigate, the scope of human-rights violations in Morocco was vastly underestimated. 56 Further, the government responded slowly to the IER's recommendations. 57\nAlthough the reparations program is up and running, the government initially did a poor job of explaining it to the public. Following a June 2009 visit, the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances concluded that, while some recommendations had been implemented, many remained unaddressed. 58 Progress in implementing IER recommendations has continued. In early 2010, CCDH president Ahmed Herzenni stated that all IER recommendations had either been implemented or were in the process of being implemented. 59 Nonetheless, at roughly the same time, Amnesty International issued a report that was much more pessimistic about the future of IER recommendations and the ability of the Moroccan government to improve its human-rights practices. 60\nCONCLUSION From the perspective of seeking accountability for human-rights abuses and promoting the contemporary protection of human rights, activists and victims' groups have tended to be dissatisfied with transitional justice. While it is not too late for Algeria, Iraq and Morocco to salvage benefits from their experiences by reforming ongoing processes, following through on transitional-justice commitments and creating new processes with greater legitimacy, the prospect is likely to diminish with time, absent significant political change. Nonetheless, these three countries provide valuable lessons to others in the region regarding reasonable expectations for transitional justice as well as potential pitfalls. Given the ongoing unrest around the Middle East, this is more than an academic exercise.\nIn transitional situations, trials are often promoted for their ability to provide justice for victims, deter human-rights abuses and promote the rule of law. Yet, in the absence of a genuine political transition, perpetrators in Algeria and Morocco largely remain in positions of authority and continue to enjoy impunity. Similarly, in Egypt and Tunisia, some top officials of the anciens r\u00e9gimes , including former presidents Mubarak and Ben Ali, respectively, have been tried, but many others continue to be politically influential. Indeed, many current and former officials hope that these limited trials will satisfy popular demand for justice and protect themselves from punishment. Studies of the impact of transitional justice often fail to account for who is or is not being prosecuted. At the same time, trials that appear vindictive and target particular groups, as in Iraq, also send the wrong message and increase intergroup tensions. Several countries in the region pose similar risks. Libya's civil war took on tribal overtones, and the summary execution of Muammar Qadhafi and other former officials, as well as the poor condition of the judiciary, led many observers to despair of Saif al-Islam and others obtaining fair trials. Moreover, the political and economic dominance of minority religious groups has been the subject of protests in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen. Should these governments be overthrown, there is a risk of retribution becoming politicized, as in Iraq. To provide justice, courts need to be independent, have credible rules and procedures, and be staffed with adequately trained personnel. However, many judiciaries in the region are routinely criticized by global human-rights NGOs and U.S. State Department reports for being subject to political manipulation. As such, it is doubtful that domestic courts will be able to produce fair and credible justice for past abuses. Yet, studies of impact generally assume that trials are conducted in a free and fair manner. Even when objective observers judge this to be the case, certain factions may disagree.\nSimilarly, the Iraqi experience with de-Baathification demonstrates the risk of applying vetting procedures without adequate safeguards. Punishing individuals for group membership rather than actual behavior is unfair. The result in Iraq was that many former Baath party members joined the insurgency. The rapid military advance of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) across Iraq in early 2014 was a result of the continued marginalization faced by Sunnis 10 years after the U.S. invasion. 61 Reprisals against tribes once loyal to Qadhafi indicate that, were vetting applied in Libya, politicization would be a real risk. The fact that Libya's Political Isolation Law was approved in May 2013 by a parliament under siege by armed militias was an inauspicious beginning. Vetting procedures need to be conducted in a fair and transparent manner to be effective. As such, in countries where there are sectarian or tribal divisions, procedures need to be mutually agreed upon and co-managed to reduce the perception that vetting measures are designed for revenge.\nTruth commissions can uncover important information about past abuses if given adequate powers, resources and cooperation. To be effective, truth commissions must have adequate resources and access to records and other evidence. A key concern in many transitions will be preserving and protecting government documents. Witnesses also must feel sufficiently secure to be willing to participate. To have a more substantial impact, truth-commission investigations must prompt further change through recommendations such as institutional reform, the creation of other transitional-justice mechanisms, and public discussion of the country's past. Without prosecution and reparations, victims often find the experience wanting.\nTruth commissions are more likely to have a positive impact if they are implemented in countries that develop stronger democratic institutions and more robust civil societies that can press for change. To date, commissions established in the wake of the Arab Awakening in Tunisia and Bahrain have dealt only with abuses surrounding protests in 2011, not the deeper history of repression that gave rise to dissent in the first place. Morocco's experience suggests that truth commissions created in the absence of real democratic transformation may produce some modest benefits in promoting human rights, and governments may magnanimously provide some reparations. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that demands for justice and accountability will be wholly satisfied by truth commissions alone.\nReparations are a key need of many victims. They represent a material or symbolic recognition of past suffering. Oil-producing countries, in particular, possess the resources to undertake substantial reparations programs. More symbolic measures, such as days of remembrance and official apologies, may help to heal social rifts and contribute to lasting peace. Impact literature has had relatively little to say on reparations. Anecdotally, in the absence of the investigation and prosecution of human-rights abuses, reparations are often viewed as the price of silence. Moreover, particularly for any reparations program aimed at individual victims, an adequate institutional infrastructure is needed to make judgments regarding eligibility and levels of compensation. Such bodies should be constructed in a transparent and inclusive fashion to increase satisfaction. These faults are partially responsible for limiting the effectiveness of reparation schemes in Algeria and Morocco.\nFinally, amnesties may have a place in facilitating peaceful political transitions. Rulers in the region may be more receptive to ceding some power and permitting more democratic reform if they feel secure from punishment, as Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh did in February 2012. Yet, promises may not last, as Saleh's return to politics exemplifies. Similarly, one of the stumbling blocks in a political solution to the Syrian civil war is that top government officials likely would not trust any promise by a transitional regime to forgo punishment. Amnesties can be constructed so as to minimize tension with the pursuit of justice by being established through as democratic a means as possible and by being granted on an individual basis. 62 However, unless they are restricted to lesser crimes, applied individually, and in a manner that encourages the uncovering of information on the fate of victims, amnesties can serve to entrench impunity and invite vigilantism. Furthermore, international norms of accountability and the prospect of International Criminal Court (ICC) investigations and indictments make it more difficult to promise amnesty. Lastly, the case of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb suggests amnesties will not convince all radicals to stop fighting.\nHow countries in the Middle East deal with their pasts in the coming months and years will go a long way toward determining the chances for long-term peace, stability and democracy. Precisely what effect, if any, transitional justice has will be shaped by country-specific factors. The best role for the international community is one of support. Given the distrust of outside interference that has been generated by the history of international intervention in the region, pushing transitional justice more strongly risks a backlash. International NGOs should continue to support official and civil-society initiatives to pursue a transitional justice compatible with local circumstances, while pressuring governments to enact legitimate processes. Pressure from other states is likely to continue to be selective, reflecting the predominance of economic and geostrategic calculations over the consistent promotion of justice and human rights in the region. Outside interference and overbearing ICC action is more likely to create a nationalist backlash rather than promote accountability. Although unsatisfying to long-suffering victims, perhaps the best solution is prudence and patience.\n1 For an overview of the evolution of transitional justice, see Ruti G.

That year she would also have the biggest hit of her career with the breakout single and chart-topping album, How Glad I Am . \nThroughout the early 60s, Wilson enjoyed a multi-genre appeal, switching effortlessly between pop, jazz and R&B. Ever since her debut single \u201cGuess Who I Saw Today\u2019 in 1960, she established herself as a singular storyteller, with the unique intonation and phrasing of a jazz singer, the passion of a blues singer and the crystal clear delivery of a commercial pop star. \nHaving cut her teeth in nightclubs as a teenager, Wilson\u2019s sultry song styling was a natural fit for jazz standards like \u2018Happiness Is Just A Thing Called Joe\u2019 and she earned plenty of cred within the jazz world for her collaborations with saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, Ramsey Lewis and George Shearing. Wilson was inspired by the records her father would play while she was growing up, like Little Jimmy Scott of The Lionel Hampton Big Band, eventually blending these big-band influences with pop orchestration and a soulful style that could be edgy and mainstream simultaneously. \nThroughout her career, she found the label of jazz singer too limiting and preferred to think herself of as more of an interpreter, which explains the diverse styles that span How Glad I Am. From the sweeping ballads (\u2018Never Less Than Yesterday\u2019) to show tunes (\u2018Don\u2019t Rain On My Parade\u2019 and \u2018People\u2019 from Funny Girl ) bossa nova (\u2018The Boy From Ipanema\u2019 and \u2018Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars\u2019) and jazz-blues (\u2018West Coast Blues\u2019). She would pull material from the pop cannon no matter its origin, as evident on her previous LP\u2019s, Hollywood \u2013 My Way and Broadway \u2013 My Way , that tackled pop standards from stage and screen. But out of this whole collection of singles, the title track \u2018(You Don\u2019t Know) How Glad I Am\u2019 is what would propel \u201cMiss Nancy\u201d to the top of the charts and earn her a Grammy for Best Rhythm And Blues Recording. \nThe single would become a huge radio hit, topping the US Top 10 Pop and R&B charts and would reach No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August of 1964, just edging out The Beach Boys \u2019 \u2018I Get Around\u2019. That same year, Aretha Franklin would cover the single on her Runnin' Out of Fools record. While many artists would go on to cover the song, it\u2019s Wilson\u2019s song through and through. The melody floats like a Glenda\u2019s bubble in The Wizard Of Oz and her syncopated vocals make you hang onto every note. It\u2019s no wonder the song has become a favourite among Northern Soul fans over the years. \nThanks to her sophisticated stage presence and soulful voice, Nancy Wilson would become the mother of adult-contemporary music, paving the way for the likes of Diana Ross and Dusty Springfield. She was able to outsell many of her contemporaries by making the leap from the jazz and R&B charts to a wider pop audience, a strategic step that would prove beneficial for many African American artists like Nat King Cole and Dionne Warwick. \nThe same year How Glad I Am was released, Time magazine heralded Wilson as \u201cthe greatest pretender to Ella Fitzgerald 's crown for a long time to come. She is, all at once, both cool and sweet, both singer and storyteller.\" Wilson was also a dynamic live performer and her innate theatricality and ease on camera would lead to numerous television appearances in the 1960s and eventually her own TV series in NBC, The Nancy Wilson Show which ran from 1967-1968 and won an Emmy. \nAlthough she would spend the next few decades embracing a more pop soul sound, Nancy Wilson never abandoned her jazz roots entirely and would go on to host a successful jazz radio show on NPR and release over a staggering 60 albums. \nHow Glad I Am is one of 75 classic albums picked to celebrate the milestone that is Capitol Records\u2019 75th birthday.

There are many body building supplements that are available today which range all the way from simple protein shakes to dangerous and illegal steroids. \nProtein based supplements are the most basic of bodybuilding supplements. This is a supplement for anyone exercising for any sport or competition. Whey protein is by far the best out of all protein type supplements because of higher absorption rates. \nNext on the list of supplements is creatine. Creatine boosts performance to bring users to maximum fatigue. It should not be considered necessary for a good workout, although it should be consider part of high end bodybuilding supplements . On the other hand, there are more potent supplements that are designed for size and strength gains in the shortest time possible. One can often see gains similar to what someone using illegal steroids would see. This is done without the risks and side effects of dangerous drugs. Some of the well known legal and safe body building supplements include: DecaVol, 1 Andro and 4 AD. \nThese supplements are designed to provide gains similar to Olympic heavy weight lifting levels. The specific weight and size gains are partly dependent on intensity and frequency of workouts. It is not uncommon to see 7-17 lbs in a month. However by combing these supplements together (also known as stacking) one can see similar gains in about half the time. There are supplements out there that claim similar gains although much of the gain is water weight which is shed shortly after going off the supplement. As such, it is important to ensure that your gains are dry or otherwise known as hard muscle gains. Thankfully DecaVol, 1Andro, and 4 AD do not lead to water weight gains even when stacked with other Advanced Muscle Science supplements (AMS is the company that produces the DecaVol, 1 Andro, and 4 AD). \nMost of the top ten muscle supplement manufactured today are manufactured by AMS, and their products work very well when stacked together. However, these are not replacement for: real nutrition ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook  bodybuild", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:20.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "120c6694abc2e9ff4601502ac89282afff797192", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGSkRlVQE.Fu8e0qP4Bpi.Cu0XbcIFi6s7Z", "site_full": "www.pistonheads.com", "site": "pistonheads.com", "site_section": "http://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/forum.asp?h=0&f=204", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_cars", "vehicles", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "TV, Film &amp; Radio - Page 1 - PistonHeads ", "title": "The official PH Coronation Street thread 299", "title_full": "The official PH Coronation Street thread - Page 299 - TV, Film & Radio - PistonHeads", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.908, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8486, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "120c6694abc2e9ff4601502ac89282afff797192", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGSkRlVQE.Fu8e0qP4Bpi.Cu0XbcIFi6s7Z", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "james_tigerwoods", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "The official PH Coronation Street thread 299", "text": "We have been trying to!
