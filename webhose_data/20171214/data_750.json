I'm sorry to hear that you are going through this tough time, and that you are facing problems in your relationship. Sometimes couples who face issues in a relationship may find relationship counselling helpful, where you and your wife can discuss the problems with a trained professional. However this would require your wife to agree, and I'd advise you to speak with her not when she is angry, but when she feels calm. Perhaps then you can address the avenue you want to take to solve the problems in your relationship.\nIn my opinion, I think the first step to solving a problem is acknowledging there is one in the first place. It seems that you have done this already by posting here, so well done. Now it is up to your wife to also acknowledge there is an issue. Again, open and honest communication is a good way to do this, especially when she is calm.\nYou mentioned you were concerned if your wife's violent behaviour is a symptom of mental illness. Sometimes mental illnesses can cause violent behaviour. However violent behaviour alone when angry may not indicate an illness and she could just be very angry and not know how to express it. If you are concerned she has a mental illness, it would be a good idea to talk to your GP, if possible, with your wife. This is easier said than done, I know, because there is a lot of stigma surrounding mental illness, but if you do suspect she is ill then like a physical illness it should be treated. However the best person to make that judgement is a medical professional.\nEven if she is not diagnosed with a mental illness however, it may still be a good idea to see a psychologist or counsellor to help her with how she can express her concerns. As Hayfa said, she may be insecure about your relationship and unsure whether your ex-wife is still in the picture. She may also still feel hurt that you didn't tell her all the details of your previous relationships. This are all valid feelings, and it is important that you show her that what she feels is real and valid. But the way to express this should not be through hurting you or abuse, and so it is really about learning the best way you two communicate. Again, mental health professionals and other relationship counsellors may be of help with that.\nFinally, regarding your mental health, it sounds like you are worried and tired of dealing with the abuse. It is crucial you stay mentally well and take care of yourself.\nJosette", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [],

A swarm of 360 Japanese warplanes followed, descending on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in a ferocious assault. The surprise attack struck a critical blow against the U.S. Pacific fleet and drew the United States irrevocably into World War II. \nWith diplomatic negotiations with Japan breaking down, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his advisers knew that an imminent Japanese attack was probable, but nothing had been done to increase security at the important naval base at Pearl Harbor. \nIt was Sunday morning, and many military personnel had been given passes to attend religious services off base. At 7:02 a.m., two radar operators spotted large groups of aircraft in flight toward the island from the north, but, with a flight of B-17s expected from the United States at the time, they were told to sound no alarm. Thus, the Japanese air assault came as a devastating surprise to the naval base. \nMuch of the Pacific fleet was rendered useless: Five of eight battleships, three destroyers, and seven other ships were sunk or severely damaged, and more than 200 aircraft were destroyed. A total of 2,400 Americans were killed and 1,200 were wounded, many while valiantly attempting to repulse the attack. \nJapan\u2019s losses were some 30 planes, five midget submarines, and fewer than 100 men. Fortunately for the United States, all three Pacific fleet carriers were out at sea on training maneuvers. These giant aircraft carriers would have their revenge against Japan six months later at the Battle of Midway, reversing the tide against the previously invincible Japanese navy in a spectacular victory. \nThe day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, President Roosevelt appeared before a joint session of Congress and declared, \u201cYesterday, December 7, 1941\u2013a date which will live in infamy\u2013the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.\u201d \nAfter a brief and forceful speech, he asked Congress to approve a resolution recognizing the state of war between the United States and Japan. The Senate voted for war against Japan by 82 to 0, and the House of Representatives approved the resolution by a vote of 388 to 1. The sole dissenter was Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana, a devout pacifist who had also cast a dissenting vote against the U.S. entrance into World War I. \nThree days later, Germany and Italy declared war against the United States, and the U.S. government responded in kind. The American contribution to the successful Allied war effort spanned four long years and cost more than 400,000 American lives. \n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "franklin d. roosevelt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeannette rankin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roosevelt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearl harbor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. pacific", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:20.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "65586b64827b4b43640eded678cac4e1c4970007", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKDWBLQrZwhUkJJFNbL7IeldA0PSG__tXmGC0Rl1HXG4Qy44_aBpb27sn5xCbkG8i62bIOvbs9RoxPsO7VrfWG", "site_full": "kldaily.com", "site": "kldaily.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "comic_books"], "section_title": "", "title": "Unicorn AIM VCT Ord (UAV) Increased 1.08% on Dec 7", "title_full": "Unicorn AIM VCT Ord (UAV) Increased 1.08% on Dec 7", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.249, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "65586b64827b4b43640eded678cac4e1c4970007", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKDWBLQrZwhUkJJFNbL7IeldA0PSG__tXmGC0Rl1HXG4Qy44_aBpb27sn5xCbkG8i62bIOvbs9RoxPsO7VrfWG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Unicorn AIM VCT Ord (UAV) Increased 1.08% on Dec 7", "text": "Unicorn AIM VCT Ord (UAV) Increased 1.08% on Dec 7 \nDecember 7, 2017 - By Maria Brooks \nShares of Unicorn AIM VCT Ord (LON:UAV) last traded at 140, representing a move of 1.08%, or 1.5 per share, on volume of 3,615 shares. After opening the trading day at 139, shares of Unicorn AIM VCT Ord traded in a close range. Unicorn AIM VCT Ord currently has a total float of shares and on average sees shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 1.35 and high of 139. FTSE 100 Index: Driving The U.K. \nThe Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE 100 Index) or FTSE 100 for short, is the benchmark index of the top 100 largest and most liquid stocks on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). As such, the index is market capitalization-weighted and free-float adjusted. FTSE 100 is operated by FTSE Group, a unit of London Stock Exchange Group. \nA large component of the index is made up of foreign companies listed on LSE. So while the index tracks the LSE\u2019s blue-chip stocks, it is considered a weak representation of the U.K.\u2019s economy because of its large foreign constituency. \nFor investors interested in tracking the health of the U.K. economy, the FTSE 250 is a better guide because it is dominated by domestic U.K. companies. \nComponents of FTSE 100 make up more than 80% of LSE\u2019s entire market capitalization and that partly explains why it is a widely used gauge of the U.K.\u2019s stock market. However, a more comprehensive indicator is the FTSE All-Share Index, which is broader as it aggregates FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and other small-cap stocks on the LSE. Rebalancing of the index \nThe FTSE 100 is reshuffled quarterly. The Rebalancing of the index takes into account the changes in the market capitalization of its constituents such as after a rights issue or a large debt-to-equity swap. Components of FTSE 100 represent a variety of sectors in the U.K. economy such as Financials, Industrials, Technology and Energy. Unicorn AIM VCT Ord is a stock traded on the U.K\u2019s stock exchange. Historic marks \nFTSE 100 Index dipped to a lifetime low of 427.50 points in February 1978, but steadily recovered from the trough. The index notched a lifetime high of 7103.98 points in April 2015 amid speculation that the Conservative Part would win the U.K. general election in May of the same year. The index\u2019s earlier record high was reached in 1999 during the so-called dot-com bubble. Unicorn AIM VCT Ord has relatively good liquidity. The stock market \nThe LSE is the main stock exchange in the U.K. and one of the largest in the world. The exchange was established in 1801, making it one of the world\u2019s oldest stock markets. The LSE is also a platform for companies to raise capital for expansion. \nThe exchange has an SME focused platform called the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). It also operates the Depository Receipt (DR) platform for trading shares of foreign companies based outside the European Union. \nA variety of securities are traded on LSE. These include equities, bonds, ETFs and a broad line of other derivatives. Opening hours \nThe LSE platform opens for trading at 8 a.m. and closes at 4 p.m. But there are pre-market and post-market sessions that open early and close late. The exchange operates all weekday except on holidays declared in advance. The market is closed on weekends. \nThe LSE is owned by the London Stock Exchange Group, which also owns several other exchanges across Europe and the FTSE 100 Index. U.K. stocks drawing more investors \nThough Brexit has shaken several businesses and economies in the Eurozone and beyond, U.K. companies continue to see investor interest in their stocks thanks in part to the country\u2019s strong regulations and corporate transparency. \nProspects of the U.K. avoiding hard Brexit are also strengthening retail investor hopes that the country\u2019s economy would escape recession after it leaves the European Union. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect Unicorn AIM VCT Ord. \nMore news for Unicorn AIM VCT Ord (LON:UAV) were recently published by: Ft.com, which released: \u201cShare swaps for VCT investors\u201d on January 20, 2012.

Tim Hahn @ETNHahn \nAn 18-year-old Erie man charged with taking part in a burglary at an east Erie residence hours after two residents of the house drowned in floodwaters that rushed into the basement during a Nov. 5 storm waived a felony burglary charge to court under an agreement with prosecutors Wednesday afternoon. \nMajed K. Al-Jayashi waived his preliminary hearing before Erie 5th Ward District Judge Paul Bizzarro on the charge under an agreement in which conspiracy, theft and receiving stolen property charges were withdrawn. \nAl-Jayashi remains in the Erie County Prison on $100,000 bond. \nTwo other Erie residents charged with committing the burglary with Al-Jayashi, 22-year-old Tyree J. Catledge, and 18-year-old Shannon J. Lambert, are expected to appear in court for their preliminary hearings on Dec. 22, officials said in court Wednesday. Catledge and Lambert also remain in prison on $100,000 bond. \nAl-Jayashi, Catledge, and Lambert are accused of entering a residence at 504 E. 30th St. sometime during the late evening of Nov. 5 or early morning of Nov. 6, hours after rising floodwaters from a powerful storm that blew through the Erie region caved in the front wall of the residence and filled the basement with water. Gary Hoffman, 59, and Michael Mcgurn, 55, who lived in the house, were in the basement at the time and drowned, according to authorities. \nErie police investigators said they believe the three burglary suspects learned of the deaths through Facebook and used the tragedy as an opportunity to go to the house and steal items from it. Items taken in the burglary included three televisions, a safe containing a .45-caliber revolver, jewelry and personal items, Erie police Detective Sgt. Earl Matson wrote in the criminal complaints. \nTips from the public helped lead detectives to identify the suspects in the crime, according to police. \nTim Hahn can be reached at 870-1731 or by email.

Normal plasma cells are found in the bone marrow and are an important part of the immune system. Plasma cells helps to fight infections by making antibodies that recognize and attack germs. Multiple myeloma causes cancer cells to accumulate in the bone marrow, where they crowd out healthy blood cells. These malignant plasma cells then produce abnormal proteins (m protein) which may cause tumors, damage the kidneys, and impair immune system function. \nReport Overview @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/multiple-myeloma-treatment-market.asp \nThe global Multiple Myeloma market is anticipated to be mainly driven by increase in ageing population, rising obese population, increase in healthcare expenditure and increased penetration of novel cancer drugs. Some of the significant developments of this industry include upcoming new innovative products in the market, trend of combination therapies, and chance of new players. \nThe multiple myeloma drug treatment market will benefit from novel therapies from 2016 to 2023. The main drivers of growth will be the launch of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) Empliciti and Darzalex, which will not only provide a new treatment option for MM patients, but they will also lengthen the time between relapses, meaning that the duration of Revlimid and/or Velcade treatments will also be longer. Also, launch of second-generation proteasome inhibitors Ninlaro and Kyprolis, will further increase treatment options for these patients. This situation will change the industry and market, which is currently dominated by an immunomodulator, Revlimid, and a proteasome inhibitor, Velcade. \nThe main strength of this market is that it\u2019s able to support many products. Novel drugs will likely to add treatment options for the Multiple Myeloma patients. Rather than competing with each other for a share of the market, these novel drugs will be used together to form more-effective treatment regimens, driving sales for each other. Again, when patients relapse, a different combination will be used. This means there are significant opportunities for revenue generation during the forecast period. There are several promising compounds in late stage development that will capture a significant share of the market after approval. Those agents include HDAC inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and kinase inhibitors. These launches will make market more diverse, with several blockbuster products claiming a significant share. The patent expiries of a number of key treatments will pave the way for further new mAbs to have a major impact on the multiple myeloma therapeutics space by 2023. \nHowever, there are limitations in this market. The limited target patient population is a restricting factor that will come into play during the forecast period. With the launch of new mAbs one after the other may cause the market saturation, then, and revenue growth will slow. Also, the high treatment price and legal regulations will restrict the market growth. \nThe biggest constrainers of market are the increasing cost-consciousness of healthcare providers, as the launch and subsequent label extensions of these pipeline agents will lead to a significant expense, which may impact uptake of these drugs by the patients. \nProteasome Inhibitors blocks proteasome which degrades unwanted cellular proteins, the inhibitors create a build-up of these proteins in the cell causing cancer cells to die. Velcade was the first drug to be approved in this category which validated that proteasome can be considered as therapeutic target. It can be administered as intravenously or subcutaneously. Kyprolis is second-generation proteasome inhibitors approved for use in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma. Ninlaro is a first approved oral proteasome inhibitor, it is approved with the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone. \nRequest to View Sample of Research Report @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/13954 \nIMiDs are thalidomide analogues, which has pleiotropic anti-myeloma properties including immune-modulation, anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects. Thalomid shown to be effective across the spectrum of myeloma disease; however it has peripheral neuropathy a common side effect and can be irreversible. Revlimid is more potent over Thalomid. Pomalyst is an oral Immunomodulatory Agent which is most potent and has few side effects. \nHistone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are thought to work in part by reversing some cancer-associated epigenome modifications. Farydak is administered in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. It is indicated for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior regimens, including bortezomib and an IMiDs. \nImmunotherapy is the new form of therapy for Multiple Myeloma treatment. This therapy stimulates the immune system and enhance their ability to attack cancer cells. These treatments involve the antibodies that targets the specific proteins found on the multiple myeloma cells or on immune cells, while others include vaccines and modified immune cells. Darzalex is the first approved monoclonal antibody for Multiple Myeloma treatment. It is recommended in the patients who have at-least received three line of therapies in prior, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), or who are refractory to both a proteasome inhibitor and an IMiD. Daratumumab is anticipated to achieve peak sales only by 2023. Empliciti is approved in combination with Revlimid/dexamethasone for patients who has who are refractory to prior three therapies. \nChemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (Cytotoxic) drugs, which enters the bloodstream and are distributed to all parts of the body. They destroy cancer cells by interfering with their ability to divide and grow. Doxil is a reformulated version of doxorubicin (Adriamycin\u00ae), which has been used for many years in traditional chemotherapy regimens in multiple myeloma treatment. \nGeographically the Multiple Myeloma Treatment Market is segmented into five key regions: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and MEA region which will be boosted by increasing therapeutic options, including the introduction of two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with blockbuster potential, namely elotuzumab and daratumumab, during the forecast period. \nMajor players in this markets are namely Johnson & Johnson, Roche Holding, Sanofi and Novartis. \nBuy now @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/checkout/13954 About Us Persistence Market Research (PMR) is a third-platform research firm.

Republican Andy Barr has held the seat since 2013. \nGray will face at least three other people for the Democratic nomination: former fighter pilot Amy McGrath, state Sen. Reggie Thomas and Geoff Young, who has run for the seat twice before. \nBut Gray is well known in the district, which includes Lexington. He ran a statewide campaign for Senate in 2016, losing to Sen. Rand Paul. \nDemocrats have been coveting the 6th Congressional district for years.

It is due to open on February 1. \nIt follows the opening of the first Humble Grape in Battersea in 2015, followed by Fleet Street last year and Islington this year. \nJames and his team now import over 400 craft wines directly from boutique vineyards around the world, dedicated to wines that are single vineyard, organic, biodynamic or sustainably sourced. \nAt Humble Grape Liverpool Street, customers will be able to taste a revolving and evolving list of 30 wines by the glass and over 400 by the bottle, while discovering the origins of each \u2013 either from the team, who are trained by the winemakers themselves, or by exploring the Winemaker Wall, which will feature photos and tales from the vineyards and winemakers. \nThis year, Humble Grape exceeded all expectations with its second crowdfunding campaign and raised over \u00a31.2 million to open further sites, expand its wine club and increase online sales. \nEach new Humble Grape site will maintain an individual identity, taking into consideration the local community and style of the building. \nJames is again working with architect Jean Dumas of Trellik Design Studios to create Humble Grape Liverpool Street \u2013 a further evolution in design from the existing Humble Grape wine bars and shops. \nThe interior (pictured) features a listed stone wall which will be complemented by reclaimed and aged natural materials in a palette of whites, blues, tan and clay. The sustainable ethos will continue throughout, with menu paper made from recycled crushed grapes and shelves fashioned from recycled cork. \nCustomers will be invited to browse and select wine to drink in or take away from the wine displays integrated throughout the interior. \nHumble Grape\u2019s executive head chef Kishen Raheja will continue the brand ethos and champion independent suppliers, serving small-plate dishes using sustainable, ethically-sourced ingredients. \nKishen is working directly with independent craftspeople such as award-winning north London artisanal cheesemakers Wildes Cheese and Essex day-boat fisherman Ben Woodcraft from Mersey Island. The winter menu will include seasonal small-plate and sharing dishes such as cuttlefish stew with chorizo, fennel and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and duck confit with clementine.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kishen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wildes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kishen raheja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james dawson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben woodcraft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean dumas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bishopsgate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "essex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trellik design studios", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humble grape liverpool street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "battersea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liverpool street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mersey island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "devonshire row", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:22.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d61173bdc660d31f510dabd1197dadcecd8061f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxpORzbI0iSqlAvu8xVCfynK61jPddILlSjkyjh19le9Mqz8vtdak04AIogt.Cs1FLdkmN0mxRBUi7VkhmLUig3", "site_full": "fkbt.com", "site": "fkbt.com", "site_section": "http://fkbt.com", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Free Kindle Books and Tips", "title": "Free & Discounted Kindle Books for Thursday", "title_full": "Free & Discounted Kindle Books for Thursday", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d61173bdc660d31f510dabd1197dadcecd8061f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxpORzbI0iSqlAvu8xVCfynK61jPddILlSjkyjh19le9Mqz8vtdak04AIogt.Cs1FLdkmN0mxRBUi7VkhmLUig3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Gallagher", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Free & Discounted Kindle Books for Thursday", "text": "Free & Discounted Kindle Books for Thursday December 7, 2017 by Michael Gallagher Leave a Comment \nHere\u2019s your first group of free and discounted Kindle book offers in a variety of genres for Thursday: for those books listed as being free in this post \u2013 while the pricing of the free status is valid at the time of this posting, please make sure you check the pricing carefully before you press the \u201cbuy\u201d button as it could revert back to paid status at any time! Book Description: \nA story about first love, growing up, and impossible choices\u2026 \nGrowing up means making hard choices, but Ariana didn\u2019t expect it to be this hard. She\u2019s determined to graduate high school and go to the University of Georgia. That\u2019s if she can even get in and figure out a way to pay for college. It would mean everything to her family if she got into UGA. They\u2019re counting on her. \nBut then Lucas steps into her life, waltzing into her senior year and disrupting her careful plans. He\u2019s the guy of her dreams, the kind of boyfriend that could restore her faith in high school love, but he can\u2019t go with her to UGA. His family needs him at home. \nTorn between duty and romance, do the two of them even stand a chance, especially with Lucas\u2019s ex-girlfriend prowling to get him back? Practical, responsible, Ariana knows she has to choose, because you can\u2019t have it all. So, why does either choice make her feel like she\u2019s losing everything? \nClick here to pick up your free copy of Without You   \nA MYSTERY FROM DEEP SPACE\u2026 \nAN EPIC ADVENTURE THRILLER \nBACKED BY REAL SCIENCE. \nNASA discovers a mysterious object heading toward us. Humanity only has days to prepare. Can one family survive? \nSomething massive is coming\u2026and it\u2019s heading for Earth. That\u2019s what astronomer Ben Rollins is told by NASA after being dragged out of bed in the middle of the night. His first instinct is to call his daughter, Jessica, who\u2019s vacationing in Italy with his wife. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a hundred times bigger than the sun,\u201d Ben tells them. \u201cSomehow we can\u2019t see it yet, and we don\u2019t know what it is, but they\u2019re calling it Nomad\u2013and in just months, the Earth may be destroyed.\u201d \nBut how did they miss detecting it until now? \nThe world erupts into chaos as the end approaches, and Ben discovers his wife and daughter are trapped in Europe. \nThe key to Nomad\u2019s mystery\u2013and humanity\u2019s ultimate survival\u2013rests in the answers Ben pieces together from his old Cold War-era research papers, in the midst of a desperate scramble across continents to find his family before Nomad swallows the

And no-one will ever stop her.\u201d \nPredictably, Russian politicians praised the announcement. \nBut top Putin critic Alexei Navalny, who has declared a Kremlin bid despite not being allowed to run due to a suspended sentence for fraud, called the president a \u201cswindler.\u201d \n\u201cI suggest we don\u2019t agree,\u201d Navalny, a 41-year-old Western-educated lawyer, said on Twitter, referring to Putin\u2019s plans. \n\u2013 Leaving Kremlin \u2018feet first\u2019\u2013 \nSocial networks were abuzz, with many ridiculing the Kremlin strongman and some comparing him to Robert Mugabe, the ousted leader of Zimbabwe. \n\u201cVladimir Vladimirovich has decided to play the old Russian game dubbed \u2018Out of the Kremlin feet first,'\u201d said one critic, Aleksandr Kommari, on Facebook. \nMuscovite Kirill Goncharov said he went to school and graduated from university under Putin. \n\u201cTime \u2014 the most important thing every person has \u2014 will be wasted on Vladimir Putin realising his personal ambitions,\u201d he said on Facebook. \nPutin\u2019s statement came as Russia reeled from a decision by the International Olympic Committee to ban the country from the Winter Games as punishment over claims of state-orchestrated doping. \nBut despite a litany of problems including corruption, poverty and poor healthcare, the 65-year-old leader enjoys approval ratings of 80 percent. \n\u2013\u2018Do you trust me?\u2019\u2013 \nJust hours earlier Putin visited a glitzy ceremony for volunteers in Moscow where he sought to rouse supporters. \n\u201cI want to ask, do you trust and support me?\u201d he addressed the huge audience of mostly young people. \u201cYes,\u201d the audience chanted. \nProminent athletes and Soviet-era celebrities such as 83-year-old actor Vasily Lanovoi, took to the stage to extol Russian successes, such as Soviet victory in World War II. \nCosmonaut Sergei Ryazansky addressed the audience via video link from the International Space Station. \nPutin has sought to appeal to the country\u2019s youth after thousands of young Russians took to the streets earlier this year to protest alleged corruption among elites, targeting Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev among others. \nThe demonstrations were sparked by a documentary fronted by Navalny. \nPutin first became president after Boris Yeltsin sensationally resigned on New Year\u2019s Eve 1999. At the end of his second term in 2008 he handed power to his protege Medvedev. \n\u2013\u2018No one on the horizon\u2019\u2013 \nPutin then served a term as prime minister \u2014 although few doubted who was really in charge \u2014 and returned as president in 2012. \nIf he extends his rule to 2024, Putin will have led Russia longer than Leonid Brezhnev, who presided over an era of stagnation from 1964 to 1982 and became the target of derision in his later years. \nSome analysts say that after 18 years of leadership \u2014 both as president and prime minister \u2014 Putin fatigue may be spreading across the country. \nMany Russians say they would vote for Putin simply because they do not see an alternative, given the former KGB officer\u2019s chokehold on domestic politics. \n\u201cSo far he is the only one on the horizon,\u201d Sergei Inshakov, a 36-year-old part-time taxi driver and former professional handball player, told AFP. \n\u201cIt will be better, more dependable for everyone this way.\u201d \nWith the result of the election a foregone conclusion, turnout could be low, harming the Kremlin\u2019 hopes for a clear mandate, observers say. \nAccording to a poll conducted by the independent Levada Centre pollster last month, just 58 percent of respondents said they would vote, down from 75 percent in December 2007. \n-\u2018What will happen after 2018?\u2019\u2013 \nPutin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this week that those figures came ahead of the start of a political campaign and would grow. \nMany expect Kseniya Sobchak, a 36-year-old glamourous former host of a television reality show and daughter of Putin\u2019s former mentor, will likely be allowed to run, rekindling some public interest in the election. \nBut what comes after Putin\u2019s expected re-election and later, after his new term ends in 2024, is the bigger question, analysts say. \n\u201cThe main intrigue is, what will happen after 2018, how the configuration of power will be changing,\u201d Tatyana Stanovaya, a Paris-based analyst for the Centre of Political Technologies in Moscow, told AFP. \nSpeculation has swirled over the past weeks that the Kremlin may be considering changes to the constitution or a new job for Putin in an effort to extend his grip on power beyond 2024. \n\u201cThe main task for the Kremlin is to adapt the regime to Putin\u2019s future status \u2014 be it an extension of presidential powers or the creation of a new post,\u201d said Stanovaya.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leonid brezhnev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navalny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirill goncharov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph stalin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry peskov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lavrov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergei ryazansky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boris yeltsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergei inshakov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanovaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir vladimirovich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry medvedev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aleksandr kommari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexei navalny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2013  putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vasily lanovoi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mugabe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medvedev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tatyana stanovaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kseniya sobchak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "russian federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nizhny novgorod", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international olympic committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kgb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centre of political technologies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "levada centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international space station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:23.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70b5464081895232098848fc45f89a995a3f4bb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVlT8m.xNywiyJI_A6v9Y1NZmEo5NFc55dJUqiAyvfe7C3qnn_XbzHazmPPOnIwn9J8kF_Zzjqgw873gKnUbVJO9otpkp1OyGUj6c5DXbpk4XEQMCuLPbVt4-", "site_full": "www.dailypolitical.com", "site": "dailypolitical.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Polaris Industries Inc.

Here's what you need to know in markets on Thursday. \n1. Theresa May has criticised Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital as Israel, calling the provocative move \"unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region.\" The status of Jerusalem is hotly disputed, with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority laying claim to the city as their capital. Every other country does not recognise it as the capital of Israel, and instead base their embassies in Tel Aviv. \n2. Britain will guarantee rights for as yet unborn children who join EU parents after Brexit and accept EU judges' rulings on such rights, according to a draft European Parliament resolution seen by Reuters on Thursday. The document, drafted on Monday for a vote next week before an EU summit that may launch talks on a future EU-UK free trade pact, also confirms that British Prime Minister Theresa May has secured agreement from Brussels that British citizens in the EU will be able to live freely in any member state after Brexit. \n3. Bitcoin briefly passed the $14,000 mark a short time ago \u2014 marking a gain of more than $2,000 in the last 24 hours. Prices on Coinbase \u2014 one of the largest US trading platforms \u2014 hit a high of $14,344.22 during overnight trading in Asia and Australia. \n4. Mobile money transfer service WorldRemit has raised $40 million (\u00a329.7 million) from LeapFrog Investments and existing investors Accel Partners and Technology Crossover Ventures. WorldRemit announced the \"Series C\" fundraising on Thursday. It takes the total raised by the London-headquartered company to $220 million (\u00a3163.8 million). \n\n5. The average first-time buyer deposit in London could soar to an eye-watering \u00a3250,000 within a decade, according to new research from broker L&C Mortgages. The firm said average deposits in the capital could rise from \u00a3140,000 this year to \u00a3245,000 by 2027, which represents a 75% rise. Nationally, average deposits could rise from \u00a352,000 to \u00a381,000 in the same period, nearly a 60% rise. \n6. Global investment banks are going to see their revenues in Europe chopped by $4.4 billion from the new financial reforms that start to go live in January, according to a new report. Trading desks will bear the brunt of the losses. Banks generate about $170 billion in revenues from corporate and investment banking (CIB) operations in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region \u2014 EMEA \u2014 but the broad and complex European regulatory reforms known as MiFID II are expected to trim that figure by 2.6%, according to Coalition, an industry analytics and consulting firm. \n7. A U.S.-based Volkswagen executive who oversaw emissions issues was sentenced to seven years in prison and fined $400,000 by a judge on Wednesday for his role in a diesel emissions scandal that has cost the German automaker as much as $30 billion. The prison sentence and fine for the executive, Oliver Schmidt, were the maximum possible under a plea deal in August the German national made with prosecutors after admitting to charges of conspiring to mislead U.S regulators and violate clean-air laws. \n8. A majority of Leave voters believe that the UK government is handling Brexit talks badly and will end up with a bad deal according to new research published today. A new report by pollster John Curtice for the National Centre for Social Research and What UK Thinks has found that while those who voted Brexit last year still believe they made the right decision, there has been a sharp increase in pessimism among them about how the negotiations are going. \n9. President Vladimir Putin confirmed Russia's worst kept political secret on Wednesday, saying he would run for re-election in March 2018 - a contest he seems sure to win comfortably and extend his grip on power into a third decade. Putin, 65, has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since 2000, longer than veteran Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and outstripped only by dictator Josef Stalin. \n10. North Korea said the US is making war unavoidable . In yet another round of threats, North Korea said this week's joint US-South Korea aerial drill is a \" dangerous provocation .\" \nNOW WATCH: These are the watches worn by the smartest and most powerful men in the world More: 10 Things Before European Markets 10 Things Before European Markets Open", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter mcdairmid", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "leonid brezhnev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josef stalin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oliver schmidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john curtice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volkswagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "worldremit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national centre for social research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leapfrog investments", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestinian authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accel partners and technology crossover ventures", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us-south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:23.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c5aae5c21a9b8b9a21b93c2dfe812aeadfa68dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvpyZvYY3fyG1763W9ElRw6GK39wxBfoGN2AglB9U9ZYytdHzRRu.UaGmmzya7xMmvDREAUGNFNAVbllTFzCu2GuAevU6MODalfUvnNvUuKcQ--", "site_full": "jonathonaspen.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://jonathonaspen.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Website Blog", "title": "Book A Swimming Pool Service Essex, London and Nationwide", "title_full": "Book A Swimming Pool Service Essex, London and Nationwide", "published": "2017-12-07T12:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4c5aae5c21a9b8b9a21b93c2dfe812aeadfa68dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvpyZvYY3fyG1763W9ElRw6GK39wxBfoGN2AglB9U9ZYytdHzRRu.UaGmmzya7xMmvDREAUGNFNAVbllTFzCu2GuAevU6MODalfUvnNvUuKcQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Book A Swimming Pool Service Essex, London and Nationwide", "text": "Book A Swimming Pool Service Essex, London and Nationwide : Book A Swimming Pool Service.

In a moving ceremony, kin, friends, and strangers gathered to honor and say farewell to their beloved friend who died on Nov. 18, after being hit by an SUV on State Road in Vineyard Haven. \nAs people filled the front room and milled about, their eyes lingered over the photos and writing on the walls \u2014 Virginia as a girl, Virginia lying out at Lambert\u2019s Cove Beach, Virginia mid-laugh at a party. Ms. Iverson was remembered for her sharp intellect, her love of the outdoors, and her passion for walking, gardening, dancing, and yoga. \nWhen describing Ms. Iverson, words like \u201ccourageous,\u201d \u201cgraceful in her pensiveness,\u201d \u201celegant,\u201d \u201cloving,\u201d and \u201csweetheart\u201d came up. \u201cShe was positive and optimistic, and always wanting to grow and change and learn,\u201d her daughter, Katherine Young, said. \nMs. Iverson\u2019s brother Neal Iverson spoke about her life , which started in Mobile, Ala., in 1946. She went on to attend Duke University, where she met Henry Newton Young and had her first child, Katherine, and later a son, Jonathan, who died in a car accident when he was 4 years old. \n\u201cThere is a sense of fate to her death,\u201d Ms. Young said, \u201cthat cars and accidents are punctuation marks to her life; a car accident taking her [son] and my younger brother, and then 40 years later a car accident taking her.\u201d \nPeople recounted the many times they picked Ms. Iverson up on a trip back from the grocery store or on their way to a ballroom dance class. Many spoke of the instant connection they felt to Ms. Iverson in the short time they chauffeured her to or from her destination. She was a recurring sight on the side of the road since she moved to the Island in 1978 with her daughter. \nTony Omer, who knew Ms. Iverson through her caretaking of his mother-in-law\u2019s property, was one of Ms. Iverson\u2019s many personal drivers. \u201cOver the years, I, evidently mistakenly, thought I was the only one who would pick her up and gave her a ride,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would meet at the Post Office, sometimes she had a bag of groceries, she would be standing on the side of the road waiting for the bus, and I would stop and pick her up. Well, invariably she would ask about my entire family. She would tell me about her daughter and what she was up to, and where she was living at the time. Every time I ran into her it was her smile, her willingness to share of her life and to show concern about yours. She\u2019s missed by all of us.\u201d \n\u201cShe felt so strongly about this place,\u201d Neal Iverson, Virginia\u2019s brother, said as the ceremony commenced. \u201cShe always spoke so warmly of Martha\u2019s Vineyard and you people up here, who were truly her neighbors and friends.\u201d \nRay LaPorte, who lived near Ms. Iverson with his wife Bernadette LaPorte for many years, valued his connection with his neighbor. \n\u201cShe made a big difference in our lives. She taught me how to walk the earth gently, almost without making a footprint on the land,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was an apparition. She was very grateful, had every question possible about our life, our children, [and our] grandson.\u201d \nMr. LaPorte recalled a sultry summer day when Ms. Iverson walked up to his door in a flowing white outfit and asked, \u201cHow do I look?\u201d With the sun beaming behind her, Mr. LaPorte recalled having to break the news to her, diplomatically, that \u201cit doesn\u2019t leave much to the imagination.\u201d \n\u201cShe politely said \u2018Oh,\u2019 and sauntered back down,\u201d Mr. LaPorte said. \u201cI have no idea if she changed her clothes, but I will forever have that image of Virginia the apparition.\u201d \nThe evening was filled with many voices and stories, which ranged from humorous to sorrowful, and painted a picture of a gentle, intentional, and caring woman who shared her love of movement with everyone she met. \nMr. Iverson recalled the last time he danced with his sister, at her 50th high school reunion in Mobile. Despite having detached retinas in both eyes, Ms. Iverson lit up the dance floor. \u201cVirginia, unable to tell where she was going on the dance floor, was the star dancer,\u201d he said. \u201cI was confounded by how elegantly she performed.\u201d \nMs. Young read a story she wrote for the occasion that focused on her mother\u2019s \u201cbeautiful sore feet.\u201d \n\u201cMother had a life of movement,\u201d Ms. Young said. \u201cHer dogs had no choice but to become intrepid walkers as well. Creating a vision of my mother striding across pavement, sand, grass, earth, Roman cobblestones, and uneven Taiwanese sidewalks seems fitting for a woman who at age 31 took to her feet and gave up driving, something one could do in Vineyard Haven in the late \u201970s, and can still do Virginia style in 2017 \u2026 funky, eccentric, willing to go against the grain \u2014 classic Virginia.\u201d \nThe combination of being a perennial hitchhiker with poor vision made for humorous results. \u201cOnce, she famously flagged down what she thought was the Vineyard Transit Authority but was instead some handsome someone who agreeably took her to her destination,\u201d Ms. Young said. \nAs the crowd grew silent, Eleanor Stanwood stood up to read a poem she wrote for her late friend. Her husband David Stanwood, another longtime friend of Ms. Iverson, played a song on the piano.

Members of the clergy will lead us in prayer for an end to the unnecessary loss of life that gun violence has caused and continues to cause in this country, and for a just and moral resolution to the dilemma the country faces between personal freedom and public safety. \nThe public is invited to bear witness in silence to the vigil.

Leave the details to him. \nFor a young family of four, Lewis introduced an addition to the back of a North London Victorian that serves as kitchen, dining space, back entry, home office, and more. Lewis\u2019s client came to him with five-year-old magazine clippings of his work and a request to replace the worn-out Ikea kitchen in her family\u2019s quarters with something multipurpose and expansive. Join us for a tour of Lewis\u2019s design, including a look at his use of characterful materials and finishes: Many are surprisingly economical, and all look both at home and of the moment in this new stage set for daily life. \nPhotography by Rory Gardiner , courtesy of Mark Lewis Interior Design . The Kitchen Extension Above: The addition links the kitchen to the garden and features wood-framed French doors. \u201cThey were easy to fabricate and cost-efficient; metal is so much more expensive,\u201d says Lewis. The roof has slate shingles\u2014a splurge\u2014and three skylights. \nThe resulting space, approximately 45 square meters (484 square feet), is double the size of what had been there and required inserting steel supports\u2014\u201dto hold up the chimney and the WC wall\u201d\u2014in the interior. Lewis says permitting wasn\u2019t an issue: \u201cIn the UK, we have a committed development rule: You\u2019re allowed to add fifty cubic meters, or 1,765 cubic feet, if you own the house, and don\u2019t have to apply for permission.\u201d Above: Lewis has an aversion to \u201cfitted kitchens\u201d and whenever possible installs drawers instead of cabinets, \u201call in a line rather than turning a corner.\u201d Over the counter, he opts for racks and open shelves. \nThe sink is set in an antique pot cupboard from John Cornall Antiques of Warwick, and the adjoining drawers are made of old pine floorboards. Lewis used the client\u2019s existing range\u2014\u201dIt\u2019s going to carry on for another ten years, so why change it?\u201d\u2014and inserted a wall-mounted Smeg hood. (Browse our Hoods & Vents posts for ideas.) \nAbove: The butler sink is a Rak Gourmet Double Bowl and Lewis\u2019s go-to Brass Mixer Faucet is from Aston Matthews. Immediately next to the sink is a Fisher-Paykel integrated two-drawer dishwasher (read about dishwasher drawers in Remodeling 101 ). As for the wall hardware, it\u2019s all Lewis\u2019s own, S-hooks included: Finding that it was impossible to keep sourcing his favorite vintage details, he started fabricating reproductions\u2014see Custom Cast Bronze Hardware from Mark Lewis in London . The dark-blue- and yellow-rimmed Paris Bowls are by Manufacture de Digoin and came from the Conran Shop. Above: Tricks of the trade: To accentuate the graining on the drawers, the wood was \u201cbrushed with a wire brush that creates the texture of driftwood\u201d and finished with Fiddes Liming Wax . The counter is flame-textured black granite\u2014another splurge\u2014and the new floor is salvaged pine, stained to match and sealed with clear wax. Kitchen Details Above: Lewis lines his kitchen drawers with leftover wallpaper: \u201cWe stick it down with double-sided tape and don\u2019t add anything to protect it\u2014you lose the magic if you seal it. You just need to be prepared to redo it every few years.\u201d \nThe cast bronze pulls are Jake Handles ; \u00a315 ($19.80) each, which Lewis also makes in cast iron and brass. \nAbove: How to light the work area immediately under the skylights? Lewis inserted copper piping and used it as a place to suspend DIY pendants: Filament Bulbs and metal Cord Grip Lamp Holders hang from Twisted Fabric Lighting Cable , all sourced from Urban Cottage Industries. The kitchen wall is lined with inexpensive square white tiles\u2014about \u00a37 (roughly $9) a square meter\u2014in a brick bond with off-white grout. For more white wall tile pattern ideas, go to Remodeling 101: Subway Tile Pattern Glossary . Above: The open shelves are whitewashed floorboards supported by Strong Boy Cast Bronze Brackets ; \u00a339 ($51.47). Note the stainless steel, full-size fridge at the end of the counter. Above: All of Lewis\u2019s hardware is hand cast in England. Above: Antique brass colanders hang from a Cast Bronze Pan Rack ; \u00a395 ($125.38). Under it, a wall-mounted Cast-Bronze Draining Rack , \u00a3650 ($857.87) holds a vintage wire draining basket that Lewis is thinking of reproducing. Above: Lewis dressed up the family\u2019s English farmhouse table by painting the base and legs pale gray using Eic\u00f3 , a low-VOC line of paints. The benches came from John Cornall Antiques . Above: The tabletop is fuss-free and can also be used for food prep. Above: Double doors open to the backyard. The top half of the windows open and there are roller blinds for bright days. Above: Lewis left the ceiling framework exposed and whitewashed. Next to the back entrance, a vintage church chair and divided crate serve as a place to remove and store shoes. \nThe bronze-finished sconces are Maria Wall Lights ; \u00a3103.32 ($136.78) from Urban Cottage Industries. Above: The new, old-fashioned cast-iron radiators are the Radiator Company\u2019s Ledbury design with exposed copper piping: \u201cThe refurbished radiators I\u2019ve found are just a pain in the ass,\u201d says Lewis. Workspace Above: Lewis used an existing alcove in the back of the kitchen to create a built-in desk and shelves made from scaffolding planks. The area is used by the family for doing homework, charging laptops, and looking up recipes. \nIn lieu of baseboards, Lewis inserted a 35mm (1.3-inch) shadow gap for a contemporary twist: \u201cYou need a balance between old and new.\u201d \nAbove: The wall has tongue-and-groove paneling in Elephant\u2019s Breath from Farrow & Ball. Above L: The German Angled Bakelite Wall Sconces , \u00a357.60 ($76), are from Urban Cottage Industries. Above R: Computer cords are tidily threaded through a Cast Bronze Wire Cover , \u00a322 ($29.04), that Lewis also makes. Utility Room Above: A back corner contains a utility room and wallpapered WC. Above: Cast Bronze Jamie Coat Hooks , \u00a326 ($34.44), are mounted on an old floorboard outside the two rooms. Above: The utility room is used for \u201cpractical tasks, like washing children and garden paraphernalia,\u201d says Lewis. \nThe exposed brick wall is original and had been hidden behind plaster. A compact Belfast Sink by Twyford sits on a counter made from salvaged Swedish pine: \u201cIt\u2019s very thick, so it\u2019s great for a worktop.\u201d A washer-dryer and the boiler are tucked below, and the fuse box is hidden behind the wooden doors. \nAbove: Strong Boy Aged Cast-Iron Brackets , \u00a335 ($46.23), support the two tiers of open shelves. Above: Reclaimed Welsh Quarry Tiles \u2014\u201doriginally made for schools, hospitals, and factories\u201d\u2014line the floor of the utility room and WC. Powder Room Above: Lewis salvaged the stained glass rose from a window in the back of the house and paired it with Robert Kime\u2019s Tokai Wallpaper in rose. Above: The Ebonized Wooden Toilet Seat and Cover , \u00a3173.93 ($229.71), is from Aston Matthews: \u201cA bit expensive but worth it.\u201d Above: The utility room and WC were slotted into the back of the kitchen. The design also includes a pantry next to the desk alcove. \nHere are two more Mark Lewis projects: A Sympathetic Renovation in Stoke Newington Get Remodelista in Your Inbox Every Day!

(AP) \u2014 Attorneys for a politically connected Florida eye doctor convicted of a $100 million Medicare fraud are arguing that the government\u2019s actual loss was significantly less. \nAttorney Josh Sheptow told U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra on Thursday that Dr. Salomon Melgen was ahead of his time, injecting patients with then-experimental drugs that are now approved. \nMedicare does not pay for experimental treatments, so Sheptow suggested Melgen may have falsified billing statements to get around those restrictions. Sheptow said that would be fraud, but the treatments were legitimate, making the government\u2019s loss nil on many patients. \nThe amount of loss is important because it bears heavily on Marra\u2019s sentencing decision. Melgen could get a life sentence for a $100 million loss, but a minor loss could result in a short sentence. Melgen was found guilty of 67 counts, including health care fraud, submitting false claims and falsifying records in patients\u2019 files. \nMelgen is charged separately with bribing New Jersey Democratic Sen.
