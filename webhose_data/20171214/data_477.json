There was one other guy in the gym at the time and we both just stood there, sweating, side by side in shocked silence. This was happening right now in London. \nI grew up in a similar estate in north London where, like at Grenfell, there was a working-class community right bang in the middle of an affluent area. When you have that, you have disparity. In my experience, being part of a community living in poverty, you are bound together, and you support each other in good and bad times. I spent time at Grenfell while making a documentary about the victims and what struck me above all was everyone knew each other here, people cared for each other, and a lot of people who lost their lives did so when they were running back in to save their neighbours. \nSign this petition calling on the Prime Minister to take action to build public trust in the Grenfell enquiry \nPeople talked about the political element of the tragic Grenfell fire, but to focus on this is to neglect the community that has been affected. More than anything, this is a story about the characters who come up again and again when I speak to people at Grenfell. A young man called Yasin who made it out but then went back in to try to save his family. He couldn\u2019t and died too. Another young guy, Paul, who woke up in the middle of the Grenfell fire and spent five to ten minutes trying to wake up the people on his floor who had been knocked out by the fumes. He was trying to break down doors when a fireman shouted at him to leave. Reis, who told me about two friends of his who couldn\u2019t move their parents because the lift was out of action. In the end, they stayed with them \u2013 and paid with their lives. \nI think the world has seen a version of London that many people were not aware of before. When people think of that corner of west London, they don\u2019t think of places like Grenfell; but the tragedy opened the country\u2019s eyes to what London life is like for many people. It has allowed outsiders to see what it means to be a part of a community and to feel neglected by the system. Grenfell was an international place and, regardless of the origins of the people who lived there, regardless of religion, taste or race, there was a community that not only looked out for each other in day-to-day life, but also in tragedy. \nThe documentary Reggie Yates: Searching For Grenfell\u2019s Hidden Victims will be on BBC Two in early 2018 Reading now", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "grenfell", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reggie yates", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "yasin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rex features", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "grenfell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:45.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b7f9e5c2e5815a4216aedf42e7cbf242e43e48cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9Nt0BrbPt_Hn4FjByO6uHXwsahg.xznpWT.ndPJYsd4j1ysBdkvlXxJA-", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html?page=4&sort=newest&pagesize=15&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'html' Questions - Page 4 - Stack Overflow", "title": "- Nginx set Last-Modified header", "title_full": "html - Nginx set Last-Modified header - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b7f9e5c2e5815a4216aedf42e7cbf242e43e48cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9Nt0BrbPt_Hn4FjByO6uHXwsahg.xznpWT.ndPJYsd4j1ysBdkvlXxJA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nurzhan", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "- Nginx set Last-Modified header", "text": "Sorry if this question has been asked many times, but I could not find any proper information on this topic in the nginx docs and Internet.

I did blogmas last year and to be honest, it wasn't the walk in the park I was expecting. I thought I'd put together a few little tips I'm using this year to organise a more stress-free blogmas.\n\n\nLists. I love a good list, I don't even care how nerdy that sounds at this point. I have put together a little checklist planning the next month's posts, this way I can plan ahead so I'm not stuck with a 'come up with an idea in an hour, write a post and find a photo ready for tomorrow' like last year. \nThink ahead with Photography November / December = No light. I use natural lighting for all of my photos so I always have to make the most of the daylight. I can use the list above to see what photos I need and have a bulk photography 'sesh' during those 3 whole hours of light we get at this time of year. If you're after for photography tips I have a post here . Bulk writing posts. The one thing that held back my blogmas last year was having to speed write a post at 11pm and schedule it for 7am the morning after. This year I'm going to make the most of days off and bulk write a couple of posts in advance. Have fun with it A post a day is a lot to handle for those of us who only post once a week, and that's fine. If this puts too much stress on you then it's okay to slow down, you can still put Christmas posts out on your normal days, There's also 12 days of Christmas which is a nice way to ease into blogging if you're not quite ready to do 24 days but want a challenge!. \nHope these tips are helpful!.

Excellent location, handy for all your Lisbon sites. Bus to Belem (or to the city centre if you don't want to walk) was just a few minutes (no. 728) down from the Apartment (Rua Remedios) Feels like you're a local and the Alfama is quaint and lovely. Mirador (viewpoints) are also nearby, great for sunrise/sunset photo ops! Staff (Magda) was so helpful and gave all the information you need to make your stay comfortable. Facilities were brilliant, all you need are there-kitchen appliances, washing machine fridge, TV, airconditioning, heater. I liked that it was all as \"advertised\". Local grocery also nearby.

As much as gold has been searched for on Earth, there has been a long debate about its cosmic origin. But the detection this past summer of both gravitational waves and an electromagnetic flash from a neutron star merger (see 16 October 2017 Viewpoint) implies that heavy elements are forged around the most extreme objects in the Universe: neutron stars and black holes. A new theoretical study by Daniel Siegel and Brian Metzger from Columbia University, New York [1], simulates in detail the postmerger accretion of neutron star matter onto a black hole and confirms earlier, but less sophisticated, studies claiming that such systems are indeed promising production sites for gold and other heavy elements. The results may provide new insights into the recent neutron star merger observations, such as why the electromagnetic flash that accompanied the gravitational waves was so bright.\nThe heaviest elements are formed through the so-called \u0093r process,\u0094 in which a nucleus grows larger by rapidly capturing multiple neutrons. Neutrons are favored over protons, whose positive charge repels them from the positively charged nucleus. After capturing a neutron, the nucleus is not generally stable. Instead, it may transform a neutron into a proton in a beta decay, thereby emitting an electron and an antineutrino. The next neutrons need to be captured on a very short time scale, before the next beta decays set in. This is the defining feature of the r process, and its basic workings were already understood in the late 1950s More At: https://physics.aps.org/articles/v10/131", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://physics.aps.org/articles/v10/131"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:48.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81c73de8b859f1eb7e9fe40a69c15c93d0d17282", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9pZjbkz0yttu0HCHKIvYECDTrZKKvhJ4MHuS20rj9vlb2M324Ekg93FvPZlnrhew-", "site_full": "mybroadband.co.za", "site": "mybroadband.co.za", "site_section": "https://mybroadband.co.za/vb/forumdisplay.php/71-General-discussions", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "General discussions", "title": "Out of Neutron Star Rubble Comes Gold", "title_full": "Out of Neutron Star Rubble Comes Gold", "published": "2017-12-07T08:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "https://mybroadband.co.za/vb/images/misc/facebook_share.jpg?v=1.1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5974, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b5127b510accf5c2db8f980342692b9500af9b8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9pZjbkz0yttu0HCHKIvYECDTrZKKvhJ4MHuS20rj9vlb2M324Ekg9Rp1S0F9jUpWzj6w1l7Zqd.SYL1W3_Qvp", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Aquila ka Hecate", "published": "2017-12-07T08:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Originally Posted by Sugarman More At: https://physics.aps.org/articles/v10/131 *Goes around humming Woodstock all day*", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://physics.aps.org/articles/v10/131"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:48.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8883e890b085cbb684edb0965a23ab9e6b7d7de7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UcABE2WRG06UCKEDL4jaGhunHTcVxmcxPKvCpFFo4rKRaa7UXYQ_GXPt4jzwsKTDXMwB_Q47WbOSvGTrbLkLdlbAuLMcwK4vDs-", "site_full": "dubaieye1038.com", "site": "dubaieye1038.com", "site_section": "http://dubaieye1038.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Dubai Eye", "title": "US lawmakers quell Democrat\u2019s bid to impeach Trump", "title_full": "US lawmakers quell Democrat\u2019s bid to impeach Trump", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://dubaieye1038.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/9480E_636482353709531250_7DEC2017.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8883e890b085cbb684edb0965a23ab9e6b7d7de7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UcABE2WRG06UCKEDL4jaGhunHTcVxmcxPKvCpFFo4rKRaa7UXYQ_GXPt4jzwsKTDXMwB_Q47WbOSvGTrbLkLdlbAuLMcwK4vDs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "US lawmakers quell Democrat\u2019s bid to impeach Trump", "text": "LISTEN US lawmakers quell Democrat\u2019s bid to impeach Trump \nThe US House of Representatives voted to stop an effort by some Democrats to impeach US President Donald Trump. \nMany Democratic Party leaders questioned its timing and termed the move as \u201cpremature\u201d. \nThe lawmakers voted 364 to 58 to reject Texas Democratic lawmaker Al Green\u2019s resolution to start impeachment process against Trump. \nIn his resolution, Green alleged that Trump had been inciting violence, hatred and bigotry and is dividing Americans on the basis of race.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"   AP National News Video More>>", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "catherine luceyassociat", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:48.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9069de06d5b082513621de733fc32f68494477a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKxcltYSq3lRjmEedNjhRMK9xBkOFNxah5q.GOwQIlr17rwhkuKlWjGQJxkKc4vvoqMcdmIHLuRzU8Mlu2FHR5vsRxg85X3XsExyfAVJdziqU", "site_full": "community.ubnt.com", "site": "ubnt.com", "site_section": "https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi/ct-p/UniFi", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "UniFi - Ubiquiti Networks Community", "title": "Solved: Flashing UAP's firmwared computer?", "title_full": "Solved: Flashing UAP's firmwared computer? - Ubiquiti Networks Community", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6846, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9069de06d5b082513621de733fc32f68494477a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKxcltYSq3lRjmEedNjhRMK9xBkOFNxah5q.GOwQIlr17rwhkuKlWjGQJxkKc4vvoqMcdmIHLuRzU8Mlu2FHR5vsRxg85X3XsExyfAVJdziqU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "barrycisna", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Solved: Flashing UAP's firmwared computer?", "text": "Hello All,\nThis is going to sound crazy,I know.

He spoke on Thursday at the Foreign Ministry. \nNetanyahu says that \"we are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition.\" \nHe says the \"time has come\" and expressed confidence that others will follow suit and move their embassies to Jerusalem. \nMeanwhile, the Israeli military said it will be deploying additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when mass Palestinian protests are anticipated in response to Trump's move. \nThe army statement on Thursday says it will deploy several battalions to the territory while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" \nPalestinians went on strike across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip on Thursday and protests are expected on Friday after midday prayers. \n___ \n11:25 a.m. \nThe top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas is calling for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nIsmail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip on Thursday and called the U.S. decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries.\" \nHe says the uprising should begin Friday, the Muslim holy day. \nHaniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nHamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \n___ \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.

Mugabe gave him a wrong speech. We had a time when he came here and presented a very wrong speech. Now, we have a pool of advisors to the President and we have the Constitution here, which everyone in this country had access to during the COPAC time but now we have a situation whereby the advisors again would advise the President to go to an extent of appointing about ten non-constituency citizens of Zimbabwe as Ministers.

The Constitution is very clear. \nMy appeal as a Member of Parliament and citizen of this country is for our President of this country to have a thorough and polished team of advisors who are sincere with concerns of this country, who are sincere with responsibilities, who are not there to jeopardize or sabotage the President by giving him falsehoods.

Former Russian Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev waits for a hearing at a court in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017. Ulyukayev who is on trial for allegedly taking a $2 million bribe is expected to deliver... \nBy NATALIYA VASILYEVAAssociated Press \nMOSCOW (AP) - Wrapping up one of Russia's most high-profile trials of the year, a former economic development minister charged with bribery on Thursday accused an oil executive of setting him up and apologized for \"turning back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nAlexei Ulyukayev, the highest-ranking Russian official to be arrested since 1993, was detained last year at the headquarters of Russia's largest oil producer, the state-owned Rosneft, after a sting operation by Russia's main intelligence agency. Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared - what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" \nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised.

Below are 10 mistakes that you are probably making. \n\n\n1. Toothbrush is Indispensible to Oral Hygiene \n\nToothbrushing is such an ingrained habit, few people think twice about it. Step one in your daily routine- brushing your pearly whites \u2018properly\u2019 is what is stressed upon right from childhood. However, mistakes are evidently made in this otherwise deeply ingrained habit. Below are 10 mistakes that you are probably making. Image Courtesy: Getty Images. \n\n2. Using the Wrong Toothbrush \nNo, we don\u2019t mean that you are using someone else\u2019s toothbrush; but the one tha t doesn\u2019t suit your\nmouth. Consider the size of your mouth when picking a toothbrush, and the comfort of the handle before, recommends the American Dental Association. If you are straining to open wide enough to let the brush in, the brush is probably too big. Image Courtesy: Getty Images 3. Picking the Wrong Bristles \nSome toothbrushes have angled bristles, others straight; hard bristles and soft. So which is better? \nBristles that are too stiff are known to aggravate gums. Hence a soft bristled brush is the perfect choice. One must also bear in mind that the bristles should be sturdy enough to remove the plaque but not cause damage to the teeth. Image Courtesy: Getty Images.\n\n4 .Not Brushing Often \n\nWith too much time between brushings, he says, bacterial plaque will build up, boosting the risk of gum inflammation and other problems. Brushing thrice a day softly is ideal. But not more than that as since it could result into exposure of the root of the tooth leading to irritation. Image Courtesy: Getty Images.\n\n5.Not Brushing Long Enough \n\nBrushing should last at least two minutes, three minutes is even better. Divide the mouth into quadrants and spend 30 seconds a quadrant. Some electric toothbrushes include built-in timers for your convenience. Image Courtesy: Getty Images.\n\n6.Brushing Too Hard \n\n\nExcessive brushing could expose the root of the tooth to irritation, and that could in turn irritate the gums. Brushing vigorously can also erode tooth enamel. The trick is to brush very gently for two to three minutes. Image Courtesy: Getty Images\n\n7. Not Brushing Correctly \n\nDo you know the correct technique of brushing? Aim your bristles at the gum line at a 45-degree angle and do short strokes or vibrations. Softly brush up and down your teeth, not across your teeth. The strokes should be vertical or circular, not horizontal. Image Courtesy: Getty Images.\n\n8.Ignoring the Inside of Your Teeth \n\nMost people forget to brush the inner surfaces of teeth -- the surface that your tongue presses against. Skipping your back teeth, molars and pre-molars while brushing can cause cavities and also lead to bad breath. Image Courtesy: Getty Images\n\n\n\n9.Not Rinsing Properly \n\nAfter brushing, rinsing the toothbrush and your mouth with water is extremely crucial. Bacteria are known to grow on an un-rinsed toothbrush. Thoroughly washing the brush will help you getting rid of any leftover toothpaste and particles stuck in the bristles. Image Courtesy: Getty Images\n\n10.Ignoring the Tongue \n\nThe tongue should be given some much-needed attention too. A tongue cleaner or scraper should be used to kill the bacteria present in that area of the mouth and hence, freshen your breath. Image Courtesy: Getty Images. 11.Using the same Toothpaste for Long \nThe American Dental Association recommends getting a new brush every three or four months, or even sooner if the bristles look frayed.

Social Democratic Party, SPD, chairman Martin Schulz addresses the media during a news conference after a board meeting at the party's headquarter in Berlin, Germany, Monday, Dec. 4, 2017. \nBERLIN (AP) - Germany's center-left Social Democrats are discussing Thursday whether to open talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on extending their governing coalition, or at least backing a minority government. \nThe Social Democrats' leadership insisted the party would go into opposition after a disastrous election result in September. It reinforced its refusal to join a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. \nHowever, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear that he doesn't want a new election, and Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz reversed course. \nAt a previously scheduled party congress Thursday, Schulz is seeking members' approval for a resolution approving talks on \"whether and in what form\" the Social Democrats can support a new government. \nHowever, some members - including the party's youth wing - want to specifically rule out another coalition, leaving only a minority government or a new election as options. Merkel has said she is \"very skeptical\" about leading a minority government, which hasn't yet been tried in post-World War II Germany. \nSocial Democrat parliamentary group chief Andrea Nahles said the collapse of Merkel's talks with other parties produced an unexpected new situation. \n\"We can't play the ostrich and stick our heads in the sand,\" she said. \nThe Social Democrats have been part of Germany's government for 15 of the past 19 years - first leading a center-left government under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder from 1998 to 2005, then twice governing in a \"grand coalition\" under Merkel, from 2005 to 2009 and again from 2013 until now. \nThe party suffered historically poor election results after both Merkel coalitions, with support slumping to a post-war low of 20.5 percent in September.

Beware, because it could lead to dating violence in their adult years, according to a new report. \n>> Read more trending news \nResearchers from the University of Texas, University of Missouri and other institutions recently conducted an experiment, published in the Journal of Pediatrics , to determine whether childhood punishment can be linked to dating violence. \nTo do so, they interviewed 700 participants in southeast Texas, who were in their late teens and early 20s. Scientists asked subjects questions about the type of punishment they received as children and whether they had experienced violence in their romantic relationships as adults. \nOverall, about 19 percent said they had committed some form of dating violence and 69 percent said they were physically punished during childhood. \nAfter examining the data closer, they found people who got spanked as kids had a 29 percent higher risk for perpetrating dating violence. This was the case after researchers factored in age, gender, parent\u2019s education and any history of child physical abuse. \n\u201cWhile parents may think this form of physical punishment is a good lesson, substantial research indicates that it does way more harm than good,\u201d lead researcher Jeff Temple in a statement . \u201cWhile we can\u2019t say that spanking causes later violence, it follows that if a kid learns that physical punishment is a way to solve conflict, he or she may carry that over into conflicts with later intimate partners.\" \nThe researchers noted that other components can contribute to violence in dating, such as mental health, substance abuse and availability to weapons. However, they believe physical punishment among kids should also be considered. \n\u201cCommon sense and scientific research both tell us that children learn from their parents,\u201d Temple said. \u201cParents are a child\u2019s first look at relationships and how conflicts are handled. Corporal punishment is communicating to children that violence is an acceptable means of changing behavior.\u201d \u00a9 2017 Cox Media Group.
