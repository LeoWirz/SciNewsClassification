HALBFINGER THE NEW YORK TIMES   3:39 a.m.Updated: December 7, 2017 at 3:39 a.m. Credit: The New York Times/URIEL SINAI Projected images of the flags of Israel and the United States illuminate the walls of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City on Wednesday evening. \nJERUSALEM -- In Gaza City, Palestinians burned photos of President Donald Trump while in Jerusalem, Jews celebrated by lighting the walls of the Old City with the colors of the American and Israeli flags. \nThe starkly different actions came after Trump on Wednesday made good on his pledge to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. \nAs Palestinian officials talked of cutting ties with the United States or ending security cooperation with Israel, Israeli government ministers and opposition leaders alike welcomed the U.S. decision. Yet ordinary Israelis and supporters of a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict expressed fears that the move would ignite a new round of violence. \nYediot Ahronot , one of Israel's leading daily newspapers, ran a photograph of Trump touching the ancient stones of the Western Wall, the Jewish holy site in the hotly contested Old City, under the headline, \"Trump Alert.\" The article warned of a possible outbreak of violence as Israeli forces readied for protests in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. \n[ PRESIDENT TRUMP: Timeline, appointments, executive orders + guide to actions in first 200 days ] \nIn the Palestinian territories, Hamas, Fatah and other Palestinian factions, whose internecine battles have often been bloody and politically debilitating, came together to urge a public venting of rage against Trump. \nIn Gaza City, officials and residents wasted little time taking up the call to protest. By noon Wednesday, despite a downpour, hundreds of demonstrators burned American flags and posters bearing Trump's photograph, in a protest at the Unknown Soldier Square downtown. Hamas and Islamic Jihad called on Arab and Islamic leaders to cut ties with the United States and to withdraw from peace talks with Israel. \n\"The ball of fire will roll until an intifada will break out,\" warned Salah al-Bardawil, a senior Hamas leader in Gaza. \nIn the West Bank city of Ramallah, there were harsh words for Trump from Palestinians agitated at the idea that they were being forced into another period of conflict. \n\"We will never allow East Jerusalem to be taken away from us,\" said a retired farmer who gave his name as Abu Malik, 54. \"Trump is a crazy man who knows nothing about politics. I think he should go back to making WWF videos, rather than making these dangerous decisions that will only bring more headaches and bloodshed to our region.\" \nMaysa Hanoun, 20, a student at Al-Quds Open University, said she believed recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital would set off a third intifada. \n\"He really doesn't know what he's getting himself into,\" she said of Trump. \"The Palestinians will unite and raise hell.\" \nIt was left to Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu's rivals and allies in Israel to assess Trump's plans, and all welcomed it, regardless of their views on how to achieve peace. \n\"Policies should not be dictated by threats and intimidation,\" said Yair Lapid, the leader of Yesh Atid, a center-left opposition party. \"If violence is the only argument against moving the embassy to Jerusalem, then it only proves it is the right thing to do.\" \nAvi Gabbay, the Labor party leader, congratulated Trump while hoping for \"confidence-building measures which will reignite hope in the Middle East, and hope for a peace agreement between us and the Palestinians.\" \nBut Naftali Bennett, the education minister and leader of the rightist Jewish Home party, said American recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital \"shows that Israel's strategic patience has paid off.\" \n\"We have been told again and again that if we want more acceptance, we have to cut off parts of Israel and hand them over to our enemies,\" he said, alluding to the land-for-peace approach to negotiations dating from the 1970s. \"What we are learning is the contrary: The world respects strong countries who believe in themselves and looks down on countries willing to give up their homeland.\" \nIsraelis overwhelmingly say they favor international recognition of Jerusalem as their capital, but they did not seem in a particular hurry before this week. \n\"I do agree with recognition, but this should have been done with a wide and clear understanding between all the sides,\" said Alon Levi, 44, a manager for a chain of health food stores. \"I am sorry to say I feel that a bomb is being thrown in order to divert from the real issues. I feel like this is an act resulting from the political interests of the leaders and is not in the interest of the two nations here, and peace.\" Palestinians wave their national flag around burning tires Wednesday night in Gaza City.

Anyway, i got your back here on Lukas Blog. In this tutorial, I'll teach to you how you can resume failed download on UC Browser, be it video, games, music or any file it may be. Works 100% and tested by me before posting.\n\nHOW TO RESUME FAILED DOWNLOAD ON UC BROWSER \n\n1. Once a download failed to resume on Uc browser, just pause it and then minimize Uc browser\n\n2. Now, go to UC browser download folder in memory card. The download folder is named \u201cUCDownloads \u201d\n\n3. In the download folder, there are two files: the main downloading file and a temporary download file with the extension .dltemp \n\n4. Now, move both files to a different folder \n\n5. Go back and open your UC Browser and resume the download.\n\n6. It will start downloading from zero, then pause the download after 60seconds and minimize your UC browser again.\n\n7. Now, open UCdownloads folder in memory card and delete the two new files downloaded.\n\n8. Next is to simply move the files you moved to a different folder in Step 4 back to the UCDownloads folder.\n\n9. After done that, go back to UC browser and resume the download, you will see that it will start from where it stopped/failed, in other words, it will resume the previous download without any inconveniences.\n\nPAY ATTENTION -  Telegram is Now Working Free With Airtel and 9Mobile Networks \nThis is just a simple trick i use to resume failed downloads on UC Browser.

It's called the US Hipster Index . \nMoveHub used factors like rent availability and the number of tattoo parlors, vegan stores, microbreweries, and thrift shops to evaluate cities for the index. \nHuntsville ranks 16th, making the site's top 20. \nBusiness Insider wrote about this, calling Huntsville one of the \" hippest cities everyone under 30 wants to move to .\" \nThe article stated, \"Huntsville is a bustling city in northern Alabama. With farmers' markets, coffee shops, and local breweries, there's plenty to do. Plus, the city has 9.3 thrift shops per 100,000 people, making it a great place for fashionistas and creatives.\" \nChad Emerson, President and CEO of Downtown Huntsville, Inc. said Huntsville should be proud to be on this list. \n\"We really focus a lot of our attention on quality of life,\" he said, \"bringing quirky, interesting, and innovative things to Huntsville, and to the city center.\" \nEmerson added that this ranking shows the hard work his group and its partners have put into the city and its downtown area is paying off. \n\"We have focused on bringing those quirky, innovative, ecclectic businesses and events to downtown, but if you do it you have to be authentic,\" he explained. \"If you try to focus or do it quickly, people will see through that. So we think it has taken longer, it's been 3-4 years now. But that authenticity of quirkiness is really coming through.\" \nEliah McCutchen, Media Coordinator at Lowe Mill Arts & Entertainment , isn't surprised Huntsville made the cut on this ranking. \n\"In the past few years, it has grown tremendously. I left for college 4 years ago in Birmingham, and coming back here I was like, 'Oh my gosh, there's all kinds of new stuff to do!'\" he said. \"It was on the list with a lot of bigger cities that you wouldn't necessarily think Huntsville would be in the same pool as, but it was very cool seeing someplace that I love so much and have lived for so long being represented like that.\" \nMcCutchen said that through his work at Lowe Mill, he knows the things Huntsville has to offer people with creative spirits. \n\"If you're an actor, an artist, a musician, there is something for you to do here,\" he said of Huntsville. \"At Lowe Mill, we are the largest privately-owned arts facility in the nation. We have 150 working studios with more than 200 artists in those studios.\" \nBut others said they don't think Huntsville is as cool yet as this list makes it seem. \n\"There needs to be more things to do. More fun stuff for youth,\" said Michael Amerson, a Huntsville resident. \"You can kind of see they're trying. They built the Top Golf and all that-- so they're trying.\" \nAmerson said he doesn't think Huntsville is quite there yet, and he sees it more as a place to settle down than a place to move while young. \nTareik Smith agreed. \n\"It has a long way to go,\" Smith stated. But he added hopefully, \"It will get there.\" \nEmerson said this list is valuable to Huntsville, and can create more interest in this area. \n\"I think what it is-- it raises your reputational value,\" he said. \"Huntsville as a whole and a downtown, is becoming a more interesting destination. You're seeing more lofts, more businesses, and activities that appeal to everyone but especially appeal to young professionals.\" He added, \"This is a piece of the puzzle to compete with other cities for a great workforce.\" \nTo see the other cities included in the ranking, click here . 34.730369 -86.586104 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "huntsville", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lowe mill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "top golf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccutchen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tareik smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chad emerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael amerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eliah mccutchen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "business insider", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lowe mill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "movehub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lowe mill arts & entertainment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "downtown huntsville, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ala.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntsville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rocket city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntsville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:24.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "876ec494467aa94f5ab99bb1d38e3499c192596f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGS86iM.zVHDjfezpInRiLIR9jO4ly2TBm8", "site_full": "www.pistonheads.com", "site": "pistonheads.com", "site_section": "http://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/forum.asp?h=0&f=74", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_cars", "vehicles", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Biker Banter -

Burnley have changed their style this season. \n\u201cThey\u2019re still a bit direct, but they can play as well. \n\u201cIt was great for the lads though, because it\u2019s always good to get an early goal.\u201d Like us on Facebook", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "danny simpson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "claude puel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig shakespeare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simpson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "newcastle united", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nufc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "newcastle united sport leicester", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tottenham hotspur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lcfc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newcastle united fc    danny simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premier league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burnley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spurs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "leicester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leicester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west ham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyneside", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:24.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "876ec494467aa94f5ab99bb1d38e3499c192596f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGS86iM.zVHDjfezpInRiLIR9jO4ly2TBm8", "site_full": "www.pistonheads.com", "site": "pistonheads.com", "site_section": "http://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/forum.asp?h=0&f=74", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_cars", "vehicles", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Biker Banter -

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mobile phone scam is conning parents, friends and kind hearted strangers out of their cash. \nVictims receive an urgent message supposedly from a loved one who say they are in hospital after breaking several bones in their body. \nIt preys on people by sending a text from \u2018Sarah\u2019, hoping that the person receiving the message will know a Sarah - but it is not the Sarah you know, it\u2019s a money-making scam. \nThe message reads: \u201cHi its Sarah. It its possible can you do me a favour? had a stupid fall &amp; broke my fibula &amp; left wrist. Can you text me back when you get this text. Signal bad x\u201d Read More The bogus bailiffs scam you need to know about - and how to avoid being caught out \nIf you try to ring the number it simply rings out, but they do reply to messages, eventually leading to them ask you for money. \nIn one recent incident, on December 6, the victim asked for them to answer the phone, but they replied: \u201cSignal bad in hospital x\u201d \nBut after searching for the number 07517360190 it was found on Who-Called.co.uk where hundreds of people had commented to say they had either fallen for or received this message.

Have stopped replying but still getting texts.\u201d \nAnother added: \u201cI was stupid enough to believe it and they asked for phone credit. I tried to call the number but they said it was bad signal in the hospital. When I sent the credit they asked for more. Then I checked with the person who I thought it was and it obviously wasn\u2019t them (I no longer had their number so I had to get it from someone else).\u201d Read More \nAnother added: \u201cMy niece is Sarah but the text was not from her phone. I texted her on her proper number and she said it wasn\u2019t her.

It\u2019s the most wonderful time of the year for sure!!! \nToday I\u2019m on Daily ART , with a mew dt project called \u201c12 Days of Christmas\u201d \nI created it on the back of an IKEA frame that broke the other day :))) \nI\u2019ve kept the rest of the pieces for another project, you will see shortly. \n\n\nFor this one I started by arranging some Hardboard Tags by Daily ART on the frame's back cover and used a left-over piece from hardboard, for the center. Later, I changed the heart for a ring, cut from kitchen paper roll. That was the base for the big snowflake to sit on. \n\nI got the idea of making a plaid pattern by using the Gelli Plate. It came out really beautiful and that distressed look was exactly what I wanted. For the pattern, I used Metallic Paint Rich Gold, Acrylic Paint Scarlet and Vintage Paint Silver Grey. I cut pieces of my design and glued it on the tags with Gel Medium Gloss . \n\n\nI preped my surface with White Gesso Paste , and dried with a heat gun. I appled Snow Paste through   A5 stencil   Diamond pattern. To paint the backgorund, I used Glimmer Ink Sprays in Gold and Silver and Glossy Ink Spray in Scarlet. \nI glued Hardboard Tags with Gel Medium Gloss . Distressed the edges of the little tags with Vintage Paint Milk and used some Stencil Paste Citrine to highlight some spots. \n\nDecorated the tags with Hardboard Snowflakes . I stamped the numbers with black Archival ink and heat embossed them with gold embossing powder. I printed the quotes on photocopy paper 200gr and colored them with a marker. \n\n\nI really hope you like it!

Attorney Kirby Moss Examines Social Security Disability Essentials \nFort Wayne attorney Kirby Moss lists the top three tips about applying for Social Security disability in Indiana. \nFORT WAYNE, Ind. (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nApproximately 90% of those who apply for disability in Indiana are denied on their first application. Upon receiving a denial, one must within 60 days apply for a Reconsideration, which is often also denied. Upon receiving the denial of the Request for Reconsideration one must then file a Request for a hearing. \n\u201cThis is where most claims that get approved are approved. The key points to remember are the 60-day deadlines of each step,\u201d said attorney Kirby Moss . \u201cOnce the hearing is requested in Indiana it takes anywhere from 12-14 months to get a date for the hearing. The Social Security Administration must let you know the hearing date at least 75 days in advance. Your evidence, i.e. medical records and any medical opinions, needs to be submitted to the Social Security Administration no later than five business days before the hearing.\u201d \nTo further educate Indiana citizens about applying for Social Security disability , Moss lists the following three tips: \nNo. 1: Determine eligibility. One can apply for one of two types of disability, both of which are administered by the Social Security Administration : Disability Insurance Benefits (DIB) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). \n\u201cThe difference between the two is that the DIB is insurance and you have to have paid into the system long enough to qualify,\u201d said Moss. \u201cSSI is a safety net for those who have not paid into the system sufficiently. The standards to qualify are the same for each; i.e., a Medically Determinable Impairment that is severe enough to prevent one from engaging in Substantial Gainful Activity (work defined by income requirements).\u201d \nNo. 2: Get a doctor\u2019s note. One will need their doctor to submit a written confirmation of their impairment. \u201cIt is important to have a long-established relationship with your doctor as that can aid in your obtaining the information necessary to be successful in your claim,\u201d stressed Moss. \u201cHaving your doctor confirm your condition will provide necessary medical evidence of your condition as well as showing that you have taken steps to responsibly obtain treatment.\u201d \nNo. 3: Retain an experienced attorney. Getting an attorney early on is the best way to enhance one\u2019s chances of getting approved. \u201cAn attorney can help you gather the evidence necessary to support your claim and make sure it gets to the right place in a timely fashion,\u201d concluded Moss. \u201cThere are certain rules that need to be complied with to get your evidence on the record and ensure that it is considered. A benefit of having an attorney is that most attorneys that handle Social Security disability have access to view the electronic file in real time.\u201d \nAbout Kirby Moss, Kirby Moss Law Attorney Kirby Moss focuses on bankruptcy , estate planning, elder law, Social Security disability, personal injury litigation and other civil litigation.

The Russian figure skater Evgenia Medvedeva, shown at a competition in Japan in November, declined to say if she would participate under those conditions. Credit Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters On Dec. 5, The Times reported that Russia's Olympic team had been barred from the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. The country\u2019s government officials are forbidden to attend, its flag will not be displayed at the opening ceremony and its anthem will not sound. Any athletes from Russia who receive special permission to compete will do so as individuals wearing a neutral uniform, and the official record books will forever show that Russia won zero medals. The ruling was the final confirmation that the nation was guilty of executing an extensive state-backed doping program, and the penalties are without precedent in Olympics history. Are you surprised at the news of Olympic athletes using banned athletic performance-enhancing drugs? Can you think of any previous Olympic doping scandals? What more would you like to know? In \u201c Did Russia Get Off Easy in Olympic Ban? Read the Fine Print ,\u201d Jer\u00e9 Longman writes: \nDespite hyperbolic language that Russia had been barred from the 2018 Winter Olympics, in truth it may have gotten off fairly lightly for undermining the previous Winter Games, which it hosted, with systematic doping. \nRussian athletes will still be allowed to compete in February in South Korea if they can show they have passed rigorous drug screening protocols. And they will wear uniforms that identify them as an \u201cOlympic Athlete From Russia\u201d instead of as an independent athlete. \nYes, the Russian Olympic Committee has been suspended. And its athletes would not march under the Russian flag at the opening ceremony or hear the Russian anthem played if they win gold medals (they will hear the Olympic anthem). \nBut the punishment would have been much harsher with a prohibition of all Russian athletes. \nThe International Olympic Committee\u2019s decision will be seen as more than fair in the international sports world. The committee penalized Russia for its widespread doping program but kept the door open \u2014 perhaps widely \u2014 for athletes who could show they have been tested regularly and have not been caught using banned substances. He continues: \nThe I.O.C. said a specialized panel will screen Russian athletes seeking to compete in South Korea. The criteria include not having any previous doping violations, agreeing to undergo pre-Games testing and complying with any other testing the panel imposes. \nYet even with this panel, the I.O.C. will face an uncomfortable truth: It is almost impossible to know whether an athlete is truly \u201cclean\u201d of using banned substances. \nGiven the sophistication of drug use, with micro-dosing techniques that go undetected, those athletes who are doping often remain one step ahead of experts policing them. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: \u2014 Do you think the Russian Olympic team \u201cgot off easy\u201d in the I.O.C. ruling? Why or why not? \u2014 Will barring Russia from the Winter Games in 2018 stop future doping practices, either by individual athletes or by nations in state-sponsored doping? If so, how, and if not, why not? \u2014 If you were on the I.O.C., would you have completely barred all Russian athletes in the 2018 Winter Games? Why or why not? \u2014 What do you think it will take to stop doping in the Olympics? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

In the end, a judge sentenced Slager to 20 years in prison, giving the Scott family the justice they had sought ever since a stranger came to them with the shocking video of Scott being killed. \n\"I forgive Michael Slager. I forgive you,\" Scott's mother, Judy, said as she turned toward her son's killer. \"I pray for you, that you would repent and let Jesus come in your life.\" \nSitting just a few feet away, Slager wiped tears from his eyes and mouthed: \"I'm sorry.\" \nThe punishment wrapped up a case that became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Slager, 36, is one of only a few police officers to go to prison for a fatal shooting, and his sentence is by far the stiffest since the shootings came under extra scrutiny in recent years. \nAttorneys for the former North Charleston officer said he shot the 50-year-old Scott in self-defense after the two fought and Scott grabbed Slager's stun gun. They said race didn't play a role in the shooting and Slager never had any \"racial animus\" toward minorities. \nStill, Slager pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott's civil rights. As part of a plea agreement reached in May, prosecutors dropped state murder charges. \n\"This is a tragedy that shouldn't have happened,\" U.S. District Judge David Norton said. \nSlager apologized to the Scott family, calling Scott's mother and brothers by their names. \n\"With my actions that day, Walter Scott is no longer with his family, and I am responsible for that,\" Slager said. Of their forgiveness, he added: \"I am very grateful for that.\" \nSlager's emotions stood in stark contrast to his stoic demeanor during his state murder trial when jurors deadlocked over a verdict. He has several weeks to appeal his sentence and will be housed at the Charleston County jail until he's assigned to a federal prison. \nAfter the sentencing, Judy Scott and Walter's two brothers told reporters that, while they had made peace with the case, they remained adamant the officer should pay for his crime. \n\"Who are we not to forgive?\" Rodney Scott said. \nA bystander recorded the shooting on a cellphone, and it was shared around the world, setting off protests across the U.S. as demonstrators said it was another egregious example of police officers mistreating African-Americans. \nSlager fired at Scott's back from 17 feet (5 meters) away. Five of eight bullets hit him. \nThe video was seized on by many as vivid proof of what they had been arguing for years: that white officers too often use deadly force unnecessarily against black people. \nWhen the jury failed to reach a verdict in the state murder case, many black people and others were shocked and distressed, because the video seemed to some to be an open-and-shut case. Some despaired of ever seeing justice. \nThe shooting angered local African-Americans who complained for years that North Charleston police harassed blacks, pulling them over or questioning them unnecessarily as they cracked down on crime. But after the shooting, the Scott family successfully pleaded for calm, asking everyone to let the justice system run its course. \nTwo months after the shooting, a young white man killed nine black church members in a racially motivated massacre during a Bible study in Charleston. The family members of those victims struck a similar forgiveness tone after that attack. \nBefore Slager's sentence was handed down, the judge had to decide whether the shooting amounted to second-degree murder or manslaughter. Norton found that it was murder. \n\"No matter what sentence I give, neither the Scott family nor the Slager family is going to think that it's right,\" the judge said. \nAfter the shooting, Slager picked up his stun gun and placed it next to Scott. Slager contended he was securing the weapon. Prosecutors think he put it there to bolster his self-defense story. \nThe judge also found that Slager obstructed justice when he made statements to state police after the shooting. \nA pre-sentencing report for Slager found that he committed manslaughter and recommended 10 to nearly 13 years in prison. But the judge was not bound by that review. \nIf Slager had faced another state trial and been convicted of murder, he could have been sentenced to anywhere from 30 years to life in prison. \nConvictions in police officer shootings are uncommon in the U.S. and prison time is even rarer. \nSouth Carolina has been aggressive in charging white officers who shoot unarmed black people. Four have pleaded guilty in state or federal court in the past six years. But only Slager and former state trooper Sean Groubert, who shot a man as he tried to get his wallet during a seat belt violation check, will have been sent to prison. Groubert was sentenced to five years behind bars.
