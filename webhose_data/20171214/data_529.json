The farmer, from Reigate in Surrey, rang police after reports of men trespassing on farmland on Slipshatch Road at 2.45pm, November 5. It was thought the men were hunting deer.But when police arrived on the farm and surrounding land they were unable to trace them.In a bizarre turn of events, the farmer then noticed all of his partridges were missing from their pens. It is now thought that the same men who trespassed on private land hunting for deer stole them.Surrey Police last made a public appeal on November 29 in a frequent newsletter the force publish for fresh leads.In the newsletter, Police Sergeant Ross Spanton wrote that he hoped the fresh appeal would \"give the suspects nagging doubt and remind would-be criminals [Surrey Police] know who they are.\"No arrests have yet been made in connection with the suspected theft or trespass incident.It follows news of farmers being reminded to take part in the government\u2019s Commercial Victimisation Survey and record the nature, extent and costs of any crime they have faced.

who has captured the beauty of the city's architecture in his impressionist oil paintings has assembled the work into a fundraising calendar for the Brant Community Healthcare System. \nDaniel Cairo's 2018 calendar called Brantford The Telephone City includes many of the city's iconic buildings - the former Carnegie Library, the Wadsworth Street train station, the Joseph Brant Memorial in Victoria Park Square, the federal building with its grand clock tower, Grand River bridges, the Sanderson Centre, and the Bell Homestead. \nCairo, who came to the city 10 years ago from his native Uruguay with a fresh pair of eyes for the city sites, covered all the costs for printing of the high-quality calendar. \nThey are selling for $20, with all the proceeds going to the BCHS Foundation. \n\"I wanted to show my gratitude,\" said Cairo, whose family members have received care at Brantford General Hospital. \"Every time we've been there we've had the best care.\" \nCairo spent four years researching and photographing the buildings that became the subjects of his original paintings. \n\"The monuments, the memorials impacted me,\" he said. \"I love history and I started to mix that love with my art.\" \nUsing the impasto technique in which paint is laid thickly on the surface, Cairo gives his artwork a three-dimensional effect, with the paint appearing to emerge from the canvas. \nThe calendars are available at the BCHS Foundation office and the hospital gift shop, both located near the A-Wing entrance, and at the city's visitor and tourism centre on Wayne Gretzky Parkway. \nCairo said he created the paintings, and the calendar, to showcase his love of Brantford. \n\"I did this with all of my heart.\" \nmruby@postmedia.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

How it happened is my grandmother on my mom's side got divorced and remarried, giving me a step grandfather. My mother got married, had a kid, and got divorced, all before she was 22. About 14 years later she married my dad. She's been raising my sister with him for the previous 5-6 years. Her ex husband moved abroad shortly after the divorce, but his parents didn't. My older sister grew up seeing her grandparents more than her father, but that's another story. So her grandparents, no relation to my dad at all, they welcome him in with open arms, even though he's literally the guy that married their sons ex wife. He joked about 'going to see the outlaws for Christmas' because they weren't his in laws, they were just his wife's kids dads parents. Anyway, so I come along 15 years later, my sister's grandfather has passed at this point, but we still, as a family, go visit her grandmother regularly. She was always introduced to me as 'your Granny Shirley', so I was like 'cool, this is my granny', her dead husband was my granddad, just like my dad's parents, my mom's parents, and my mom's step dad.\nWhat makes this story all the more ridiculous is that my sister's dad and his parents are all Indian, while my mom and dad are both pasty white Irish people. I just never questioned why I had 3 more grandparents than anyone else, let alone why 2 of them were an entirely different race to me.\nTL;DR I wound up with 3 bonus grandparents thanks to 2 divorces and a half sister, and 2 of them were an entirely different race to me but I never actually questioned that.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:29.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f5902342877644547441cc981b021ede28c233e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W2DX.jkN0lth2m4x5VeKqiZutgpLXvSiZ5x8WA_OjY95.FYNFkHkiBVEtBgxXNelxOStt8tcRBblpBRPb1czd796CI0U19Y1gA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What do people think you\u2019re joking about but you\u2019re 100% serious?", "title_full": "What do people think you\u2019re joking about but you\u2019re 100% serious?

They were good and decent people that served Him faithfully. They had a great heartache in their life, though. They wanted a child but they were old now and the blessing they waited on all their life has passed them by. Maybe this morning you are greatly troubled, something is missing in your life. Your dreams have been shattered. Your hopes are left unfulfilled. \nLuke 1:8-10 8 Once when Zechariah\u2019s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, 9 he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 10 And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside. \nWhat do faithful people of God do when they face heartache? They keep right on serving God. \nLuke 1:11-14 11 Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 12 When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. 13 But the angel said to him: \u201cDo not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. 14 He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, \nImagine going to church one Sunday hoping God would show up.... and HE DOES! When God breaks 400 years of silence to send an angel to tell one man that he and his wife are about to have a son, well, you must know that he is going to be a very special child! \nThe angel goes on to tell him that, not only he and Elizabeth would have great joy, but that many will rejoice at his birth! \n* What is so special about this child? \nThe angel goes on to tell him about 4 qualities that John will have. \nLuke 1:15-17 15 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. 16 He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. 17 And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous\u2014to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\u201d \nWhat did the angel say about John? \n1. HE WILL BE GREAT! \nLk 1:15a 15 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; \nWhen John was born, there were many greats in the world. Here's a couple of guys the world thought of as great. \nCaesar Augustus- 41 years as Emperor of Rome. He expanded the Roman empire and influence and made Rome the greatest empire in the world. He said of himself, \u201cI found Rome a city of bricks and left it as a city of marble.\u201d Study Tools", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zechariah", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "aaron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abijah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caesar augustus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elijah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "judea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:29.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f5902342877644547441cc981b021ede28c233e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W2DX.jkN0lth2m4x5VeKqiZutgpLXvSiZ5x8WA_OjY95.FYNFkHkiBVEtBgxXNelxOStt8tcRBblpBRPb1czd796CI0U19Y1gA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What do people think you\u2019re joking about but you\u2019re 100% serious?", "title_full": "What do people think you\u2019re joking about but you\u2019re 100% serious? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 195, "participants_count": 163, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d7d15ddbc4552d5a6648386fb234ea39bc32df1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W2DX.jkN0lth2m4x5VeKqiZutgpLXvSiZ5x8WA_OjY95.FYNFkHkiBVEtBgxXNelxOStt8tcRBblpBRPb1czd7_5ZTszjgDA9CuwMVT4_BZ3INSELOy2dT4-", "ord_in_thread": 175, "author": "deckard1980", "published": "2017-12-07T17:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "That I hate my sticky out ears.

But that, given the genocide meted on Southern Cameroonians, he wants the UN to supervise the two nations to go their separate ways. Excerpts: \nWhat was your mission to the United Nations? \nWhen I addressed the Political Administrative Heads, I said I had sent a file of preliminary letters to shorten the length of an interview on situation of the Southern Cameroons. The Head of the Central African Department said he hadn\u2019t received any letters. \nI had a duplicate of the letters that I had kept and I told him that I can lend him the pile which contains all I have been writing about for him to photocopy, so that he can present it to his hierarchy. He accepted. So, I went on holiday and before I came back, they had returned my file to me. I told him that I wanted to see the next level of his hierarchy so that I can find out what next step they are going to take. \nHe said he photocopied my full dossier and a copy of the interview I had and that he had already sent it to all departments of the UN. So, it seems to me that there is secretariat gatekeeper whom the mails go through and he decides what to pass on and what not to pass on. Remember that President Trump of the US, during the last UN meeting, said that the UN is not doing their work well; that they are just come to have a good time. \nSo, it was this time around that the UN realised that we had been sending petitions all along which they have never seen. President Trump even recited that there are some countries,whereby, the right of Independence and Self Determination are being suppressed, where people are being arrested and put in prison, where they shutdown internet.He said he was not going to tolerate that. \nTalking about the internet, there we pictures of you with an award, what is it about? \nWell, the people of the Southern Cameroons or Ambazonia invited me to a party. I arrived there and saw thousands of people from all over the Americas and other countries. \nThey said the event was actually a birthday party for me. I said I organised my 90th birthday last year, but they said I organised that one and that they have organised their own for me. During the party, they surprised me with an award, which they said was for my efforts in the Southern Cameroons/Ambazonia Struggle. \nSouthern Cameroonians are said to be divided between Unionists, Federalists and Separatists. To which group do you belong? \nSouthern Cameroons had been sufficiently educated to be granted their Independence on October 1, 1961. The highest organ of the United Nations so decided. The United Nations also decided that, before Britain left, they should graduate this colonial territory into an Independent State. And the terms of joining had been outlined before the United Nations by Ahmadou Ahidjo when he said that if Southern Cameroons was to join him, they would sit as equal partners and draw up the terms of joining. \nThere are no terms of joining, because,power was never handed to Southern Cameroons in consequence of which there was no agreement with Southern Cameroons. But haven taken power from Britain through the back door, instead of coming straight up, Ahidjo considered that that Southern Cameroons had been \u2018dashed\u2019 to La Republique du Cameroun, which is a serious misconception, because, it was to be a Federation of two States. You will find it in Chief Mukete\u2019s book \u201cMy Odyssey\u201d. \nHe has reproduced what Ahidjo stated. So, the understanding was that, we were to create a Federation of two States, equal in status. We have not, that means that he just took us as a colonial territory to add to La Republique du Cameroun and so exercised authority over Southern Cameroons in the mistaken belief that, it is his property. \nThe only territory called La Republique du Cameroun is the territory which gained Independence on January 1, 1960 and became a member of the UN on September 20, 1960. The Constitution of La Republique du Cameroun, which was passed by their Territorial Assembly in February 1960 was the one after the abortive Foumban. \nThat is why it was headmen who were posted in Sothern Cameroons until the British Mandate ended, because, the Government of Foncha, although he had a Ministerial Government, had no power over defence. In like manner, it had no power over foreign relations. So, the meeting in Foumban in July 1961 was a farce, because, Foncha had no power to negotiate internationally without the presence of the Commissioner of Cameroon. So nothing occurred in Foumban. \nWhat can be done to solve this Southern Cameroons crisis? \nThat is why I went to the UN to confront them on whether they have any evidence of Southern Cameroons joining French Cameroon and whether Britain accomplished their duty of handing over power before they left. They did not do so. So I said La Republique du Cameroun, at the time of entry into the UN, entered with its territorial boundary. \nThat is what is recorded in the UN. By just entering with their territorial boundaries as a member State of the African Union which says in order to avoid troubles in Africa, keep the boundaries of your territory, on the date of your Independence. We were never part of that agreement. \nSo, it was the Constitution of La Republique du Cameroun which they amended on September 1,1961,when we were still a British colony and they changed their name from La Republique du Cameroun to La Republique Federale du Cameroun. \nAs I said before, you can\u2019t marry yourself, however handsome you may be. You need a woman in order to celebrate a union. In like manner, you need two parties to create a Federation. Now, Ahidjo just changed his name, promulgated it into law on September 1, 1961, and we were not there. Ahidjo ruled on the basis of his constitution, not on the terms as organised by the International Community. \nIn spite of the concessions made by Government, you still went to the UN in pursuit of the statehood of Southern Cameroons. What will actually satisfy you, then? \nI had hoped originally that the United Nations would invite La Republique du Cameroun which is a member and say the proceedings we had were that you and Southern Cameroons were to join and create a Federation of two States, equal in status. My advice to the United Nations was that, since there in no Union Treaty and La Republique rather annexed Southern Cameroons,call them, sit them together and let them try and see if the intentions of the founding fathers creating a Federation of two States, equal in status, can be realised. If they cannot be realised, then, the two parties should go their separate ways. Well, I am not a member of the General Assembly. \nI addressed this to the Political Affairs Department of the UN. They asked that what is the way forward and I said; \u201cYou have power to summon La Republique du Cameroun to bring Southern Cameroons and say; you people intended to join in a Federation of two States, equal in status. That was the Resolution of the General Assembly of the UN. But we don\u2019t see the two States anymore.So, to correct this issue, you have got to sit together and see if you can construct a Constitutional arrangement embodying the understandings you had from the word \u2018go\u2019. \nSo, I will lock you up in a room \u2026 if you get into agreement, you just sign it and you would then have complied with Article 102 of the UN Chatter. If you don\u2019t agree, then, you go your separate ways. That is the separatist option. Is that where you belong? \nFirst of all, there was no Federation which was created. We are still working under the Constitution of La Republique du Cameroun. To create a Federation, at all, you needed two parties of equal status. That was never done, so there\u2019s no Federation. Ahidjo just took advantage of the departure of British Army and launched his own troops over here. He has been in occupation and annexation ever since. \nAnd the solution to it is that the two parties should be brought together as equal delegations. If we get into such a conference, it would be the conference to repair all the damage that has been done. But if such a conference cannot be called by the United Nations, there is nothing that I can ever tell you we will ever join. \nThus, you are for the dialogue that has been proposed by civil society organisations and even the UN? That was my position when I was addressing the United Nations. Since then, things have developed in a manner all forecasted by the African Union Commission, that if this thing is not properly settled, it would result in Genocide. \nHow can I advise people to stay together when what has happened has happened? This is your brother, I kill him in your presence because he entered the gate and then, you call me later that, I should discuss with you after you had killed my brother. My mind would be so poisoned that I too would only be scheming to kill you. So, my position now, in the face of the massacre on Southern Cameroons \u2026 I say; NO! We have crossed the red light and we must go forward and look for our own State. \n\nSo, how are you going to do that, by declaring independence? \nSouthern Cameroonians have already declared it. It would now be left for the world. There were 64 countries which voted for the Independence of Southern Cameroons, but the resolution was passed unanimously. \nTheir actions have compelled this matter to another level, and now that La Republique has not opted for dialogue and has opted for genocide;now they don\u2019t throw any stones at people, but to take life bullets and shoot at people mercilessly as I saw the evidence on the internet. This is an unthinkable way of treating another human being. \nThe only crime would be, fighting for the fundamental human rights of going to whatever church you belong, speaking your mind without necessarily going to destroy public properties of which there would be laws to try them, if they broke these laws. But to kill them, shows that you regard them as something below the dignity of a dog. \nI see all these astwo people having problems and the one party sees killing the other as the best way. This means you\u2019re not equal, whereas, it a fundamental human right for you to express your opinion as to what type of Government you want to lead you. \n\nInterviewed by Bouddih Adams &Tah Nduko for Crusel News ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mola njoh litumbe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmadou ahidjo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahidjo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foncha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bouddih adams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tah nduko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "la republique", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central african department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "african union commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "territorial assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "independence of southern cameroons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern cameroons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la republique du cameroun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la republique federale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameroons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international community", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "political affairs department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "americas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameroon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la republique du cameroun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "african union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameroun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:31.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8a1a6c245f7258f978070c6a4cd340b12c49a8e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UfoBG7jxN1wgJoUZo3b.9TfDiUCy3j0Gn.bpTvIeb0pYpDe6d3mBtDHSbJqSx8pHBtglpKR.KLZ.wRe6QbEakLj8fkrYyBKTrP10bb_rH3euA--", "site_full": "deeplearning-news-archive.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://deeplearning-news-archive.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "DeepLearning News Archive", "title": "Deep Learning Engineer", "title_full": "Deep Learning Engineer", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c8a1a6c245f7258f978070c6a4cd340b12c49a8e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UfoBG7jxN1wgJoUZo3b.9TfDiUCy3j0Gn.bpTvIeb0pYpDe6d3mBtDHSbJqSx8pHBtglpKR.KLZ.wRe6QbEakLj8fkrYyBKTrP10bb_rH3euA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "hayate kiridera (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Deep Learning Engineer", "text": "Deep Learning Engineer.

President Donald Trump's move to recognize the divided city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital may have triggered a worldwide chorus of critics but the president had his ears closely tuned to his supporters at home. \nFor Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \n\"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\" the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \"Today, I am delivering.\" \nThose were words to savor for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed - sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns. \nRepealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump's frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on.

On some pages of MVC application I perform ajax requests to WebAPI. Furthermore, I use IdentityServer3 as an authentication/authorization framework.\nI've already implemented cookie-based authentication for MVC part and token-based for WebAPI basing on tutorials/samples published on GitHub. Each of them works as intended, but user has to log in twice (separately in MVC and WebAPI), which seems to be reasonable because I've used different authentication types.\nIs it possible to use IdentityServer3 in a way that user is required to log in once? I'm wondering if it's a good idea to generate access token by MVC app (after cookie-based authorization) and provide it to JavaScript part of application (the token would be used during ajax calls). I think that this solution allows to avoid double signing in. I've read a lot of posts about similar problems, but they haven't given unambiguous answer.\nEdit: I've followed Paul Taylor's suggestion to use \"Hybrid Flow\" and I've found a couple of samples which illustrate how to implement it (among other things this tutorial ), but I cannot figure out how to perform valid ajax requests to WebAPI.

Maloof, who starred in the early seasons of the hit Bravo reality series, has revealed that she and her family have been forced to evacuate their Ventura County home due to the dangers of the widespread California fires. In addition, current Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Kyle Richards confirmed her Bel-Air neighborhood has also been evacuated. \nMaloof updated her followers on Twitter, confirming her family\u2019s evacuation from their lavish Southern California home.

Using high-resolution manometry (HRM), this study aims to identify positional adaptations of pharyngeal physiology by evaluating swallowing pressure patterns in a series of inverted body positions. Ten healthy adults each underwent swallowing tasks with pharyngeal HRM at six body positions using an inversion table (0\u00b0[upright], 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0[supine], 110\u00b0, 135\u00b0, and 180\u00b0[fully inverted]). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess impact of position on pressure parameters, and pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients translate. Velopharyngeal pressures varied by position ( P < 0.001), with significantly higher pressures generated with inversion \u226590\u00b0, compared with upright and 45\u00b0. Change in position did not significantly affect common mesopharyngeal pressures or swallowing pressure durations. UES valving mechanisms were preserved during inversion, with subtle variations observed in integral pressures ( P = 0.011). Pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients changed with position ( P < 0.01), increasing with inversion > 90\u00b0 compared to upright and 45\u00b0. Mechanisms of deglutition may differ with position and relative direction of gravity, particularly when at > 45\u00b0 inclination. Increased palatal pressure is generated in the upside-down position to achieve nasopharyngeal closure and prevent regurgitation. While other classically measured pressures may not consistently differ with positioning, many individuals exhibit adaptations in pressure gradients when inverted, likely due to a combination of changes in pharyngeal driving force and UES opening mechanisms. Identification of these changes, relative to position, further builds on our understanding of the adaptability of the pharyngeal swallowing system.\n\n\nfrom #ENT via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2nzWiCa\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hrm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anova", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:32.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f95d0c4c6d814a2a780badd8ae3b51fb2adfb739", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFEoFP0QO28OnjEntiYOUhnt9knjA5ipF_TJX.deoTPY6Tigjf9YIEQAaf6L73NLyXg3NIqiSptbTC.oKMf3CjxazpPHEXSIvo", "site_full": "community.babycenter.com", "site": "babycenter.com", "site_section": "https://community.babycenter.com/sitemap/posts/d20171205.xml", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "", "title": "Btdt mom's, second pregnancy weight gain", "title_full": "Btdt mom's, second pregnancy weight gain - BabyCenter", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://community.babycenter.com/img/bclub/birthclub_logo_preg_2.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 891, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "75668f235a08b414ae91195d3c2470adfc6b5db9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFEoFP0QO28OnjEntiYOUhnt9knjA5ipF_TJX.deoTPY6Tigjf9YIEQAaf6L73NLyXg3NIqiSptbTC.oKMf3CjxSSvYTw4GKUx0GWVVI6kPyo-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "jessalyn09", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "My first was a boy and I gained around 60lbs.
