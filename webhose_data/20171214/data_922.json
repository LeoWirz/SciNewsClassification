The PSAR, Developed by Welles Wilder, is designed to determine the point in time when there emerges a better than average probability of a trend switching directions. This is a common tool used by traders and investors to try to gauge potential reversal of a trend. \nThe parabolic SAR is shown on the charts as a series of small \u2018dots\u2019 that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. The basic use of the Parabolic SAR is to buy when the dots move below the price bars (signaling an uptrend) and sell/short-sell when the dots move above the price bars (signaling a downtrend). \nAfter a recent look, Tekmodo Industries Inc (TEK.V) has a 50-day Moving Average of 0.07, the 200-day Moving Average is 0.06, and the 7-day is noted at 0.08. A popular tool among technical stock analysts is the moving average. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators that simply take the average price of a stock over a specific period of time. Moving averages can be very useful for identifying peaks and troughs. They may also be used to help the trader figure out proper support and resistance levels for the stock. \nTraders may be relying in part on technical stock analysis. Tekmodo Industries Inc (TEK.V)   95.45. Despite the name, CCI can be used on other investment tools such as stocks. The CCI was designed to typically stay within the reading of -100 to +100. Traders may use the indicator to determine stock trends or to identify overbought/oversold conditions. A CCI reading above +100 would imply that the stock is overbought and possibly ready for a correction. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally. \nAt the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Tekmodo Industries Inc (TEK.V) is 19.46. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines,  DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available. \nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of multiple popular technical indicators created by J. Welles Wilder. Wilder introduced RSI in his book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d which was published in 1978. RSI measures the magnitude and velocity of directional price movements. The data is represented graphically by fluctuating between a value of 0 and 100. The indicator is computed by using the average losses and gains of a stock over a certain time period. RSI can be used to help spot overbought or oversold conditions. An RSI reading over 70 would be considered overbought, and a reading under 30 would indicate oversold conditions. A level of 50 would indicate neutral market momentum. The 14-day RSI is currently sitting at 53.83, the 7-day is at 53.34, and the 3-day is spotted at 65.48 for Tekmodo Industries Inc (TEK.V). \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tekmodo industries inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:07.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d5ff4d6d6d26325ff71ea97f082860709d7ae235", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTKKx84HUn3OfFAdUWSQjlJ5NfBYg_p9IOjpLldv6qVJaZz17Zb6OV1", "site_full": "www.crmbuyer.com", "site": "crmbuyer.com", "site_section": "http://www.crmbuyer.com/perl/syndication/rssfull.pl", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business_software", "business"], "section_title": "CRM Buyer", "title": "Machines Could Become Driving Force Behind CX", "title_full": "Machines Could Become Driving Force Behind CX", "published": "2017-12-07T03:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d5ff4d6d6d26325ff71ea97f082860709d7ae235", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTKKx84HUn3OfFAdUWSQjlJ5NfBYg_p9IOjpLldv6qVJaZz17Zb6OV1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Richard Adhikari", "published": "2017-12-07T03:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Machines Could Become Driving Force Behind CX", "text": "By Richard AdhikariDec 6, 2017 3:37 PM PT Customer experience improvements have become an important part of companies' digital transformations, according to survey results Mitel released Tuesday. \nMore than 2,500 senior IT decision makers across North America, the UK, France, Germany and Australia responded to the survey, conducted in August by Opinion Research for Mitel. The participants represented businesses ranging from 250 to 10,000-plus employees in a wide range of industries. \nAmong the researchers' findings: Overall, 95 percent of the respondents saw customer experience (CX) improvements as an important part of digital transformation; 59 percent had completed half or more of their expected CX improvements; 90 percent planned to tie machines to their communications and collaboration tools; 85 percent believed machine-to-people interactions would result in positive transformations in the customer experience; 75 percent planned to implement machine-based interactions with customers within the next two years; 75 percent saw automated event-triggered calls from customer devices as a valuable service; 73 percent believed machine-enhanced routines were valuable to their organization; 57 percent of retail respondents believed better CX would lead to higher customer satisfaction; and 56 percent of retail respondents believed better CX would lead to higher customer loyalty and lower customer churn. Generation Z \nCustomers, particularly millennials, readily have embraced digital technology in their day-to-day lives, the report suggests. \nMultichannel and machine-enhanced processes that tie together voice, video, movie and online channels to deliver a seamless and highly personalized experience help determine good CX, based on the survey results. \nHowever, businesses need to look beyond millennials to Gen Z -- the generation whose oldest members turn 21 this year -- suggests a study of United States consumers by WP Engine . \nGen Z members, who will constitute 40 percent of all consumers by 2020, soon will drive every major consumer trend, the WP Engine researchers found. \nBiometrics, predictive technologies, voice and gestures will replace typing on a singular device, they concluded. \n\"The only way to get these types of real-time personalized -- and then, ultimately, predictive -- experiences is with the assistance of machines,\" said WP Engine CMO MaryEllen Dugan. \nCompanies might need to look further beyond AI and omnichannel communications. \n\"We're headed to completely unified experiences across both online and off,\" Dugan told CRM Buyer. \nA consumer's in-store preferences will need to be incorporated online and vice versa, she said, and \"this will likely mean the adoption of AR and VR.\" Emerging Tech \nLarger e-commerce companies have the funds -- and to some extent, the skilled manpower -- needed to incorporate artificial intelligence, big data, augmented reality, virtual reality and other newer technologies into their systems, and \"they'll do this for mass personalization,\" noted Ray Wang, principal analyst at Constellation Research . \nWhile e-commerce small and mid-sized businesses face manpower and budgetary constraints, they too will be able to tap newer technologies, he told CRM Buyer. \nThe rise of AI networks is coming, and the market will total US$100 billion by 2025, Wang has predicted. \nThese AI networks will be offered by a limited number of large players, including Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, he said, and e-commerce SMBs will be able to tap into them. \n\"This is already here with lead matching,\" Wang pointed out. \n\"For the first time, SMB companies have the ability to leverage the martech stack and cloud software to provide the same seamless type of experience that large companies do,\" observed WP Engine's Dugan. \n\"Given that their website is essentially their face to the world, they need to use all the technology available to take advantage of the cloud, AI and e-commerce technology,\" she said. \nThat includes \"spinning up microsites faster, tracking their audience,' and adapting quickly to new trends, Dugan said. \nUsing an open source CMS is one way SMBs can keep down costs, she added, while \"providing incredible ROI and competing with larger companies.\" Richard Adhikari has been an ECT News Network reporter since 2008.

(Every company in the top 10 scored at least a 4.5 \u2014 well above the overall average of 3.3 among the 700,000-plus employers reviewed on Glassdoor.)\nAlthough Silicon Valley heavyweights make a strong showing, \"this year's list represents a diverse group of employers hiring across the country, including top companies in tech, retail, health care, consumer goods, consulting and more,\" said Robert Hohman, Glassdoor's CEO and co-founder.\nOne commonality that's increasingly clear: The culture and values of an organization and the opportunities that exist there are as important as the compensation and benefits packages .\nThree companies have been on the list all 10 years, including two in the top 10 listed below. The third, Apple , ranked 84th this year.\nHere are the top 10:\n10. Ultimate Software This year, a newcomer to the list notched the 10 th spot \u2014 for good reason. The Miami-based technology company, which specializes in human resources software solutions, covers 100 percent of employees' health-care premiums and 100 percent of their dependents' premiums, including dental, vision, mental health and prescription drug coverage, as well as acupuncture and homeopathy.\nUltimate Software also kicks in a 40 percent 401(k) match, free boot camp classes twice a week and free lunch every Monday. It's no wonder employees like it so much.\n9. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital St. Jude's \u2014 the pediatric research hospital where sick children can be treated at no cost \u2014 is another newcomer to the list. As a result of the nonprofit's mission, there's a deeply felt, shared culture centered on saving lives and making a positive difference in the world.\nStill, to counteract the seriousness of the daily grind, work/life balance is encouraged with flexible schedules and an on-site gym available to all employees.\n8. World Wide Technology Everyone on the team at World Wide Tech stands by the company's core values, including honesty, integrity and humility \u2014 along with a strong work ethic and a good attitude.\nBut, of course, working there has tangible benefits, too. The tech giant boasts a new state-of-the-art headquarters and extensive training programs, and a profit-sharing plan, to boot.\n7. HubSpot The Boston-based marketing software start-up prides itself on offering employees many opportunities to learn, try new things and grow their careers. That can sometimes be to the detriment of time outside the office \u2014 HubSpot's recent study of young executives found that 1 in 2 people say they need to improve their work/life balance.\nThe company is making significant strides in that area by giving workers unlimited vacation days, allowing pets in the office and offering free beer.\n6. Lululemon In a race to the top, this yoga and running gear retailer continues to outperform its competitors. But within the company, there's much more of a communal culture, thanks to free yoga classes and team-based commissions.\nMeanwhile, Lululemon is hungry to expand, which means more hiring opportunities for those who want to get in on the action.\n5. Google It may be no surprise that Google \u2014 one of the most sought-after employers \u2014 landed at No. 5 on Glassdoor's list. It's also one of only three companies to make the top 100 list every year in the list's 10-year history.\nThe secret to Google's success is that the search giant is all about the entire employee package, offering massages, catered meals, generous parental leave and other amazing benefits \u2014 in addition to being one of the highest-paying companies in America .\n4. In-N-Out Burger The California-based restaurant chain is not only a cult favorite among burger lovers, but also its workers.\nThat's likely because employees of the family-owned restaurants have competitive salaries, flexible schedules, paid vacations and a 401(k) plan, as well as parties and athletic events throughout the year. They also get free Double Double burgers and fries daily.\n3. Boston Consulting Group Boston Consulting Group heavily recruits on college campuses around the firm's home base in its namesake city as well as nationwide, making it an excellent place for new grads to start out \u2014 and stay for the long term.\nOne reason employees like the Massachusetts firm so much: It also notched a top spot for having one of the highest base salaries, at nearly $150,000, according to a separate report by Glassdoor .\n2. Bain & Company As only one of three employers to make Glassdoor's top 100 list all 10 years, the Boston-based consulting firm has demonstrated \"an impressive consistency and ability to keep their workforces engaged and satisfied,\" Hohman said. \"What's more, they offer a company culture that their employees truly believe in.\"\nOf course, a highly competitive compensation package doesn't hurt, either.\n1. Facebook It's no surprise that so many employees \"like\" working for Mark Zuckerberg , but their reasons go way beyond the salaries and benefits or even the free food.\n\"What we really see them appreciate most is the company's mission-driven culture, transparent leadership and the fact that their work literally impacts the lives of billions of people worldwide,\" said Hohman.\nThe social media stalwart has now made the list for eight consecutive years over the past decade and has been at No. 1 a whopping three times.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Best-Places-to-Work-LST_KQ0,19.htm", "https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/09/these-are-americas-favorite-restaurants-when-on-the-run.html", "https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/15/the-top-10-companies-for-millennials-who-want-flexible-jobs.html", "http://cdn3-s.hitc-s.com/20171201/img/jefferies-bptw.jpg", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/12/google-and-facebook-rank-among-americas-25-highest-paying-companies.html", "https://www.hubspot.com/sales-data/work-life-balance", "https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/21/benefits-can-be-as-valuable-as-a-big-paycheck.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hohman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark zuckerberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glassdoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert hohman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston consulting group boston consulting group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lululemon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. jude children's research hospital st. jude", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bain & company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world wide tech", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:08.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "159bb5e46ce5a793ba3f0fa001932f204821e077", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwoJVPiCLOARJl0_KuXKRDV8TYFQ01rCqbVZ7ATQmA8MdNOO1zEoMKDxNDLWIuGA7psOkHbD3N6M2DiTCuv.HetT4yudC4K5w2F_nEJPRahZLhUYlyo_hDpaBWxdcWsdrB._hXu.XjpG0bxKgZDgSf6drvaKfZnpugM3DHjsyzRzqjv1NQF32loAYfVZGIX0xexTaGo_r8J3Q--", "site_full": "flintdaily.com", "site": "flintdaily.com", "site_section": "http://flintdaily.com/feed/atom", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Flint Daily", "title": "Shore Capital Reconfirms a Buy Rating on Ladbrokes Coral Group Plc (LON:LCL); Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WAB)\u2019s Sentiment Is 1.21", "title_full": "Shore Capital Reconfirms a Buy Rating on Ladbrokes Coral Group Plc (LON:LCL); Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WAB)\u2019s Sentiment Is 1.21", "published": "2017-12-07T12:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "159bb5e46ce5a793ba3f0fa001932f204821e077", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwoJVPiCLOARJl0_KuXKRDV8TYFQ01rCqbVZ7ATQmA8MdNOO1zEoMKDxNDLWIuGA7psOkHbD3N6M2DiTCuv.HetT4yudC4K5w2F_nEJPRahZLhUYlyo_hDpaBWxdcWsdrB._hXu.XjpG0bxKgZDgSf6drvaKfZnpugM3DHjsyzRzqjv1NQF32loAYfVZGIX0xexTaGo_r8J3Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Henry Gaston", "published": "2017-12-07T12:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "Shore Capital Reconfirms a Buy Rating on Ladbrokes Coral Group Plc (LON:LCL); Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WAB)\u2019s Sentiment Is 1.21", "text": "Shore Capital Reconfirms a Buy Rating on Ladbrokes Coral Group Plc (LON:LCL); Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WAB)\u2019s Sentiment Is 1.21 \n  Henry Gaston \nToday, Thursday morning, Ladbrokes Coral Group Plc (LON:LCL) stock Buy was maintained by Analysts at Shore Capital in analysts report. \nWestinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation, doing business as Wabtec Corporation, provides technology equipment and services for the freight rail and passenger transit vehicle industries worldwide.

Each team, however, must have a minimum of 18 players in its roster. \nThe attractions of last-ball winning sixes, extravagant switch-hitting and rapid-fire centuries have made the IPL a favourite of the masses, especially the younger generation. \nThe IPL\u2019s 60 games are valued at roughly $8.5-million each, not far off the estimated $9.6-million per English Premier League match \u2013 and well over the $6.2-million price tag attached to home internationals in India.

Game of Thrones comes out in 2019. Dark Phoenix is in November. Then I have a couple indie movies coming out. I\u2019m a producer on my next movie (Girl Who Fell From the Sky). So I\u2019m really excited about the future.\" \nWhile no specific premiere date was announced, the show usually airs in April (Season 3 aired on March 31) so that's a clever shout - although Season 7 did air on July 16 of this year.

I find it curious that our well-informed Easterling has not spoken of Agarnaith to us. Does he keep the secrets of that land with the hope of blinding us to the threat it poses? \n'I do not like his silence on this matter. You must go to Agarnaith and learn what transpires within, but do not go alone! I believe you should bring Ayorz\u00e9n with you, and find out what he knows about the Bloody Gore.' Background \nMithrandir has heard unsettling rumour of a threat growing in Agarnaith, the Bloody Gore, on the eastern side of Gorgoroth. Objective 1 Talk to Ayorz\u00e9n at Cirith Gorgor, inside the Black Gate \nAyorz\u00e9n the Wily is at Cirith Gorgor, just inside the Black Gate. Ayorz\u00e9n the Wily : 'You have not sought my help in some time, <name>. I was beginning to think you had fallen into a hole, or blundered into the fire-lake, or forgotten the way back here. What is it you want?' You tell Ayorz\u00e9n that you need his help on the next leg of your journey, and ask him to accompany you to Agarnaith. A sudden look of panic crosses his face, but it passes just as quickly. When next he speaks, his voice is loud and confident, and no sign of his seeming fright remains. 'I have come to a decision, my friend! I will be happy to accept your previous and very generous offer of a place in Gondor! Your forgiveness and acceptance of Ayorz\u00e9n the Changed will become a thing of legend, <name>, and will be spoken of for centuries as an example to all! 'I will let the waggon-driver know. Sadly, I will be unable to accompany you to the Bloody Gore. Perhaps another time.' Objective 2 Gain entrance to Agarnaith from the north \nor Gain entrance to Agarnaith from the south \nAgarnaith may be approached from either the north or the south. You found the adventurers that entered Agarnaith from the northern approach \nOR You found the adventurers that entered Agarnaith from the southern approach Objective 3 Talk to the adventurer you found inside Agarnaith \nYou found adventurers in Agarnaith, and should hear what they have encountered within the Bloody Gore. \nIf you approached from the north Raneleg : 'Have you come to aid us, <name>? This swamp is a place of horror, and there are too few of us to feel secure within it, but having you here will be a great help! Arodrog planned to rejoin us shortly, but he has not yet arrived. 'Keep an eye on your surroundings as you adventure within the marsh. Dangers could lurk anywhere: in the water, up among the trees, within the twisted grasses. This is a foul place. The air smells foul and tastes worse. 'The creatures here don't seem to mind it. Indeed, it seems to lend them a curious strength! Test your mettle against them, and Linadar and I will meet you further south along the road.' \nIf you approached from the south Arodrog : 'Are you here to help us, <name>? Did Mithrandir send you to us? Only a Wizard could know the trouble we have been in ever since we arrived, and send aid such as you in time! Raneleg planned to rejoin us soon, but he has not yet found us. 'Enemies lurk everywhere in the swamp, and they can ensnare you even before you know they are there! I have never seen horrors such as these before, and I am no stranger to bogs unpleasant and mires malicious! 'If the tales I have heard of you are true, you should be able to best even the foes that stalk this swamp, <name>... I hope it is so! Defeat any you can, and Linadar and I will meet you further north along the road, not far from where the eastern road runs away into the swamp.' Objective 4 Defeat foul creatures in Agarnaith (0/12) \nThe creatures of Agarnaith seem to draw strength from the fetid air, and you must oppose them for the good of those who adventure in the marsh. Defeated foul creatures in Agarnaith (12/12) Objective 5 Meet up with the adventurers near the junction with the eastern road, in Agarnaith \nYou agreed to meet up with the adventurers again on the road, near where the eastern path leads away into the swamp. Linadar made it to the meeting location, but where is the other adventurer? Objective 6 Talk to Linadar on the road in Agarnaith \nOnly Linadar met up with you at the arranged meeting place in Agarnaith. Linadar : 'We should never have come here, <name>, we should never have come! This place is not fit for good folk! It hates us, and will strive evermore until we are slain, and the marsh will never give back our bodies... it will jealously drag us down beneath the surface and never let us go! 'Arodrog was slain by a terrible creature to the south, not far from here, and Raneleg is missing and nowhere to be found! I ran, to my shame, but shameful or not I am still here and they are not! 'Can you search for Raneleg, at least? And mayhap see if Arodrog survived his wound? I cannot imagine that he did, but if there is a chance that he lives we should not abandon him! My courage is spent! What good is a man of Gondor who runs from peril? And yet there is peril all around us in this horrible swamp!' Objective 7 Search for Raneleg to the north, west of the road Search for Arodrog just south of the eastern road Learn the fate of Raneleg Learn if Arodrog is alive or dead \nRaneleg and Arodrog ran into trouble off the road to the north and south, and Linadar has asked you to learn if they yet live. Raneleg is gone, but his sword remains: sticking straight up in the mud Did the sword fall from Raneleg's hand as he was borne aloft? Arodrog's body lies in the muck Arodrog has succumbed to his wounds. He is dead Objective 8 Bring Raneleg's sword to Linadar in Agarnaith \nLinadar is just north of the junction with the eastern road, in Agarnaith. Linadar : 'I am not surprised to hear that Arodrog was dead, for the creature that attacked him was a terrible, rotting thing. I can still hear its awful cry echoing in my head! But what of Raneleg? You found his sword, but no sign of the man himself?' You tell Linadar that the sword was stuck blade-first in the mud, as if Raneleg dropped it from a height as he was carried aloft by some flying creature. Linadar's eyes are saucers, wide with horror. 'I... I cannot stay here, <name>! I cannot abide this swamp for a single moment longer! I did not think myself a coward, but who could remain in this land and keep his wits? Let the shame follow me back to Gondor! I care not! At the least I will keep my life! 'Please help me back to the Gate, <name>! I cannot bear to go alone!' Objective 9 Talk to Mithrandir in Cirith Gorgor, inside the Black Gate \nMithrandir is in Cirith Gorgor, just inside the Black Gate. Mithrandir : 'Well, what did you learn of Agarnaith? Are the rumours true? Many are the explorers who have returned from that land shaken, robbed of their courage.' You recount what you beheld of the festering swampland, and the Wizard is most interested to hear of the vile creatures that you encountered.

You are born into a certain system and you play your position. If you are lucky you might be born a King on the chess board or a pawn who just manages to get by on minimum wage. Whatever the case, the system seems, crystallized, static and unchangeable. Thankfully I soon become aware of the power of the individual and the power of choice. Our social structure is not static, but changing microscopically every minute. While some people are born into royalty, others are able to rise to the top. Life is a game of cards; some people choose to hold on to the cards they are dealt with all their life. Others choose to play smart and deal to the next round. There is no play to survive but play to win. Take risks, bluff and evolve. \nEveryone is bound by the same universal rules. We all need food and sleep. The CEO and the average student both have 24 hours in a day. The only difference is the degree of access and quality of mind they have developed. I believe the ideal man ought to have a synthesis of aesthetic brilliance alongside and immaculate mind. This merges a Zen state of mind and the lifestyle of a living king. A person with such equilibrium ought to have the most gravitational pull. \nIt is my theory that higher you are in playing the game of life, the more gravitation you have. In describing gravitation, I would liken it to a degree of influence. Like moths that flock towards the light, we are all trying to get by in life and latch onto someone who we think has figured it out. There is almost a dark husky aura that surrounds people who have experienced beyond the scope of the average person. They have the interesting stories, and chilled confidence wherever they go. This causes a sense of ease to the average Joe, who keeps up football and hits the pup every three days to catch up on the town gossip. This gives them the believe that there is more to life or the grass is greener on the other side, so they become followers. It is very hard to be clear on what I mean by gravity, but if I was to pin it with words, it would be the depth and structure of the entity and his experiences. It is a combination of going through a lot of experiences, and structuring them very well internally that almost grounds the person. This can be thought as the development of character, because in Ju Jitsu we can test out the character off the person by the way he gives up. Some people tap out really easily, because they panic too much to remember how to reverse lock. Others have a degree of internal grounding and can calmly apply their experiences in the given situation, i.e. counter attack. This is the same way in life. Some people are overwhelmed, talk to their friends and family and cause worry and then take no action to solve it.  Others take the problem as it is, make proactive attempts to solve it and then internalize the new skills or lessons they have learnt. The latter are truly anti-fragile. \nConfidence is attractive to everyone because it gives the impression that their internal reality is well structured. They can handle the trauma of life and are literally high on life. Below is a rough diagram of gravity between people within a room. The calculation is as follows, the degree of trauma/experience of life divided by the degree of integration or internal structure. If the number is below 1, then they will ooze a certain confidence in life. \n\nAs you can see both Sigmas and Alphas ideally stay under the trauma threshold. They are not stunted but life, and almost bring life into the room through. Though naturally the Sigma has been through a lot more sh*t to get to where he is, his skills of self mastery and internal structure are more evolved. Therefore, his gravitational pull would be similar to an Alpha or more depending on how deep you want to access internal richness. Notice, how the other types revolve around them like followers. This is because of our human instincts to follow perceived authority. \nThe average person has very little internal structure. His coping mechanisms are not adept enough to cope with the growing complexity of the world.  What he does to cope is vicariously learnt through his upbringing and his role models. If he is in a gang, he would drink and take drugs to cope. If he was born in a structured household, there would be a focus on internal structure through the development of responsibility, truth and integrity. Therefore to play your cards right and evolve, you must structure yourself and come from a very firm foundation of mind.  \nThat would be all for now. \n\n-SigmaTalks  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ju jitsu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "sigma", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:10.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad157ecfa2188f8c10a541d83ea50ae1ad775eb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3J9lINDyYWhKt4n3cbg_wtCr5MK04b1EyJoNADDcl0A.G0hCM5sChoK._Fdj.7eFnkbxqes17WcKBiJ8I5D.rckCfRp_j5N114-", "site_full": "epicresearch.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://epicresearch.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Epic Research Stock Advisory Company", "title": "Epic Research Update : F&O cues", "title_full": "Epic Research Update : F&O cues", "published": "2017-12-07T12:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad157ecfa2188f8c10a541d83ea50ae1ad775eb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3J9lINDyYWhKt4n3cbg_wtCr5MK04b1EyJoNADDcl0A.G0hCM5sChoK._Fdj.7eFnkbxqes17WcKBiJ8I5D.rckCfRp_j5N114-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "aarna singh (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "Epic Research Update : F&O cues", "text": "\n\nNifty 10100 Call added 8.37 lakh shares in Open Interest on December 6 \n\nNifty 10200 Call added 7.7 lakh shares in Open Interest \n\nNifty 9800 Put added 5.23 lakh shares in Open Interest \n\nNifty 10200 Put shed 2.1 lakh shares in Open Interest\n\nFor more information & more Commodity Tips . \n\nCall us \u2706 \u2013 0731-6642300 or\n\nVisit http://www.epicresearch.co \n\nConnect with our social media sites\n\nFacebook Twitter YouTube Pinterest Linkedin Google+ Follow @Epic_Research http://epicresearch.blogspot.com/sitemap.xml ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "epic research update", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "open interest   nifty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook twitter youtube pinterest linkedin google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:11.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a3c0476b5de1e848d0029736c5016f44306b145a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosK88xwTGkiFAyHvNW3XdSaUFPxrLX6hyf9R4iK5_ZFJpvClferCyZwKqXRtDojh0Nh0534fD66Gxo-", "site_full": "www.freelancer.co.uk", "site": "freelancer.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.co.uk/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Simple website in blogger by ExpertsWorld007", "title_full": "Simple website in blogger by ExpertsWorld007", "published": "2017-12-07T12:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 56088, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a3c0476b5de1e848d0029736c5016f44306b145a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosK88xwTGkiFAyHvNW3XdSaUFPxrLX6hyf9R4iK5_ZFJpvClferCyZwKqXRtDojh0Nh0534fD66Gxo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "Simple website in blogger by ExpertsWorld007", "text": "Graphic Design Simple website in blogger \nHi, I need a simple blogger website to design which will have a home page with the contact form in which anyone can attach documents. \nI will give me login details to create this.

When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. The basic use of the Parabolic SAR is to buy when the dots move below the price bars (signaling an uptrend) and sell/short-sell when the dots move above the price bars (signaling a downtrend). \nTraders may be keeping a close eye on ATR indicators. The current 14-day ATR for Zions Bncrp Wts (ZIONW) is currently sitting at 0.89. The ATR measures the volatility of a stock on a day-to-day basis. The average true range is typically based on 14 periods and may be calculated daily, weekly, monthly, or intraday. The ATR is not considered a directional indicator, but it may reflect the strength of a particular move. \nChecking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is currently at 60.75, the 7-day stands at 59.56, and the 3-day is sitting at 45.93. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a commonly used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. \nAnother technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with  DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Zions Bncrp Wts (ZIONW) is noted at 20.96. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nThe Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator worth taking a look at. Zions Bncrp Wts (ZIONW) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -36.74. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends. \nZions Bncrp Wts (ZIONW)   72.81. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zions bncrp wts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:11.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b4d22fd292f88eb27bcfa9ea0c95ed091bd400a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosK88xwTGkiFAyHvNW3XdSaUFPxrLX6hyf9q6RoOEtHEynAzE1x6.nlCtRRvENcQXZTgyzStZ6L0bs-", "site_full": "www.freelancer.co.uk", "site": "freelancer.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.co.uk/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Outline Fonts for logo by newsouth", "title_full": "Outline Fonts for logo by newsouth", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 56088, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6b4d22fd292f88eb27bcfa9ea0c95ed091bd400a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosK88xwTGkiFAyHvNW3XdSaUFPxrLX6hyf9q6RoOEtHEynAzE1x6.nlCtRRvENcQXZTgyzStZ6L0bs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "Outline Fonts for logo by newsouth", "text": "I have read your details posted in \"outline fonts added\" project.

Sigurdsson to start repaying his hefty transfer fee. \nThe most expensive signing in Everton's history is finally beginning to show glimpses of the player who will forever hold a place in Swansea supporters' hearts but, after a lengthy settling in process, it's high time that the Icelandic playmaker turns his performances in recent weeks into a regular occurrence. \nSigurdsson scored a screamer on his full debut for the Toffees back in August but his new side's fans were made to wait over three months to see the 28-year-old find the net again. \nHe's got on the scoresheet twice in the past fortnight but new manager Sam Allardyce will want to see that more regularly and beating Liverpool's goalkeeper Simon Mignolet in Sunday's Merseyside derby would go some way to endearing himself to the Everton hardcore. \nDefending In Numbers is a new Deezer Originals football podcast. Listen to the latest episode and subscribe to the podcast on Deezer and iTunes . \nOnly Christian Eriksen and Kevin De Bruyne registered more assists last season than the Iceland international but his delivery has been underwhelming this term by his previous standards. \nBut it can change! \nOn this week's episode of the Defending in Numbers podcast, David Preece, the former Aberdeen goalkeeper turned football pundit, has a theory on how to get Sigurdsson firing on all cylinders again. Advertisement \n\"The one thing that I couldn't understand about Gylfi Sigurdsson is, when they paid all that money for him, why not play him in the exact same position and try to replicate as closely as possible the link he had with Fernando Llorente?\" Preece said. \n\"They're using him for his set pieces, OK. But they're playing him out wide. \n\"Use him in the role that he was playing in for Swansea to get the best out of him. Use him in the role that got him the \u00a350 million move in the first place. \n\"Obviously there's that history around the Romelu Lukaku move and that Everton didn't get a replacement. That was key to making Sigurdsson work, getting someone that he can link up with and use as a focal point. \n\"Dominic Calvert-Lewin has done great for a young kid.

\u00a9 Ronen Zvulun / Reuters Senior Russian lawmakers have called the decision by US President Donald Trump to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel a dangerous move that could cause a wave of painful aftershocks in international politics. \n\u201c Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and the plan to relocate the US embassy [in Israel] to this city is a continuation of a string of provocations in American foreign policy, which we are continuously witnessing in relation to Syria, Iran and North Korea, among others ,\u201d said Leonid Slutsky, head of the State Duma Committee for International Relations, RIA Novosti reported on Thursday. Read more Jerusalem is the \u2018eternal capital of the state of Palestine\u2019 \u2013 Palestine leader Abbas \nThe lawmaker also noted in his comments that Trump\u2019s move could potentially \u201c explode the situation in the zone of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .\u201d \nHead of the Upper House Committee for Information Policy, Senator Aleksey Pushkov, wrote on Twitter that the US president\u2019s decision was a global shock with potentially dire consequences. \u201c The whole world except for Israel is in a state of shock because of Trump\u2019s decision. He has brought a new fuse to the old powder keg. I am confident that this is not the last shock ,\u201d he said. \nOn Wednesday, US President Donald Trump signed a declaration officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and announced the plans to relocate the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the city. \" Today, we finally acknowledge the obvious - that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality ,\" Trump said. \n\" Israel is a sovereign nation with a right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital. Acknowledging this as a fact is a necessary condition for achieving peace ,\u201d continued the US president, who called Israel \u201c one of the most successful democracies in the world .\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "leonid slutsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronen zvulun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aleksey pushkov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "upper house committee for information policy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ria novosti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state duma committee for international relations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:12.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb77a90d0265a97ed17fe01baa04c071a6a5bf7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UcvD7XnQbJXcP88QB1Pe3gD8ITf0DrwuQdxHOX5qS97v2TO6C6ULPpl4S2Aqp42qVwB2xOCYu1MF1ZPsh1IAwKkfyBjjjwzvOhfk6lpL_YsuuZWN4Qc5nlHZ4gWZC2r.jpDazIWQdC.Ig--", "site_full": "diaoconline.vn", "site": "diaoconline.vn", "site_section": "http://diaoconline.vn/Rss/SieuThiDiaOc/10/can-ho-cao-cap", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "C\u0103n h\u1ed9 cao c\u1ea5p - Si\u00eau th\u1ecb \u0111\u1ecba \u1ed1c", "title": "Nh\u1eadn nh\u00e0 \u0111\u00f3n T\u1ebft 2018- c\u0103n h\u1ed9 cao c\u1ea5p khu T\u00e2n B\u00ecnh.

She said a definitive no. She said she loves America, no matter what its current problems are, and all her friends, family and her job are there. She asked me to move down there, but I\u2019m in my 50s and have a job here I love. How do you have half a marriage?

Living apart allows you to share your best selves and have some complete autonomy and time to breathe.\nLiving together means sharing decisions and costs, and less time to be alone to do your own thing. That can be good or bad. At least you\u2019ll know. Rather than wrangling over which country to live in, take your relationship on a 30-day test drive.\nRead more by Miss Lonelyhearts .\nRelated Items Articles Relationship stuck at American border Miss Lonelyhearts Delaying engagement could backfire Miss Lonelyhearts Nylon stocking in bed could be his Miss Lonelyhearts Advertisement\nAdvertise With Us\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "winnipeg free press", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winnipeg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:13.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1dc54c3b388cc65450aeaf88bad209195dfa6e31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3OSYnYmcftOgb_rVxqBfbTl1uEvgqFOMnPxQQWsret76wv9eOA0CgaIfDvILfWlN33Tce5cZ02vHf0z61GvPg", "site_full": "www.rt.com", "site": "rt.com", "site_section": "http://rt.com/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RT - Daily news", "title": "Turkey begins trial of pro-Kurdish leader over \u2018terrorist links\u2019", "title_full": "Turkey begins trial of pro-Kurdish leader over \u2018terrorist links\u2019", "published": "2017-12-07T10:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.rt.com/static/img/og-logo-rt.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 538, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1dc54c3b388cc65450aeaf88bad209195dfa6e31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3OSYnYmcftOgb_rVxqBfbTl1uEvgqFOMnPxQQWsret76wv9eOA0CgaIfDvILfWlN33Tce5cZ02vHf0z61GvPg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "RT", "published": "2017-12-07T10:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Turkey begins trial of pro-Kurdish leader over \u2018terrorist links\u2019", "text": "Turkey begins trial of pro-Kurdish leader over \u2018terrorist links\u2019 Published time: 7 Dec, 2017 08:54 Edited time: 7 Dec, 2017 10:17 Get short URL \nThe co-leader of Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish opposition party went on trial in Ankara Thursday on charges of links to outlawed Kurdish militants.
