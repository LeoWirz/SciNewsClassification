Posted on Author Samuel Comment(0) \nThe Portuguese star is aiming to defend his crown and match the achievements of his eternal rival at Barcelona by taking the prize for a fifth time. Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo will beat Barcelona rival Lionel Messi to the 2017 Ballon d\u2019Or, according to leaked images of his personalised Nike boots. With the pair having dominated the most prestigious individual prize in world football over the course of the last decade, their collective tally is set to be taken to 10 on Thursday. Messi currently leads the way on five victories to Ronaldo\u2019s four, but it appears that the Portuguese forward is set to equal the Argentine\u2019s haul. Having already claimed the FIFA Best Award for 2017 and topped the Goal 50, Ronaldo has always been the leading contender on a 30-man shortlist to capture the Ballon d\u2019Or , and Nike appear to have readied themselves for his coronation. Paying homage to Ronaldo\u2019s previous successes, the new boots have already added 2017 to the 32-year-old\u2019s roll of honour. It remains to be seen whether that scenario will play out, but there is not long to wait now. The Ballon d\u2019Or ceremony is set to take place in Paris on Thursday around 18:00 UK time , with former France international David Ginola on hand to dish out the top prize \u2013 which is voted for by a group of 173 journalists from around the world. Ronaldo\u2019s claims to the crown have already been talked up by those he works alongside at Real Madrid, with Blancos boss Zinedine Zidane backing his star forward to emerge victorious . He said: \u201cRonaldo\u2019s human, just like us but he is very different at times. He has no limits, really. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s going to win his fifth Ballon d\u2019Or explains that. It\u2019s just amazing. He deserves it as well. I\u2019m sure Cristiano is going to win his fifth Ballon d\u2019Or. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me. He wants more and more. He has the ambition to win a sixth or a seventh. Real president Florentio Perez added : \u201cRonaldo is one of our great symbols. \u201cHe is the leading goalscorer in our history. A few days ago, he won his second \u2018The Best\u2019 and this week he is going to win his fifth Ballon d\u2019Or.\u201d The collection of another trophy would mark a fitting end to another record-breaking week for Ronaldo, with his goal in a Champions League clash with Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday seeing him become the first man in the history of the competition to net in all six games of the group stage .

Read more Russia solves inflation headache plaguing the economy - central bank \nThis would be the first year since the crisis in the Russian economy that growth would be seen in the country. \nThe economy ministry predicts growth would hit two percent this year. Economists like former finance minister Aleksey Kudrin have warned that Russia\u2019s GDP could grow only if the Kremlin implements structural reforms in the economy. \nThe rate of economic growth in Russia, according to the economy ministry, slowed in October to one percent year on year. The reasons are a fall in output in extractive industries, contracting activity in manufacturing and worse-than-expected results in the banking sector. \nAt the same time, inflation in Russia remains at the lowest level since the collapse of the Soviet Union, falling to 2.5 percent in November. Given the low inflation, the central bank plans to gradually cut the key rate to 6-7 percent per annum from the current 8.25 percent.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yepanchintsev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maksim oreshkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aleksey kudrin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soviet union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:06.040+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c968076afc4635a30ad7d479252c70653514f30e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQgZmxVwbZRK6SRv0Rpmn3kzTDa2rLkIrR7p.QZWAYExYBkeH.3DEqhp1IASnDtkhM58KXEAznaBKEWoQ52yNaESgw_g_76wP4-", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/mobiles-new?page=2", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Mobile Phones - Cheap Contracts, PAYG &amp; Voucher Codes - Hot UK Deals - page 2", "title": "Samsung Evo+ 32GB Micro SDXC Card \u00a39.99 (or 2 for \u00a319) mymemory", "title_full": "Samsung Evo+ 32GB Micro SDXC Card \u00a39.99 (or 2 for \u00a319) mymemory - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-06T15:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 29, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2848709_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c2f97434b7775406996723c05d92d684090ed55e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQgZmxVwbZRK6SRv0Rpmn3kzTDa2rLkIrR7p.QZWAYExYBkeH.3DEqhp1IASnDtkhM58KXEAznaBKEWoQ52yNaEsEIP9RUtu_yTauKYGqv9DzKCSnXkF6O.", "ord_in_thread": 26, "author": "jojoboy1978", "published": "2017-12-06T23:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "jojoboy1978 59 m ago but this is 9.99 only\npart of the deal as posted is 2 for \u00a319", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:06.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4452d73f58ee258440e0fd8bbb5a7afbf9b70b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9s6W3tDEph.e0VyZt8AE4XTPL36cATVt.D8xoIcx3pgYIPp.V8MwxsuhUFqdP6b7tB9Nipi4U6fg--", "site_full": "www.daijiworld.com", "site": "daijiworld.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TodaysNewsOnDaijiworldcom", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Today's News on Daijiworld.com", "title": "Jerusalem status: Saudis condemn Trump's announcement", "title_full": "Jerusalem status: Saudis condemn Trump's announcement", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://daijiworld.com/images/daijiSquareLogo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17002, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d4452d73f58ee258440e0fd8bbb5a7afbf9b70b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9s6W3tDEph.e0VyZt8AE4XTPL36cATVt.D8xoIcx3pgYIPp.V8MwxsuhUFqdP6b7tB9Nipi4U6fg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Jerusalem status: Saudis condemn Trump's announcement", "text": "Jerusalem status: Saudis condemn Trump's announcement Thu, Dec 7 2017 02:22:56 PM \nRiyadh, Dec 7 (IANS): Saudi Arabia on Thursday condemned US President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital amid growing international criticism of the move.The Saudi Royal Court in a statement warned of serious consequences of such an \"irresponsible and unwarranted step\", including further complicating the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Saudi Press Agency reported.Trump on Wednesday recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital reversing decades of US policy. He also instructed moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the ancient city.\"The decision represents a great bias against the historic and permanent rights of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem, which have been affirmed by international resolutions and recognized and supported by the international community,\" the Saudi statement said.Calling the decision a pivot from the \"historically impartial position\" of Washington in regard to the issue of Jerusalem, the statement said the decision exemplifies a drastic regress in efforts to move the peace process forward.Saudi Arabia called on the US administration to reverse this action and support the international will to enable the Palestinian people to regain their legitimate rights.Eight of the 15 nations who are currently members of the UN Security Council called for the body to hold an urgent meeting on the US decision by the end of the week.

I love it! To celebrate, I wrote a special Christmas novella: a Bow Street thief taker finally gets his chance with an independent widow\u2026on Christmas Eve. \nKeep your eyes open for a special offer at the end.  Enjoy!  Gina Conkle \nLady Isabella is off-limits for thief taker, Jack Emerson. Other women practically draw maps to their bed chamber windows when he patrols St. James\u2014but never the raven-haired widow. They\u2019ve shared hot looks, fast quips, and lobbed an insult or two. The lady is maddening. She doesn\u2019t need Bow Street\u2019s best until one Christmas Eve in a dark alley\u2026 \nThis excerpt is from the middle of the story. Jack and Lady Isabella have danced around their attraction for a long time. They\u2019ve traded quips but never been alone\u2014until Christmas Eve. \n\nMeet My Love at Midnight \nThe door to Ryland House opened, spilling cinnamon and nutmeg scents. Laughter and violin music poured out behind Belker. Even the dour butler couldn\u2019t stop Christmas Eve cheer. And by his rosy cheeks, the upper servant had done a bit of dipping in the merriment. \n\u201cLady Foster. Mr. Emerson.\u201d Belker stiffened his shoulders. \u201cPlease come in.\u201d \nLady Foster swept inside but Jack\u2019s boots rooted in place. He grinned at the butler and tapped the corner of his own mouth. \n\u201cIs that a wine stain you have there?\u201d \nBelker\u2019s hand clapped the side of his mouth. His eyes rounded. \u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d \n\u201cLike any good butler, you tested the mulled wine before it left the kitchen.\u201d Jack\u2019s grin widened. \u201cFor quality purposes only.\u201d \n\u201cYes, for the quality,\u201d Belker sniffed. \u201cWe have high standards at Ryland House.\u201d \nLady Foster passed her cloak and gloves to a footman. \u201cAren\u2019t you coming inside Mr. Emerson?\u201d \nHeel strikes banged marble floors behind Belker. Cyrus Ryland and his flaxen-haired wife approached. \n\u201cOf course, he\u2019s coming in,\u201d Ryland put in smoothly. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve and Bow Street\u2019s best thief taker is on our doorstep.\u201d \nJack touched his hat, his gaze colliding with Ryland\u2019s amused grey stare. He and the well-heeled man of business had a bumpy history, but Jack gave a respectful greeting. \n\u201cI\u2019m delivering Lady Foster safely to your door. She had an\u2026unfortunate incident.\u201d \nThree curious pairs of eyes blinked at the lady. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Mrs. Ryland asked. \n\u201cNothing of import.\u201d \n\u201cJust an overturned hack and a dockside ruffler bent on thievery.\u201d Jack added with pride, \u201cShe had the matter well in hand by the time I arrived.\u201d \nMrs. Ryland gasped. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d \n\u201cNot in the slightest, but I could do with a brandy or a cup of your mulled wine.\u201d Lady Isabella\u2019s violet gaze landed on Jack. \u201cAs would Mr. Emerson.\u201d \nShe wanted a drink after her ordeal, but her eyes said, I want you most of all. \nLonging hit him square in the chest. He pulled his great coat tighter, fighting winter\u2019s chill. His Hammersmith garret was dark and empty. He could grab a pint at The White Dove and talk to friends and neighbors. Ryland house with its evergreen boughs and holly sprigs was light and inviting\u2014especially with the raven-haired widow waiting for him to join her. \n\u201cOh look.\u201d Mrs. Ryland was a swish of emerald silk. \u201cIt\u2019s snowing.\u201d \nFat snowflakes fell on Jack\u2019s boots. Two. Then three and four. White sprinkled the ground like grains of sugar, much of it melting on contact. \nMr. Ryland set a protective hand on his wife\u2019s shoulder and checked Piccadilly. \u201cMore like a dusting. We need to go north if you want proper snow.\u201d \nJack grinned against his collar. Ryland spoke like a man who\u2019d move heaven and earth to give his wife whatever she wanted\u2014proper snow included. Dubbed the King of Commerce, London\u2019s wealthiest commoner could buy heaps of the white stuff and have it delivered on the canals he built. \n\u201cIt\u2019s settled then.\u201d Mrs. Ryland hugged herself against the cold. \u201cYou can\u2019t ride off in weather like this. Come inside. I insist.\u201d \nShe backed away to give him room and there was nothing for it. He caved. \nInside the grand entry hall, candles blazed from three sparkling chandeliers. Belker took his hat and great coat. A footman materialized with a tray of cups brimming with mulled wine. Jack took a cup and drank. Hot, clove-flavored wine tripped over his tongue. He\u2019d stay for one drink. \nMrs. Ryland steered them through the cavernous entry. Pine boughs swathed every cornice. Oranges and holly berries dotted the greenery. Violins played Hark the Herald Angels Sing from the ballroom. A younger set dashed about a drawing room where the furniture had been pushed against the walls. Youths crowded the room. Gangly lads of twelve or thirteen years all the way to university age young men. Beribboned girls cupped their giggling mouths as they dodged a blind-folded boy. \n\u201cMy nieces and nephews,\u201d Ryland explained with a nod to the drawing room dripping with festive pine boughs. \n\u201cThey\u2019re playing blind man\u2019s bluff,\u201d Mrs. Ryland added. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join them or come to the ballroom. Dancing will start up again.\u201d \nJack tensed at the mention of dancing, quickly tending to his mulled wine. He wasn\u2019t staying long enough to dance. \n\u201cOr if you\u2019re hungry\u2026\u201d Mrs. Ryland pointed to a pair of gilt edged doors opened wide. \nGuests milled about a long table spread with the finest fare of plum puddings and cakes, three roasted geese, a pyramid of macaroons, and another tower of oranges and dates. A white-gloved footman sawed slices of ham for those needing a hefty nibble. \n\u201cI say, Ryland, I\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d A man with perfect sausage curls above both ears traipsed through the entry. \n\u201cBaron Atal seems most insistent,\u201d Mrs. Ryland murmured against her husband\u2019s shoulder. \nRyland gave a curt not. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse us.\u201d \n\u201cEnjoy the party.\u201d Mrs. Ryland spoke over her shoulder as her husband whisked her away to greet the lace-cuffed baron. \nLady Isabell sipped her wine, amusement glinting from her violet eyes. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s got your humor up?\u201d Jack asked. \n\u201cYou.\u201d She held the cup to her mouth. Steam curled past her nose. \n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019ve crossed a threshold after all.\u201d Her minx-ish smile widened. \u201cNot the one I had in mind, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d \nHe grinned, recalling her quip when he nearly kissed her in the Queenhithe alley. But this wouldn\u2019t do. He was a stranger in a strange land. He protected West End homes. He didn\u2019t hobnob in them. \n\u201cI\u2019m not one for parties, milady.\u201d \n\u201cParties? Or dancing?\u201d A winged brow arched. \u201cYou paled at the mention of dancing.\u201d \nHe winced. \u201cWas I that obvious?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m certain no one else noticed.\u201d Her tongued flicked delicately over wine-stained lips. \u201cYour Irish brogue becomes more pronounced. At certain times.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019ve noticed that, have you?\u201d \nLady Isabelle\u2019s nod was slow and her voice for his ears alone. \u201cWhen you\u2019re vexed. When you tease.\u201d Her breath hitched. \u201cWhen you\u2019re\u2026aroused.\u201d \nHer last word burned him. It went from his brain, tripping through his body like a hot coal. Pricking his skin. Heating his abdomen. And landing between his legs in the most pleasant way. They stood in an entry hall bigger than his garret, surrounded by guests meandering from one entertainment to the next. Yet, he and Lady Foster could be on an island alone. Etched marble underfoot was their land and the lovely, raven-haired widow his sole companion. \nShe could be a Christmas Eve gift. \nHe downed the last of his wine. Fanciful thinking like that was trouble. Best he remember his place. He was a Bow Street thief taker, a commoner while Lady Isabella was far beyond his reach. Time he left. \nJack clunked his empty cup on a table festooned with holly. \u201cWhere\u2019s Belker? I need my coat and hat.\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave. You barely warmed up.\u201d \nCreamy mounds plumped over Lady Isabella\u2019s velvet bodice. He stared at them. Hard. He knew what would warm him best, but he was smart enough to keep that to himself. \n\u201cI\u2019m good and warm, milady.\u201d \nHe should\u2019ve pinned her to the alley wall when the moment was ripe. The lady had been more than willing. But diamonds twinkled above her tempting flesh. What other proof did he need that she was not for him? \nIf he removed lust from the equation, he was faced with an undeniable fact. He genuinely liked Lady Isabella. One misstep could ruin their budding friendship. And get him dismissed from Bow Street. \nSome distance was required. He was about to make that point when feminine fingers touched his sleeve. \n\u201cWould you consider a proposition?\u201d \n\n\n\nLord Marcus Bowles has stained his family's reputation for the last time. Only after spending a scandal-free year restoring some far-flung property can this second son return in good graces. But Marcus isn't one to abandon a lone damsel on a dark country lane. \nOne stolen kiss and Genevieve Turner's handsome midnight savior disappears. Typical. No matter, Gen is finally on the way to her new post, and hopefully to finding her grandmother as well. Instead she finds her mischievous hero is her new employer. Surely a few more kisses won't hurt... \nPurchase: | Amazon | Kindle | B&N | iTunes | \nCheck out the  Midnight Meetings series:       \nUp For Grabs: \n1  $10 Gift Card (Amazon or B&N) \nTo Enter:  \nPlease fill out the Rafflecopter for entry. \n**Don't forget to enter the grand prize giveaway! \n\nGood Luck!  \nSpecial thanks to Gina Conkle for sponsoring this giveaway. a Rafflecopter giveaway ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gina conkle  gina conkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baron atal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lady foster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus bowles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "genevieve turner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cyrus ryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lady isabella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isabell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isabelle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isabella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gina conkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gift card (amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "b&n", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king of commerce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryland house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald angels", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hammersmith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white dove", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:07.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bef022fd4cc330701c1f8719a74d6236b71ffefc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/Mx2PHH_4C23UFioRV_hVQVn7BKiqenspo3huzuxxrqth.zNhiBF8M2X3JPFBxiBvdrEpbVdw3pcw6hYs.F.3JaZtphMavAaNne_o4Wg1f4C5MFuHw0TR8a1pRZKTchlsLCRhUcwslNRLzTJka5slG.gVFC53NswEOP7cn4Xomo0-", "site_full": "univworgers.com", "site": "univworgers.com", "site_section": "http://univworgers.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "univworgers", "title": "Little girl brutalized and raped several times by her aunt\u2019s husband rescued in Delta State", "title_full": "Little girl brutalized and raped several times by her aunt\u2019s husband rescued in Delta State", "published": "2017-12-07T11:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://univworgers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24312627_1973052996054897_831475103572199433_n714153379.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bef022fd4cc330701c1f8719a74d6236b71ffefc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/Mx2PHH_4C23UFioRV_hVQVn7BKiqenspo3huzuxxrqth.zNhiBF8M2X3JPFBxiBvdrEpbVdw3pcw6hYs.F.3JaZtphMavAaNne_o4Wg1f4C5MFuHw0TR8a1pRZKTchlsLCRhUcwslNRLzTJka5slG.gVFC53NswEOP7cn4Xomo0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "alabi", "published": "2017-12-07T11:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Little girl brutalized and raped several times by her aunt\u2019s husband rescued in Delta State", "text": "Little girl brutalized and raped several times by her aunt\u2019s husband rescued in Delta State Posted on Author alabi Comment(0) \nA little girl, Chiamaka who was repeatedly harassed and defiled by her aunt\u2019s husband has been rescued in Delta State. \nFacebook user, Israel Joe who shared the story and photo revealed that the suspect has been arrested. Read below\u2026 \n\u201cYesterday 4th December, I was called to a situation that made me wept right here in the city of Warri, Nigeria. Chiamaka have been severally harassed and raped by her uncle. Last week, this little girl declined and was brutally tortured to almost stupor by this callous uncle. \nAfter much beaten, she succumb and was again raped with blood gushing out of her body. She could hardly go to school with her tattered uniform and excruciating pains from both the rape and torture she got from this animal called uncle. When she opened her body yesterday, with marks of wire all over her back, chest and stomach, and narrated her ordeal to her teacher, the school immediately called the police. \nThe uncle was apprehended and his wife who is an elder sister to Chiamaka\u2019s mother surprisingly was ignorant of this wickedness perpetuated by her husband. I guess you can\u2019t look at her private part without a lion heart\u2026 You can\u2019t but cry. \nThanks to the Nigerian police (QRS) as their investigations keeps on inspiring us and we shall pursue this case to a reasonable conclusion to ensure justice is done. We had to admit this young girl who could barely walk at the hospital yesterday. \nWhy this rapes and sexual harassment against the girl child? Why this gender violence against this child. It was as if I should just execute this idiot but the law must take her course even if my last penny will go for it. \nBetter future still awaits this young girl and like Oprah Winfrey she will definitely bounce back greater. \nGod bless Nigeria.\u201d Post Views: 16 Related Posts", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chiamaka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oprah winfrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel joe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "delta state posted o", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delta state little", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delta state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:07.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "558f034e240bf388cc035a39d7355e48ac5ea262", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3OSYnYmcftOgb_rVxqBfbTl1uEvgqFOO5Fr6FXqGaylhBDQLDGxV5x5kJXk5Cx.TrbBI_289xDQ--", "site_full": "www.rt.com", "site": "rt.com", "site_section": "http://rt.com/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RT - Daily news", "title": "France\u2019s Macron visits Qatar amid Arab boycott of Doha", "title_full": "France\u2019s Macron visits Qatar amid Arab boycott of Doha", "published": "2017-12-07T09:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.rt.com/static/img/og-logo-rt.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 538, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 1}}}, "uuid": "558f034e240bf388cc035a39d7355e48ac5ea262", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3OSYnYmcftOgb_rVxqBfbTl1uEvgqFOO5Fr6FXqGaylhBDQLDGxV5x5kJXk5Cx.TrbBI_289xDQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "RT", "published": "2017-12-07T09:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "France\u2019s Macron visits Qatar amid Arab boycott of Doha", "text": "France\u2019s Macron visits Qatar amid Arab boycott of Doha Published time: 7 Dec, 2017 07:46 Edited time: 7 Dec, 2017 09:18 Get short URL \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Qatar Thursday for a one-day trip amid a boycott of Doha by four Arab nations.

But when I do go out, I like to go to the movies, try new restaurants and read; I love everything by Haruki Murakami.\nWhat\u2019s next for you?\nI recently got into Commonwealth Games qualifier in Putrajaya where I came second.

So, I remember waiting for my points with my coach and my mom. When I found out that I made the cut, I was just relieved that all the hard work we put in paid off.\nRachel Arnold ( @RACHARNOLDDDD ), SQUASH, 21\nComing from a family that has a stellar track record in squash, does that come with certain kind of pressure?\nI think the pressure will always be there. I just try not to think about it too much and let myself have fun because squash is something that I\u2019m very passionate about.\nBut of course, I want to be better than my sister (Delia Arnold), eventually.\nYour career is only blooming but what has been the highlight of it so far?\nThe SEA Games in 2015 where I won both team and single events, and I just won gold for doubles at this year\u2019s Games. Also, I currently rank at number 50 in the world and I hope to break into the top 10 before I hit 25.\n(Outfit: Versace)\nChristian Lee ( @CLEE_TENNIS ), TENNIS, 25\nHow did you get into tennis?\nBoth my parents played, my dad was actually a semi-professional. I\u2019ve been playing since I was four years old and it actually started at squash courts, playing against the wall.\nI moved to Florida when I was 16 to gain more experience before returning home few years after.\nWhat was the hardest match that you\u2019ve ever done?\nWinning or losing? (laughs) I have to say the doubles final I had earlier this year where my partner and I beat out a top-seeded duo after being six championship points down, which means we had to score seven to eight points consecutively to win.\nHad we lost just one point, we would\u2019ve lost the entire tournament.\n(Outfit: Gucci)\nZylane Lee ( @ZYLANE ), SYNCHRONISED SWIMMING, 25\nWhat do you think is the biggest hurdle about being a synchronised swimmer?\nThat the field is extremely small here; there are only four states in Malaysia that recognise this sport.\nI consider myself fortunate that my mom was in the first batch of synchronised swimming team. She used to take me and my sister to her trainings and that\u2019s how I got my start.\nOne thing that people don\u2019t know about you.\nI\u2019m studying Science and Food Technology at Universiti Putra Malaysia and I dream to invent food for astronauts.\nBut right now I\u2019m focussing on my sports career until 2020 for the Olympics.\n(Outfit: Prada)\nLeong Chee Feng ( @CHEEFENGLEONG ), TABLE TENNIS, 19\nWhat was the most memorable event for you?\nThe 2013 SEA Junior Championship where I won both double and single categories. Those were two of the first gold medals I won overseas.\nWe didn\u2019t get to celebrate much as we had another game coming in Malaysia but that\u2019s fine.\nFinish this sentence: \u201cIf I could change one rule of the game, I would...\u201d\nMake it a standard practice that our team gets a head start in terms of points whenever we are up against players from China. They\u2019re just (almost) impossible to beat! (laughs)\n(Outfit: Dior Homme)\nChuah Yu Tian ( @YUTIAN_YUTIAN ), POLE VAULT, 24\nPole vault is not a popular sport in Malaysia, so what motivates you to continue on this journey?\nIt\u2019s true that there aren\u2019t many pole vaulters out there, especially women, but it doesn\u2019t bother me.\nMy senior Roslinda Samsu proved that it is possible to take our talents into pole vault beyond the borders. She made it to the Olympics in 2008!\nWhen have you been the most satisfied with yourself?\nAt the recent SEA Games where I won the silver medal. It was my first SEA Games ever and I wasn\u2019t expecting to place at all since all the medallists from the previous Games were there.\n(Outfit: Versace)\nWelson Sim ( @WELSONSIM ), AQUATIC SWIMMING, 20\nAt 20 years old, you\u2019re already making and breaking records, what\u2019s your secret?\nIt\u2019s not really a secret. It\u2019s all about the hard work and sacrifice.\nI\u2019ve been swimming since I was 10, initially because of my chronic asthma condition but I\u2019m grateful to have made it this far.\nHow do you release tension?\nI play computer games and my go-to is DOTA. I play a lot of DOTA.\nOne fact about you that\u2019s least expected.\nI don\u2019t get angry easily.\n(Outfit: Gucci)\nTracie Ang ( @TRACIE_ ANG ), GYMNASTICS, 24\nBeing an athlete means you start at the earliest stage of life, and at 24, have you achieved everything in your list?\nNot everything. I want more. I still want to win the big competitions like the Commonwealth Games and the Olympics.\nI went to the qualifier for the last Olympics but missed the spot by a hair\u2019s breadth. So I\u2019m hopeful for the next one in 2020.\nTo remain in shape takes discipline, especially dietary, but do you do cheat days?\nI do! Usually, I\u2019d go and eat whatever I\u2019m feeling on that day. I\u2019m not sure if this is a cheat-day food but I had waffles with toothsome maple syrup just yesterday.\n(Outfit: Fendi)\nYeap Wai Kin ( @WAIKINYEAP ), WUSHU, 24\nMartial arts are not without risks; have you ever had an injury that almost pushed you over the edge?\nIt was a couple of years ago when I sprained my leg ankle during practice. One ligament was completely torn.\nAt one point, it didn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to get any better and it affected me a lot. But after some time, I was able to push through.\nOne of the interesting things about sports like wushu is the costume. What\u2019s a \u201cgood costume\u201d to you?\nBecause this is a Chinese traditional martial art, a good costume needs to employ appropriate emblems such as the motifs of dragon, phoenix and flower.\nA good costume carries the spirit of the tradition that will project into every movement.\n(Outfit: Fendi)\nTo read the full interview of the 10 athletes, you can grab a copy L'Officiel

Read less Read more\nThe problems of buying from Chinese sellers is exactly the same as when they were barred . The only thing that has changed is that they now pay HUKD referral fees . So now its OK .

Sadly it is now just a paid for referral site treating its members as \"cash fodder\" .

The chill in the air is just enough for red noses. The city streets are decked out in shimmering lights and dazzling displays of ornaments. \nAt the same time, New Year pine tree was installed in the Fountain Square on December 1. \nThe holiday season in Baku can't begin until charity fair \"Cold hands, a warm heart\" has arrived at public square. Here you can buy New Year's souvenirs and try popular street food. \nWith the support of the Nargis Fund, a festive fair was opened here, and by tradition all collected funds will go to charity. More than forty fairy wooden huts invite you to buy gorgeous souvenirs and try delicious food. \nThe curious thing is that most people at the fair are going to the bookstore. \n\"The best gift for the New Year is a book.
