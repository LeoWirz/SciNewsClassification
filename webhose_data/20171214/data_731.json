Australia never knew what hit them. \nAFP \nEarlier India had posted 523 in reply to 556 by the hosts. Now they needed a good bowling performance to gain the upper hand. With Zaheer Khan out injured, Agarkar took charge. \nHe grabbed 6/41 as the Aussies folded for 196. India chased down the target of 230 with 4 wickets to spare. They led the series 1-0 with 2 games to go. It was eventually drawn 1-1, our best performance Down Under. \nAgarkar removed the likes of Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting who were in great form at that time. His spell titled the scales in India's favour and he was the toast of the team. \nIt was a heroic spell, which is still remembered as one of the finest moments in our cricket history.

Thursday voiced regret over the decision to ban Russia from the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, saying the participation of the country's athletes was crucial to the success of the event.The South Korean sports ministry urged Russian athletes to compete as neutrals following the International Olympic Committee's unprecedented ban, saying in a statement it had \u201cworked hard over the past seven years to make meticulous preparations\u201d for a peaceful and harmonious Games.\u201cThe participation of winter sports athletes from around the world, including Russia, is the key to the success of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and a crucial factor in realizing the Olympic spirit,\u201d said the ministry, which is responsible for preparing the Games.The presence of Russian athletes \u201cwho have shown outstanding performance in the many previous winter games, would make significant contributions to the success of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games,\u201d it added.The statement came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would not boycott the event despite the ban over a state-orchestrated doping programme, assuaging fears Russia could spurn the Games entirely.The IOC ruling allows clean athletes from Russia to take part in the Games as neutrals.In its statement, the South Korean sports ministry said it \u201cregrets the situation that caused the IOC Executive Board to decide on sanctions against Russia for doping violations.\u201dThe absence of athletes from Russia \u2014 a winter sports powerhouse \u2014 would represent a major blow to host South Korea, already battling under the shadow of North Korea's nuclear and missile threats.The Games have also been hit by the decision by North America's National Hockey League not to allow its athletes to attend, and lukewarm interest in South Korea.The Pyeongchang organising committee said Wednesday it would prefer if Russians competed under their own flag, but accepted as \u201csecond-best\u201d the decision to allow their participation as neutrals.

We are currently investigating the nature of the incident and, as a result, we are stopping all operations for the next 24 hours,\" the marketplace said in a statement late on Wednesday. \n\"Importantly, our payment system was compromised and the contents of the NiceHash Bitcoin wallet have been stolen. We are working to verify the precise number of BTC taken,\" it added. \nCoindesk reported on Thursday that the loss is about 4,736.42 Bitcoins, worth more than $60 million. \n\"Are we going to get our btc? or might as well just forget it. Your press release said nothing about sending us what you owe. I have 4000$ stuck in your wallet which is now almost 4300$,\" tweeted a user named Lohit. \nAnother NiceHash user Philip Richardson tweeted: \"If I dont get my btc back i will never use your service again\". \nEarlier in the day, the value of one Bitcoin had crossed $14,000, a new record high for the cryptocurrency. \nBitcoins are created through a complex computer process known as mining, and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. \nA steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins are created a day - with about 16.5 million now in circulation from a maximum limit of 21 million, BBC reported. \n\"Clearly, this is a matter of deep concern and we are working hard to rectify the matter in the coming days. In addition to undertaking our own investigation, the incident has been reported to the relevant authorities and law enforcement and we are co-operating with them as a matter of urgency,\" NiceHash said. \nThe company recommends users to change their passwords - both on NiceHash and other services. \nThe incident brings back the memories of the 2014 implosion of the \"mtGox\" Bitcoin marketplace which lead to losses of millions of dollars. \nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) this week cautioned the \"users, holders and traders\" of Bitcoins about the security related risks associated in dealing with such virtual currencies (VCs). \nThe apex bank reiterated its stand that \"it has not given any licence or authorisation to any entity or company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoin or any VC\". \n\"In the wake of significant spurt in the valuation of many VCs and rapid growth in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), RBI reiterates the concerns,\" the central bank said in a statement. \n--IANS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicehash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip richardson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nicehash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ians", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:38.040+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1d714434ea88f2c417ca4462937dbbc2e9440ef5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvDGYY.k3ke23OTAyEaLF9yTeXLdqDHM93YxwH6DiLxeNp9cjCKNdUpZ0wRRjl1vhbhiir2iVFYS0B4mnAOr8zyG0XlA8lo3f_QNOv6HlLtOhFPKyAqPOx.1r.jK_m5NlYrfaVdDcrGwIOGgjX3XJb91STjR0EI7G41SYOLayUImE-", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "Revere Bank : Customer Up to Date Laundry Opens New Baltimore Facility", "title_full": "Revere Bank : Customer Up to Date Laundry Opens New Baltimore Facility", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a08e95c06464f53ca7dd5eb55c83a46f9c9dcd9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvDGYY.k3ke23OTAyEaLF9yTeXLdqDHM93YxwH6DiLxeNp9cjCKNdUpZ0wRRjl1vhbhiir2iVFYS0B4mnAOr8zyG0XlA8lo3f_QNOv6HlLtOiqiMJyAJkrmg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Revere Bank : Customer Up to Date Laundry Opens New Baltimore Facility", "text": "December 6, 2017 \nRevere Bank congratulates Up to Date Laundry on the opening of its new Baltimore facility.

Bayliss admitted Stokes\u2019 potential appearance in Australia could be a distraction for the team. \u201cWhenever he comes back that\u2019s going to be a bit of a circus for sure,\u201d he told reporters after England lost the second Test in Adelaide on Wednesday. \u201cWhether it\u2019s any more of a circus than it\u2019s already been, it\u2019s hard to say. If it happens, let\u2019s just get on with it and take it on the chin.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to adjust to that at some stage.\u201d New Zealand-born Stokes did not travel to Australia with the rest of the squad for the Ashes Test series, and has missed the first two in Brisbane and Adelaide, with England losing both. But speculation that he is preparing for a dramatic call-up was fuelled by his decision to sign with New Zealand provincial side Canterbury as their overseas player in late November. In his first limited overs match for his birth province against Otago, he was bowled for two. He did better against Auckland on Wednesday, hitting 34 from 41 deliveries as he shakes off the rust. No idea Stokes could yet return mid-series to the Ashes if police decide not to charge him. British detectives late last month passed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service for a decision, but there has been no word since. \u201cI\u2019ve got absolutely no idea. Still waiting for the police report,\u201d said Bayliss when asked if he expected Stokes to play in the Ashes. The England Cricket Board said in their statement on Thursday that once they receive formal confirmation on whether Stokes has been charged or not, they would meet within 48 hours to decide the next step. Hales, an opener who has not played any professional cricket since the September nightclub incident, learned this week that he will face no criminal charges, opening the door for his trip to Australia. In addition to Stokes and Hales, Kent batsman Sam Billings and Durham seamer Mark Wood were added to the squad that beat the West Indies 4-0 in the one-day series held in England at the end of the British summer. \u201cWith around 18 months to the start of the 2019 World Cup, our ODI side continues to make solid progress with series wins over the West Indies and South Africa last summer and a semi-final berth in the Champions Trophy,\u201d said selector James Whitaker. \u201cThe forthcoming series against Australia presents another significant opportunity for this group to showcase their skills and talent against a quality side away from home.\u201d England one-day squad: Eoin Morgan (capt), Moeen Ali, Jonathan Bairstow, Jake Ball, Sam Billings, Jos Buttler, Tom Curran, Alex Hales, Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Jason Roy, Ben Stokes, David Willey, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood Schedule: 1st ODI -

Many research projects have already implicated this protein in both tumor-promotive and suppressive functions, but its exact role remained elusive. By examining macrophages at the sites of metastases, the scientists have now described the \u2018anti-metastatic surveillance\u2019 role of Caveolin-1 for the first time. The new paper, published in the leading scientific journal Cell Reports, was conducted by a team led by prof. Massimiliano Mazzone (VIB-KU Leuven). His lab has been focusing on the tumor microenvironment for some time now, gradually disentangling topics such as tumor oxygen shortage, angiogenesis (the formation of blood vessels) and macrophages (a type of white blood cell) and anti-cancer immunity. This fundamental groundwork has now been stimulated by a European ERC grant on metabolic immunoregulation in cancer and tumor immunotherapy. The gatekeepers of our lungs While the role of tumor-associated macrophages at each step of cancer progression is already well-established, the biology of \u2018metastasis-associated macrophages\u2019, their counterparts at the sites of cancer metastases, has been almost neglected. Understanding this field, however, is of the utmost relevance, as metastases cause no less than 90% of human cancer deaths.In this research, the team describes for the first time the mechanism of Caveolin-1 in metastatic macrophages. They saw that upregulation of this protein in the lung environment clearly hinders metastatic growth.Prof. Mazzone (VIB-KU Leuven): \u201cA surprising outcome, since macrophages are traditionally associated with cancer progression. But at the same time, the anti-metastatic, patrolling function of Caveolin-1 makes sense when one considers the relevance of the immune system in the lungs as the first barrier against (inhaled) pathogens and external bodies. You could say Caveolin-1 is a gatekeeper: high expression can protect the body against foreign bodies and diseases, while downregulation is prometastatic.\u201d Caveolin-1 as a gatekeeper Previous studies already associated the loss of Caveolin-1 with more aggressive proliferation \u2013 and worse patient outcomes \u2013 in several types of cancer. Prof. Mazzone\u2019s findings directly confirm the suggestion that this protein may yield promising therapeutic perspectives.Prof. Mazzone (VIB-KU Leuven): \u201cWe have now learned that there is a huge difference in immunity at the metastasis compared to the primary tumor. And since metastasis is what kills most cancer patients, this research avenue deserves much more attention \u2013 which describes perfectly the direction of our next research projects!\u201d Note: The lab of Massimiliano Mazzone is part of the VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mazzone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massimiliano mazzone", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "leuven center for cancer biology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leuven", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leuven center", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:39.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e9c95dba9e1a7f672a0c3870f97fb48dd69755e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQkK7aUqeqwE6FcBfT4kcWNyUu8A3UnG6Jh3lGSPuxYmVcmBZukQh5lzy64Zh62EF._UglSvKEoNnoVfCU7VFsV4tSYKuAIgjyvOmbgW0XCKJTQ23ltO2NRtsyhtL_rKUgfQclVeBC9u74FTrraqm7YMCqqOa_xpM8JX3v3gAgEWEpz6y9ng45B4qhie97st9k-", "site_full": "www.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Twitterati Tried To Beat Priyanka Chopra's Unread Emails Count & As Expected, Failed Terribly! - Indiatimes.com", "title_full": "Twitterati Tried To Beat Priyanka Chopra's Unread Emails Count & As Expected, Failed Terribly! - Indiatimes.com", "published": "2017-12-07T09:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.034, "main_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2017/Dec/pc_1512627512_800x420.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2506, "comments": 0, "shares": 2506}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e9c95dba9e1a7f672a0c3870f97fb48dd69755e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQkK7aUqeqwE6FcBfT4kcWNyUu8A3UnG6Jh3lGSPuxYmVcmBZukQh5lzy64Zh62EF._UglSvKEoNnoVfCU7VFsV4tSYKuAIgjyvOmbgW0XCKJTQ23ltO2NRtsyhtL_rKUgfQclVeBC9u74FTrraqm7YMCqqOa_xpM8JX3v3gAgEWEpz6y9ng45B4qhie97st9k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Twitterati Tried To Beat Priyanka Chopra's Unread Emails Count & As Expected, Failed Terribly! - Indiatimes.com", "text": "December 07, 2017 661 SHARES \nGlobal icon Priyanka Chopra has been an integral part of Bollywood and the West.

Hence in many jurisdictions, the wilful termination of the life of a human being by another human being is viewed as a grievous offence. The common law at its early stage viewed such a killing as so serious that it was hardly excusable. Except in a few cases, the very fact of causing the death of a human being is already an imputable crime even where one did not intend or foresee death as the result of one\u2019s conduct. It was only later that there came to be a distinction between lawful and unlawful homicide. \nAn example of the case I am considering as it happened under the English Law on  the offence of murder is that, the intent to kill or cause grievous harm is sufficient to ground conviction. Hence in the English case of Hyam v. D.P.P, where the \u201caccused jilted by her lover, out of jealousy set her new lover\u2019s house on fire burning her two children to death, and pleading that her only intention was to frighten her out of the neighbourhood, it was held that an intention to cause death or grievous bodily harm is established if it is proven that the accused deliberately and intentionally did an act knowing that it was probable that it would result in the death of or cause grievous bodily harm to the victim, even though he did not desire the result\u201d.    The murder case of Maryam Sanda It is difficult for one who is not a direct eye witness to say what really happened between Bilyaminu of blessed memory and Maryam Sanda on the 19th November 2017, which led to the death of Bilyaminu.  This piece is therefore not meant to predetermine the case as the judge who will be seized of the facts would do, but to highlight the legal issues involved and carry out some legal analysis with a comparative thesis of similar murder cases that occurred in Nigeria in the past. Reliance will be placed on some decided cases in order to contextualize the murder of Bilyaminu. It is to be stated from the onset that whatever opinion expressed here outside the law is that of the writer and should therefore not form the basis of any legal projection of the outcome of the case against Maryam Sanda. \nThe gamuts of the story have been pieced together from social and other print media. And so the significant part of the story is that a murder was allegedly committed on the 19th November 2017. In order to recap the story, I have relied on the online report of The Nigeria Lawyer ( the  nigerialawyer.com ) . It reported that the police arraigned before a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Jabi, Abuja on charges of culpable homicide, Maryam Sanda, for allegedly stabbing her husband, Bilyaminu Bello Halliru. The charges came under Section 221 for \u201cCulpable homicide punishable with death\u201d and causing \u201cgrievous bodily hurt\u201d under Section240 (g) of the Penal Code Law. It was said that Maryam stabbed her husband in the chest with a \u201cbroken bottle\u201d as against the initial and other unconfirmed allegation that the stabbing was with a knife. On her plea in court, Maryam has been said to plead not guilty and thus has put the onerous burden of proving her guilt on the prosecution. She has also triggered the constitutional presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Without looking at the morality, emotional, sentimental and cultural dimension of the incident because the law does not necessarily consider all those factors when it is in motion; this is also notwithstanding the fact that human beings are the necessary players in the temple of Justice. \nWhile I am not in a position to recount the gruesome incident of the 19th of November 2017 between late Bilyaminu and accused Maryam, one has to look at all the legal ramifications of the matter. Since both Maryam Sanda and Late Bilyaminu Bello Halilu are or were of the Islamic faith, albeit, whether they have deep knowledge of the Shariah or not, I will consider the implication of the murder in the Islamic perspective. What are the legal issues involved?\nThis will entail considering the following laws:\n1.      The provisions of the Penal Code Law under which Maryam is being\ncharged \u2013 Sections 221 and 240;\n2.      The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended);\n3.      The Law of Evidence.\nApart from the foregoing, the court will have to consider the demeanor of the accused and the conduct of the prosecution in all ramifications.\n\nConsideration of the Laws\nThe Penal Code Law:\nOFFENCES AFFECTING THE HUMAN BODY\n\nOffences affecting Life\n\nSections\n\n220. Whoever causes death-\n(a) by doing an act with the intention of causing death or such bodily\ninjury as is likely to cause death; or \n(b) by doing an act with the knowledge that he is likely by such act\nto cause death; or\n(c) by doing a rash or negligent act, commits the offence of culpable homicide.\n221. Except in the circumstances mentioned in section 222 of this Penal Code, culpable homicide shall be punished with death-\n(a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention\nof causing death; or \n(b) if the doer of the act knew or had reason to know that death would be the probable and not only a likely consequence of the act or of any bodily injury which the act was intended to cause. It should be noted that in accordance with the explanations under the Penal Code on Culpable Homicide Punishable with Death, whether death was the probable or only a likely consequence of an act, or of any bodily injury, is a question of fact. 222. (1) Culpable homicide is not punishable with death if the offender whilst deprived of the power of self control by grave and sudden provocation causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. 240. Whoever causes bodily pain, disease or infirmity to a person is said to cause hurt. 241. The following kinds of hurt only are designated as grievous-\n(a) Emasculation;\n(b) Permanent deprivation of the sight of an eye, of the hearing of an ear or the power of speech;\n(c) Deprivation of any member or joint;\n(d) Destruction or permanent impairing of the powers of any member or joint;\n(e) Permanent disfiguration of the head or face;\n(f) Fracture or dislocation of a bone or tooth;\n(g) Any hurt which endangers life or which causes the sufferer to be during the space of twenty days in severe bodily pain or unable to follow this ordinary pursuits. 242. Whoever does an act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to a person or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to a person and does thereby cause hurt to a person is said voluntarily to cause hurt. The Constitution of the Federal republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended)\nSection(s) 33.(1) Every person has a right to life, and no one shall be deprived intentionally of his life, save in execution of the sentence of a court in respect of a criminal offence of which he has been found guilty in Nigeria. (2) A person shall not be regarded as having been deprived of his life in contravention of this section, if he dies as a result of the use, to such extent and in such circumstances as are permitted by law, of such force as is reasonably necessary \u2013 (a) For the defense of any person from unlawful violence or for the defense of property: (b) In order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained; or (c) For the purpose of suppressing a riot, insurrection or mutiny. 35 (2) Any person who is arrested or detained shall have the right to remain silent or avoid answering any question until after consultation with a legal practitioner or any other person of his own choice. (3) Any person who is arrested or detained shall be informed in writing within twenty-four hours (and in a language that he understands) of the facts and grounds for his arrest or detention. (4) Any person who is arrested or detained in accordance with subsection (1) (c) of this section shall be brought before a court of law within a reasonable time, and if he is not tried within a period of \u2013 (a) two months from the date of his arrest or detention in the case of a person who is in custody or is not entitled to bail; or (b) three months from the date of his arrest or detention in the case of a person who has been released on bail, he shall (without prejudice to any further proceedings that may be brought against him) be released either unconditionally or upon such conditions as are reasonably necessary to ensure that he appears for trial at a later date. (5) In subsection (4) of this section, the expression \"a reasonable\ntime\" means -\n(a) in the case of an arrest or detention in any place where there is a court of competent jurisdiction within a radius of forty kilometres, a period of one day; and (b) In any other case, a period of two days or such longer period as in the circumstances may be considered by the court to be reasonable. 36(5) Every person who is charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty; Provided that nothing in this section shall invalidate any law by reason only that the law imposes upon any such person the burden of proving particular facts. (6) Every person who is charged with a criminal offence shall be entitled to -\n(a) be informed promptly in the language that he understands and in detail of the nature of the offence; (b) Be given adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defense; (c) Defend himself in person or by legal practitioners of his own choice; (d) examine, in person or by his legal practitioners, the witnesses called by the prosecution before any court or tribunal and obtain the attendance and carry out the examination of witnesses to testify on his behalf before the court or tribunal on the same conditions as those applying to the witnesses called by the prosecution; and (e) have, without payment, the assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand the language used at the trial of the offence.\n\nThe Law of Evidence\nThe facts of the case;\nInvestigation processes by the police;\nThe evidence relied upon, whether direct, confessional statement or circumstantial;\nBurden and Standard of Proof;\nWitnesses and examination/cross-examination of such witnesses;\nHearsay evidence;\nOpinion and Expert evidence;\nForensic evidence.\nAll the above cited provisions of the relevant laws are easy to read and understand and quite self explanatory and so much time will not be spent here to explain each provision.\n\nApplication of the cited provisions of the laws to the case of Maryam Sanda\nSince Maryam Sanda has been charged under the above cited provisions of the Penal Code Law; and in view of the fact that under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, she is presumed innocent until proven guilty, the case will have to be determined based on the very cogent, convincing, and compelling evidence that will be tendered in court by the Prosecution.  In other words, the entire case depends on the investigation carried out by the Police, the chain of evidence, which must not lose any link and how well the case is presented before the presiding Judge, who as we all know is not a magician or an eye witness. This kind of case succeeds or fails on the weight of evidence adduced by the prosecution and the inability of the lawyers defending Maryam to impinge or debunk the evidence. From the 19th November 2017 that the incident occurred, the place of the incident ought to have been declared a crime scene and sealed off in order to allow the investigating police to gather as much evidence as possible from the crime scene, like the murder weapon if any and finger prints on potential weapons. Such evidence gathering will include the statement of the accused, interviews of people around if there were witnesses, and if no eye witness or witnesses, then the prosecution will be working on circumstantial evidence and lots of presumptions. Circumstantial evidence is fraught with its own problem and is usually very difficult to use, because there must not be any missing link in the connection of the chain of evidence. \nInterestingly, Maryam has been said to plead not guilty of the offence of culpable homicide, which presupposes that she intends to exculpate herself using the same circumstantial evidence. It also debunked the initial unconfirmed news that she had confessed, through a confessional statement, to the murder of Bilyaminu. This development set the foundation for a hard and long legal battle between the\nProsecution and the Defense. One then wonders that having pleaded not guilty, what will be her defense for the murder if indeed she committed the murder based on the prima facie case that may establish the fact that it was her and no  other person committed the murder? As it is shown in the listing of requirements to ground a conviction of Maryam under Section 221 of the Penal Code, the Prosecution must prove the case beyond reasonable doubts, and what constitute reasonable doubts have been defined over the years through judicial pronouncements. Where are there are doubts, more so that the case will depend so much on circumstantial evidence, the case will be resolved in favour of Maryam Sanda. There are no rooms for mere suspicion or hearsay facts or evidence. They must be concrete prove without any iota of reasonable doubts. Because of the religious inclinations of Maryam and Bilyaminu, most of the sources of evidence would have been disposed, especially the non-delay or prompt burial of Bilyaminu in accordance with Islamic injunctions. In other words, no autopsy or post mortem examination would have been conducted, to determine the actual cause of death. The murder weapon would have been tampered with before the arrival of the investigating police and so many other mishandling of the crime scene. To make matters worse, Maryam at the trial may elect not to testify on her behalf, a situation which our Constitution protects or guaranteed. But depending on the circumstances of the case, this may be counter-productive. These and so many other factors, stacks against the deceased who is not around to state his own case against that of Maryam Sanda. Here lays the difficulty in our law in Nigeria which is based on the Common Law model of England. He who alleges must prove. Islamic Law Perspective of the Incident. \n\nOn this perspective, I will place copious reliance on the judgment of Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, J.S.C. in the case of Abubakar Dan Shalla Versus The state, decided on 5th October 2004 at the Supreme Court, where he retorted, citing Islamic text, that The Prophet (SAW) is reported to have said that the first action to be judged on the Day of Judgment is the spilling of blood. (see Bulugh Al - Maram Min Adiilatil Ahkam by Asqalani, page 244). In another Hadith, he is\nreported to have said that three things have been made illegal to a Muslim:\n\n(i)     to spill the blood of another or deprive him of his life\n\n(ii)    to deprive him of his property and\n\n(iii)   to deprive him of his honour or integrity\n\n(See Forty Traditions of Imam An-Nawawi).\n\nConclusion\nOne hopes that from the abundance of precedents that abound on similar cases in the past, the prosecution will do its job and do it effectively well, devoid of the corruption that has permeated the fabric of police and the Judiciary. And if this case goes in the direction that is unexpected despite the overwhelming evidence to ground conviction or otherwise, the final comfort, as Muslims lies in the knowledge that on judgment day in the afterlife, the first action to be judged on the Day of Judgment is the spilling of blood. Perhaps that may be the consolation of the family of the late Bilyaminu at the end of it all, where the State fails in its\nresponsibility of ensuring that Justice has been served and adequately seen to have been served.\nAbayomi Oyelola, MNI\nLegal Practitioner and Public Commentator ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maryam sanda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryam sanda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asqalani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bilyaminu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulugh al - maram min adiilatil ahkam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibrahim tanko muhammad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imam an-nawawi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jabi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abayomi oyelola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bilyaminu bello halliru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abubakar dan shalla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mni legal practitioner and public commentator", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standard of proof", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal capital territory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.s.c.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "federal republic of nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bilyaminu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abuja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:40.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "98ff7975b260b4c77a2a8d363c6ab4c0ffaae396", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacec8eKQjvRxmC9mYqVaGOjgIW_owINjDI2V_2j9GonDA-", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/phones", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Phones - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "HTC One M7 ( Almost New, No Scratch or Dent)", "title_full": "HTC One M7 ( Almost New, No Scratch or Dent) - Phones - Nigeria", "published": "2017-12-04T10:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.037, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4890207c6e6acd4b63b7c8a7a361077fcd9ae38c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacec8eKQjvRxmC9mYqVaGOjgIW_owINjDIUhI_k1makLzt2_YufvE7jA--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "armylord", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Location, got 22k", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:40.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd5926deaa2b2a0298b3ed03d675263a9f20f113", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRDTIB6K9NX2OCyPw2gAZWYRNar8Jg9lq6pRh0S1TV6F9pS7slnMQYjqtjS2Y_6gSnVSF1pCyDsx2cv_gs4IRA0OjW.gZt6IXeOe5DGxEZnvdahBUtINafR87sga8D0GTbB0m66IEGigA--", "site_full": "www.lollipuff.com", "site": "lollipuff.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.lollipuff.com/LollipuffListings", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Lollipuff Listings", "title": "Auction: New without tags Herve Leger black jacquard inserts dress size S", "title_full": "Auction: New without tags Herve Leger black jacquard inserts dress size S", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd5926deaa2b2a0298b3ed03d675263a9f20f113", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRDTIB6K9NX2OCyPw2gAZWYRNar8Jg9lq6pRh0S1TV6F9pS7slnMQYjqtjS2Y_6gSnVSF1pCyDsx2cv_gs4IRA0OjW.gZt6IXeOe5DGxEZnvdahBUtINafR87sga8D0GTbB0m66IEGigA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Auction: New without tags Herve Leger black jacquard inserts dress size S", "text": "  E n d s S o o n !

In the latest findings, scientists have come across what they say, \"by far the most complete skeleton of a human ancestor older than 1.5 million years ever found.\" The University of the Witwatersrand displayed the virtually complete Australopithecus fossil on Wednesday. The skeleton dates back 3.6 million years. Its discovery is expected to help researchers better understand the human ancestor's appearance and movement. \nAP \nThe researchers say it has taken 20 years to excavate, clean, reconstruct and analyse the fragile skeleton. The skeleton, dubbed Little Foot, was discovered in the Sterkfontein caves, about 40 kilometers northwest of Johannesburg when small foot bones were found in rock blasted by miners. \nProfessor Ron Clarke and his assistants found the fossils and spent years to excavate, clean, analyze and reconstruct the skeleton. The discovery is a source of pride for Africans, said Robert Blumenschine, chief scientist with the organization that funded the excavation, the Paleontological Scientific Trust (PAST). \n\"Not only is Africa the storehouse of the ancient fossil heritage for people the world over, it was also the wellspring of everything that makes us human, including our technological prowess, our artistic ability and our supreme intellect,\" said Blumenschine. \nAdam Habib, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Witswatersrand, hailed the assembly of the full skeleton. \n\"This is a landmark achievement for the global scientific community and South Africa's heritage,\" said Habib. \"It is through important discoveries like Little Foot that we obtain a glimpse into our past which helps us to better understand our common humanity.\" Don't Miss ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "blumenschine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "habib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam habib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron clarke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert blumenschine", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of witswatersrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of the witwatersrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sterkfontein", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:40.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fca1f5744375755a80ad3db4c70a78f36f339994", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRb2ySgZMJK1I8Fa3KOTjmcSExPEN3knsgpRK4uzoD3iSGzHv2Z6gUu3T2ZCjvPq.cItyo9NEeyCpdh1kQOyUfOFyhXr0MMv5qLf3H5Ag4p93BlcPCT1s7Uipw3hJCvxYI-", "site_full": "www.worldcement.com", "site": "worldcement.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/WorldCement", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "World Cement", "title": "Adelaide Brighton signs new energy contracts", "title_full": "Adelaide Brighton signs new energy contracts", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/contract-01.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fca1f5744375755a80ad3db4c70a78f36f339994", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRb2ySgZMJK1I8Fa3KOTjmcSExPEN3knsgpRK4uzoD3iSGzHv2Z6gUu3T2ZCjvPq.cItyo9NEeyCpdh1kQOyUfOFyhXr0MMv5qLf3H5Ag4p93BlcPCT1s7Uipw3hJCvxYI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "Adelaide Brighton signs new energy contracts", "text": "Adelaide Brighton signs new energy contracts Adelaide Brighton signs new energy contracts \nSave to read list Thursday, 07 December 2017 09:24 Advertisement \nAustralian cement maker, Adelaide Brighton, has signed new gas and electricity contracts in South Australia.

Acorn, or Snowbud, gets its name from its shapely nugs \u0096 they are lumpy and dense with a noticeably acornish shape and a thick coating of frosty milky white crystal trichomes. Each nug is dotted with bright fiery orange hairs that are coated with sweet sticky resin droplets. The Acorn high is one that is long-lasting with lazy effects that can leave you sleepy and couch-locked for hours on end with no hope of moving. The high starts with a happy lift that boosts your mood without affecting your energy level before lulling you into dreamy introspection and absolute laziness. With these nighttime effects and its powerful 25-26% average THC level, Acorn is the perfect choice for patients suffering from conditions such as chronic pain, appetite loss, insomnia, inflammation, and depression. Acorn has a sweet earthy flavor accented by a sharp kick of spicy hash and a skunky pungency upon exhale. The aroma is very sweet and herbal with earthy skunky hints and a touch of spicy hash and pepper.\nIndoor grow\nOutsunny 4x4x6.5 grow tent\nMARSII 1200W LED for Veg and Bloom\nHydro grow with Expanded clay pellets soaked in PH water for 24hrs before placing in the 2 gallon growing chambers, Rockwell for seedling.\nGeneral Hydroponics GH4120 Waterfarm times 4 (not sure if I will make a controller/reservoir and link all 4 kits together I will update if I do)\nI have made a couple of upgrades to the Waterfarm\n1. drill more and larger holes in the bottom of the 2-gallon growing chamber\n2.

Najib did not hint at a date in his speech but speculation is swirling that they will be take place early next year.Najib\u2019s chances of winning a third term have been dented by explosive graft allegations. Billions were looted from a sovereign wealth fund that he founded, 1MDB, in complex overseas deals which are being investigated in several countries. Both Najib and the fund deny any wrongdoing.The US Justice Department has led the charge in tackling the alleged pillaging, launching lawsuits through which it is seeking to recover $1.7 billion in assets thought to have been purchased with looted money.The election race has also been upended by the emergence of elderly former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who led Malaysia for 22 years, as a key figure in the main opposition alliance. Mahathir, 92, has come out of retirement to try to oust the government over the 1MDB scandal, teaming up with his former nemesis, jailed opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.In his speech at the UMNO gathering, the most closely watched event in Malaysia\u2019s political calendar, Najib, 64, accused Mahathir of having \u201ccrossed the line.\u201d\u201cHe has the audacity to unite with his political enemies,\u201d he said.He also warned that if the opposition won the election then Muslim Malays, about 60 per cent of the country\u2019s 32 million people, \u201cwill become homeless and despised in their own country.\u201dUMNO has long championed the Malay cause in a country that is home to substantial ethnic and religious minorities, and has enshrined policies that favour them.Despite the challenges, most observers believe that Najib and the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition will edge another victory in the elections.Agence France-Presse", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "najib r", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir mohamad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anwar ibrahim.in", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united malays national organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barisan nasional coalition", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:41.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ed1ed45bc555d6883677c9438a6b992a7972fb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzhjY9exanv2MBxfwU7LNnKGGSEDjBF_o9zQpoHI1YgwLW.vLwilryuZuGD30UxnGV5pa0gb.xTnx5Zn9hMZxogKGIK.tbTyadnVHtSoLaymyJ7Ox7fjOC80B.cEde4oS5WMOo.MSWaPDt99TEnhNQ2", "site_full": "food.ndtv.com", "site": "ndtv.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["cocktails_beer", "food", "barbecues_and_grilling", "food_allergies", "health", "herbs_for_health", "italian_cuisine"], "section_title": "", "title": "Atta, Nuts and Oodles of Ghee, Punjabs Pinni is All Things Winter-y and Decadent - NDTV Food", "title_full": "Atta, Nuts and Oodles of Ghee, Punjabs Pinni is All Things Winter-y and Decadent - NDTV Food", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.146, "main_image": "https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-12/pinni_620x350_61512641125.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 306, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 61, "comments": 0, "shares": 61}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ed1ed45bc555d6883677c9438a6b992a7972fb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzhjY9exanv2MBxfwU7LNnKGGSEDjBF_o9zQpoHI1YgwLW.vLwilryuZuGD30UxnGV5pa0gb.xTnx5Zn9hMZxogKGIK.tbTyadnVHtSoLaymyJ7Ox7fjOC80B.cEde4oS5WMOo.MSWaPDt99TEnhNQ2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sushmita Sengupta", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Atta, Nuts and Oodles of Ghee, Punjabs Pinni is All Things Winter-y and Decadent - NDTV Food", "text": "Atta, Nuts And Oodles Of Ghee, Punjab's Pinni Is All Things Winter-y And Decadent Atta, Nuts and Oodles of Ghee, Punjab's Pinni is All Things Winter-y and Decadent Sushmita Sengupta | Updated: December 07, 2017 15:36 IST Tweeter Winters are finally here!

A tte ki Pinni has to be the easiest and most common form of pinni you would find in Punjab and other parts of North India. Made by cooking flour in ghee, sugar and milk on low flame, in a heavy bottom pan or kadhai , the pinni mixture is stirred continuously till it turns brown in colour and starts giving out a pleasant aroma. Pinni is also loaded with oodles of nuts like green cardamom, cashew, almonds and raisins which makes the dessert even more loaded and flavoursome. Ghee is an essential part of every winter dessert, it helps keep the body warm from within. You may need to add some more milk gradually if your pinnis are turning out to be dry and crumbly. Milk helps bind the mixture so pour it slowly until you feel that the mixture has found the right consistency. Allow the mixture to cool and start moulding.Here's a delicious recipe of Atte ki Pinni by Ashwini that will help you churn out these delicious warming delight in the corners of your kitchen.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "punjabs pinni", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ood", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "atta", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ashwini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atte ki pinni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panjiri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ndtv food atta", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pinni", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "punjab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:41.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c3743179e6f9788e93714ef1bb165191901dfb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4Lzrr.7U8XsXwPXKOVYcof3EtIjBm7gpS4lC_Fy2iY_opCR0z94ZhyulF", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/in/temple-on-ganges.en-gb.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hotel Temple On Ganges, Varanasi, India - Booking.com ", "title": "211 Verified Hotel Reviews of Hotel Temple On Ganges | Booking.com", "title_full": "211 Verified Hotel Reviews of Hotel Temple On Ganges | Booking.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 37, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://t-ec.bstatic.com/static/img/facebook-image-else/566c7081f1deeaca39957e96365c3908f83b95af.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 105, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c3743179e6f9788e93714ef1bb165191901dfb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4Lzrr.7U8XsXwPXKOVYcof3EtIjBm7gpS4lC_Fy2iY_opCR0z94ZhyulF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Andreas", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Good because of location.

ScumBags.\nI'm not sure if the Bell and Telus partnership is breaking down a bit quicker than in the past. Back then it was the Telco against the Cableco. Telus and Bell share cell towers to gain full country coverage to upstage Rogers. Bell might be shifting away from that sharing agreement, as both Telus and Bell are showing up as standalone towers in each others regions (bigger cities first).\nTelus with their TV service is kind of screwed. Bell sets the cost/rules of access to what is mostly rebroadcast U.S. content. And Telus can't just substitute the U.S. feed, due to the long line of assholes known as the Heritage Commissioner, who falsely thinks Canadian TV commercials (ad revenue) have something to do with heritage.\nIPTV, after a few years of large gains of many subscribers from the Cableco TV, are seeing their market gain flatten out for new IPTV customers. There was an article that I glanced across several months ago, that IPTV is actually a money loser (aside from Internet signups) for Bell and Telus, due to the cost of hardware subsidy.\nTelus article (two sections) from March 2013. Vertical Integration and Bell the Shithole of Canada.\n\u00bb blog.telus.com/public-po \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 nadians/ The average consumer has no idea what vertical integration means, let alone why he or she should be concerned about it. But that doesn\u2019t make vertical integration in the broadcasting and telecommunications markets any less of a threat to Canadians.\nVertical integration generally means ownership by one company of more than one element of the production or supply chain of a good or service. It\u2019s like owning the factory that makes potato chips and also the grocery store that sells them. Maybe also the farm that grows the potatoes to make the chips.\nIn the broadcasting industry, the chain includes the \u201cproduction company\u201d which creates \u201cprogramming\u201d, the \u201cprogramming service\u201d which aggregates the programming and the \u201cdistribution service\u201d which provides access via cable, satellite or IPTV to programming services by the ultimate consumer. The CRTC has been grappling with concerns related to vertical integration in the broadcasting industry for the past few years after it approved the huge acquisition by Shaw Cable of the many programming services owned by the former Canwest Global and then shortly thereafter the equally significant, if not more so, acquisition by Bell of the many programming services owned by the former CTVglobemedia.\nThe CRTC has recognized that vertical integration in the broadcasting industry can be harmful to competition and therefore to consumers, and that\u2019s why it has adopted many safeguards as part of a new policy framework. The CRTC\u2019s regulatory framework related to vertical integration can be found here. The CRTC was also sufficiently concerned with the market power that would result from too much vertical integration that it denied Bell\u2019s attempt to acquire Astral Media last October.\nAll of these deficiencies in the current safeguards relating to vertical integration further erode the protection of consumers against the harm caused by abuse of market power by the large vertically integrated broadcasting and telecommunications companies.\nThe CRTC has thus far treated vertical integration as a broadcasting issue but ultimately it is much more than that. Vertically integration in Canada has far reaching effects, much further than mere television distribution. That is because those same vertically integrated companies in the broadcasting sector are also Canada\u2019s biggest telecommunications providers.\nCanada has an internationally admired model of platform competition that has seen world leading deployments of fibre to the node, gigabit passive optical networks, DOCSIS 3.0, high speed packet access (HSPA), high speed packet access plus (HSPA+) and long term evolution (LTE) wireless deployments to ensure that Canada remains at the vanguard of technology. Continued investment by these private companies is vital to the success of Canada\u2019s economy.

A dinosaur, named Halszkaraptor escuilliei, a turkey-sized, bird-like dinosaur that boasted a swan\u2019s neck, arms resembling flippers, long legs and a mouth full of needle-like teeth staked out a unique amphibious lifestyle in rivers and lakes about 75 million years ago in Mongolia is seen in this artist\u2019s reconstruction image released on December 5, 2017. Courtesy Lukas Panzarin/Handout via REUTERS Scientists on Wednesday described the dinosaur, named Halszkaraptor escuilliei, which walked on two legs on land in an upright ostrich-like posture but spent a lot of time floating atop the water, using its long neck to catch small fish, insects, mollusks and crustaceans. \u201cIt combines different features from different groups of dinosaurs in an unexpected and bizarre mix,\u201d said study lead author Andrea Cau, a paleontologist at the Capellini Geological Museum in Bologna. \u201cIt looks like a mixture between a Velociraptor and a goose.\u201d Its semi-aquatic lifestyle is almost unheard of among dinosaurs. The researchers believe Halszkaraptor, a close cousin of the dinosaur lineage that led to birds, was covered in feathers. But feathers are rarely preserved in fossils and none were found. Compared to birds, its forelimbs were relatively small, and structurally were \u201cdecidedly not wing-like,\u201d said University of Alberta paleontologist Philip Currie, another of the researchers. \u201cIn water, it probably was a slow-moving swimmer, perhaps similar to a swan, and used its forelimbs to maneuver while swimming,\u201d Cau said. The scientists used a sophisticated scanning device called a synchrotron to peer inside solid rock to make out anatomical details of the well-preserved, nearly complete fossil skeleton. \u201cHalszkaraptor was able to run like all dinosaurs, and probably hunted its prey using an ambush strategy that used the long neck to quickly catch small animals. It was also able to swim and hunt in water, using again an ambush strategy thanks to its long and flexible neck,\u201d Cau said. Its snout was low and slender, contributing to its bird-like appearance. \u201cI would guess that it had a lifestyle similar to a shorebird or heron,\u201d Currie said.

Items included a Beaver uniform, badges, achievement books and the mascot for the group. \nCommenting on the group's visit to the Hele Park development, Iris Burrows, Beaver Leader, said: 'We'd like to thank Taylor Wimpey for inviting us to take part in this project. The Beavers were keen to come up with ideas for items to include in the capsule and the project really captured their imaginations. \nMelissa Langton, Sales Manager for Taylor Wimpey Exeter, said: 'We were thrilled to have the Beaver Scouts take part in this project at Hele Park . The capsule has been filled with items that the children wanted to remember, and it was lovely to see them think about how life could be different for people living at the development in the future.

I think I am trying to take those steps to move forward. It can hurt, but every time I feel myself falling to that, I just remember that I can move forward and I can find some solace in other things, and hopefully if i keep plugging away, one day I will find someone who will see the things in me my ex didn't, or i will excel at my work. So I am trying not to be bitter, but making every effort to move forward.\nYeah, I like that she sees that and is giving me that responsibility. I like that I can take it on as well and do it. I hope I can prove myself so that it shows through and then hopefully when something does open up, be it this store or another, I can be offered it and grab it.\nThat's ok. I don't think it came up.

That's why our North Thames team recently donated \u00a3200 towards the Christmas Fair at St George's Catholic Primary School. The event, held on Friday 1st December, was a great success and raised over \u00a34,000, which will be put back into school resources. \nThere was plenty on offer at the fair. With food lovers indulging on everything from waffles to hot dogs and parents stocking up on Christmas presents at the different stands, there was something for everyone. One of the most popular stalls was the raffle where families had the chance to win a \u00a3200 Ticketmaster voucher, funded through our donation. \nPaul Franklin, Chairman of the Parent Staff Association (PSA) , said: 'Without the support of parents and local businesses these events would not be possible, so we're always grateful for the donations we receive. Collectively, our efforts continue to enrich the school, not only in helping obtain much needed equipment for our children, but also by bringing a great community together.

Macron is in Doha for talks with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani on combatting the financing of terrorism at a time the Middle East is locked in a regional power struggle between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran.\nQatar agreed to firm up an option from 2015 to buy 12 more Dassault Aviation-made Rafale fighters, and said it could purchase a further 36. It had already bought 24 planes for about 6 billion euros ($7.11 billion), including missiles.\nThursday's deals also saw Doha commit to buying 490 armoured vehicles from defence firm Nexter, sending a signal to its neighbours after Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut political and trade with Doha in June. They accuse it of supporting terrorism, a charge Qatar denies. \nQatar also said it would buy 50 Airbus  ( >> Airbus SE ) a321neo planes with an option for a further 30 and awarded a French rail consortium, comprised of RATP and SNCF, the contract to build and operate the metro system in the Qatari capital of Doha in a deal estimated at 3 billion euros. \nParis has close commercial and political ties with Qatar and has pushed deeper business interests in the country as well as encouraged Qatari investment in France, where the gas-rich Gulf state already has assets of about $10 billion. \nQatar has drawn closer to Iran and sought to strengthen its military as relations with its neighbours have deteriorated, and signed military equipment deals with the United States, Russia and Britain.\n\n(Reporting by Hameed al-Sayegh and Jean Baptiste-Vey; Writing by John Irish; Editing by Richard Lough)\nStocks treated in this article : Airbus SE , Safran , Dassault Aviation , Suez

of the two mobile cold rooms with processed vegetables ranging from onugbu, ugu, scent leave, utazi among others.\n\nSpeaking to ABS, the President of Grafil, Dr Fuster Ifejiofor, explained that the vegetables were sourced from their farm at Ogbunka, and local farmers from Onono, Osomalla, and other communities in Anambra State.\n\nDr Ifejiofor added that on completion of the loading process, the mobile cold room containers would move to Lagos, where they would be shipped to Europe.\n\nHe added that after sourcing the vegetables, they preserve them in the cold room containers that would runs for twenty four hours a day to avoid decay, noting that the products are well accepted in the international market.\n\nHe urged farmers to work very hard and called on individuals to embrace the moves initiated by Governor Obiano towards agricultural revolution in Anambra as according to him, agriculture is the only guarantee to drive the state economy.\n\nBy Ngozi Obileri", "highlightText": "",
