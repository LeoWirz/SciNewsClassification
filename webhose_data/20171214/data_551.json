Original Issue Discount", "text": "By Danielle Erickson, Manager, Government Reporting Solutions, TD A meritrade December 7, 2017 \nYou pay for what you get. Yep, heard that one before. But have you ever heard the phrase \u201cReport on what you don\u2019t get\u201d? Yeah, I haven\u2019t either, but it applies to this topic, so now it\u2019s a thing! \nFor you bond savvy folks out there, there is a change in place for tax year 2017 that you might want to know about, especially if you invest in securities that have Tax-Exempt Original Issue Discount (OID) . Remember, non-taxable is the not the same as non-reportable. Understanding OID \nSo what exactly is OID? According to the IRS, OID is a form of interest. It is the excess of a debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity over its issue price. \nSince the inception of tax-exempt OID, guidance has been murky regarding how (or if) brokers should be reporting this income type and if so, where. At one point, it was being reported on the 1099-INT in the same box as tax-exempt interest. In 2007, information was given that further direction would be given at a later date. Isn\u2019t that cyclical? \nFor the past 10 years, it has been at the discretion of firms to decide the best course of action. That is, until now. Brokers are now required to report tax-exempt OID for covered securities (purchased after 1/1/2017) on Form 1099-OID. A new box on the 1099 has been created for this income, box 11 and aptly titled Tax-Exempt OID . \nThere is still room for discretion though. If a firm chooses to report non-covered lots, they may. Tax-exempt OID for non-covered lots will not be reported on form 1099 for TD Ameritrade clients. It is always beneficial to have clear guidance from the IRS when it comes to tax reporting. Brokers want to comply just as much as individual tax filers. \nFIGURE 1. FORM 1099- OID: \nReportable tax exempt OID. So What Does This Mean for Me? \nSince brokers used to be able to adjust whether or not tax exempt OID was reportable, you may not have seen this on your previous tax forms. To learn more, take advantage of the resources available to you at no cost. EMMA is a helpful site where you can peruse information, tax statements, and prospectus\u2019 on municipal bonds. And if you need assistance in tax filing, you may visit irs.gov or contact your tax professional. \nStill curious to learn more about OID?

MST December 07, 2017 People celebrate while watching a large television screen as it is announced that same-sex marriage will be legal in Australia with Parliament agreeing to end the ban on same-sex couples marrying on December 7, 2017 in Melbourne, Australia. (Photo: Scott Barbour/Getty Images, 2017 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nCANBERRA, AUSTRALIA - Australia's Parliament voted Thursday to allow same-sex marriage across the nation, following a bitter debate settled by a much-criticized government survey of voters that strongly endorsed change. \nThe public gallery in the House of Representatives erupted with applause when the bill passed. It changes the definition of marriage from solely between a man and a woman to \"a union of two people\" excluding all others. The legislation passed with a majority that wasn't challenged, although five lawmakers registered their opposition. \nThe Senate passed the same legislation last week 43 votes to 12. After royal assent and other formalities, the law will likely take effect in about a month, with the first weddings expected about a month later. \n\n\nChampagne and tears of flowed in the halls of Parliament House as gay celebrities including Olympic champion swimmer Ian Thorpe and actress Magda Szubanski hugged lawmakers and ordinary folk in a party atmosphere. \n\"What an amazing day, I'm a little bit delirious, it's extraordinary,\" said Szubanski, who sat in the public gallery during Thursday's daylong debate. \nThorpe thanked \"our straight brothers and sisters\" for strongly backing marriage equality in the two-month postal survey. \n\"Quite literally without them voting for us, this would never have happened,\" Thorpe said. \n\"It means that we've created an Australia that is more equitable, it's more fair, it's more just,\" he added. \nAmendments meant to safeguard freedoms of speech and religion for gay-marriage opponents were all rejected, though those issues may be considered later. The government has appointed a panel to examine how to safeguard religious freedoms once gay marriage is a reality in Australia. \nLawmakers advocating marriage equality had argued that the national postal survey in November mandated a change of the marriage definition alone, so changing the law should not be delayed by other considerations. \nGay marriage was endorsed by 62 percent of voters who responded to the postal ballot. \n\"It is now our job as members of Parliament to pass a fair bill that does not extend or create any new discriminations,\" an emotional government lawmaker Warren Entsch, who helped draft the bill, told Parliament. \"It is a strong bill that already strikes the right balance between equality and freedom of religion.\" \n\"It's an historic day for Australia today and I think the celebrations around the country when we finally ... achieve marriage equality are going to be immense,\" Janet Rice said before the vote. Rice is a minor Greens party senator who was only able to remain married to her transgender wife of 31 years, Penny, because Penny remained listed as male on her birth certificate. \nPenny Wong, an opposition Labor Party senator who has two children with her lesbian partner, said, \"I am feeling happy.\" \nMost gay rights advocates believed the government should have allowed marriages years ago and saw various ideas for a public survey as a delaying tactic. The U.N. Human Rights Committee had called the ballot survey \"an unnecessary and divisive public opinion poll.\" \nThe current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from anti-discrimination laws. \nOne of the rejected amendments would have ensured Australians could speak freely about their traditional views of marriage without fear of legal action. It was proposed by Attorney-General George Brandis and supported by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, both gay marriage supporters. \nFormer Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a high-profile advocate of traditional marriage, told Parliament that Turnbull and opposition leader Bill Shorten had failed to deliver detailed protections for freedoms of speech, conscience and religion in the bill. \n\"A promise was made by the leaders of this Parliament and the promise has not adequately been delivered on,\" Abbott said. \nAbbott pointed to an Australian teenager who lost her job for advocating against gay marriage on social media and an Australian Catholic bishop who was taken before a state anti-discrimination tribunal over a pamphlet he published extolling traditional marriage. The complaint against the bishop was dropped. \n\"The last thing we should want to do is to subject Australians to new forms of discrimination in place of old ones that are rightly gone,\" he said. \nGovernment lawmaker Trevor Evans ruled out an Australian equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court case in which a baker who refused to provide a wedding cake for a gay couple argued he was exercising artistic freedom and was exempt from Colorado anti-discrimination laws. \n\"Let's be honest here, for a case like that to arise in Australia, it would require a gay couple who care more about activism than about the success of their own wedding, to find a business operator who cares more about religious doctrine than the commercial success of their own small business, and for both of them to commit to having a fight,\" Evans told Parliament. \n\"Typical Australians would genuinely question the bona fides of the players in a case like that and the slim prospects of that occurring doesn't warrant the pages and pages of commentary and debate that have been dedicated to it,\" he added. \nSeveral gay marriage opponents in Turnbull's conservative coalition have regarded marriage equality as inevitable and have welcomed an end to an issue that has long divided the government ranks. \nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann, a same-sex marriage opponent who oversaw the postal ballot, said he felt \"great satisfaction\" that the issue was resolved. \n\"It was a polarizing issue on which good Australians had strongly and sincerely held views on both sides of the argument,\" Cormann said. \nThe result is a political win for Turnbull, who became prime minister after deposing Abbott in 2015 in an internal government leadership ballot. \nAbbott was head-butted by a gay rights advocate during the postal survey campaign in September. Kevin Rudd, a center-left Labor Party prime minister whom Abbott defeated in elections in 2013, blamed the postal ballot for an assault on his 19-year-old godson as he campaigned for marriage equality a week earlier. \nVeteran gay rights campaigner Rodney Croome said he expected the first same-sex weddings in Australia would not take place until February. \nThe law will likely take effect after a month. State laws then require couples to give 28 days' notice of their intention to marry, Croome said. \n\u00a9 2017 Associated Press ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rod mcguirk", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penny wong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill shorten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thorpe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet rice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "croome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodney croome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott barbour/getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "szubanski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mathias cormann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren entsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magda szubanski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin rudd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian thorpe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cormann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "australian parliament", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labor party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n. human rights committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:14.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebd1bdb37f016bffae706213a874d973a8c5ee2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRBjhW88byoNjGPpTea4iWS_Lu6Fj6tCivyKdQRoI7G.J3_Bih4W6O_qucuMWFYWn4-", "site_full": "www.prakard.com", "site": "prakard.com", "site_section": "https://www.prakard.com/viewforum.php?f=640", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "The Parkland Grand Asoke-Phetchaburi - Prakard", "title": "-- For Rent (\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e32)-- The Parkland Grand Asoke (1 Bedroom 35 sqm) Floor 22 --> 16,000, Baht/month", "title_full": "-- For Rent (\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e32)-- The Parkland Grand Asoke (1 Bedroom 35 sqm) Floor 22 --> 16,000, Baht/month - Prakard", "published": "2017-11-14T03:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "HK", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 55300, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "83ce82dacc6ef34b2a68ef871456049678216d8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRBjhW88byoNjGPpTea4iWS_Lu6Fj6tCivyKdQRoI7G.J3_Bih4W6O_kLvVvHw1jW4iUyI14GlGNg--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Phakin_T", "published": "2017-12-06T10:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Re: -- For Rent (\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e32)-- The Parkland Grand Asoke (1 Bedroom 35 sqm) Floor 22 --> 16,000, Baht/month Quote: Post by Phakin_T \u00bb 06 Dec 2017 16:19\n\u0e22\u0e49\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22 \u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e48\u0e21\u0e40\u0e15\u0e34\u0e21\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:15.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f91263f1b06b40cce33d296722000e7b67b56b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pfguUTHYhAEG0HOSllNMFzI3EpgQr3WCg", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/sci/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/sci/ - Science &amp;

Look Here! - Everything you need to know about Baseball", "text": "TOPICS: batting helmets Posted By: admin December 7, 2017 \nBaseball has been a favorite pastime for many people for a long time. But not everyone can play it efficiently. When you read the following paragraphs, you are going to improve your playing ability, understanding and passion for the game. \nIf you want to raise your batting average, focus on hitting towards the fence and not necessarily hitting over the fence. You want to hit the ball back towards where the pitcher. Most times that balls are hit into the air, they\u2019re easily caught. \nIf, as a coach, you have trouble holding your team\u2019s attention, try mixing up your methods a bit. If you constantly do the exact drills, the team will get bored. This is why changing drills at each practice keeps the team fresh. \nShift all of your weight to your back foot to maximize your hitting. If you bat with your right hand, you should shift your weight to the right foot and keep those leg muscles tight. As you swing, your back foot will add power. \nAct like a professional at tryouts. Whether is is little league or a school team, you must remember to maintain politeness when meeting your teammates and coach. This works well for you by showing your maturity. \nWhen pitching, it\u2019s a must to know how to best hold a ball and pitch the ball. To start, have your middle finger over the baseball\u2019s seam. Once that\u2019s done, place the thumb right along the other seam. This will make it so you throw with more accuracy and speed. Batting Helmets \nBatting helmets must be worn when hitting the baseball. These helmets provide protection against injuries to the head. The best batting helmets will have a shield that also helps protect the face from balls that are either pitched badly or for hits that results in a foul ball. \nThe correct stride is very important in baseball. People who are right-handed should pick up their left leg a little as the pitch is thrown. Lefties do this on the opposite leg. Stride with the opposing foot when you swing during the game. Younger and smaller people may not have to stride quite as much. \nIf you are an outfielder, keep your eye on the ball at all times. A batter who is right handed usually hits the ball toward the left field. On the other hand, a batter who is left handed usually hits the ball to right field. This tip will assist you in knowing which direction the ball is likely to be hit. \nBalls react differently depending on how the grass is cut. The lines that are generally found in the outfield can make the baseball alter its course while rolling on the ground. When learning how a ball reacts when rolling along the lines, you can get it to where that ball stops. \nIt is undeniable that baseball is huge when it comes to popularity. The more advice you listen to, the better you will be as a player. Hopefully, this article has given you some guidance in helping you enjoy the game even more.

The 13-track album includes 10 songs that have never been released.\nHendrix died in 1970 at age 27. The new album is the third volume in a trilogy from the guitar hero's archive. \"Valleys of Neptune\" was released in 2010, followed by \"People, Hell and Angels,\" released in 2013.\nEddie Kramer, who worked as recording engineer on every Hendrix album made during the artist's life, said in an interview that 1969 was \"a very experimental year\" for Hendrix, and that he was blown away as he worked on the new album.\n\"The first thing is you put the tape on and you listen to it and the hairs just stand up right on the back of your neck and you go, 'Oh my God. This is too (expletive) incredible,\" said Kramer. \"It's an incredible thing. Forty, 50 years later here we are and I'm listening to these tapes going, 'Oh my God, that's an amazing performance.'\"\nMany of the album's tracks were recorded by Band of Gypsys, Hendrix's trio with Buddy Miles and Billy Cox. Stephen Stills appears on two songs: \"$20 Fine\" and \"Woodstock.\"\n\"It sounds like Crosby, Stills & Nash except it's on acid, you know,\" Kramer, laughing, said of \"$20 Fine.\"\n\"Jimi is just rocking it,\" he added. \"It's an amazing thing.\"\nJohnny Winter appears on \"Things I Used to Do\"; original Jimi Hendrix Experience members Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding are featured on \"Hear My Train A Comin'''; and Lonnie Youngblood is on \"Georgia Blues.\"\nKramer produced the album alongside John McDermott and Janie Hendrix, the legend's sister and president of Experience Hendrix. Kramer said though \"Both Sides of the Sky\" is the last of the trilogy, someone could find new Hendrix music in an attic or a basement, which could be re-worked.\nHe also said they have live footage of Hendrix, some just audio and some in video, which they plan to release.\n\"It was amazing just to watch him in the studio or live. The brain kicks off the thought process \u2014 it goes through his brain through his heart and through his hands and onto the guitar, and it's a seamless process,\" Kramer said. \"It's like a lead guitar and a rhythm guitar at the same time, and it's scary. There's never been another Jimi Hendrix, at least in my mind.\"\n_", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jimi hendrix", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "johnny winter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen stills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john mcdermott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noel redding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kramer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lonnie youngblood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janie hendrix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hendrix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eddie kramer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy cox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "buddy miles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia blues", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "neptune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crosby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:16.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "802cb393abb809921b15d2be59e5b64890ea089e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvAVxs6a_QJ.WRqktNaa8mx1IuR5ZBOKGEGQMthUhx_82YAvdjaZ.4uyyikdrNdknbAY0sI3_loQd", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.za", "site": "tripadvisor.co.za", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/ShowForum-g186591-i88-o40-Ireland.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Ireland Forum, Travel Discussion for Ireland - TripAdvisor", "title": "The Pope's Visit - Ireland", "title_full": "The Pope's Visit - Ireland Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-09-28T01:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10000, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fc54bad6ab587006b258f5bc914cbecb7479fc1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvAVxs6a_QJ.WRqktNaa8mx1IuR5ZBOKGEGQMthUhx_82YAvdjaZ.4uyyikdrNdknbMjsUke17y428hs_GpX5Wd8-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "spiceloft", "published": "2017-12-06T07:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "As his lordship says, there is no need to alter any travel plans.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\" Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

U.S. health of...  55   \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades.

More >> \nBy ANDREW TAYLORAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Minnesota Democrat Al Franken, facing fresh allegations of sexual misconduct and vanishing support from fellow Democrats, appears to be on the brink of resigning from the Senate. \nFranken scheduled an announcement for Thursday, though his office tweeted Wednesday evening that he had not made \"a final decision\" on resigning. \nBut a majority of the Senate's Democrats called on the two-term lawmaker to quit after a woman emerged Wednesday morning saying he forcibly tried to kiss her in 2006. Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" - women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008.

The turret is planned to be delivered in modules in early 2020, will be moored in ca.370m water depth and will have a capacity to accommodate 21 risers. \nAker Solutions won the contracts for the Johan Castberg subsea system, and engineering and procurement management on the project, worth a total $480 million (NOK4 billion). The work scope includes detailed design engineering of the living quarters and technical specifications for the equipment and supplies required for Sembcorp to construct the accommodation unit for the Statoil-operated development. \nLast month, Statoil is signed a letter of intent with Sembcorp Marine Rigs & Floaters in Singapore for the construction of the hull and integrated living quarters for the floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel for Johan Castberg. \nStatoil delivered the plan for development and operation (PDO) for Johan Castberg to Norwegian authorities earlier this week . All contracts are subject to final approval of the PDO. \nThe partnership in Johan Castberg consists of Statoil (Operator 50%), Eni (30%) and Petoro (20%).

A press release describes Imoto as \u201cbar-centric,\u201d and notes that it will be home to a lounge that will offer a clubbier vibe in the late-night hours, complete with a DJ and plenty of cocktails. The restaurant takes its name from the Japanese word for \u201clittle sister.\u201d The second newly-announced spot, Burgundy Swine, will be a modern wine bar with a list of bottles, glasses, and wines on tap curated by a group of as-yet-unnamed sommeliers in Dallas. Situated right next door to the currently-open Olivella\u2019s, the space will include an outdoor patio that will be dog-friendly. In addition to the wine bar, Burgundy Swine will sell bottles of wine at retail. As Eater reported back in March, these two new additions are part of a major restaurant revamp in Victory Park . Over the next year, Brooke Humphries (of Barcadia, Pints & Quarts, and Mudsmith, among others) will open two restaurants in the neighborhood in 2018, along with concepts from Tristan Simon\u2019s hospitality company Rebees and an outpost of Mesero .
