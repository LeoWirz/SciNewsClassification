My mother was in labour for three days and three nights because the baby was breached and there was no available medical facilities and personnel on time that could have saved both mother and child.\u201d \nAkenroye, who heads BalmGilead Hospital in Lagos, regrets that \u201c50 years after, maternal mortality rates still remain high. \u201cWomen should not die because they are pregnant and people should get enough information necessary to stop the unnecessary deaths. That is why we are raising a foundation in remembrance of my mother. It is wrong that many women still die out of ignorance to access the available medical facilities and to utilize them, he said.\u201d \nParticipants trooped out in their hundreds to the Comprehensive High School, Ilutitun venue of the health outreach as early as 7am to take advantage of the services. About one thousand people came for the free treatment that included check-ups for blood pressure, blood sugar level, BMI, and treatment of various diseases. There were free surgical operations while free medicated eye glasses were handed out as well. There were also counseling services. \nOn the various ailments treated, Akenroye said the \u201cmedical team encountered different cases. \u201cThere are cases needing surgical intervention. We had cases of hernia, infertility, fibroids, dental cases among others. Many malaria and bacteria infection cases were also treated. Some have chronic diseases, like arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, insomnia and geriatric diseases and were assisted. A lot of people with high blood pressure, and other chronic diseases were screened, counseled and treated for the first time. This program has helped them to know their health status,\u201d he stated. \nHe also lamented the ignorance the people live with regarding their health. \u201cThere is a major problem while the people are not aware of what the hospitals have in stock. We had to educate them about medical facilities we have brought. Many in the community had problem with going to hospitals to get information about their health and available health provisions.\u201d \nDr Akenroye recalled how his mother died young because of delay in accessing medical facilities. \u201cShe was in labour for three days and three nights because they could not even transport her to where to get medical assistance. Even when she was eventually transported to the general hospital, the only doctor had travelled. She had to wait for another 24 hours to get the emergency treatment she needed. However, despite a surgical intervention, she lost her life due to post-operative complications.\u201d \n\u201cUnfortunately, even 50 years after, according to the statistics available there are about 5,000 mothers that still died after child birth last year and those were the ones reported.\u201d \nAlso helping out at the health outreach was a retired Chief Medical Consultant at the Ondo State Specialist Hospital Akure, Dr. Manuwa Idowu Akenroye and Dr Ilesami Ogunsuyi, the director of Medical services at the Federal Prisons in Ondo State. \nThe Consultant and uncle to the initiator of the project added that, \u201cDr. Akenroye\u2019s mother died during child birth when he was a little boy. Fortunately I was with him I know the story and when he turned around and told me he wants to do this I said that is a good thought and I wish him well. \n\u201cThe program is about preventing mothers and children from dying. To me if we can dedicate a day every year to remember this woman with this kind of event, it is worth it.\u201d \nMrs. Monisola Akenroye, an accountant and wife of the initiator of the project who was deeply involved in the planning, expressed satisfaction and fulfillment at the success of the outreach. \u201c\u201dI feel fulfilled I know that what we are doing now is exactly what God really wants us to do. This is not the first outreach but this is the first major one because we have had series of outreaches in America where we raised funds for children living with cancer. We have also raised funds for St. Joseph\u2019s home, a motherless babies home, and for abandoned mothers\u2019 homes. We have been doing it in our small ways but this is the first major outing and we are thrilled about the outcome\u2019. She promised that it would henceforth be a regular event. \nOn the NGO\u2019s future plan, she revealed that, \u201cWhat we intend to do is to put up a mother and child health centre. Not really a full-fledged hospital but somewhere they can get them information awareness on what is going on. Majorly we intend to have an ambulance service so that in case of emergency they can easily use it to move people around to the nearest hospital.\u201d \nOne of the beneficiaries Mrs. Grace Daso, 75, a retired teacher expressed appreciation for the initiative. \u201cI thank the organisers for this kind gesture. I have been battling an eye defect and this is coming at the right time. \nThe remembrance events which was kick-started with a thanksgiving and launch of the Victoria Aderemelekun Akenroye Foundation on November 12 (including the launch of her biography titled The Ultimate Sacrifice at the Redeemed Christian Church of God (Grace Sanctuary) in Lagos, followed by the medical outreach on 17th and 18th November, climaxed with a two \u2013day gospel crusade at Ilutitun.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "prisca sam-duru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manuwa idowu akenroye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monisola akenroye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilutitun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akenroye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madam victoria aderemilekun akenroye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilesami ogunsuyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grace daso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adegboyega akenroye", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "redeemed christian church of god", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balmgilead hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comprehensive high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ngo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria aderemelekun akenroye foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balmgilead life support", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okitipupa local government area of ondo state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ondo state specialist hospital akure", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ondo state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilutitun", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:52.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2ea2ca6da65b3a6f38dad0145e58b057bb04dee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh3ndEYTs9d7YRs_yLIO9UtljG8nNE4Q7vZ56vVa_NUlmV0BnoSHJv38RwEpyMTzgYJszJ9yW_4UTIZGzWrayPTBjKXSrLv5JXvPwLfCg5ohbkgVSDiB0b5Hg--", "site_full": "bizpr.us", "site": "bizpr.us", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/Bizprco", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BizPR.co", "title": "Clinical Laboratory Services Market Key Players, Industry Overview, Analysis to 2025", "title_full": "Clinical Laboratory Services Market Key Players, Industry Overview, Analysis to 2025", "published": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://bizpr.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/TMR-5.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f2ea2ca6da65b3a6f38dad0145e58b057bb04dee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh3ndEYTs9d7YRs_yLIO9UtljG8nNE4Q7vZ56vVa_NUlmV0BnoSHJv38RwEpyMTzgYJszJ9yW_4UTIZGzWrayPTBjKXSrLv5JXvPwLfCg5ohbkgVSDiB0b5Hg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sagarj2", "published": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Clinical Laboratory Services Market Key Players, Industry Overview, Analysis to 2025", "text": "December 7, 2017 Business & Professional Services Press Release , Business Internet Press Release No comments The global clinical laboratory services market demonstrates a largely fragmented business landscape due to the presence of a large pool of international and regional players, states a recent market intelligence report by Transparency Market Research (TMR). Keen players in the market are pouring money for facility automation and for the inclusion of technologically advanced tests as well as to expand their existing capacities that will help them serve a large customer base. They are also seen to expand their geographical outreach with mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances, which is making the market somewhat consolidated. Read Report Overview @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/clinical-laboratory-services-market.html Key companies operating in the global clinical laboratory services market include Charles River Laboratories International Inc., SYNLAB International GmbH, Sonic Healthcare, NeoGenomics Laboratories Inc., Genomic Health Inc., Fresenius Medical Care, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, UNILABS, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, and Eurofins Scientific among others.

Based on test type, clinical chemistry test segment is likely to lead the global market through 2025. The segment of standalone laboratories among the various service provider segments holds dominance in this market. However, hospital based laboratories segment is expected to display the leading growth rate among all service provider segments over the forecast period. Geography-wise, North America is anticipated to continue to dominate in the global clinical laboratory services market over the forecast period. Rising Awareness about Importance of Early Disease Diagnosis Boosts Market\u2019s Growth High prevalence of infectious diseases is one of the key factors driving the growth of global clinical laboratory services market. This, along with the rising awareness about the importance of disease diagnosis, incidence of seasonal diseases, and prevalence of lifestyle related diseases are attributed to drive the growth of clinical laboratory services market during the forecast period. Request Sample Report @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=414 In the present scenario, advanced technologies, demand for quick results, and revolution in testing methodologies are some of the key factors that are likely to propel the market\u2019s growth over the forecast period. Consumers are aware of the availability of tests that help diagnose the condition at an early stage and administer the course of treatment. Furthermore, rise in per capita healthcare expenditure by consumers, government funding for modernization of laboratory services in emerging economies, and increasing global population are expected to stoke growth of the clinical laboratory services market in the upcoming years. Clinical laboratory refers to a facility where tests are performed on the clinical specimen to obtain information about the medical condition of patients so as to diagnose and deliver the line of treatment in a timely manner. The tests help physicians to understand the root cause of the disease and subsequently administer appropriate treatment. Lack of Technical Expertise in Developing Nations Hinders Growth On the downside, factors such as lack of awareness in developing countries about the importance of diagnosis and prevention of diseases, lack of infrastructure and dearth of expert technicians in developing nations, and stringent regulatory scenarios in many countries are restricting the growth of clinical laboratory services market. \nAbout Us \nTransparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

But stricter immigration enforcement and new opportunities in Mexico have reversed the trend. Now, many are returning to towns like Malinalco, a rural community southwest of Mexico City. But coming home, it turns out, can be complicated. As the cell door slammed behind him at an immigrant detention center in Detroit, Jose Roberto Tetatzin knew his life as an American was about to come to an abrupt end. \nHe thought about all the things he had acquired over 10 years of hard work in Michigan: the apartment full of furniture, the cool clothes, the cars. \nAnd he thought about his daughters, 7-year-old Angela and newborn Lesli, both U.S. citizens who until that morning had such bright futures ahead of them. \nTetatzin knew he was going to be deported to his native Mexico. Now he and his partner, Judith Cristal Gudino, would have to decide what to do next. \nShould the girls stay in the U.S. with Gudino, or should the whole family relocate to Mexico? \nAt night, he talked through the dilemma with other detained immigrant fathers in the same situation, men from Central America, Africa, even the Middle East. Sometimes, they cried together. \nWhen Tetatzin was finally deported in 2015 in connection with a drunk driving conviction two years earlier, he was part of a large wave of Mexicans returning home. \nMore Mexicans have left the U.S. than have migrated to it in recent years, data show, a reversal of the largest flow of incoming migrants in modern U.S. history and a significant new chapter in the immigration narrative that has long dominated U.S. politics and culture. \nSome have returned to reconnect with family or take advantage of new opportunities in Mexico, where a declining birth rate means less competition for jobs. Others have been forced out, either deported, like Tetatzin, or deciding to leave because, in Donald Trump \u2019s America, they felt less welcome. \nIn any case, the trend has sparked both hope and concern in Mexico. Many view the large numbers coming back as brimming with potential. Many returnees bring home English and other skills learned in the U.S. But others in Mexico are concerned; they fear unwanted competition for jobs, or worry that deportees sent home for committing crimes could worsen the country\u2019s already high levels of violence.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jose roberto tetatzin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judith cristal gudino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kate linthicum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gudino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lesli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tetatzin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "la times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malinalco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tetatzin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:53.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9169878a8668d8fa48e384025943017068c28dd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSVhxeW_jLAEnSUuO7c8bGtJrptH9KYFKPAJm3tMMK08w--", "site_full": "www.zerochan.net", "site": "zerochan.net", "site_section": "http://www.zerochan.net/?xml", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Page 1 - Zerochan Anime Image Board", "title": "Shiunin Sora", "title_full": "Shiunin Sora", "published": "2017-12-07T07:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11381, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9169878a8668d8fa48e384025943017068c28dd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSVhxeW_jLAEnSUuO7c8bGtJrptH9KYFKPAJm3tMMK08w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T07:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "Shiunin Sora", "text": "Entry by Dyunasumon 4 hours ago .

(Photo: La Verdad) \nAbout this new vehicle fleet, FUTV members said that the main reasons why these actions are taken are the comforts offered by these vehicles, since all have air conditioning, a large trunk, in addition to the stoppage in the production of the Tsuru, last May, because its lack of the minimum safety measures. \nOn the subject, several taxi drivers commented that with these new cars one of the requests of the society is fulfilled, because many users demanded more comfortable vehicles. \nThe changes became with the administration of the former Governor Patricio Patr\u00f3n Laviada, who granted concessions to other groups different from the FUTV, to be able of offer the transport service with the \u201ctaximeter\u201d mode. \nThen with the arrival of Uber and other transport platforms, the taxi drivers had to adapt themselves to offer modern cars and eliminate some of the famous taximeters, because people preferred the platforms, due to their cheaper cost and comfort.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cabify", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vento", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patricio patr\u00f3n laviada", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "merida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "futv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tho service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volkswagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "front of workers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honda civic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nissan", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "la verdad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m\u00e9rida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:53.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb8885bc451901a89613a073014d2a14e63bc190", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3eOM0HtbHwPrUnad4dxqC_oy3atPDct1Xf9qUXOOHfFT.sRSUcipuaQ3QOnOTX15Fn", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/CryptoMarkets", "title": "Poloniex - My deposit is missing", "title_full": "Poloniex - My deposit is missing : CryptoMarkets", "published": "2017-12-07T15:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78dd5d599c3dcff98c3d7333dae3e08cc7faffd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3eOM0HtbHwPrUnad4dxqC_oy3atPDct1Xf9qUXOOHfFT.sRSUcipuaQ4N3fdfCK2uE3lH4A5MHn6HDtGmAw4LUZp3QCVAmimpN", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "TheCryptoJazz", "published": "2017-12-07T16:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I\u2019ve been waiting for a reply from them for months.

The article is called Lessons From Over 250 Year-End Fundraising Campaigns and is located at https://recharity.ca/lessons-250-year-end-fundraising-campaigns/. Captcha \nI realized recently that I\u2019ve been part of over 250 year-end fundraising campaigns . That\u2019s 24 years of helping nonprofits in the U.S. and Canada raise as much money as they can during the final weeks of the year. \nHere\u2019s a summary of what I\u2019ve learned . . . In the Mail \nThe mail. It\u2019s the way most charities still raise most of their money at year-end. \nTo young fundraisers, this is astounding. But to fundraisers who know the demographics of donors , it makes perfect sense. Most donors are older. They are more responsive to mail than to email and social media. \nThis is changing \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t changed that much. According to Blackbaud, in 2015 93.7% of donations came in offline. Online is growing and growing fast, but the mail remains the primary vehicle and will for several years. \nHere are a few tips on how to maximize your revenue through the mail: If you haven\u2019t already sent your holiday/year-end letter, do it as fast as you can. Every day you wait, you raise less money. If you can get another letter out the door before December 20 th , do it and send it first class postage. You\u2019ll raise about 1/3 of the amount your main letter raises, and it will be additional revenue. Remember that your donors are scanning your letters, not reading them. So make sure anyone who scans your letter for five seconds will see that you\u2019re asking them to give a gift and they need to send it no later than December 31 st . Online \nOnline fundraising is growing at around 12% per year. Unless you do something seriously wrong, you\u2019re going to raise more money online than you did last year. \nThe even better news is that this month is the easiest time to raise more money than you expect. Here are my top tips: Please send at least 3 emails at the end of the year . In all likelihood, these emails will be your best-performing emails of the year. I recommend the 29 th , 30 th and 31 st . \nIf you can send more, send another one on the 31 st . And if you can send yet another, send it on the 28 th . Remember that this year, the 31 st is on a Sunday. But because so much charitable giving happens at work, this means that there\u2019s going to be a spike of giving on Friday, December 29 th because it\u2019s the final work day of the year. Be sure to send out an email at 10:00 a.m. the morning of the 29th, and be more active on social that day. In my experience, the more emails you send, the more money you\u2019ll raise. Though a lot of people fear that there will be negative consequences of doing this, I\u2019ve never seen them. Not once. (And I don\u2019t count a handful of unsubscribes from non-donors as a negative consequence.) In our experience, social media\u2019s best use during December is to echo and reinforce your two main fundraising impacts: your year-end letters and any emails you send. In social, repeat the exact same phrases you\u2019re using in your email and your appeal letters. In General \nIn all of your year-end fundraising, keep the following in mind. Your donors are really busy this time of year. \nYou need to say everything a couple more times than normal. In addition to their normal lives, they are going to parties, buying presents, decorating the house, etc. They are busy and are going to flat out miss or delete many of your attempts to communicate with them. The smart fundraiser\u2019s response to that reality is to communicate with them more than normal. If you\u2019re uncomfortable, try it for one year. You\u2019ll raise more money, with no negative consequences, and you won\u2019t ever go back. Repetition is your friend. \nIn my opinion, the concept of repetition is the biggest lesson that advertising & marketing can teach to us fundraisers. Advertisers know that a person needs to hear the same message three times before she\u2019s likely to take action. But in the nonprofit world, we get scared of saying anything twice \u2013 ever! \nIn all of your year-end fundraising, you want to a) repeat the exact same strong calls-to-action through all your materials, and b) repeat your call to action multiple times each time you send it out (because remember, people are skimming, not reading). It will seem repetitive to you, your staff and your board. But it will help your donors get your message and you\u2019ll raise more money. Your donors LOVE to give. \nThey love how it feels . They love helping your beneficiaries or your cause. They love helping your organization. But they are busier than normal. So get in touch with them more than you have in the past. You\u2019ll be rewarded with more money and happier donors! \nMy fundraising friend, go forth. Give your donors more chances to make a gift and do good. They\u2019ll love it, and you\u2019ll love the results. More \nAnd hey, if you\u2019re still putting your online year-end campaign together, check out our Year-End Digital Fundraising Toolkit .

There are many people who can do filler Drs and Nurses who are expert injectors. They do this a majority of their day. I would not say goto them for Laser for Acne Scars, or expert acne scar treatments. But they key treatment here is \"filler\" as such there are tons of options.\nLet us know how you do with the person you found from the journal.\nRegarding Chu, every Dr has bad reviews. This comes from unrealistic expectations. When you are treating thousands like Chu, ... you will have people who judge you from your poor healing capabilities (in general) ... this is 70% of scar healing - with the other percentage the Dr's skill. Also noncompliance of treatment. Changing Drs and trying new things often. One day after the procedure judging the results - It taking to long (many do not know scar work can take 3 years with ones life / down time availability - Collagen is not quick to form). So if I go for one subcision, and see \"minimal\" results. Well I did not do multiple subcisions. I did not use filler or vacuum (Chinese cupping) potentially. I expected one treatment to fix all of my scars permanently and did not want to go through the long hard road or in the OP's case \" \u00a36000 in the last two years alone.\" We have had many reports of Chu being fairly priced (not out for the money) and able to do subcision. If you need to goto someone else for filler that is easy, find a expert injector after your treatment or do Chinese cupping (amazon) for shallow scars. Be aware when looking for reviews on real self, people go there to bitch about treatment - not say how wonderful it was. So it's a small percentage. Take the reviews from several sources and often good drs have videos showing their work. The OP needs skill with filler here \"not acne scars\" per say.\nRegarding what @Obi wan said above. This is basics of any energy based therapy. It uses your bodies ability to heal. It creates energy based wounding to stimulate collagen / healing. Think about it, this is what acne scar revision is, wounding (needling / peels/ subcision / fillers/lasers/Infini), and stimulating healing. The thought is one has to minimize thermal damage or other side effects through the remodeling process. This is why we offer peels, not a lot of people have the faith in their Dr to do these procedures with them and not get side effects. Very few know their way around lasers and the effects of their use - instead doing set it and forget it, the doctor's skill is very important here. As such I think it's easier to find someone for acid peels for resurfacing than a good laser based aesthetics dr who specializes in acne scars. Don't wait out 20 years for the next big cure that can be injected, not only would that effect your quality of life but your psyche and we age creating worse issues over 20 years (this clock never stops). Treat to be able to function and move on with life. There are people obsessing under scar less healing thread some 300 pages in the acne scar sub with the next big thing (SkinTE and Sudogel, lots of promises with few results in this category, ...listen to Obi 20 years) by that time we will be 3D printing organs. The obsession drives some people of perfection and for some 60-70% of their body is covered in scars so we are going beyond cosmetic facial treatments.\nBe Well\n1 person likes this ** Please \"Like\" my response above; As a volunteer encouragement helps!\n[Thank You For Your Kind Understanding - I reply to individual Private Messages addressing your concerns as soon as I can, helping many people a day, please be patient.]\nCLICKABLE LINK: OFFICIAL ACNE SCAR SOLUTIONS; Q&A / FAQ TABLE OF CONTENTS: 1.

Sean Suiter, 43, was set to testify before a federal grand jury about an incident that occurred years ago involving BPD officers, Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said during a news conference . The officers were indicted in March and August on federal racketeering charges . \nDavis also revealed that investigators believe Suiter had been killed with his own weapon, adding that there were signs of a struggle between Suiter, an 18-year veteran of the BPD, and his killer, who remains at large. \nAt a news conference, Davis attempted to dispel any rumors that Suiter\u2019s pending testimony was related to his death. \nSuiter was not a target of the ongoing federal investigation of the eight officers, members of Baltimore\u2019s elite Gun Trace Task Force, according to police. \n\u201cThe BPD and the FBI do not possess any information that this incident \u2026 is part of any conspiracy,\u201d Davis said, explaining that the fatal confrontation \u201cappears to be nothing more than a spontaneous observation of a man behaving suspiciously and a spontaneous decision to investigate his conduct.\u201d \nSuiter, a father of five, was shot in the head on Nov. 15 after noticing a man acting suspiciously while he and his partner were investigating a 2016 triple homicide. He died one day later. \nDuring that day\u2019s investigation efforts, both Suiter and his partner had noticed the suspicious man in a vacant lot and approached him, Davis said, citing surveillance camera footage reviewed by investigators. \n\u201cUpon the sound of gunfire, Detective Suiter\u2019s partner sought cover across the street,\u201d Davis explained. \u201cHe immediately called 911. We know this, because it is captured on private surveillance video that we have recovered.\u201d \nAccording to police, the ongoing investigation revealed that Suiter was shot within close range and was still holding his radio in his left hand. \nDavis also confirmed that Suiter\u2019s death remains an open homicide investigation and confirmed that police don\u2019t have a suspect in custody a week after the shooting. \nAsked about the conspiracy theories surrounding Suiter\u2019s killing, Davis said, \u201cIt certainly makes for great theater.\u201d \n\u201cWe have a police officer who\u2019s shot and killed, and we don\u2019t have a good description and we don\u2019t have someone in custody and \u2015 lo and behold \u2015 we find out after the fact that he was scheduled to testify in front of a federal jury.\u201d \nStill, Davis added, \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that Suiter\u2019s death was related to his testimony.\u201d \nMany people remain suspicious of the timing of Suiter\u2019s death, including Intercept columnist and prominent civil rights activist Shaun King. \nThe Baltimore Police Department has been under public scrutiny after the Justice Department released a damning report last year that revealed the department had routinely abused Baltimore residents\u2019 civil rights , including unconstitutional stops, frisks and arrests, using excessive force and taking a lax approach to sexual assault cases. \nIn April, a federal judge approved a deal made during the Obama administration between the city and the Justice Department to reform the troubled police department. The Trump administration had requested a delay on the approval of that deal , but it was rejected. \nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sean suiter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shaun king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suiter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "baltimore police department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffpost", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "baltimore", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:54.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de988321753066a443443147cc26c373e54973b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRQOqVJIj186fVMUVblmOnBjk7i3SMEty9ft8mWjH11ytqql1hH7OsGv9P60OVP_TaOMIcsGpRFvGAfYhp6Gaj6YPBiQN.V4HM-", "site_full": "uberpeople.net", "site": "uberpeople.net", "site_section": "http://uberpeople.net/find-new/24016636/posts?page=4", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Recent Posts | Uber Drivers Forum", "title": "How was your day?

The Conservative leader and byelection candidate weren't shopping just to soothe a sugar craving. They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they're pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck \nSURREY, B.C. \u2013 Inside a colourful candy shop in a bustling Vancouver suburb, Andrew Scheer and Kerry-Lynne Findlay marvelled at delicate British chocolate bars, chewy Red Vines and an edible Monopoly board. \nThe Conservative leader and byelection candidate weren\u2019t shopping just to soothe a sugar craving. They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they\u2019re pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. \n\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I\u2019m paying a lot higher taxes than I was before. I\u2019m being called a tax cheat because I\u2019m an entrepreneur with a small business,\u2019\u201d said Findlay, 62, a former national revenue minister. \nThe riding is one of four across Canada where a byelection will be held Monday, but it\u2019s anticipated to be the closest race. Conservative Dianne Watts won by just 1,400 votes over the Liberal candidate in 2015, while the NDP placed a distant third. \nThe vote arrives midway through Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s term and it\u2019s expected to test his popularity, as well as the potential of rookie leader Scheer, ahead of the 2019 election. Both men have visited the riding twice and both have suggested the outcome will indicate whether the Liberal surge of 2015 is continuing or waning. \n\u201cTwo years ago, in the election, Canadians didn\u2019t randomly or suddenly change who we are,\u201d Trudeau said at a recent rally to support Liberal candidate Gordie Hogg, 71. \n\u201cWe have always been progressive, forward-thinking, open, compassionate, ambitious people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just about getting a government that recognizes that.\u201d \nSouth Surrey-White Rock has older, wealthier and whiter demographics than other ridings in Surrey, which is the fastest-growing city in Metro Vancouver. It\u2019s home to a picturesque waterfront and an array of restaurants, shops and other small businesses. \nIn July, Trudeau\u2019s government announced plans to close loopholes that it said have allowed high-earning business owners to avoid higher taxes. The measures included changes to \u201cincome sprinkling,\u201d which allows owners to split income among family members. \nAfter a backlash, the government said it would cut the small business tax rate from 10.5 per cent to nine per cent by 2019. \nHogg said he and Trudeau are committed to cutting taxes for small businesses, while the Conservatives voted against a tax cut in 2015 for \u201cmiddle-class\u201d Canadians earning between about $45,000 and $90,000 a year. \n\u201cTo me, their record is more important than their rhetoric,\u201d said Hogg. \u201cThis byelection is about electing the strongest positive voice for our community, and only Justin Trudeau and I have a positive plan to strengthen our middle class and offer real help for families.\u201d \nThe seat became vacant after Watts resigned to run for leader of the B.C. Liberal Party, an informal coalition of federal Conservatives and Liberals. \nByelections will also be held in Battlefords-Lloydminster in Saskatchewan, previously held by the Conservatives; Bonavista-Burin-Trinity in Newfoundland, a Liberal seat; and Scarborough-Agincourt in Ontario, also won by the Liberals in the last election. \nIn South Surrey-White Rock, Hogg has name recognition and deep roots. He was White Rock mayor for 10 years before being elected to the B.C. legislature for two decades. Findlay, meantime, represented Delta-Richmond East in Parliament from 2011 to 2015. \nAsked about her connection to the riding, Findlay said her parents lived in the community and she has also lived there at various points, including after she was widowed at 34 and was raising her children alone. She said she moved to White Rock this summer. \nThe NDP candidate is Jonathan Silveira, 40, a real estate agent and founder of advocacy group Surrey Kids Matter. He said the byelection was an opportunity to train new volunteers and strengthen relationships, but added he was serious about winning. \n\u201cThere are two big sharks fighting here. I am not afraid of the fight as well,\u201d he said. \nNew Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has not joined Silveira in the riding. \nTrudeau\u2019s recent rally with Hogg in Surrey drew hundreds. Some were not local voters, however, including a Syrian refugee who said she wanted to thank Trudeau, and a visitor from Singapore who wanted to see the famous Canadian politician in person. \nThe prime minister is pictured alongside Hogg on campaign signs, indicating confidence among Liberals in Trudeau\u2019s popularity. \nScheer and Findlay, however, said they\u2019ve heard from people who have \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d after voting Liberal in 2015. \nIt\u2019s hard to predict a general election based on byelections, Scheer added, because the latter generally have lower turnouts, and local issues become amplified over national ones. \n\u201cBut I think we would love to send a signal, mid-term, that what the Liberals have been doing for Canadians isn\u2019t working.\u201d \n\u2014 Follow @ellekane on Twitter.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew scheer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura kane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scheer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerry-lynne findlay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dianne watts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gordie hogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jagmeet singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonavista-burin-trinity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "findlay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan silveira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silveira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dyck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watts", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "b.c. liberal party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surrey kids matter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ndp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "surrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metro vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south surrey-white rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newfoundland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saskatchewan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarborough-agincourt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "battlefords-lloydminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surrey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:54.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5abf7f96f3506f022d5151136e1f37234e91f63c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LQMIn3mdI5_9CNxiYczfxNhwp9Hnhe30W5WH8XMrX32sFyv1vZEpTP0.tLsB9K8Ak-", "site_full": "eu.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/19369714/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Classic Discussion - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "More Q", "title_full": "More Q - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T13:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53ed163867881c952e214ec9c5a414d4c141446f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LQMIn3mdI5_9CNxiYczfxNhwp9Hnhe30W5WH8XMrX32sFyv1vZEpTPZtbh5wyq0LH.O3i6Z0497w--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Shogath", "published": "2017-12-07T15:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "04/12/2017 15:52 Posted by Tindella 04/12/2017 15:20 Posted by Darkvveaver #nochanges.

Photo by Wall in Palestine. Flickr.com (CC BY-SA 2.0) Some rights reserved. \u201cBe yOuR OwN BosS.\u201d Two twenty-something Palestinians are pictured leaning over an iPad and laughing: a ColourSplash\u2122 filter makes their eyes and frayed festival wristbands glow a radioactive green. Their suits are whatever they put on that morning and their offices are wherever they turned their screens on. On a Facebook group for online freelancing work in Gaza and the West Bank, these mantras come up again and again. \nThe idea is that regardless of your circumstances, anyone can live the hipster millennial dream and \u201cwork where they want when they want\u201d thanks to the internet. In places like Palestine with unemployment rates of 30% (the highest in the world ) and movement violently restricted by a series of checkpoints, borders and military zones, profit-making activities in the \u2018placeless\u2019 digital realm can be viewed as a way of overcoming these obstacles. \nThe World Bank\u2019s \u201c m2work \u201d project in cooperation with Nokia took precisely this approach. It was just one of a series of initiatives in the past few years led by governments or private sector actors that have identified the Arab world as a region in which microwork has \u201cvast potential\u201d as a means of alleviating poverty. But this rhetoric of flexibility and entrepreneurship so common to neoliberal development agendas conceals some ugly realities. \nThere are a few really exciting grassroots initiatives such as Gaza Sky Geeks that are also using digital labour. But when western bodies like the World Bank, the Rockefeller Foundation or multinational NGOs propose the introduction of exploitative gig economy platforms as some kind of blanket solution to the problems of an entire region (or way of profiting off them), these realities need to be highlighted. Tech for good isn\u2019t always good and here\u2019s why in this case: \n1. Digital labour platforms are unregulated and exploitative \n\u201cMechanical Turk\u201d is an example of a digital labour platform run by Amazon that draws on \u201chuman intelligence to perform tasks that computers are currently unable to do.\u201d Microwork portals harness virtual crowds to organize playlists of music, tag videos and images, write, translate or transcribe short texts and in doing so train artificial intelligence software. Wage rates plummet as people around the world bid to complete tasks for cheaper and cheaper prices \nMicrowork is just one part of a broader spectrum of digital labour that ranges from on-demand services such as Uber to data extraction via social media such as Facebook. This continuum of unpaid, micropaid and poorly paid \u2018taskified\u2019 human activities means that work can no longer easily be distinguished from leisure time. Because of this, it\u2019s really hard to talk about exploitation, a word usually associated with industrial labour\u2019s sweatshop conditions, in relation to digital labour. It\u2019s also hard to reconcile people not always feeling like these activities are work that warrants compensation with their objective creation of a great deal of economic value. \nBut structural conditions can\u2019t be reduced to individual pleasure or preference. Loads of studies have shown how paid digital labour platforms seriously threaten basic workers protections. While the median hourly rate on Amazon Mechanical Turk is $1.38, tasks are completed for as little as $0.01. Wage rates plummet as people around the world bid to complete tasks for cheaper and cheaper prices. Opportunities for promotion or skill-development are near non-existent as workers are unable to access information about core business processes. \nBodies are also regimented to the demands of capital in new ways to the physical discipline of the factory. Refugees in Lebanon\u2019s Shatila camp who engage in a range of digital labour activities from freelance programming to online games with virtual currencies are forced to adjust their sleeping patterns to the demands of (western) capital. Teenagers keep their phone buzzers on loud while they sleep in order to respond at any hour or consume endless energy drinks to work or play through the night. Other studies of micro-workers around the world or \u201c gold-farmers \u201d in China have shown how these activities result in repetitive strain injuries or severe eye problems. \nCrucially, there are no opportunities for collective action to resist these conditions as workers are totally isolated by the platform. Despite this, in the US there have been some creative efforts to fight back against the precarity and exploitation that define microwork. These include the \u2018Dynamo\u2019 email campaign (and quasi-union) and the FairCrowdwork monitoring system designed by IG Metall in 2015. \n2. They reproduce a global division of labour based on historical patterns of domination and dependency \nThe way in which digital platforms leverage gender, class and race disparities to extract unpaid/underpaid digital labour hasn\u2019t been addressed by any of these campaigns. These questions are crucial to understanding the implications of the expansion of this kind of work into the Arab world. Protections are not risky. Making someone dependent for their survival on an algorithm with zero accountability is risky \nThe \u201cm2Work\u201d project seeks to overcome \u201cgeographic obstacles\u201d in order to offer employment opportunities to local youth and women. But this emphasis on \u201covercoming\u201d geography detracts from the very real ways in which uneven global geographies of power, wealth and knowledge play out in the field of global digital labour. A study by the Oxford Internet Institute based on 60,000 anonymized transactions completed on Upwork revealed a clear neo-colonial pattern of dependence as \u2018tasks\u2019 are sold from India and the Philippines to the US, Australia or the UK. This results in the same toxic race to the bottom that has defined industrial production for the past 30 years. \nIt is significant that the World Bank thinks that Gaza and the West Bank are \u201c particularly relevant \u201d destinations for microwork. In the global race to the bottom, the \u2018bottom\u2019 is an open-air prison and an area under military occupation. According to their 2014 report, these sites pose \u201climited risks\u201d to employers in terms of having to pay any full time employment benefits or a minimum wage. Protections are not \u2018risky.\u2019 Making someone dependent for their survival on an algorithm with zero accountability is risky. Not paying them an adequate hourly rate to feed themselves or their family is risky. Irregular or excessive working hours resulting in repetitive strain, eye problems or insomnia are risky. \nOne of the big selling points of digital workplaces is also that they are blind to race and gender. There haven\u2019t yet been any comprehensive studies of the way in which racialised identities play out on platforms like Mechanical Turk. However, Nakamura\u2019s work on racialized forms of labour on massive multiplayer online games exposes the same phenomenon. The term \u201cChinese gold-farmer\u201d in gaming chatrooms has come to stand for all worker-players completing repetitive tasks to sell virtual goods or characters for real money just as the term \u201cMexican gardener\u201d stands in for all dark skinned men cutting lawns. Syrian players in Shatila who viewed their gaming activities as leisure rather than work complained that their broken English or Arab names meant they were viewed by other players as unwanted guest workers or \u2018gold-farmers.\u2019 \n3. They profit off rather than tackling the political realities that result in unemployment \nThe World Bank\u2019s m2work borrows heavily from the Samasource initiative, a non-profit business that seeks to alleviate poverty by outsourcing digital work from Walmart, eBay etc. to impoverished populations. But contrary to their marketing, these schemes don\u2019t work in spite of predicaments like the occupation or the refugee crisis - they work because of them. \nLike the prison industrial complex that profits off the unpaid or underpaid labour of inmates, these initiatives thrive off social and political upheaval and structural deformities in the Middle East. \nIn many ways, digital labour plays perfectly into the logic of the refugee camp or the blockaded territory whereby subjects must be kept alive, but only just. Now, even bodies stripped of their political existence, of the rights and protections of the law, can be rendered productive. Through online platforms, residents can literally work within their figurative jail cells. Their integration into the global economy as cheap outsourcers makes users dependent not only on Israel or on a host state but on technology as well. \nLike the prison industrial complex that profits off the unpaid or underpaid labour of inmates, these initiatives thrive off social and political upheaval and structural deformities in the Middle East. In fact, prison labour programmes in the US now also include digital data entry, proofreading and document preparation just like the Chinese inmates \u201cforced into gold-farming\u201d on Massive Multiplayer Online Games. A platform called \u2018MicroSourcing\u2019 uses the fact that \u201c virtual captives \u201d will perform the work of western companies as a selling point on their website. \nThese unconcealed efforts to overcome local regulation in the global south to serve the interests of western platforms are part of a broader pattern of \u201ctech for good.\u201d Tawil-souri argues that we must recognise the underside of the \u201cprogress\u201d represented by the Internet\u2019s role in Palestinian society . This includes \u201can alienated society controlled from above, the degradation and destruction of much employment, the further concentration and consolidation of corporate capital, and the imposition of its criteria and priorities on the nation state.\u201d \nToufic Haddad has coined the term \u201c Palestine Ltd \u201d to describe the series of western donor policies based on the premise that \u201cthe market\u2019s invisible hand will guide Israelis and Palestinians to peace.\u201d Palestine has become a very profitable business for a number of investors from donors to western states. The m2work project is only the latest manifestation of the World Bank\u2019s priority to encourage private-sector growth as the path to Palestinian state-building since the 1990s. But this willfully ignores the political realities of settler-colonialism. Last year, the UN found that the Palestinian economy would be at least twice as large if the Israeli occupation was lifted. \nThe \u2018Mechanical Turk\u2019 was originally an 18th century Chess Player Automaton secretly operated inside by a real person. With his turban and curled mustache, this pipe-smoking \u2018Turk\u2019 was part of a craze for automata designed to resemble the oriental \u201cOther\u201d based on the trope in Christian theology of the docile and obedient Muslim. As workers in impoverished areas, from Syrian refugee camps to the Palestinian occupied territories, are forced to perform these repetitive, unskilled tasks, (concealed behind a slick, anonymized interface) the \u2018muslim-as-machine\u2019 trope takes on new meanings. Machine-like, always-on, this \u201csurplus population\u201d can always be tapped into by companies to fuel the 24-hour business cycle that drives western progress.

In formal settings, it is polite to use both hands when presenting and receiving a business card. This is a sign of respect for the other person. Once you receive a card, you should not put it in your wallet right away. This is a sign of disrespect. You should make sure to take a look at it carefully. If you are sitting at a table, it is customary to place the business card in front of you while you are having the meeting. Business cards are usually double-sided and printed in English well. Meanwhile, Korean like to exchange business cards even in casual settings. Close friends exchange business cards to show what he or she is doing.\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5d0\uc11c \uba85\ud568\uc744 \uc11c\ub85c \uad50\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud754\ud55c \uc77c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uc2dd\uc11d\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba85\ud568\uc744 \uac74\ub124\uace0 \ubc1b\uc744 \ub54c\uc5d0 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ub450 \uc190\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc608\uc758\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uac83\uc740 \uc0c1\ub300\ubc29\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uc758\uc758 \ud45c\uc2dc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba85\ud568\uc744 \ubc1b\uc790\ub9c8\uc790 \ubc14\ub85c \uc9c0\uac11\uc5d0 \ub123\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc88b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ub300\ubc29\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uc758\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba85\ud568\uc744 \ubc1b\uc73c\uba74 \uba3c\uc800 \uc720\uc2ec\ud788 \uc77d\uc5b4 \ubcf4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc88b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9cc\uc77c \ud68c\uc758\ub97c \ud558\uba70 \ud0c1\uc790\uc5d0 \uc549\uc544 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub77c\uba74 \uba85\ud568\uc744 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc790\ub9ac \uc55e\uc5d0 \ub193\uc544 \ub461\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud55c\uad6d \uba85\ud568\ub4e4\uc740 \ubcf4\ud1b5 \uc591\uba74\uc73c\ub85c \ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc601\uc5b4\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc778\uc1c4\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \ud55c\uad6d\uc778\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0ac\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uba85\ud568 \uad50\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc88b\uc544\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uce5c\ud55c \uce5c\uad6c\ub4e4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc11c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc77c\uc744 \uc54c\ub824 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uba85\ud568\uc744 \uc8fc\uace0\ubc1b\uae30\ub3c4 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\nexchange business cards \uba85\ud568\uc744 \uc8fc\uace0\ubc1b\ub2e4\nin formal settings \uacf5\uc2dd\uc11d\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294\nit is polite to ~\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc608\uc758\ub2e4\nuse both hands \uc591\uc190\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub2e4\na sign of respect \uc608\uc758\uc758 \ud45c\uc2dc\na sign of disrespect \uacb0\ub808\uc758 \ud45c\uc2dc\ntake a look at something carefully ~\uc744 \uc720\uc2ec\ud788 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\ub2e4\nsit at a table \ud14c\uc774\ube14\uc5d0 \uc549\ub2e4\nbe customary \uad00\ub840\uc774\ub2e4\ndouble-sided \uc591\uba74\uc5d0 \uc778\uc1c4\ub41c\nin casual settings \uc0ac\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c\n- EGG -\nMy watch is 2 minutes slow. \ub0b4 \uc2dc\uacc4\ub294 2\ubd84 \ub2a6\uc5b4\nIt\u2019s been confirmed that a massive geoglyph discovered in a Peru desert is that of a killer whale.\n\uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubbf8\uc2a4\ud130\ub9ac \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc778 \uac70\ub300 \uc9c0\uc0c1\uadf8\ub9bc, geoglyph\uac00 \ud398\ub8e8 \uc0ac\ub9c9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uacac\ub410\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ubc88\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \uadf8\ub9bc\uc740 \ubc94\uace0\ub798\ub97c \ub2ee\uc558\ub2e4\uace0 \ud558\ub124\uc694.\nSick of traffic jams?

Among those legends is that of the Itzalana Virgin, Queen of Yucatan, that tells the miracle that has been happening every December 8 for almost two centuries in that magic town. Itzalana Virgin, Queen of Yucat\u00e1n, (Photo: Diario de Yucatan) \nThe history began when one of the most important priests in the history of Yucatan, Fray Diego de Landa, traveled to Guatemala to bring to Izamal and Merida two images of the Blessed Virgin. The two images were the same in everything: size, beauty and details, and of course the town baptized them as \u201cThe two sisters\u201d. One stayed in the Superior Convent of Merida and the other one was placed in the Izamal convent. \nA sacristan of Mayan origin that was in charge of cleaning the church and the room in which the Virgin\u2019s image was kept, became strongly devoted of the virgin, passing hours bowed in front the image and talking with her. \nTime passed and the fateful April 16, 1829 arrived, when the altar and the Virgin\u2019s room were completely covered by flames. From that day the Mayan sacristan disappeared. People thought he died in the flames. Later, the other Virgin Image in Merida was transferred to Izamal to replace the one that was lost in the fire. \nSuddenly on December 1 st , after bringing to Izamal the other image, the sacristan showed up at the temple and explained to the priest that he would only spend eight days in the city and that he would be available to be the guardian of the Virgin\u2019s room. The Priest accepted and after December 8 th , he disappeared again from Izamal promising to return next year to work in the church on the same days and in the same way. Convento Franciscano; Franciscan monastery @ Izamal Photo: Google \nThis custom continued for several years, but strange rumors began to flow through the town. It was said that in the early hours of the morning of December 8, the sacristan was seen leaving the church of Izamal and heading to Kinich-Kakm\u00f3 hill. He reached the eastern part of the base of the hill and disappeared in a hollow. Soon he was seen leaving and returning to the convent through the same streets. Moments later he left the church again and repeated the trip exactly like the previous one. And then after the second trip, the streets where he passed filled with a sweet flower\u2019s scent. Kinich Kak Moo Pyramid, Izamal, Yucat\u00e1n (Photo: Google) \nYears later, when the sacristan was old already, he found some people on his nocturnal trip to the hill, and he told them that that was the last year he came to Izamal, but even in his absence, they would observe that in the streets where he spent his strange trips every December 8 at dawn, \u201cthey would continue as before smelling flowers\u201d. \nAlso he said that finally he had been authorized to reveal the secret guarded since April 16, when the church burned: \u201che was working in the back of the building and when he noticed the flames, he heard a voice saying: \u201cSave me, I am the Virgin\u201d. Then he noticed a faint light that followed him and not knowing where to go he directed his steps towards the Kinich-Kakm\u00f3 hill, and in the hollow that it has on the eastern side penetrated accompanied by the Virgin. For fear of what happened he left Izamal thinking never to return, but one day, in the place where he went to take refuge, he heard that voice again, saw the light and was ordered to come to Izamal every year for the holidays and not leave here until he accompanied the two sisters in the annual change of place, in which he accompanied them. \nHe also indicated that no one dares to enter the hollow of the hill where one of the virgins is sheltering, because beneath it there is a cenote with a small island in the center and in the water around inhabits a huge snake guardian that would eat anyone who comes near.

Like many Barbudans, she lost the roof of her house to high winds, which wreaked havoc with the house\u2019s interior. \nShe is less resistant to the idea of title but insulted by the suggestion she has to pay for her land. \n\u201cIf they come and say, here is a title deed for this land, I would take it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to pay for it. It could be 10 cents. The minute I do that, I\u2019m buying back something that belongs to me.\u201d \nAntigua operates with freehold tenure, but for nearly two centuries Barbudans have collectively governed the use of land on their island, a system that is unique in the Caribbean. \nMany of them fear a freehold system would be a first step for increased foreign investment on Barbuda, a quiet place where residents hunt, fish and farm for a living and that \u2014 unlike Antigua \u2014 receives no cruise ships and sees few tourists. \nHollywood actor Robert de Niro is planning to build a luxury resort on the island, a project that stirred controversy among Barbudans when the government approved the plan in 2015. \nEmpowering Barbudans \nIn an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation in the Antiguan capital St John\u2019s, Prime Minister Browne, insisted his plan will \u201cempower\u201d Barbudans. \nThe new land ownership system, Brown said, would help development and pave the way for Barbudans to get mortgages to rebuild their homes and get insurance to protect them when the next disaster hits. \nHistorically, Barbudans have constructed their homes incrementally and relied on savings rather than bank financing. \nFew if any have insurance following a negative experience after the last major storm, Hurricane Luis in 1995, when a fraudulent provider failed to make good on claims. \nThree months after the storm hit Barbuda, the utility company says running water and limited electricity have been restored, although Barbudans communicating with the Thomson Reuters Foundation via WhatsApp disputed this. \nSince the storm, the few hundred returned residents have been relying on generators and desalinated water from humanitarian relief organisations. \nThe lone primary school\u2019s classrooms are cluttered with overturned desks and shredded books while they remain open to the sky. \nThe lack of schooling means families with school-age children continue to shelter in Antigua, 63km away, which was not damaged by Irma and is home to the bulk of the country\u2019s population with some 80,000 residents. \nAccording to a United Nations post-disaster building damage assessment, roughly half of the 1,250 structures on Barbuda require significant repair or complete reconstruction. \nThe United Nations estimates it will cost US$79 million to fix up Barbuda\u2019s housing stock and that total recovery expenditure will amount to US$223 million, nearly 16 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP. \nDonors promised US$1.3 billion in aid and more than US$1 billion in loans and debt relief and loans for hurricane-ravaged Caribbean islands at a pledging conference last month. \nMortgages needed? \nBrowne said donor money would be used to build new homes, but said hurricane victims cannot expect to receive them without cost. \n\u201cThey must have some skin in the game,\u201d he said, expressing concern at setting a \u201cprecedent in which we just give away homes.\u201d \nFinancing Barbuda\u2019s reconstruction will need a \u201cmortgage component\u201d, said Browne. In order to secure a loan, he said some form of title to the land was required. \nLiz Alden Wily, a land tenure specialist, disputed that freehold title is an obligatory step before issuing a mortgage. \n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with their collective title, it just would require some work by the (elected) Barbuda Council to get everyone on board and to organise a schedule of payment of interest and repayment of the loan,\u201d she said. \nSome residents fear the abolition of communal land ownership on the island may pave the way for the sell-off of lucrative beach-front tracts of land. \n\u201cThe government is asking Barbudans to surrender collective ownership of the whole island for just a few parcels of land in (the capital) Codrington,\u201d said Alden Wily. \nPensioner Clifton Walbrook, whose house was destroyed by Irma, says he does not have savings or insurance, but he is not interested in a mortgage. \n\u201cBarbuda land is not for sale,\u201d said Walbrook, whose house was destroyed by the storm. \n\u201cIf you can\u2019t repay the bank, they take the damn property away from you in the first place,\u201d he said. \nDonors have not yet weighed in on the land issue. \nThe United Nations Development Programme and CARICOM, which organized the pledging conference last month, did not respond to requests for comments, nor did the governments of Canada and Britain, which have both made large financial commitments. \nHowever, Britain\u2019s Department for International Development said in a news release last month an additional \u00a33 million (RM16.4 million) would be pending \u201conce the priorities for reconstruction on Barbuda are agreed with the local government.\u201d \nThe World Bank, which pledged US$140 million for rebuilding to the Caribbean region, has not commented, while the European Union, which pledged US$352 million, called land tenure an \u201cinternal matter\u201d. \nAlden Wily said donor nations must take a stance. \n\u201cIt would be wrong for donors providing hurricane relief not to lay down very clear conditions that in the case of Barbuda, this is not the time to change the tenure regime,\u201d she said. \u2014 Thomson Reuters Foundation", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cliff drinkwater", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liz alden wily", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaston browne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alden wily", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hurricane luis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walbrook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colain beazer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "browne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert de niro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clifton walbrook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicky jeffrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbudans", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "world bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department for international development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "codrington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbuda council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations development programme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caricom", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "barbuda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st john\u2019s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antigua", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:55.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "71dc88559d6d83860c173e7fae7515c7eeccca85", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8j8mfi7.uiCqDt2Gq_6Jo3xHmqupWLJpPvLdSaFLqmK5EVstaUxXP6FJOlWYW41hE-", "site_full": "www.discuss.com.hk", "site": "discuss.com.hk", "site_section": "http://www.discuss.com.hk/forumdisplay.php?fid=442", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "\u65e5\u672c - \u9999\u6e2f\u8a0e\u8ad6\u5340 Discuss.com.hk - \u9999\u8a0e\uff0e\u9999\u6e2f No.1", "title": "\u02db\u00c4\u00a4@\u015a\u00b8\u013dh\u00a4j\u00a8\u00c1...\u0154\u0142\u00b8\u00d3\u015bR\u00c9Apass??

"Nepal votes in final phase of general elections Published 07-Dec-2017 15:23 IST | Updated 15:42 IST To Name Maximum Length : 250 Pic Courtesy:Twitter@ANI Kathmandu: Millions of people across 45 districts in Nepal on Thursday voted in the final phase of the general elections that will send representatives to the country's first bicameral legislature following the approval of the 2015 Constitution. The polls, that will elect members of the national and provincial assemblies to end almost two decades of an interim government, opened at 7 a.m. and will conclude at 5 p.m. \"The elections are taking place in a peaceful manner across the country except for some stray incidents,\" Election Commission spokesperson Nabaraj Dhakal told Efe news. Two homemade bombs had exploded in Kathmandu's Manamaiju area and in Dharan, located some 400 km to the east of the capital, but did not cause any damage to life or property, he added. By 10 a.m., around 20 per cent of the 12.2 million people who were eligible to vote had cast their votes, Sudhir Shah, one of the five election commissioners, told Efe. \"We want stability so that the country can move toward prosperity. I hope this election gives us a stable government,\" Yadav Dhakal, a 67-year-old retired teacher, said after casting his vote. Nepal has a total of 15.4 million registered voters, out of which more than 3 million had voted in the first phase of the elections that were held on November 26 across 32 districts in the northern part of the country. With a total of 25 governments in the last 27 years, three of them in the last two years, Nepal has been steeped in grave political instability for long. In these elections, Nepalese voters will directly elect 165 national lawmakers while another 110 members of the lower house will be elected through the party-list proportional representation system, which takes into account the total number of votes secured by the parties. Similarly, 330 members of the seven provincial assemblies will be elected directly while another 220 members will be elected through the same party-list proportional representation system. Counting will begin after voting concludes, with results expected to be announced next week.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sudhir shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yadav dhakal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nabaraj dhakal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "efe news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "election commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nepal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manamaiju", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dharan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathmandu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:55.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2bfe47b8d2340f4a76dadfbb8dcd19f89e45f3ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4N1o4mbtJPWy__k36h6PV3g22dD8HAI5p7YP5l7ps50bXZ5XCxiPK4TQIjbov9eklaH8bvLZcfQsMHvqb27Cmnjk2Lip78rAqLFdWXFBIMX2B90.xgKtx.w--", "site_full": "news.abs-cbn.com", "site": "abs-cbn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "The Sun Writers Club: Meet the maids reporting Hong Kong\u2019s hidden stories | ABS-CBN News", "title_full": "The Sun Writers Club: Meet the maids reporting Hong Kong\u2019s hidden stories | ABS-CBN News", "published": "2017-12-07T03:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.741, "main_image": "https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2017/news/12/07/hk-maids-1.jpg?ext=.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 323, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1010, "comments": 1, "shares": 1010}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2bfe47b8d2340f4a76dadfbb8dcd19f89e45f3ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4N1o4mbtJPWy__k36h6PV3g22dD8HAI5p7YP5l7ps50bXZ5XCxiPK4TQIjbov9eklaH8bvLZcfQsMHvqb27Cmnjk2Lip78rAqLFdWXFBIMX2B90.xgKtx.w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shaun Turton", "published": "2017-12-07T03:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Sun Writers Club: Meet the maids reporting Hong Kong\u2019s hidden stories | ABS-CBN News", "text": "After she finishes cooking dinner, cleaning up and reading her employer\u2019s children a bedtime story, Marites Palma aims to be in bed by 9pm \u2014 especially if a deadline is looming.\nWith the rest of the house asleep, she rises at 2:00 am, sits at the table where her television usually rests, and, in the glow of her laptop, begins work on her articles.\nThe 42-year-old domestic helper usually writes until 5:30 am, then takes a bath and begins preparing her employer\u2019s breakfast.\nThough tiring, her early morning routine, she says, is the realization of a life-long ambition.\n\u201cWhen I was in school, I wanted to study [mass communication], but my parents could not afford it because that course was only in other provinces, so I took agriculture instead,\u201d says Palma, a native of northern Luzon.\n\u201cBut I always read newspapers and I love to write. I think maybe this is the dream.\u201d\nPalma is a contributor to the Filipino community newspaper The Sun, one of about 100 overseas workers in Hong Kong that the free bi-monthly publication has trained in journalism since it was founded 22 years ago.\nSun contributor Marites Palma conducting an interview at a demonstration against mining in the Philippines in Central last month. Shaun Turton A few times a year, the paper holds workshops for readers interested in news writing. Some of the attendees, mostly domestic helpers, then join the Sun Writers Club and contribute a handful of stories to the paper each month.\nIt\u2019s a taxing double life. The contributors use their one day off each week to report, and often correspond with sources in the brief spare moments between housekeeping, running errands and cooking.\nBut for members of the all-volunteer Sun Writers Club, it\u2019s a role they cherish and excel at.\nTheir stories cover the gamut of the experience of the roughly 189,000 Filipinos living in Hong Kong. From community events, travel features and sports write-ups, to the all-too-common stories of abuse, indignity and misfortune suffered by their fellow maids.\nAnd though each enjoys improving their writing, their overriding motivation stems from helping their community.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of activism and journalism,\u201d Palma told Coconuts Hong Kong last month in Central, where she had been covering an environmental group\u2019s demonstration against destructive mining in the Philippines.\n\u201cIf you know more, you know about your rights and how to fight for them.\u201d\nPaper with a purpose\nIn its first 4-page edition, printed on Dec. 3, 1995, the Sun vowed to serve Filipinos as they \u201ctoiled in this strange land.\u201d\nAnd toil they do. Recent research has highlighted the \u201cappalling\u201d living conditions of many maids who are forced to sleep in toilets, showers, storage rooms and on balconies. Another, government-backed, report revealed that more than 70 percent of employment agencies charge exorbitant fees, withhold passports, or act as de facto loan sharks, ensnaring maids in debt.\nOne year-long study found a \u201csignificant proportion\u201d of the maids it interviewed were working in conditions that would constitute \u201cforced labor\u201d.\nNewspapers, a page 1 editorial in the Sun\u2019s inaugural edition reads, can be pieces of paper tossed away after reading, or they can become institutions. Leo Deocadiz and Daisy Mandap \u2014 the Sun\u2019s founders and veterans of the Filipino and Hong Kong journalism scenes \u2014 promised to be the latter.\nMore than two decades later, the husband and wife team continue to run a publication that is much more than the sum of its parts, adopting what might be called a hybrid approach to journalism \u2014 melding reporting, advocacy, social work and community service.\nSun publisher Leo Deocadiz and editor Daisy Mandap. Shaun Turton Behind adjacent desks ensconced in the Sun\u2019s 15th-floor North Point office, the couple works late most nights, surrounded by shelves piled high with files, mementos, and back issues.\nWith a small full-time team of three \u2014 Deocadiz, the publisher; Mandap, the editor; and associate editor, Vir Lumicao \u2014 the paper tackles an endless torrent of troubling tip-offs: from shady recruitment agencies offering bogus jobs, to helpers abused by employers, to those stricken by illness or terminated in the dead of night.\nReporting the facts is draining enough, but their work goes far beyond simple reporting.\nBehind the scenes, the team arranges lawyers, coordinates the rescue of maids in distress, refers helpers to shelters, accompanies them to police stations, and helps them file complaints or compensation requests. Its these efforts outside a newspaper\u2019s traditional mandate that have earned them the unofficial title of \u201csecond consulate.\u201d\n\u201cWe grew into this role because there was a need for it,\u201d Deocadiz said, sitting behind his desk last month.\n\u201cWe were schooled in the journalism principle of always being in the middle, but in this case, since we started this, we have found that it\u2019s not enough. You have to take sides, and you know which side you\u2019re on. We\u2019ve always taken the side of these people, and we recognize that.\u201d\nRodelia and the rescue\nSun contributor Rodelia Villa, who began writing for the paper this year after 13 years of publishing a church newsletter, occupies a middle ground of her own: reporter, responder and, perhaps her favorite role, a source of recipes.\nAfter finishing her work as a domestic helper each day, usually about 11:00 pm, the 39-year-old informs her Facebook followers that she is available to answer questions.\nShe administers two Facebook groups, one providing basic Cantonese translation services for maids, and another that shares recipes for affordable meals to cook their employers. Each has several thousand followers.\nSun contributor Rodelia Villa at a market in central. As well as writing stories, Villa maintains a Facebook group to share recipes for fellow domestic helpers to cook. Shaun Turton Her profile online also sees her regularly contacted by helpers in need. Most days, she gets 10 to 15 messages ranging from minor issues to emergencies. She refers serious cases directly to the Philippine consulate, where she also somehow finds time to volunteer.\nOn three occasions, she\u2019s been contacted by domestic helpers contemplating suicide, and in each case, talked them down.\n\u201cShe said she was at the window,\u201d she recalled of one. \u201cI told her to step back, just step back.\u201d\nEarly last month, Villar received a tip-off, describing a history of horrific treatment of a helper working at a home in Tseung Kwan O, including physical, verbal, and emotional abuse.\nThe woman had allegedly been forced to bang her head against the ground, kicked, jabbed with scissors, and made to pay exorbitant fines for perceived shortcomings in her performance, each documented in a notebook, photographs of which were passed to Villar.\nShe quickly sent the information on to the consulate and the newspaper. Soon after, Vir Lumicao, the Sun\u2019s main writer, arrived at the helper\u2019s home, and took her and the colleague who reported the abuse away to safety.\nVillar helped write the story, which appeared in the Sun\u2019s next edition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a critical part of the community,\u201d says the Philippine Labor Attache in Hong Kong Jalilo Dela Torre of the newspaper.\n\u201cNot only is it a source of information but, also, they see to it that all the services that our workers are entitled to are delivered by government officials, as well as non-government organizations.\u201d\n\u2018Small person, big voice\u2019\nMerly Bunda, too, always finds herself in the middle.\nThe exuberant 50-year-old is a domestic helper, a trained midwife, a volunteer radio correspondent and a contributor to the Sun. But, like many of those in the Sun Writers Club, she\u2019s much more.\nIn the Philippines, some \u2014 not her, but others \u2014 say she\u2019s a bit of a celebrity.\nSince the SARS outbreak in 2003, her regular dispatches from Hong Kong for Bombo Radyo mean her voice is recognized regularly when she returns to her native Iloilo province.\n\u201cWhen they meet me in the market, they say \u2018how does such a small person have such a big voice,\u201d says Bunda, who has lived in Hong Kong for 27 years.\nHere in Hong Kong, she\u2019s also well-known in the community, particularly via social media. She has almost 5,000 friends on Facebook.\nSun contributor Merly Bunda draws on her large Facebook network for stories and sources. Shaun Turton In a matter of minutes, Bunda, acting on a tip-off, can use those online relationships to track down nearly any Filipino living in the city. In October, a Filipino driver suffering from severe depression mutilated his own genitalia. A few messages later, she was in contact with the man\u2019s flatmates.\nLike others in the Sun Writer\u2019s Club, Bunda also serves as a point of contact and source of advice for helpers in distress. For true emergencies, like workers abruptly struck down by illness, she refers to the Philippine consulate, which knows to always answer her calls.\nWhen she can, she follows up in person. Not just for the story, but to try and provide a solution.\nIn recent weeks, she\u2019s visited hospitalized maids, one with Lupus and another with tuberculosis, the latter of which she personally accompanied to the emergency ward during a typhoon warning.\nIn late November, she met with a domestic helper wrongly accused of abandoning a fetus in a public toilet. The woman had been summonsed a second time for questioning and was nervous. Bunda, who\u2019s writing a piece about the episode for the Sun, counseled her prior to the interview to remain confident and answer all the questions she\u2019s asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m always in-between, in the middle,\u201d she says of her role.\n\u201cYou know, there is a thrill,\u201d she admits, both in chasing down stories and trying to help those in need. \u201cIf in my heart, I think I can help, I will go.\u201d\nAgents of change\nDeocadiz and Mandap joke about who is the real boss. Dela Torre, the labor attach\u00e9, calls them a \u201cperfect match,\u201d the former handling the business and the latter spearheading their coverage of dozens of stories a month.\nMandap\u2019s energy and drive is integral to the operation. Holder of degrees in both law and journalism, her resume includes major Filipino publications and senior editorial roles at Hong Kong newspaper the Standard, Asia Television HK (ATV), and CNN in Hong Kong.\nThere\u2019s likely not an issue affecting Filipinos in Hong Kong that she can\u2019t detail in depth, meaning conversations easily flow from one case, to the next, to the next.\nPublisher Deocadiz and editor Mandap at the Sun newspaper office. Shaun Turton As well as reporting many of the stories, Mandap spends her time editing the copy of the Sun Writers Club contributors, making sure her changes are accompanied by feedback.\nShe\u2019s a stickler for the fundamentals. Nor is there any accommodation of double standards in the paper\u2019s portrayal of those it\u2019s covering.\n\u201cOur bottom line is the protection of our domestic workers, but if they do something wrong, they have to face the consequences. We do not protect them to the extent that we cover up for any misdeed they have done,\u201d she says.\n\u201cWe try to be very accurate. There\u2019s no excuse for sloppy.\u201d\nWorking as a domestic helper can be isolating, lonely and a blow to the self-confidence of women, many with tertiary educations, who often feel they\u2019re treated as second-class citizens.\nFor many of the Sun contributors, reporting and writing gives them a chance to change not only the lives of the people they cover, but their own.\nSuch was the case for Gina Ordona, who arrived in Hong Kong fresh out of college, planning to stay just a few years. That was 20 years ago, and for a long time, the 41-year-old said she struggled with low self-esteem. That finally began to change a decade ago when she began writing.\n\u201cI could not even tell my friends, my classmates from college, what I do here in Hong Kong, for a long time,\u201d she said recently. \u201cI had difficulty accepting it. I don\u2019t know what made me come to terms, but maybe it\u2019s because of what I do now. I\u2019m a domestic helper, but on the sidelines, I write.\u201d\nAfter many sleepless nights writing and hours spent comparing her copy to the published story, Ordona has become one of the Sun\u2019s best contributors.\nShe wants to study writing when she returns to the Philippines, where she hopes one day to work full-time in journalism.\nSpeaking with Coconuts last weekend after covering a forum by Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Cayetano, Ordona explained why she loved the craft.\n\u201cI just enjoy writing the story as it is,\u201d she said.\nSun contributor Gina Ordona has written for the paper for a decade. Shaun Turton \u201cYou want to be the agent of change, just making a little difference to make the situation better.

Propper is opening a new showroom inside their headquarters to serve the local law enforcement community. \nPropper\u2019s law enforcement products fit what patrol officers, detectives, and SWAT teams need on an everyday basis. ST. CHARLES, Mo. (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 Law enforcement and tactical gear manufacturer Propper International is opening a new showroom inside their St. Charles County headquarters to serve the local law enforcement community. The new 2,000 square foot facility is adjacent to the in-house Design Lab located inside Propper\u2019s corporate headquarters at 17 Research Park Drive in the Missouri Research Park, at the corner of I-64 and Highway 94 in Weldon Spring. \u201cWe want to offer a place where local law enforcement can browse and check out not just our products, including Class B uniforms, but many other LEO necessities such as holsters, duty belts, and pouches,\u201d said Mark Marino, territory manager for the St. Louis area. \u201cWe are also expanding our offering soon to include flashlights, gloves, knives, and other gear.\u201d The showroom opens December 15 with a Holiday Welcome Event open to the public from 9:00am-4:00pm. As a former police officer, Marino knows firsthand what officers look for in gear. \u201cPropper\u2019s law enforcement products fit what patrol officers, detectives, and SWAT teams need on an everyday basis \u2013 from shirts, pants, and boots to concealed and tactical armor.\u201d In addition to a wide range of apparel and gear options, the new showroom will offer embroidery, hemming, and other services for local departments. Started in 1967 by William S. Propper, the company\u2019s first contract was making the iconic white Dixie Cup hats for the US Navy. Over the next five decades, Propper grew to become the largest supplier of military BDUs and ACUs. Building on its success as a military supplier, Propper added a commercial division in 1991 and today has a strong presence in the law enforcement and civilian tactical industries with offerings that include men\u2019s and women\u2019s tactical pants and shirts, jackets, boots, everyday carry bags, backpacks, and a full selection of NIJ-certified concealed and tactical body armor, including the innovative 4PV 4-panel vest line. About Propper Propper is proudly celebrating 50 years in business in 2017. Making tactical gear with a purpose has been a way of life for Propper since their first U.S. Navy contract in 1967. Today, Propper designs and manufactures tactical clothing and gear that keeps military, law enforcement, and public safety professionals protected whether they\u2019re in the service, on the job, or off for the weekend.
