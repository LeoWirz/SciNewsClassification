Brace Hemmelgarn-USA TODAY Sports \nThe LA Clippers are 8-14 and quickly plummeting down the West standings, but head coach Doc Rivers probably doesn\u2019t have to sleep with one eye open. \nSam Amick of USA TODAY Sports reported this week that Rivers\u2019 job is likely safe for this season, despite speculation that the coach is on the hot seat. Amick cited the injuries that have ravaged the Clippers\u2019 depth. \nPer Amick: \nThree people with knowledge of the situation say Rivers is likely safe for this season, with his championship resume still held in high regard and the injuries to four of five opening-night starters having made it unfair \u2013 in Ballmer\u2019s eyes \u2013 to accurately judge his coaching performance this season. \nIncluding in those injuries are five-time All-Star Blake Griffin, who could miss up to two months with an MCL sprain, and top perimeter defender Patrick Beverley, who is done for the season after undergoing microfracture surgery. Those are blows that would sink any team, so it sounds like Rivers can breathe easy for now, even if questions may still exist about his overall performance .

Pavely/Getty Images \nSteelers safety Mike Mitchell clearly does not want to see the NFL introduce more rules to affect how the game is played. \nThe NFL announced on Wednesday that it is considering introducing a targeting rule that would require mandatory ejections for players, and that seemed to be the tipping point for Mitchell. \nThe Steelers safety spoke to reporters in the locker room on Wednesday, and went off on an epic rant which included his thoughts about the physical nature of the game, ESPN analyst and former NFL quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and more. \n\u201cAt the end of the day this is football,\u201d Mitchell said, in a video produced by Mark Kaboly of The Athletic. \u201cYou wanna see flag football, then let\u2019s take our pads off. That would make it easier for me. Because now I don\u2019t gotta wear heavy s\u2014. But give us flags for me to pull off, because that way I know what we\u2019re playing. I signed up to play full-speed, contact football, and we\u2019re not doing that. I feel like I gotta ask a guy, \u2018Hey, are you ready for me to hit you right now?\u2019 before I hit you.\u201d \nMitchell also called out Hasselbeck for questioning his style of play. \n\u201cAnd at first you\u2019re taking our money, but now I got a\u2013holes like Matt Hasselbeck calling me a dirty player and trying my character and we\u2019ve never met before,\u201d he said. \u201cI donate more money to Cincinnati underprivileged kids than probably people on the Bengals.\u201d \nThe Steelers safety then addressed how he felt about Goodell, specifically how he believes the commissioner is inconsistent in his decision making process. \n\u201cWe got to get better leadership as who\u2019s running the league because obviously everybody from fans to owners, players are all disappointed in Roger Goodell,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe just got to do better. We can\u2019t have a guy where you just hand out discipline on how you see fit.\u201d \nIf interested, you can watch the entire rant in the video below. \nMike Mitchell absolutely killing it. Must watch. @TheAthleticPIT pic.twitter.com/SwcvJMJyHy \n\u2014 Mark Kaboly (@MarkKaboly) December 6, 2017 \nThere\u2019s obviously a lot to digest from that epic tirade, but a lot of current and former players would likely agree with what Mitchell had to say about the physical nature of the game.

Photo: AFP/Noel Celis Much of the Western world lined up to admonish Cambodia\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s ruling last month to dissolve the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), with the European Union and United States in the lead threatening punitive sanctions, including visa restrictions on complicit officials.\nBut Cambodia has found bonhomie among the world\u2019s autocracies, with China quick to say that it supported Phnom Penh\u2019s own path to development, which it has funded for years through generous aid packages and soft loans. Reports rightly noted that Chinese largesse has helped to underwrite Prime Minister Hun Sen\u2019s ongoing crackdown on political opponents, independent media and civil society.\nLess has been reported, however, on Russia\u2019s role.\nWeeks before the CNRP\u2019s closure, Hun Sen met his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, on the sidelines of a regional summit in Manila. Medvedev offered to send a team of observers to next year\u2019s election, which many observers have said would be a sham without the CNRP\u2019s participation.\nWhile China supports the Cambodian government economically, by reducing Phnom Penh\u2019s reliance on Western aid and loans Russia is offering to lend certain moral support for the clampdown. Hun Sen\u2019s Cambodian People\u2019s Party (CPP) has taken a sharp anti-Western line in recent weeks.\nThe ability of Moscow to affect global politics, including the US presidential election, through social media and Kremlin funded news stations is well-known. In this respect, Russian media has been conspicuously mute on the Cambodian situation.\nRussia\u2019s state-controlled broadcaster RT has been quiet on Cambodia\u2019s crackdown. Photo: AFP/Kirill Kudryavtsev \nRT, a popular international news network financed by the Kremlin, has not published one article about the CNRP\u2019s dissolution last month, despite the event garnering widespread international news coverage.\nThe only two articles published by RT on Cambodia in recent months are related to Phnom Penh ordering the closure of the National Democratic Institute, a US State Department-funded democracy promoting outfit.\nBoth articles on the issue feature a typically heavy anti-American tinge, with one headline quoting Hun Sen calling US democracy \u201cbloody\u201d and \u201cbrutal.\u201d Moscow\u2019s repressive tactics, on the other hand, have long been a source of inspiration and replication for other aspiring autocracies.\nIn September, when the Cambodian government moved to close the  Cambodia Daily , an American-owned independent newspaper, it did so over taxation issues. Russia\u2019s government has long used its Federal Tax Service to intimidate and shutter critical nongovernmental organizations and media.\nLast month, Russia\u2019s Parliament passed legislation that could demand foreign media organizations operating in the country to register as \u201cforeign agents.\u201d Cambodia\u2019s crackdown on its independent media bears a striking resemblance.\nA woman buys a copy of the final issue of The Cambodia Daily at a street stall in Phnom Penh on September 4, 2017. Photo: Reuters / Samrang Pring In August, Phnom Penh went on the attack against Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Voice of America (VOA), two US Congress-funded news agencies which have long been accused by the CPP government of fomenting anti-government propaganda from overseas.\nOver 20 radio stations that carried RFA and VOA news programs were closed in the provinces on the grounds they had abused their operating contracts. RFA closed its office in Cambodia in September.\nPa Nguon Teang, director of local radio station Voice of Democracy and founder of the Cambodian Center for Independent Media, was branded a \u201cforeign agent\u201d in August by Council of Ministers spokesman Phay Siphan.\nIn 2012, Russia became one of the world\u2019s first autocracies to pass a law requiring NGOs that receive funding from abroad to register themselves as \u201cforeign agents,\u201d a term that Moscow\u2019s propaganda machine now considers as \u201cspies.\u201d\nSome analysts believe the move gave inspiration to the likes of Egypt, Hungary and China to pass similar legislation.\nRussian leader Vladimir Putin in a file photo. Photo: Reuters/Dmitri Lovetsky Cambodia\u2019s Law on Associations and Non-Governmental Organizations (LANGO), passed amid controversy in 2015, contains no such requirement for NGOs to designate themselves as \u201cforeign agents,\u201d though it does require them to be \u201cpolitically neutral,\u201d a vague and broad term.\nBut the same narrative that foreign influence is equivalent to subversion underlines the government\u2019s response to independent NGOs.\nLast month, Hun Sen told the Interior Ministry to investigate and potentially close the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR), a prominent NGO founded by jailed opposition leader Kem Sokha, because \u201cthey follow foreigners.\u201d The CCHR has so far avoided closure.\nIt remains unclear whether Moscow has had any direct influence over Phnom Penh\u2019s repressive strategies or if the Cambodian government is simply imitating its actions.\nNikolai Patrushev, a former director of the Russian Federal Security Service, the KGB\u2019s successor, and now the Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, met with Hun Sen in February ostensibly to discuss anti-terrorism collaboration.\nIn retrospect, there are now suspicions that the two discussed other issues as Hun Sen may have been preparing his crackdown on the political opposition and foreign-backed NGOs.\nPolice officers stand guard near the Supreme Court of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, October 31, 2017. Photo: Reuters/Samrang Pring What is clear is that Phnom Penh now sees its future with China and Russia, not Western democracies. In a speech in September, Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn announced that the \u201cthe West has become weak\u201d before praising Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s leadership style.\nThe Phnom Penh Post reported that he also said \u201cCambodia\u2019s foreign policy future lay with China and Russia.\u201d Part of the incipient shift is likely due to Russia being one of the most vocal \u2013 and most hypocritical \u2013 proponents of non-interventionism.\nLast month, Cambodia joined Russia and China in a ten-nation grouping that voted against a mild United Nations draft resolution on the ethnic cleansing of ethnic Rohingya in Myanmar which if passed would have called on Naypyidaw to protect the persecuted minority group\u2019s rights.\n\u201cFor us, the principle of no interference is a very big thing,\u201d Hen Sen said after his country\u2019s vote at the UN.\nSome analysts put this down to the Association of Southeast Asian Nation\u2019s (Asean) long history of non-interference in member states\u2019 internal affairs. Four other Asean members \u2013 Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and the Philippines \u2013 voted against the UN motion, meaning the bloc\u2019s other five nations voted for it.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin (R) and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen (L) at an Asean-Russia summit on May 20, 2016. Photo: Anadolu Agency via AFP A more likely explanation is that the non-interventionist doctrine, well-versed by Russia, has become a necessary defense mechanism for Phnom Penh against democratic nation criticism, including from the US and EU. Both are now weighing potentially crippling economic sanctions.\nMoscow apparently sees that censure as an opportunity. There are already indications that Cambodia and Russia are trying to form a closer economic alliance. Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn visited Moscow in August, where he spoke about boosting trade with Russia by 2020, including the possibility of creating a Cambodia-Russia Business Council.\nBilateral trade in goods was worth only about US$110 million in 2015, compared to the US$3.4 billion recorded between Cambodia and the US that year. In the second quarter of this year, total trade with Russia was worth US$34.1 million, up roughly 15% from the same period last year.\nThe ruble\u2019s hard decline in 2014 undercut Russian tourism to Cambodia, though there are signs that numbers are picking up again. Earlier this year, Tourism Minister Thong Khon outlined a new strategy to boost Russian arrivals, including new direct flights from Russia and bilateral tourism forums.\nNuclear cooperation is also on the cards.\nLast year, Russian and Cambodian government departments signed many memoranda to develop the latter\u2019s nuclear energy sector, including the building of an Information Center for Atomic Energy in Phnom Penh. It will reportedly be advised by Rosatom, Russia\u2019s state nuclear firm.\nAnother intergovernmental agreement was signed in September in Vienna to boost cooperation between the two nations for the development of nuclear energy for peaceful means.\nA money changer in Phnom Penh. Photo: Reuters/Samrang Pring Whether Russia is willing to buy influence in Cambodia will be seen if it decides to write-off or revise down the US$1.5 billion Soviet-era debt Cambodia incurred during the 1980s. Phnom Penh has long called on Moscow to cancel the debt.\nAmerica attracted Cambodia\u2019s opprobrium earlier this year when Hun Sen revived the issue of a US$500 million debt Phnom Penh owes dating back to the 1970s. The US government has long said Cambodia must pay the debt incurred during a US-backed rightist regime which Hun Sen this year referred to \u201cblood-stained\u201d and \u201cdirty.\u201d\nRussia seldom attracts criticism for maintaining its historic debt with Cambodia, worth three times as much as America\u2019s.  When Hen Sen broached the subject with Medvedev last month, the Russian premier reportedly promised to establish a working group to study the issue.\nMoscow made the same vow in 2014, but failed to propose a mutually agreed resolution.\nSome analysts believe Moscow might restructure the debt, though probably not write it off, in a bid to deepen bilateral inroads. One scenario, they say, would give Russia special access to Cambodia\u2019s ports and resource extraction contracts in exchange for a debt write-down.\nGiven that Cambodia\u2019s total national debt was US$6.2 billion as of June this year, representing roughly 28% of GDP, any such gesture would be well-received in Phnom Penh at a time it braces for the pinch of US and EU sanctions imposed against its anti-democratic backsliding.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hun sen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name":

There are many kinds of yeast, torula yeast is one of its kind, it can be found worldwide in many types of settings, such as cellulose-rich substrate that includes leaf litter, paper pulp, and wood. Many regions cultivate wood pulp torula yeast for industrial usage. Torula yeast is the best replacement for MSG and therefore majorly brought in use as a food additive due to its property of producing glutamic acids which when combined with nucleotides lend foods a strong savory character. Torula yeast is used in processed foods such as soups, pasta, rice mixes, snack food, salad dressings, processed meats, gravies, and sauces. Many people prefer gluten free food, due to celiac disease or any other allergic reason. It becomes tricky to figure out gluten free diet as gluten is found in many foods made with wheat, barley or rye. Torula is not made from these grains hence it is a naturally extracted gluten free yeast. Request for Report Sample @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/14737 Global Torula Yeast Market: Drivers & Restraints The ever growing demand for processed food products and the convenience food products has enhanced the growth of torula yeast across the globe. Rising demand of yeast as a flavor enhancer is driving the market of all kind of yeast. Many people are allergic to gluten and prefer gluten free diet; this preference accelerates the demand of torula yeast among other yeast. As compared to other yeast, torula yeast is less expensive and is a better alternative for MSG, dashi and veal stock which were used as the source for umami flavor. Torula yeast is also very much in demand in the paper industry. Another boosting factor for torula yeast is the increasing demand of MSG, a synthetic flavor enhancer in snack food products. In upcoming years MSG market is expected to grow substantially. Studies have highlighted that torula yeast is an adequate replacement of MSG. Although demand and necessity of torula yeast in the market can be seen broadly, sometimes it can cause an adverse effect to the people who are sensitive to allergies. Though it is considered as a safe edible yeast but for some individuals who are very much allergic to MSG may have the same reaction if they consume torula yeast. Request for Report TOC @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/14737 Global Torula Yeast Market: Regional Outlook Based on the geographies, torula yeast market is segmented into seven regions \u2013 North America torula yeast market, Latin America torula yeast market, Eastern Europe torula yeast market, Western Europe torula yeast market, Asia Pacific excluding Japan torula yeast market, Japan torula yeast market and the Middle East & Africa torula yeast market. The consumption of processed foods including salad dressing, snack foods, seasoning blends, processed meats, soups, rice and pasta, and sauces; as well as consumption of beverages in countries such as U.S, Canada, Mexico made North America and Latin America dominating region in the market of torula yeast. The second leading region is Eastern and Western Europe where countries such as Germany, France, Italy, U.K and Spain practices torula yeast mostly in processed meat. Asia Pacific excluding Japan is an emerging region because of the developing countries such as China, India rising in intake of processed food.

Insects for instance, can breed much faster and in larger quantities compared to other species of animals, which is why when an infestation begins, it would be best to immediately take action and the necessary steps in its removal. Otherwise, the problem will only become bigger and it will be harder to get rid of it later on and may even cause more property damage and potential health hazards to you and the other inhabitants within the property.\n\nLuckily, there exist numerous bureaus and competent professionals that you may request this intention.

The research report, titled \u201cDigital Pathology Systems Market \u2013 Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2014 \u2013 2020,\u201d states that the worldwide market for digital pathology systems attained a value of US$229 mn in 2013. Digital pathology is defined as an image-based information environment for the management, the analysis, and the interpretation of the information achieved from a digital slide. This technology has gained momentum in the global medical and healthcare industry, owing to the improvements it brings in a number of application such as drug discoveries and their development, diagnostic tests, and other academic and research application. Consequently, digital pathology systems are witnessing rapid adoption in the medical and healthcare industry. Read Report @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/digital-pathology-systems.html The ability of digital pathology systems to effectively validate and identify novel drugs, to create molecular therapies, and to categorize patients for treatment procedures is boosting their demand remarkably across the world. According to the report, the rising need for cancer detection, propelled by the increasing incidence of cancer across the world, is the key factor fuelling the demand for digital pathology systems. The research study has evaluated the global pathology systems market on the basis of technology and application. Based on technology, the market was led by the virtual microscopy segment in 2013. Analysts have predicted that this segment will remain the leading segment over the forecast period due to the rising digitization of microscopic slides and the increasing usage of virtual microscopy in the diagnosis of diseases and in drug discoveries. Based on application, the disease diagnosis segment dominated the global digital pathology systems in 2013. The segment is projected to witness steady growth during the forecast period on account of a favorable reimbursement scenario, notes the study. The report also analyzes the global digital pathology systems market on the basis of its regional spread. North America emerged as the largest regional digital pathology systems market in 2013.

I'm only joking, but if you need some jewellery or watch inspiration why not check out my jewellery and watch wishlist for Christmas 2017. \nWith a range of watches and jewellery for ladies everywhere, I have covered something for most ages and styles.  \nFor the fashion conscious watch lover \nSkagen Anita Rose Gold Plated Mesh Bracelet Watch \u00a3165 F Hinds \nI love the brand Skagen, and yet I am still to own a watch by them.  This needs to be resolved straight away, so I am going to leave my Mac open on this page for Mr W to see. The Danish-designed watch and jewellery brand are su per cool at the moment and I love this Skagen Anita rose gold plated mesh bracelet watch. The watch band is slim and sleek, the rose colour catches the light and the design is simple yet chic. Available online and on the high street from F Hinds jewellery and watches.  \nFor the stacking ring lover \nSterling silver Serenity stacking ring set \u00a3423 Dower and Hall \nThis sterling silver Twinkle ring set by British company Dower and Hall features a 3mm round aquamarine on a wavey band, a marquise blue topaz on a plain dotty band, an oval white topaz on a granular dotty twinkle ring, a plain dotty ring and a 3mm white sapphire on a wavey peapod band.  What I love about these rings is that they are so versatile. Wear on their own, or stack them how you wish for a fashion statement. \n\nFor the one you love \n\nPaloma Picasso Loving Heart necklace 18 ct \u00a3795 Tiffany and Co. \nI adore this Paloma Picasso Loving Heart necklace from Tiffany and Co . In 18 ct rose gold, this dainty design of four hearts with a diamond at the centre is adorable and would make a great gift for someone you love. Packaged in the trademark Tiffany and Co box, she will be delighted with this necklace on Christmas morning.\n\nFor the Disney collector \nPandora Disney Cinderella bracelet \u00a3635 John Greed Jewellery \nPandora is a name many of you will know and this bracelet will be loved by many out there. Incredibly girly with lots of sparkles, this Pandora Disney Cinderella bracelet i s perfect for Disney fans everywhere. I particularly think the heart charm with the quote \"a dream is a wish your heart makes\" is super cute. Priced at \u00a3635 from John Greed Jewellery it's not cheap for sure but it is beautiful. \n\nFor a twist on a Christmas engagement \nMorganite and Diamond Halo engagement ring \u00a32195 Browns Family Jewellers  \nChristmas and New Year is a time of year that people propose.  If you want something slightly more unusual than a classic diamond engagement ring then I think this Morganite and Diamond halo engagement ring fits the bill perfectly from Browns Family Jewellers . The pinky-orange hue morganite is offset by the array of brilliant cut diamonds. A real showstopper this ring is simply stunning.\n\nFor the health and fitness fan \nHybrid Smartwatch Q Gazer \u00a3179 Fossil \nCombining style with functionality, this Hybrid smartwatch Q Gazer from Fossil . has a built-in activity tracker that can track steps, distance and calories burned. Compatible with Android OS 5 and above and iPhone 5 and OS 9 and above, its a cool watch that does so much more than tell the time and I like the mix of navy and rose gold. \nFor the drop earring connoisseur  Light of Luna earrings \u00a3179 Thomas Sabo \nI really like these silver drop earrings by Thomas Sabo . The white zirconia crystals add a touch of sparkle and the blue synthetic corundum has a faceted look. A lovely pair of earrings to wear out for a meal, to a Christmas party or for Christmas dinner. \nSo this is my jewellery and watches wishlist for Christmas 2017. Do you have any jewellery or watches on your Christmas wishlist? What do you think of the items I have chosen? \n*PR collaboration ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas sabo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pandora disney cinderella", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tiffany and co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skagen anita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tiffany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skagen anita rose gold plated", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john greed jewellery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paloma picasso loving heart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john greed jewellery  pandora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "browns family jewellers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "skagen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:08.038+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3741b60b881dec66f6460fde197cdd08b3350675", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBt.zJBM7pyqAnpFZ8mbo7DspoLXjBnUY6xaX6eVTVlduMWfQAS8Th47DawxHEreC9SfVdeWgfdCsWz40oHJB8O4l84BlyKfNinjqXfmOfZolMvn4ziqTP", "site_full": "forums.macrumors.com", "site": "macrumors.com", "site_section": "http://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch-accessories.173/", "site_categories": ["mac_support", "tech"], "section_title": "Apple Watch Accessories | MacRumors Forums", "title": "Every Apple Watch band Apple released.

The army didn't want to define intelligence but to classify the recruits quickly; the authorities look for help from psychologists. Have a look at the following article taking us through the topic Army Psychological Testing Atlanta facts.\n\nBefore a trader decides what forex trading strategies to use, it is even more important for him or her to know an exact, reasonable and realistic financial goal. Since there is no one who can predict and mention what that tolerance level is going to be. This is especially for those who are employing brokers, speak ahead in your mind that you would not be wooed by any of their talks that may drive you into a greater risk than you do not want to run into.\n\nUnderstanding information: This test is intended to review you are reading ability and also your understanding of what you have read. The reading material will be of a type you will experience as a firefighter in your day to day work. You will be tested in six scenarios and be expected to retrieve the relevant information from the reading materials. There are a total of 25 questions in all. Reading materials may include training course notes, memos, fire safety in sequence, and newsletters.\n\nThe emotional ordeals can unveil many things like - if you are more of a team person or one who prefers to work alone if you have anger issues and other things. The tests can also reveal how honest a person is and your answers will reveal if you are a trustworthy or a dishonest person. The army mental analysis should be answered honestly.\n\nThirty questions in all are asking you to choose the answer that most reflects what you would do. You do not need any knowledge of operational procedures to complete the test just a common sense approach to the safety of yourself and others around you. You will also have to complete the National Firefighter opinion poll as a part of the Firefighter submission mental testing phases.\n\nHow do you go about finding solutions to problems, whether they are physical, emotional, vocational, or recreational? Usually, the start of the solution process involves problem or goal definition. It doesn't make much sense to jump right in and solve something, without first knowing what it is that requires a solution.\n\nEach question looks at a specific area of one of the scales. Functioning with others - you can toil successfully with others either surrounded by the FRS or within the civic. Pledge to assortment and truthfulness - you appreciate and revere assortment and you can assume a blond and principled advance towards other people. You can uphold a confident and pliant attitude in highly demanding and thorny situations.\n\nGoing through the internet searching you will surely find it hard to get information about the army psychological test. This is because the army authorities don't want to reveal too much about the exam. It is their only way to determine or screen out the potential soldiers that will serve the nation best. Prepare yourself for the test and be honest at all times!\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are looking for the facts about psychological testing Atlanta residents can visit our web pages today.

At this time, about 374 heresies threatened to destroy the Church\u2013the Bishop had supported the Arian heresy that argued against the divinity of Christ. Who would take his place an Arian or a Catholic? Both sides met in the cathedral and a riot broke out. \nPublic order was Ambrose\u2019s responsibility as Governor, so he hurried to the church and made a passionate speech not in favor of either side but in favor for peace, begging the people to make their choice without a fight, using restraint and moderation. \nSuddenly while he was speaking, a voice called out \u201cAmbrose for Bishop.\u201d Soon everyone was shouting, \u201cAmbrose for Bishop.\u201d \nThe other Bishops of the Province were only to glad to have this controversial decision taken out of their hands but Ambrose was not about to give up his successful career for the dangerous position as Bishop\u2013a life threatening position in these heretical times, so Ambrose ran away. \nWhen he appealed to his friend the Emperor to overturn the decision on the grounds that he hadn\u2019t even been baptized yet, the Emperor answered that he was happy that he chose Governor\u2019s fit for the episcopal office\u2013Ambrose hid in a Senator\u2019s house but the Senator surrendered Ambrose when he heard about the Emperor\u2019s decision. \nWith nowhere else to run, Ambrose gave in. Since he had been forced to take the position, no one would have been surprised if he\u2019d decide to keep on living the way he had before ordination. Instead, Ambrose immediately gave all of his property to the poor, making only provisions for his Sister Marcellina (who later became a Nun) and committed the care of his family to his brother\u2013raising Ambrose\u2019s popularity even more\u2026 \nFull Biography here of Saint Ambrose from Catholic Online", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bishop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emperor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cristy li saint ambrose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ambrose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcellina", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "st ambrose", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "milan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:10.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e5a007b05f1b5ae714dcc34a8e14a6552a6fa04", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKwQ8dgA6TtKLhimg0c0wM4DI5ZvIEZoF7g--", "site_full": "community.nxp.com", "site": "nxp.com", "site_section": "https://community.nxp.com/content?start=40", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Browse - Content | NXP Community", "title": "ADC in KL03 config sample code", "title_full": "ADC in KL03 config sample code | NXP Community", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.027, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15430, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e5a007b05f1b5ae714dcc34a8e14a6552a6fa04", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKwQ8dgA6TtKLhimg0c0wM4DI5ZvIEZoF7g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "raff5184", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "ADC in KL03 config sample code", "text": "Has anyone a guide/sample code of how to initialize/configure the ADC receiving a voltage input from PTA12?\nI'm having a hard time understanding:\n1.

These news has now been confirmed by the Italians, who are saying that Milanese club is set to sell their number 10.\nIt is also suggested that Inter is ready to give up on versatile midfielder for 26 million pounds, although they have spent 40 million pounds to bring him from Sporting Lisbon only a year and a half ago. The 24-year-old Portuguese came as a major boost after great performances in domestic league where he was one of the best players.\nHe was expected to be the \u201ctrequartista\u201d in the Neroazzuri team. However, it didn\u2019t work very well for him in Italy. Since coming, he has made 43 appearances in all competitions scoring only 3 goals and providing 11 assists. This season he played 10 matches, but was primarily used a substitute bythe coach Luciano Spalletti, who was relaying on more experienced Borja Valero and MatiasVecino.\nIt is reported that the former Sporting CP player is dissatisfied with his current status, and coach Spalletti in an interview for Gazzettadello Sport said: \u201cJoao Mario? I know him well. I wasn\u2019t surprised by his words. It\u2019s only right that he wants to play more often and I consider him good enough to be a starter, but whoever\u2019s played in his place hasn\u2019t done badly.\u201d This statement only additionally confirmed the likely departure of versatile midfielder in January transfer window. Arsenal is reported to be one of the potential buyers. The Gunners wants to put more competition in midfield department, especially due to large oscillations in Mesut Ozil\u2019s game. There is also an eternal question regarding Alexis Sanchez, who seems to be close to finally complete his move to Manchester City, while PSG always looks as a possible destination.\nWenger does not count seriously on Jack Wilshere in the Premier League; Ramsey is injury prone, while Coquelin and Xhaka are both defensive minded. Therefore, an eventual arrival of Joao Mario seems to be a very realistic option, especially if we have in mind a sum of 26 million pounds, which is a very favorable price considering the situation on the market. In the meantime, Arsenal will face Huddersfield on Wednesday and it\u2019s expected to be an easy 3 points for the Gunners. Although Lacazette and company have won 5 of their last home games in the Premier League, Huddersfield proved to be a very tough team to beat this season.\nThey are defending well and are dangerous on counter-attacks. But Arsenal has to win this one if they want to improve their chances in Champions League race. The home side is a huge favorite ahead of this match. Their odds of winning are high and bookies can check the best betting offers and bonuses online. Bookies are always trying to find the better odds and this platform provides best offers and bonuses on the market. Arsenal\u2019s victory is probably not called into question and if Wenger\u2019s side manages to grab the opening goal quickly, we could be witnessing a \u201cgoleada\u201d on Emirates. Bookmarkers\u2019 platform such as bet365 often add onto the hype but all in all it is the two sets of fans that bring about the raw emotion and create the electrifying atmosphere out of a match of such a magnitude. Click here to read bet365 mobile review .\nOn the other hand, it is hard to expect that Mario can replace Ozil in an adequate way; Turkish star has shown a top class and has become one of the best players in the championship since coming to the North London side. Yet, Arsene Wenger is known as a coach who likes to have mobile and technically gifted midfielders at his disposal and Joao Mario fits perfectly into this profile. If he can regain the form from Sporting CP, he may prove to be a very serious reinforcement. With great vision and deadly through balls, he could bring a new dimension into the Arsenal\u2019s attack.\nBut, English club Arsenal will apparently have to face a tough competitor for Joao Mario\u2019s signature, as some media reported last week about alleged interest of PSG in Portuguese international. And the player didn\u2019t want to deny speculations regarding the possible January transfer. In the interview for local newspaper, he said: \u201cRumors are normal, they\u2019re part of football, I\u2019m always focused, I\u2019m not distracted because I\u2019m used to. It\u2019s still early, there\u2019s still a long time before the January market.
