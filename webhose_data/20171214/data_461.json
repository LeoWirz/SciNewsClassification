Assembled in less than a day, the prefabricated building is the latest work of Olivier Grossetete , a prolific French artist who specializes in cardboard architecture. Those who hope to gaze upon the temple of cardboard should hurry\u2014the ephemeral building will come down on Sunday for recycling. \n\n\nTemples are woven into the urban fabric of Thailand , and this new Thai temple of cardboard is no exception. The ephemeral building is located at Tha Phae Gate, an ancient city gate on the east side of the Old City and a popular site for community events. Built for Chiang Mai Design Week , the temporary pavilion will stay up for the duration of the five-day event, held every year to celebrate the city\u2019s creative talents. \n\n\nFrench embassy official Vanessa Silvy facilitated the project, bringing Marseille-born artist Olivier Grossetete and his design team in contact with TCDC Chiang Mai , an educational design center and resource, as well as the cardboard box supplier Siam Cement Group (SCG). \n\n\nA prolific artist, Olivier Grosstete began dabbling in cardboard 15 years ago and now installs cardboard architecture around the world. He recently completed cardboard projects in five cities in China two weeks prior to Chiang Mai. The crux of his work goes beyond just cardboard. His site-specific projects focus on community and collaboration, and take a team of volunteers\u2014often people who begin as curious passersby\u2014to realize the giant cardboard buildings. \n\u201cEach time I\u2019m invited to a city, I try to work with the image of existing buildings,\u201d said Olivier Grosstete to Inhabitat. \u201cFor example, I might make a cardboard Eiffel Tower in Paris or some special monument of the city. But every time the city and the people will help choose what will be built, like with this temple that\u2019s based off of a famous Chiang Mai attraction.\u201d \n\n\nThe Chiang Mai installation measures 11 by 14 meters at the base and 15 meters at its highest point. Construction began with a four-day workshop, where a team of 20 to 30 students and volunteers from the community helped construct the individual architectural elements. The pieces were marked in the order of assembly before being transported to the site. The building process shares similarities with traditional Thai construction, particularly temples, which were historically prefabricated for easy disassembly and reconstruction.\nRelated: Modular Wikkelhouse wrapped in 24 layers of cardboard snaps together in a day \n\n\nNo ladders or cranes were used in assembly. \u201cWe started with assembling the roof,\u201d explains Grosstete. \u201cAnd after, with the audience, we lifted the completed roof and slid the next pieces underneath and taped them together.\u201d\n\u201cConstruction is simple in the beginning because it\u2019s very light,\u201d adds Silvy about the bottom-up assembly process that began with the roof ended with the supporting pillars. \u201cWe had 40 people assembling the building. Other people who came by also began to help. It\u2019s amazing because we might not speak the same language, but we can communicate with each other just through body movement.\u201d As a safety precaution against strong winds, two ropes are attached to the building and anchored by 1,000-liter water tanks on opposite sides. \n\n\n\u201cThe goal of the project is, of course, to create a beautiful building,\u201d says Silvy. \u201cBut more importantly, this building teaches us that you may go faster alone, but work together and you\u2019ll go farther.\u201d She described how, in addition to the existing team of builders, curious passersby joined in assembly as well. Some of those people ended up staying the entire day. \nThe teardown of the cardboard temple will take place on Sunday, December 6 from 4 to 6 PM. SCG will take the cardboard away for recycling. Olivier Grosstete will be traveling to Sardinia on Saturday for his next cardboard project. He has completed 25 cardboard projects to date this year.\n+ Olivier Grosstete \nImages \u00a9 Lucy Wang \n\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chiang mai", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "olivier grosstete", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tcdc chiang mai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanessa silvy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grosstete", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silvy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olivier grossetete", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucy wang", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "scg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chiang mai design week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siam cement group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "old city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sardinia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eiffel tower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tha phae gate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inhabitat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:19.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e4dcaf468490a5946b8a00737c791feb8a9eb0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kdgErVlnrHOGeS1xF_bHucHwhN7jQOAlbK6lTgHzG47iG2MUq2iiq98n0.NE.pXAvwPkSuj3PitcHJDc2dInj788ePw_D4wk-", "site_full": "www.borderlandbeat.com", "site": "borderlandbeat.com", "site_section": "http://www.borderlandbeat.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Borderland Beat", "title": "AeroMulas: The Women Drug Mules of Heroin", "title_full": "AeroMulas: The Women Drug Mules of Heroin", "published": "2017-12-06T02:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1224035bf8c8a2eb6ed54e46776211157c677e3c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kdgErVlnrHOGeS1xF_bHucHwhN7jQOAlbK6lTgHzG47iG2MUq2iiq98n0.NE.pXAvwPkSuj3PitcHJDc2dInjsJZSc2c4MaRJceezVXzNkg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T02:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Big fish, this guy took over after Taliban got pinched", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:19.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "016e4ae9dd7fc045805624d23aadb27c6ce18073", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_bowCbYcHE0tbP1nwOIzgmHrESaL0So09hVJtG_UXugSRasLkEZEU2bl5UEcj1qu.d_XP225BaKTEeDUbKyv4q3Q9OXHTrA7Q-", "site_full": "www.bcinemaindia.in", "site": "bcinemaindia.in", "site_section": "http://bcinemaindia.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BCinema India: Bollywood Cinema News", "title": "Move over Emoji; Jomoji featuring John Abraham is here!", "title_full": "Move over Emoji; Jomoji featuring John Abraham is here!", "published": "2017-12-07T11:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/T40nd1r6lcZW3rkSGLVMs0pkYrGuby3tfXnjWz2cJaJgD2rN3ZKxxtO38Q3gWYQY8TinB-Qbyun1i0x7lIqp-luolro56bcxiJQA0ee7ueVX07wptPLv99AkNjsV38E2jBASeSKKDSJCq9VjI5qzczws4Nk2aVm-ljv3sMhCI2W3vW7prjJp89_h=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "016e4ae9dd7fc045805624d23aadb27c6ce18073", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_bowCbYcHE0tbP1nwOIzgmHrESaL0So09hVJtG_UXugSRasLkEZEU2bl5UEcj1qu.d_XP225BaKTEeDUbKyv4q3Q9OXHTrA7Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (Rachna Purohit)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "Move over Emoji; Jomoji featuring John Abraham is here!", "text": "Move over Emoji; Jomoji featuring John Abraham is here!  //ift.tt/2AyWAOF \nIn today\u2019s times, emojis have become an indispensable part of our communication. At one point, they were mostly used on desktop messaging softwares and in case of phones, they were used in the forms of text based emoticons. But the advent of smartphones and mobile messaging apps has led to an increase in the use of emojis. These cute little yellow things have also become more elaborate and expressive and no wonder that their popularity refuses to die down. \nThanks to the craze for the emojis, few celebrities have opted for custom emojis and it has also been received well. In Bollywood, not many have tried it and taking advantage of it, John Abraham has jumped into the bandwagon. His range of emojis are called \u2018Jomoji\u2019 and the actor announced about this venture on his social media handles today by uploading an interesting picture. It features John Abraham in different poses and avatars and the central picture has him hiding his left eye with his hand and giving out a cute smile. As of now, these are exclusively available on the App store for all the iOS users. It remains to be seen if it\u2019ll be available on the Android platform, which is majorly used by people across the world. \nThis trend of having a customized emojis is not new. In the past, Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber, Amber Rose, Rick Ross, Charlie Sheen etc have also had their own emojis. Closer home in Bollywood, Sonam Kapoor and Sunny Leone have launched their own line of emojis. \nOn the film front, John Abraham was last seen in Force 2 , co-starring Sonakshi Sinha, which released last year. He\u2019ll be now seen in Parmanu , produced him, and releases on February 23, 2018. It also stars Diana Penty and Boman Irani.

When we were posing for the photo, he stuck his hand up my dress and grabbed onto my ass cheek. I squirmed and lurched sideways to get away from him, but he wouldn\u2019t let go,\u201d Swift recalled. \n\u201cAt the time, I was headlining a major arena tour and there were a number of people in the room that saw this plus a photo of it happening. I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances and high stakes, imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance. It was important to report the incident to his radio station because I felt like they needed to know. The radio station conducted its own investigation and fired him. Two years later, he sued me.\u201d \nSwift went on to detail how the court proceedings affected her emotions and that of her mother. \u201cWhen I testified, I had already been in court all week and had to watch this man\u2019s attorney bully, badger and harass my team including my mother over insane details and ridiculous minutiae, accusing them, and me, of lying. \n\u201cMy mum was so upset after her cross-examination, she was physically too ill to come to court the day I was on the stand. I was angry. In that moment, I decided to forgo any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened. This man hadn\u2019t considered any formalities when he assaulted me, and his lawyer didn\u2019t hold back on my mum \u2014 why should I be polite?\u201d \nSwift also shares a message for women who may find themselves in a similar situation. \u201cYou might be made to feel like you\u2019re overreacting, because society has made this stuff seem so casual. My advice is that you do not blame yourself and do not accept the blame others will try to place on you. \n\u201cYou should not be blamed for waiting 15 minutes, 15 days or 15 years to report sexual assault or harassment, or for the outcome of what happens to a person after he or she makes the choice to sexually harass or assault you.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "taylor swift", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tay tay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swift", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david mueller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "time", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:19.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4fe36dd52cf529d07904a7b6eec81e0057eba4bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.IN.dxT4AmEhxKyiJpGT4U5Bb_XdMd_CxyS11WCS4ZEBT_MOrkZJoocAL_EHcHhPgmm1vQXhFqjAO8zpvWFcnNbtvNn3etHZ.5AyOkVHk6oSwbukYe0rNkIpFuTGfHLAU-", "site_full": "www.themalaymailonline.com", "site": "themalaymailonline.com", "site_section": "http://www.themalaymailonline.com/feed/rss\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Malay Mail Online | All", "title": "Liverpool\u2019s Moreno a doubt for Everton clash, says Klopp", "title_full": "Liverpool\u2019s Moreno a doubt for Everton clash, says Klopp", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.themalaymailonline.com/uploads/articles/2017/2017-09/2017-09-23T165856Z_1455404393_RC1E454D2F60_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-ENGLAND-LEI-LIV.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19647, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4fe36dd52cf529d07904a7b6eec81e0057eba4bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.IN.dxT4AmEhxKyiJpGT4U5Bb_XdMd_CxyS11WCS4ZEBT_MOrkZJoocAL_EHcHhPgmm1vQXhFqjAO8zpvWFcnNbtvNn3etHZ.5AyOkVHk6oSwbukYe0rNkIpFuTGfHLAU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "Liverpool\u2019s Moreno a doubt for Everton clash, says Klopp", "text": "Liverpool\u2019s Moreno a doubt for Everton clash, says Klopp Thursday December 7, 2017 Print Article \nLiverpool\u2019s Philippe Coutinho celebrates scoring their second goal against Leicester City with Alberto Moreno in Leicester September 23, 2017. Moreno may sit out of the Everton clash this Sunday. \u2014 Reuters pic LONDON, Dec 7 \u2014 Liverpool defender Alberto Moreno is doubtful for Sunday\u2019s Merseyside derby against Everton after sustaining an injury in yesterday\u2019s 7-0 Champions League win over Spartak Moscow, manager Juergen Klopp has said. \nA tearful Moreno was substituted close to halftime after a collision with Spartak\u2019s Roman Zobnin as Liverpool sealed progression to the last 16 as group winners but Klopp is hopeful that the 25-year-old\u2019s injury is not too serious. \n\u201cWe had a little shadow on the night when Alberto Moreno needed to get substituted. It was a strange situation. He is a tough guy and if he cannot continue the game then you should consider it could be something serious.\u201d Klopp told reporters. \n\u201cIn the treatment room then, he was a little bit more positive, so maybe we are lucky and it\u2019s not too serious. We will see. \n\u201cWe need all the boys for the next few weeks, but especially in this week for the next game on Sunday...\u201d \nLiverpool\u2019s last 7-0 win came in a Champions League game against NK Maribor in October that was followed by a thumping 4-1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur and Klopp has urged his side to avoid another poor return to league action. \n\u201cWe showed tonight that we learned from the mistakes we made in Sevilla (where the side blew a three-goal halftime advantage to draw 3-3)... now we have to show we have learned from the mistakes after Maribor when we faced Tottenham,\u201d Klopp added. \n\u201cWe will be ready again on Sunday and if the crowd is ready to help us, it would be nice.\u201d \nLiverpool are fourth in the table and will be looking to reduce the 14-point deficit to league leaders Manchester City, who travel to second-placed Manchester United on Sunday, with a win in the Merseyside derby. \nAfter a poor start to the campaign, Everton have lost just one of their last five league games to climb to 10th in the standings but the Toffees have not beaten Liverpool in 14 encounters since a 2-0 league win in 2010. \u2014 Reuters",

Both Regulations provided that the European Commission should by 26 November 2017, by means of implementing acts, draw up a list of codes and corresponding types of device. The purpose of the list is specification of the scope of the designation of notified bodies.\nThe purpose of the codes is to categorise the fields of expertise of the notified bodies and thereby designate their scope. Notified bodies are now able to express their intention concerning the designation they plan to request on the basis of this list of codes.\nThe published list of codes for designation under the MDR does not vary widely compared to those in the public consultation version published on 27 September 2017. One small but significant difference is that Code 1002 concerns devices manufactured utilising tissues or cells of human origin while Code 1002 of the draft version made reference to devices manufactured using tissues or cells of animal origin. Code 1003 of the final official version relates to devices manufactured using tissues or cells of animal origin. \nThere are significantly more changes for designation of notified bodies under the IVDR. The draft list from 27 September 2017 and the official published list vary substantially. About 20 codes have been removed from the draft version and several editorial changes have been made. In particular, Section 4 \u201cIn vitro diagnostic devices which require specific knowledge in laboratory and clinical disciplines for the purpose of product verification\u201d has changed coding.\nWhen notified bodies submit their application forms, available on NBOG\u2019s website, they are required to list the scope of their planned activities by choosing the relevant codes.\nHowever, it is unlikely that notified bodies will be designated under the MDR and IVDR in the near future. NBOG\u2019s Best Practice Guide on the designation and notification of conformity assessment bodies suggested that the first notified bodies to apply for designation will have a final decision in about 20 months, July 2019 at earliest.\nMedical devices manufacturers will be required to wait and see which notified bodies will be designated and the scope of their related activities.\nThe post Publication of the notified bodies\u2019 designation codes under the MDR and IVDR appeared first on Focus on Regulation .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "mdr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbog", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivdr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:19.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e164eda2817050fd8dc3d3cb2d6e3f12c015630d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApugq6nq8E7yjiK8yVOwWPx6ypzOVp6zSFVQDfAcGKUaWbAQGlSiwmDsUXLDq.YjPS.KQr.DGxlvGA--", "site_full": "mgayabookstore.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://mgayabookstore.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "ONLINE BOOK STORE", "title": "IMG_9983.mp4", "title_full": "IMG_9983.mp4", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "TZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e164eda2817050fd8dc3d3cb2d6e3f12c015630d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApugq6nq8E7yjiK8yVOwWPx6ypzOVp6zSFVQDfAcGKUaWbAQGlSiwmDsUXLDq.YjPS.KQr.DGxlvGA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jerome Mapile (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "IMG_9983.mp4", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:20.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f60c46c6b8b6bc08affe4360127fec143cc1a34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf7woOt0nebbYHxSDixEbQyl1KuLz8ARHH8B7SX.8gb9p8pJMfQOxKl1wX.SGI2AY5chplJn5esNcWykVGKwHXvWx.kjFMsANMs-", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Second-City-Hotell.0-l6219831-0.Reseguide-Filter-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotell Second City, Toronto | Expedia.se", "title": "Hilton Garden Inn Toronto Downtown", "title_full": "Hilton Garden Inn Toronto Downtown (Toronto, Kanada) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-09-22T08:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4aa7ec4a601aee98bbc7b93b9ae21ace3fe7d4ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf7woOt0nebbYHxSDixEbQyl1KuLz8ARHH8B7SX.8gb9p8pJMfQOxKl1wX.SGI2AY5chplJn5esNcWykVGKwHXvWv2VGgbAS8vrQQsSdDCsIxwk1htLgieF4yC51SGCt7Ik-", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-28T12:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Everything is fine about the hotel really - it\u2019s just located next to a very loud night club.

On the basis of good word of mouth, the film saw good growth in days to come and eventually gathered Rs. 37 crore, hence emerging as a Hit. During the last four years, the film has enjoyed a good recall value for itself. No wonder, practically the entire cast of the film has been retained for Fukrey Returns with Pulkit Samrat and Richa Chadha leading from the front, Varun Sharma as the usual suspect and Ali Fazal along with Manjot Singh supporting them well. \nWhat also helps the film is the fact that it is releasing three weeks after Tumhari Sulu , the last film to do well at the Box Office, and that means audiences are waiting for something at least marginally exciting to arrive in theaters. Since the promo of Fukrey Returns is more than just decent and the comic quotient is expected to strike again (albeit to a lesser degree) after Golmaal Again , the film does have a chance to see at least a fair opening at the Box Office. \nAs things stand today, the film should see an opening day of Rs. 3-4 crore as it is practically the only notable release this Friday.

Congratulations Naples!\u201d cried pizza maker Enzo Coccia, as crowds in the street outside the Sorbillo pizzeria erupted into cheers. \nIt didn\u2019t matter that the cultural body\u2019s World Heritage Committee was still a few hours away from making it an \u201cintangible heritage\u201d: there was no chance the world-famous dish could lose. \nThe day before today\u2019s much-awaited announcement, discs of floury dough flew through the air as jubilant pizzaioli feted the art of pizza making \u2014 from the wooden ovens used, to the spectacular handling of the mix to \u201coxygenate\u201d it. \nPassing families and youngsters whizzing by on scooters stopped to grab fresh slices dripping melted mozzarella as a man with a guitar burst into one of the songs dedicated to the Italian delicacy. \nDozens more chefs were expected to hand out free pizza to locals and tourists in the southern city after the decision, which paid homage to pizza\u2019s key social as well as cultural role. \n\u201cDown the centuries, the Neapolitan art of pizza making has been based on a few key elements: water, flour, salt and yeast \u2014 and the excellent produce from the Campania countryside,\u201d Coccia said. \n\u201cBut it is also the hands, heart and soul of the pizzaiolo which allow us to make magic,\u201d he added, describing the stretching and turning of the dough as \u201ca love and passion that we transmit to others\u201d. \nThe pizza\u2019s humble ancestor, a plain affair usually tarted up with a bit of lard, was born less as an act of love than as a cheap, easy and fast way to feed the city\u2019s army of poor in the 18th century. \n\u201cIn around 1750 the first pizza appeared in the taverns, after which people began to specialise as \u2018 pizzaioli \u2019 (pizza chefs),\u201d said historian Antonio Mattozzi. \n\u201cBy the end of the 18th century, the first pizzerias were born\u201d. \nBut despite being an immediate hit with the locals, pizza failed to take off outside the city at first, he told AFP. \n\u2018Trade secrets\u2019 \nIt took Queen Margherita\u2019s love of the classic tomato, mozzarella and basil version to fire up the imagination and taste buds of diners far and wide \u2014 at least that is how the story goes. \nHoping to win the hearts of the commoners, the queen asked in 1889 to try their favourite dish. And while she was unconvinced by anchovy and Parmesan-topped versions, the basil delight won her over. \nLegend has it the winning combination was put together by pizza maker Raffaele Esposito, who baked it in the royal pizza oven in the grounds of the stunning hill-top Capodimonte Palace. \nThe Margherita offered to the queen was recreated Tuesday in the 300-year old oven by pizzaioli who hold no truck with modern toppings like pineapple and are on a mission to defend the real thing. \n\u201cWe are honoured to pass on secrets and tips,\u201d Gino Sorbillo told AFP. \n\u201cEach one of us might have a small detail that makes a difference, but we share them so that across the world those who want to make good Neapolitan pizza can do so\u201d. \nHe said there were \u201cyoungsters from every culture who get in touch with us asking to learn, even sending us photographs of their pizza attempts online saying \u2018what did I do wrong?\u2019\u201d \nBut fellow pizza maker Antonio Starita was not convinced that tips were enough, insisting that \u201cto learn the art, you need to do long apprenticeships in pizzerias\u201d. \nCulture Minister Dario Franceschini, digging into a hot slice straight off the royal peel, said that while \u201cpizza has become a universal patrimony, many around the world don\u2019t even know it is Italian\u201d. \n\u201cThis Unesco decision will establish the truth once and for all: that pizza is a global food \u2014 but it was born in Naples, and in this very oven\u201d. \u2014 AFP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "antonio starita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dario franceschini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margherita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raffaele esposito", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio mattozzi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coccia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michele", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gino sorbillo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enzo coccia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "world heritage committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capodimonte palace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "naples", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "campania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l\u2019antica pizzeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naples", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:20.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19a7bf8cf3d07a5c060001108d3710f7a905f8fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSQVqV6X.kFq58YFKFXEB714uIvMTgeXikIy6_jIexLqUlUpmWPVcU8GRJq_2kA7eRaReCCqU2aFNw6hOuQo1qqdicxk9RIT1SDW_qoF6mJvpYiEbgktq3pdjBxl3HLTnFOs63jfDJ0Nz3WnFsPrVoX", "site_full": "www.channelnewsasia.com", "site": "channelnewsasia.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech", "social"], "section_title": "", "title": "See Naples and pie: pizza making wins world heritage status -

from preparing and flipping the pizza dough to baking it in a wood-fired oven - was part of the country's cultural and gastronomic tradition. \nTraditional Neapolitan pizza has a relatively thin crust with the exception of the rim, which, when baked, bloats like a tiny bicycle tyre. \nIt is rigorously made in a wood-burning brick oven and has two classic versions: Marinara (tomato, garlic, oregano and oil) and, the most famous, Margherita (tomato, mozzarella, oil and basil). Advertisement Advertisement \nTradition holds the Margherita pizza was created in 1889 by a local chef in honour of Queen Margherita, who was visiting the city. It has the red, white and green colors of the Italian flag. \nUNESCO also accepted Chogan, an Iranian horse-riding game accompanied by music and storytelling, and the craft of millers operating windmills and watermills in the Netherlands. \nTraditional boat making on the Indonesian island of South Sulawesi, and Nsima, a maize-based culinary tradition from the African country of Malawi, also joined the list. \nFood culture already on the UNESCO list includes Turkish coffee culture and tradition, the gingerbread craft of northern Croatia and the traditional ancient Georgian method of Qvevri wine-making. \n(Reporting by Reuters Television; Writing by Darren Schuettler; Editing by Clarence Fernandez) Source: Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "margherita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clarence fernandez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darren schuettler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "intangible cultural heritage of humanity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters television", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naples", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeju", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malawi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nsima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south sulawesi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "croatia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:20.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f60c46c6b8b6bc08affe4360127fec143cc1a34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf7woOt0nebbYHxSDixEbQyl1KuLz8ARHH8B7SX.8gb9p8pJMfQOxKl1wX.SGI2AY5chplJn5esNcWykVGKwHXvWx.kjFMsANMs-", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Second-City-Hotell.0-l6219831-0.Reseguide-Filter-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotell Second City, Toronto | Expedia.se", "title": "Hilton Garden Inn Toronto Downtown", "title_full": "Hilton Garden Inn Toronto Downtown (Toronto, Kanada) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-09-22T08:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "32b79f5dd1b32e5a7502ff57d2c5b653d3f3521c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf7woOt0nebbYHxSDixEbQyl1KuLz8ARHH8B7SX.8gb9p8pJMfQOxKl1wX.SGI2AY5chplJn5esNcWykVGKwHXvW.nzHynRFfmEdJLvgzdGSyD_.4GG4Epeu7kJojHeNY6k-", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-14T00:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Nice hotel.

Each panel shows the central date within the 30-day window: (a) 8 March, (b) 1 May, (c) 1 June, and (d) 1 October 2016. Warm colors indicate regions where seismic velocity was decreased. During the 2016 earthquake, seismic velocity around the seismogenic Hinagu-Futagawa fault system and Mount Aso decreased greatly. Cold colors indicate regions where seismic velocity was increased. Seismic velocity at Mount Aso recovered rapidly and was faster than the pre-earthquake velocity after the eruption. The date described above shows the central date within the 30-day window. Yellow or white dots are Hi-net stations.\nCredit: Science Advances Most of what we know about earthquakes and volcanoes is based on what we can observe at the Earth\u2019s surface. However, most of the action \u2014 especially early activity that could help with disaster prediction and preparedness \u2014 occurs deep underground.\nDeveloping a clearer picture of changes in subsurface conditions, together with continuous monitoring, could provide life-saving information in advance of future disasters. In earthquake-prone Japan, especially, there is ongoing need for effective means of foreseeing seismic activity.\nJapan\u2019s National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) has developed the Hi-net network of hundreds of high-sensitivity seismographs evenly distributed across the country. High-resolution seismic data from Hi-net shed light on the workings far below the country\u2019s surface. A key source of information from Hi-net is the velocity of seismic waves as they travel between stations. Faults, fractures, and fluids in the subsurface, among other factors, can influence seismic velocity. Thus, changes in seismic velocity can signal changes occurring underground but not yet apparent at the surface.\nUntil recently, little variation in seismic velocity had been detected in central Kyushu, Japan\u2019s southernmost major island. However, in April 2016, the MW 7.0 Kumamoto earthquake struck the region, shortly after a MW 6.2 foreshock. These destructive earthquakes were followed by eruptions of Japan\u2019s largest active volcano, Mount Aso, in April, May, and October of the same year.\nA trio of researchers at Kyushu University and its International Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research (I2CNER) investigated Hi-net seismic velocity data, collected continuously from December 2015 to November 2016, to better understand the subsurface conditions associated with these disasters. They reported their findings in Science Advances.\n\u201cWe applied seismic interferometry to the ambient noise recorded at 36 Hi-net seismic stations,\u201d Tatsunori Ikeda explains. \u201cWe found that during the earthquake, velocity slowed significantly, which may have been related to damage and pressure changes around the deep rupture fault. This was followed by gradual \u2018healing\u2019 of the fault over the following months, although different areas recovered to different extents.\u201d\nThe earthquakes also may have mobilized fluids around Aso\u2019s magma body. Velocity below the caldera decreased when the earthquake struck, but recovered relatively rapidly after the eruptions; this may have released pressure.\n\u201cAlthough past studies have used similar approaches for velocity estimation, the higher spatial resolution we achieved over a broad area allowed us to identify the spatial distribution of the damage zone or stress state,\u201d corresponding author Takeshi Tsuji says. \u201cDenser deployment allows local anomalies to be more accurately resolved. Velocity changes thus identified could be useful in the estimation of future earthquakes and volcanic activity.\u201d\nReference: \nHiro Nimiya, Tatsunori Ikeda, Takeshi Tsuji.

With two of his movies Rangoon and Chef failing to do business this year, Saif Ali Khan still thinks taking good roles is much better irrespective of the films\u2019 fates. \nOn Wednesday, Bollywood Hungama had a fun chat with Saif Ali Khan at the trailer launch of his upcoming film Kaalakaandi where he spoke about his recent film Chef and why he thought the film failed to work at the box office. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to think that people no longer want to see me in a film. But I don\u2019t do that. I get my confidence back every time, irrespective of whether my film works or not. I\u2019ll keep working and hopefully, things will fall into place,\u201d Saif said. \nTalking about Chef failure, Saif Ali Khan said, \u201cI like Raja\u2019s attempt. A director is my first audience. I think it was a little European in flavour, and the drama could have been a little more. I think he generally avoids drama. I think the palette of this film was a little western. I also got some good reviews, but then some things are out of your control. It\u2019s sad but I wish it had done better. But, I think people like different kind of movies in India. I think they would have wanted to see more food, working in the New York kitchen or the high-pressure job. It\u2019s the various things it could have been. I still think it was a good movie, and I enjoyed my work in it. I think people expected a bit more. I also don\u2019t think it was even publicized correctly. I didn\u2019t see enough buzz around the film. It\u2019s okay doing the interviews. But, with films like that, you have got to show the trailer, hoardings, and you have to spend money on the publicity.\u201d \nSaif Ali Khan further added why proper marketing is important for movies like Chef. He said, \u201cSometimes, these days, I think people don\u2019t want to spend money on marketing. You are going to Bigg Boss or Comedy Nights or something and talk about the movie because you feel that will help. But, it won\u2019t help because people, if they liked the trailer, they will go and watch it. But, if you go and say at hundred events that please go and see my film and dance at the train station, it won\u2019t help you!\u201d \nWhen asked whether a man in the kitchen wasn\u2019t a relatable story for the audience, Saif said, \u201cWhen we were making the film, we were told that the profession is not the traditional heroic one. But, it can be. Was it the most dramatic story we could have told about Chef? I don\u2019t know.\u201d \nSaif Ali Khan, lastly, talked about the Dil Chahta Hai reference in Chef where his character mentions that he had visited Goa with his friends 20 years ago. Talking about the same, he said, \u201cRaja Krishna Menon wanted that and of course, it was intentional. I thought it is not going to connect with the people. But, it did. I was totally wrong about it.\u201d \nOn the work front, Saif Ali Khan stars in Delhi Belly writer Akshat Verma\u2019s directorial debut, Kaalakaandi . The film which is a raucous tale about life, death, karma, that barrels through one monsoon night in Mumbai, talks about the journey of six characters from different walks of life.

Advertisement Advertisement \nHonda and McLaren split after the 2017 season that ended last month, bringing down the curtain on three painful years that saw the former world champions suffer their worst ever slump. \nMcLaren, who had a dominant partnership with Honda in the late 1980s and early 1990s, last won a race in 2012 and this year finished ninth of the 10 teams with just 30 points - 638 fewer than champions Mercedes. \nTheir time together was beset with poor reliability and a lack of performance from a Honda engine struggling to compete with rivals. \nMcLaren, who have Spain's double world champion Fernando Alonso along with Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne as their drivers, will have Renault power next season. Toro Rosso have New Zealander Brendon Hartley and France's Pierre Gasly.

Demi Lovato had some words for the editors of TIME who felt that it was alright to include Donald Trump on their list of people who deserve Person of the Year title. This year, the magazine honored the women, including Ashley Judd and Taylor Swift , who spoke up about sexual harassment. Trump, meanwhile, was named the runner-up for the title, while it is known that he was accused for sexually harassing sixteen women before. Lovato has taken to Twitter to question the editors' decision of choosing the president of America as the runner-up. She even called the magazine \"hypocrites.\" She tweeted, \"TIME mag highlights brave women coming forward against sexual assault on the cover but names a man with sexual assault allegations against him runner up to Person of the Year..

They were called \"The Silence Breakers,\" which referred to \"individuals who set off a national reckoning over the prevalence of sexual harassment.\" \"These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking result: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, mogul toppled, icons disgraced,\" the magazine wrote. \"In some cases, criminal charges have been brought.\" More Demi Lovato News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "demi lovato", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ashley judd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taylor swift", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 demi lovato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "demi lovato news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lovato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "disney", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:22.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1470df5fd55db5ad9d40cb7c55ebfe30a70c9d31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw7WJGN_XHoozYgGe_Ow8GS4HSzdMhX_q28pTnzxBkZfp31VsmO71yzurSG3GZA3ffKeeKIMCPCRMDir4Pxlel7Y6gpVBrYqCP.5VtKKZF7O4rn5WIqEX.R1XFCj28y2jWoimdtxWtYRush.NmiSkDOyTF0j7Dxo5ePByn9GqpEvNOB_3ZNnbOabFJPkF7LH695.ICjPsbEE1ucAFjqdWR", "site_full": "pflueger.international", "site": "pflueger.international", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/haraldpflueger/WIhm?format=xml", "site_categories": ["education", "business", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Harald Pflueger", "title": "Syria Arab Republic delegation arrives in Geneva Next Sunday to participate in 8th round of Syrian-Syrian dialogue", "title_full": "Syria Arab Republic delegation arrives in Geneva Next Sunday to participate in 8th round of Syrian-Syrian dialogue", "published": "2017-12-07T10:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1470df5fd55db5ad9d40cb7c55ebfe30a70c9d31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw7WJGN_XHoozYgGe_Ow8GS4HSzdMhX_q28pTnzxBkZfp31VsmO71yzurSG3GZA3ffKeeKIMCPCRMDir4Pxlel7Y6gpVBrYqCP.5VtKKZF7O4rn5WIqEX.R1XFCj28y2jWoimdtxWtYRush.NmiSkDOyTF0j7Dxo5ePByn9GqpEvNOB_3ZNnbOabFJPkF7LH695.ICjPsbEE1ucAFjqdWR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Syria Arab Republic delegation arrives in Geneva Next Sunday to participate in 8th round of Syrian-Syrian dialogue", "text": "Todeszonen 07.

Although we have to wait for some more time before Priyanka Chopra announces her next Bollywood project, it seems that the actress is grabbing eyeballs yet again for featuring in the list of Asia\u2019s Sexiest Woman and that too for being ranked on top. \nThe Eastern Eye which conducted the poll recently announced that Priyanka Chopra has regained her first position as Asia\u2019s Sexiest Woman after holding it in the years 2014 and 2015. However, this means that the actress has dethroned the 2016 winner of the poll, actress \u2013 friend, Deepika Padukone this year. This comes as yet another good news for Chopra whose second Hollywood film A Kid Like Jake got selected for the Sundance Film Festival a week ago. \nTalking about the honour, Priyanka Chopra however gives the credit for featuring on the list to genetics and optics. The actress also thanked everyone who voted for her and further added that she was been told that she won the poll with record breaking numbers of all times. On the other hand, curator of the list Asjad Nazir was all praises for the former beauty queen \u2013 actress terming her as an incredible ambassador of India. While he appreciated her courage to often experiment with the unknown, he also called her as a symbol of girl power. \nAlthough Priyanka Chopra isn\u2019t looking forward to much of Bollywood next year, the actress continues with the third season of her popular crime drama \u2018Quantico\u2019 in 2018. Furthermore, she also has a couple of Hollywood projects in the pipeline besides A Kid Like Jake , which includes Isn\u2019t It Romantic? and Seth Gordon\u2019s next.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "deepika padukone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "priyanka chopra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asjad nazir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chopra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seth gordon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quantico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:23.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f38b6a2a3533de83e9a39905ee172ebe8285839e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pjEE7ve6gczfQoGdSBkpjrqVsNKJDkg.m", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/sp/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/sp/ - Sports - 4chan", "title": "What sport would she excel at?", "title_full": "/sp/ - What sport would she excel at?

REUTERS/Toby Melville Gavin Williamson issued a direct threat to Britons still fighting for ISIS. He said \"my view is a dead terrorist can't cause any harm to Britain.\" At least 800 people have left the UK to join ISIS in Iraq or Syria. Other terror experts have said they should instead be reintegrated. \nBritain's new Defence Secretary has unequivocally threatened to kill Britons who leave the country to fight for ISIS. \"I do not believe that any terrorist, whether they come from this country or any other, should ever be allowed back into this country. [...] \"Quite simply my view is a dead terrorist can't cause any harm to Britain.\" \nWilliamson added that British fighters who flee the UK for other countries would be hunted down and prevented from returning home or finding havens in other countries. \nHe said: \"Make sure there is no safe space for them, that they can\u2019t go to other countries preaching their hate, preaching their cult of death.\" \nThis could mean seizing their passports if they try to cross international borders, the Daily Mail said. \nWilliamson's threat was harsher than that of his predecessor, Michael Fallon, who resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations last month . \nIn October, Fallon said British nationals who have chosen to fight for ISIS in Iraq or Syria have made themselves \"a legitimate target\" and \"run the risk every hour of every day of being on the wrong end of an RAF or a United States missile,\" according to The Telegraph . \nWilliamson's Wednesday remarks echoed those of Rory Stewart, an international development minister, who said last month : \"The only way of dealing with them [foreign fighters] will be, in almost every case, to kill them.\" \nMeanwhile, Max Hill QC, the UK's official anti-terror watchdog, has said that teenagers who joined ISIS \"out of a sense of naivety\" should be reintegrated into British society so as to avoid \"losing a generation.\" \nAt least 800 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIS, according to the BBC .

There are now nine known species, which increased in size over millions of years. \u2014 AFP-Relaxnews", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter schouten/journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna gillespie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard owen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david attenborough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillespie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riversleigh world heritage area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riversleigh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queensland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:23.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfa57b26a9bfc6622269b16d98474a68739631d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_DRNYNHvKGwBXjWTOM6I0YUHbc0KzUokr.9vcBtyEnwB4EFYt5DCi", "site_full": "www.55188.com", "site": "55188.com", "site_section": "http://www.55188.com/forum-8-2.html", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "\u0104\u017e\u0161\u00c9\u0118\u0110\u0118\u013e\u0150\u02dd\u0110\u0139\u010e\u02d8\u02dd\u0165\u00c1\u00f7\u00c7\u0159\u0104\u017c -
