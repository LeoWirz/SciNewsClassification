About 200,000 people were under evacuation orders. No deaths and only a few injuries were reported.\nFrom the beachside city of Ventura, where rows of homes were levelled, to the rugged foothills north of Los Angeles, where stable owners had to evacuate horses in trailers, to Bel-Air, where the rich and famous have sweeping views of L.A. below, fierce Santa Ana winds sweeping in from the desert fanned the flames and fears.\n\"God willing, this will slow down so the firefighters can do their job,\" said Maurice Kaboud, who ignored an evacuation order and stood in his backyard with a garden hose at the ready.\nAir tankers that were grounded most of Tuesday because of high winds went up on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before the winds picked up again. They were expected to gust as high as 80 mph (about 130 kph) overnight into Thursday, possibly creating unprecedented fire danger.\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection uses a colour-coded wind index in its forecasts. Tomorrow's forecast is purple, the most extreme conditions, which has never been used before, director Ken Pimlott said.\n\"Conditions are going to change again tonight,\" Pimlott said. \"They're going to be extreme tomorrow. We need to have everybody's heads up -- heads on a swivel -- and pay very close attention.\"\nBefore dawn Wednesday, flames exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily travelled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes in Bel-Air, where houses range from $2 million to more than $30 million.\nFirefighters hosed down a burning Tudor-style house as helicopters dropped water on hillsides to protect homes from the 150-acre (60-hectare) blaze.\nA Christmas tree saved from the flames was in the front yard of a burned-out house and a large painting was propped against a Range Rover.\nBel-Air was the site of a catastrophic fire in 1961 that burned nearly 500 homes. Burt Lancaster and Zsa Zsa Gabor were among the celebrities who lost their houses.\nAcross the wide freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles cancelled classes because of poor air quality. UCLA, at the edge of the Bel-Air evacuation zone, cancelled afternoon classes and its evening basketball game.\nBy late afternoon, firefighters said they had controlled the fire's advance.\nProduction of HBO's \"Westworld\" and the CBS show \"S.W.A.T.\" was suspended because of the danger to cast and crew from two nearby fires.\nIn Ventura County northwest of L.A., the biggest and most destructive of the wildfires grew to 101 square miles (262 square kilometres) and had nearly reached the Pacific on Tuesday night after starting 30 miles (about 45 kilometres) inland a day earlier.\nThe fire destroyed at least 150 structures, but incident commander Todd Derum said he suspects hundreds of homes have been lost.\nWhile winds were calmer Wednesday, the fire remained active around Ventura, spreading along the coast to the west and up into the mountains around the community of Ojai and into the agricultural area of Santa Paula.\n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behaviour specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maurice kaboud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd derum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim chavez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zsa zsa gabor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burt lancaster", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "california department of forestry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bel-air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa paula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sepulveda pass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ojai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:39.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "337299b5c2eac97f3c27249d70bfaa41f07dea1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrbBawd.8AIZhXbK8Um4KlCOWhQYGzqyFGjVpqqlG05hSQqhZo_O7aO", "site_full": "strelec.si", "site": "strelec.si", "site_section": "http://strelec.si/forum/forum-41.html", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Strelec.si - Slovenski strelski forum - Rojal ", "title": "Gamo GR-STRICKER", "title_full": "PONOVNO NA ZALOGI - Gamo GR-STRICKER", "published": "2017-12-07T12:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SI", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "337299b5c2eac97f3c27249d70bfaa41f07dea1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrbBawd.8AIZhXbK8Um4KlCOWhQYGzqyFGjVpqqlG05hSQqhZo_O7aO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.rojal.si", "published": "2017-12-07T12:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "Gamo GR-STRICKER", "text": "Gamo GR-STRICKER\nCena: 149,00\u20ac\nWhat\u2019s in a name? Gamo could not name their new Co2 revolver the Striker as they intended, so they added a \u2018c\u2019 for its full title of GR-Stricker. It\u2019s a revolver so it has a swing-out cylinder and an exposed hammer, and it shoots lead pellets as opposed to the BBs normally found with Co2-powered pistols. The gun is very modern-looking thanks to the molded-on accessory rails on top of and below the barrel, as well as the open sights, which have high visibility add-ons.\nThe pistol grips add to a very modern look. They are the rubber, super-grip-type fitted to most top-end revolvers these days. The plastic cylinder takes eight pellets, and to gain access to it there is a spring-loaded latch under the barrel. Do not be fooled by the faux cylinder release catch molded onto the metal casting of the main frame. The plunger has to be held forward in order to swing the cylinder out to the left, and please note that this can only be done when the gun is not cocked.\nThe gun has a safety catch positioned right at the back of the action, tucked in behind the rear sight. The firing thumb for a right-hander can slide the catch to the right to set the gun on safe; it effectively blocks the hammer from striking the Co2 valve release, and I found I could use the same thumb to take it off. It displays a red dot when ready to fire.

Let's take a closer look at them.\nThe Cryptborn Nightmares are a team made up predominantly of undead types. From left to right are the Mummy - Namhophar the Celebrated, Zed the Zombie, Wolffang the Werewolf, Crashnukh the Orc Skeleton and Boney Bonaparte the Human Skeleton. I gave them those names.\nThe Cryptborn Nightmares are a team of extremes. On one extreme are the skeletons: dime a dozen, but prone to collapsing into piles of bones. Whilst on the other extreme are the mummies: rock hard opponents that don't ever stay down for long \u2013 if you even manage to get them down in the first place! Teams from the Rolling Bones will find great longevity in these undead monsters.\nZombies and Mummies are some of the most reliable wrestlers in Rumbleslam . They have lots of power, and Rise From The Grave helps them to just keep going and going. Make sure to use those Crowd Pleasers!\nThe Werewolf is probably the best all round WEIGHT 3 wrestler in the game. Werewolves are quick and extremely efficient at throwing the opposing team out of the ring.\nFinally, Skeletons and Ork Skeletons aren't too worrying on the face of it, but their special abilities hit extremely hard. Just be careful not to put them against far superior opponents, or Brittle Bones will make them explode from a particularly savage beating!\nIn addition to buying the standard team as shown above, I also bought two Superstars for the Cryptborn Nightmares - Fang and the Grave Digger.\n\u201cA vampire older than record books, this dark denizen of the night has plagued the land for millennium. For a while, that was enough to entertain the ancient entity. But like all things, the shine soon left the apple. He would sleep, and hope that the next century would be of more interest. One hundred years passed before his eyes opened once more. Awake, thirsty and eager to see what new delights the world had to offer, Fang ventured out into realm to find the city streets alight with life! The sound of cheers met his ears, and he grew curious enough to venture inside a building. What greeted him was Rumbleslam! For the first time in hundreds of years, the wicked man smiled.\u201d \nFang has entered the ring! He's a fantastic all-rounder superstar, with decent stats and a couple of +1s on his card. He's fast and vicious! Superhuman Spinebreaker is a Grapple Ability you'll be using lots and lots. It's easy to do, and thanks to Fang's Vampirism Passive Ability, replenishes his Stamina at the same time. But that's not all, because if you pass a Crowd Pleaser, the whole team gain the same benefit! \nFang obviously fits in perfectly with The Cryptborn Nightmares, boosting their already decent regenerative capabilities and their reliance on grapple attacks. But he's also a great choice for any team with lower Stamina \u2013 The Deadly Divas and The Twisted Shadows come to mind \u2013 as his constant replenishing can make up for their main weakness!\nSome of the Superstars are clearly based on WWE wrestlers from real life (see the Grave Digger below). But Fang appears to be modelled on Blade as portrayed by Wesley Snipes in the films of the same name. I'm cool with that.\n\"Little is known about The Grave Digger. He has declined all interviews and questions to date. Who was he before his death? How did he come to be undead? Many have asked and yet none have received more than a chilling glare from the towering giant of a superstar. An enigma both in and out of the ring, The undead superstar has amassed a cult following who worship his every match and claim he is the chosen one.\" \nWant to play one of the most recognised wrestlers in all of Rumbleslam ? Grave Digger is strong, tough, and surprisingly quick. Get a Crowd Pleaser off and he can do quite a lot of attacks in one turn, and his Deadeye ability stops enemy wrestlers from moving!\nGrave Digger is a Rolling Bones superstar, and fits perfectly alongside The Cryptborn Nightmares.\nI just had to buy this figure. He is based on one of my favourite WWE characters - the Undertaker. What I particularly like about this model is that he comes with a choice of two heads - bareheaded or with his hat. I had to choose the hat version as that was very much a trademark of the Undertaker. Please beware that the Cryptborn Nightmares team are made up of a lot of parts. The Werewolf comes in seven pieces not including his base. Also take care when handling the skeletons. They have very fragile limbs which I reinforced with a tiny amount of Milliput, Fortunately, I didn't have any breakages.\nThe Cryptborn Nightmares team costs \u00a322.00 for all five figures and Fang and Grave Digger cost \u00a37.00 each.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wolffang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rumbleslam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wesley snipes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boney bonaparte", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tt combat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brittle bones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rolling bones", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rumbleslam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crowd pleaser", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:39.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "179c7527aebd30b1d2438be8874b5f29ddc0d5f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTfWUxJ2K2KH9X1SpU8XK.IpnSOFbcY_ROXhtQflfvm6fzwrMjdl8ntPT.MpCR1cRmWz2uwOcTe_v8Pc23MQV9sbVKUIXO0fYfiSS9gVFVgyZua1ZfBlJ0fj72OUEOS1uY8eJ2Et9vStyIKhuifPKafxGoFQwEDTm9ATtn1TvuwpZ4vhZgQ.y3LXT2mprCG9Tg-", "site_full": "www.openpr.com", "site": "openpr.com", "site_section": "http://www.openpr.com/rss.php?cat=3", "site_categories": ["marketing", "financial_news", "finance", "business"], "section_title": "openPR.com - New Public Relations: Business, Economy, Finances, Banking & Insurance", "title": "Global Dewatering Pump Market 2017 - Grundfos, Sulzer, Xylem, The Weir Group, KSB, Ebara, Wacker Neuson, Tsurumi Pump", "title_full": "Global Dewatering Pump Market 2017 - Grundfos, Sulzer, Xylem, The Weir Group, KSB, Ebara, Wacker Neuson, Tsurumi Pump", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 43086, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "179c7527aebd30b1d2438be8874b5f29ddc0d5f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTfWUxJ2K2KH9X1SpU8XK.IpnSOFbcY_ROXhtQflfvm6fzwrMjdl8ntPT.MpCR1cRmWz2uwOcTe_v8Pc23MQV9sbVKUIXO0fYfiSS9gVFVgyZua1ZfBlJ0fj72OUEOS1uY8eJ2Et9vStyIKhuifPKafxGoFQwEDTm9ATtn1TvuwpZ4vhZgQ.y3LXT2mprCG9Tg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Global Industry Report", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Global Dewatering Pump Market 2017 - Grundfos, Sulzer, Xylem, The Weir Group, KSB, Ebara, Wacker Neuson, Tsurumi Pump", "text": "Access Full Report With TOC @ goo.gl/LvJBL3 There are 15 Chapters to deeply display the global Dewatering Pump market.

You may find it at cheaper rates or even free of cost. After making a thorough research, we have come up with the best android SIP dialer. \n\nKakao Talk Kakao Talk helps you to make calls and send text messages free of cost. However, making calls and sending messages is not the only thing that you can do with Kakao Talk. You may change theme, play games, check for item score also with this dialer. Most of the features stated above costs money as app needs to support it in some way. Apart from that, you can enjoy user- friendly interface and enjoy navigating through the app.\nTango The main feature of Tango does not focus on VoIP or SIP as it is widely known as a social network. It supports pictures and video messages apart from free calls and texts. This app stands out from the rest of the apps. It boasts of good quality network over 3G, 4G and Wi- Fi. The only negative thing about this app is that you can communicate only with the people who have this app.\nViber Viber is another VoIP that enables you to make free call over a network. Enjoy sending messages, emotions, stickers and other in builtding features and navigate easily through this app. However, you need to set up your account before using SMS. Apart from this, it is an exceptional app with lots of reception in the Play store.\nVoX VoX is the simplest solution for all your VoIP and SIP needs. You need to pay for making calls from your VoX account. It has an extensive rate list of different countries. The dialer acts as the main interface and the menu is used for navigating around the app. If you send messages, deductions would be in terms of minutes from your account and this means less call time. It is a good and simple app with limitation only in its functionality.\nThe android SIP dialers are not listed according to their rank.

Having just completed my blogs re last week's visits to both Frampton Marsh, Boston and Attenborough Reserve, Nottingham I am now underway with catching up on my two days in Almeria.  Day 1 based on Las Norias and Roquetas de Mar already published, photographs downloaded so that I can add along with Day 2 (yesterday) at Cabo de Gata. Meanwhile, David and Gilly Elliott-Binns are back from their UK visit and, also, yesterday were off to the Sierra de Maria where, like me, they had the rare privilege of recording a Merlin in \"supersonic\" flight.  As Dave says in his report below, they may have been down on numbers but certainly had some quality birds. \n\n\nSierra de Maria   -   Wednesday 6th December \nI take full responsibility for today! It was my decision for the group to return here, two weeks after their last visit whilst I was on my way back from the UK.  Gilly, who had the day off work, and I picked up Richard and headed for Maria.  My truck doesn't give the outside temperatures, but John's car displayed -2c passing Velez Rubio.  It was about 0c at Maria. We met up with him, Alan, Val, Les and Adrian at the Repsol garage cafe for a warming cuppa before making our way to the chapel area.  We'd already logged some of the usual suspects, House Sparrow, Collared Dove, Spotless Starling, Magpie and White Wagtail and added a Goldfinch en route.  There was very little round the chapel.  Les spotted a Robin and I was first to see some Great Tits.  Nothing at the water trough which I assume was iced up, so we began the walk up to the Information Centre. Incredibly Gilly spotted a bird in a distant tree.  A Hawfinch.  \n\nWell-hidden Hawfinch Coccothraustes coccothraustes (PHOTO: David Elliott-Binns ) Presumably one of the hard to see resident ones, even though the has been lots of reported sightings recently in the UK.  Amazingly I got a photo from one of my friendly guides in Morocco of one resting in the Northern Sahara!  We also saw Blackbird and Mistle Thrush.  In the Botanical Gardens we only added some Crossbill. We all quickly returned to the Information Centre to have a warm by their blazing log fire!   Maybe my decision was not a good one! Hawfinch Coccothraustes coccothraustes seen in the Sahara (PHOTO: David Elliott-Binns ) I led the convoy of cars towards the disused farm buildings.  As we approached some half dozen Jays followed a Green Woodpecker from the small deposito towards the pine trees.  Richard spotted the first Rock Sparrow.  Some Mistle Thrush and Crossbill were perched in the tree next to the water.  Les and the others went round the back of the buildings where the sun was on the short grassed meadow and found Crested and Lesser Short-toed Larks, Black Redstarts and many Chaffinch. A Raven and Carrion Crows were also seen.  Moving on to the farm water trough area we saw more Crested Lark and Rock Sparrows, when Gilly spotted a Iberian Grey Shrike low down below an almond tree.  It eventually posed nicely on the fence surrounding the deposito. Iberian Grey Shrike Lanius meridionalis (PHOTO: David Elliott-Binns ) Heading onto the plain we passed some corvids feeding to our right.  One Raven and some Carrion Crows.  Again I was leading the convoy when I saw a fast low flying bird  parallel to my left.  It landed.  It was a male Merlin.  It rapidly took off as a small lorry drove from the opposite direction and flew between us and the lorry, flying a wide circle and disappearing.  Kevin driving behind us saw it but the others, further behind missed it despite a search.  Kevin did manage to spot the crown of a skulking Little Owl amongst some rocks!  It was joined by a Black Redstart. Down at the hamlet we saw more Crested Larks and Alan identified some Linnet. On the way back along the plain, two Little Owls were now on top of the rocks, warming themselves in the sun.  We came across a huge flock of corvids.  I stopped to check them when all of a sudden numerous Black Bellied Sandgrouse took off.  I followed a group of 14 but Alan said there were many more.  I think this is the third time in about 14 years I've seen them here.  The corvids included Raven, Carrion Crow and Red Billed Chough. Once we'd got to the La Piza forest cafe it was warm enough in the sun to sit out for our snack lunch. We were entertained by a small flock of Long-tailed Tit.  Les also spotted a Blue Tit.  Leaving there we saw a stream of Griffon Vultures flying towards Maria town and further on at least 8 birds soaring near Velez Blanco. A few of the group trying to restore their circulation (PHOTO: David Elliott-Binns ) Although we only ended up with 31 species , I think we got quality not quantity! A great day out despite the cold weather!  A good decision, David! I've also attached a photo of a very obliging Hoopoe which visited the threshing circle in front of our house the other day!

Yes, selective choice of purchases afraid. So not exactly lieing but errm bending the truth.\nMaris Piper are sold as a premium product at a premium price. So the Co-op 2017 price for Piper is probably correct.

A 'proper' researcher would have gone back to Aldi and asked for their assistance in comparing like with like. But I suspect that might not have generated a sensationalist story.\nEpisodes like this are why I believe little I see, hear or read in the press or any publication really.

There, Republicans from both sides of Congress generally agree on two big changes. \nSaving for private school \nTaxpayers can currently save money for college through a 529 plan, where earnings grow tax-free. Many states also offer deductions for contributions. In the proposals, Republicans want to let taxpayers use 529s to pay for K-12 tuition at private and religious schools, too. Families can already do that with a different plan \u2014 Coverdell Education Savings Accounts \u2014 but these have low contribution limits and aren't open to high-income Americans. The move to expand the 529 would dramatically increase who could use these plans and the money they could save. \n\"I think the only taxpayers who will be in a position to benefit from the 529 change are very rich people,\" says Nora Gordon, an economist and associate professor at Georgetown University. She says using these accounts to save for elementary or high school won't help much unless you can afford to set aside a lot of money early on. No wonder, when the Government Accountability Office studied 529s and Coverdells a few years ago, it found \"families with these accounts had about 25 times the median financial assets\" of those who didn't use them and \"about three times the median income.\" \nWhile the proposed expansion of 529 plans would largely help affluent parents who use private schools, Republicans are proposing another change that could hurt funding for the nation's public schools. \nThe SALT (State And Local Taxes) deduction \nUp to now, taxpayers who itemize their deductions \u2014 generally high-earners who make up about a third of households in the U.S. \u2014 have gotten a break from the federal government for paying state and local taxes. \nThink of it as a kind of rebate \u2014 courtesy of Washington \u2014 that ultimately helps state and local governments pay for important things, like schools, among other things. \nRepublicans now want to cut that discount, getting rid of the income and sales tax deductions and putting a $10,000 cap on the deduction for property taxes. \n\"This bill is gonna make it more painful for residents to increase local property taxes to pay for public schools,\" says John Friedman, an associate professor of economics at Brown University. \nOn average, nearly half of public schools' funding (45 percent) comes from local taxes, often property taxes. In the past, when locals hiked these taxes to help pay for their schools, the federal government made the hike hurt less with that SALT deduction. So imagine, if Congress caps the property tax deduction, for high earners who already pay a lot \u2014 in places like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, even Texas \u2014 a new hike would hurt more than it used to. \n\"This is a really big deal for some states and no deal at all for other states. And the states that it's a really big deal for are blue states,\" says Nora Gordon of Georgetown. \"They're states with higher cost of living, higher property values, and states that spend more on their state and local government.\" \nWhile local taxes provide nearly half of public school dollars, state taxes account for much of the rest (46 percent). Kim Rueben of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says states often use these sales and income taxes to help their poorest schools. \n\"The money from the state ends up helping to prop up school districts that have less ability to raise money from the property tax,\" she says. Getting rid of these deductions, Rueben says, will make state-level taxes more painful for some and, again, could make it harder to raise money for schools in the future. \nImportant context: All this is happening with many school districts still reeling from the Great Recession. According to a recent analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, after adjusting for inflation, \"twenty-nine states provided less overall state funding per student in the 2015 school year than in the 2008 school year, before the recession took hold.\" \n*** \nThe two tax bills are farther apart when it comes to higher education. \nIn the House: fewer tuition benefits \nWe've heard a lot about graduate students' reaction to the proposal to tax their tuition waivers as income. \nAs Ariana Figueroa reported for NPR: \n\"Many grad students \u2014 especially in Ph.D. programs \u2014 receive tuition waivers in exchange for teaching classes or doing research. Under current law, that money isn't taxed as income. But the House bill calls for those tuition waivers to be counted as income and subjected to income taxes. \nThat means graduate students would be paying taxes on money they never receive.\" \nThe House bill also cuts or reduces other higher education tax benefits: The Hope Scholarship Credit The Lifetime Learning Credit and tuition deduction The deduction on interest for those repaying student loans The American Opportunity Tax Credit, which students and families can use to offset college tuition payments, is limited to exclude part-time and graduate students, although it is also extended for a fifth year. \nTogether, the axed benefits are worth about $6.5 billion a year to students and families, according to the American Council on Education. \nThe Senate bill doesn't include any of the above. \nState funding for public higher education may also be in jeopardy, for the same reasons we discussed above \u2014 a consequence of getting rid of the deductions for SALT. Scaling back, or cutting federal discounts to taxpayers may cause a squeeze on funding for state universities and colleges. \nPrivate college penalties \nBoth public and private colleges have expressed concern that fewer people are going to be taking the charitable deduction, because of the increase in the standard deduction. They're worried this will lead, in turn, to less money in donations. The American Council on Education estimates about $100 billion less a year in donations across all nonprofits. \nThere are also some provisions in the House and Senate bills that target private colleges specifically. One provision would levy a tax on investment gains for a small group of private colleges that have very large endowments on a per-student basis. Currently, this money grows tax-free thanks to the colleges' nonprofit status. \nThis affects about 65 private colleges with extremely large endowments. But even more colleges are worried about it, says Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education. \n\"Even though public universities are not affected by the endowment tax, they are very much opposed to it, for fear it would set a precedent that would be applied to them in the future.\" \nCulture war? \nThe tax plans, which passed on party lines in both the House and Senate, are aligned with a broader Republican agenda. On the K-12 side, cuts that impact the source of public school funding are coming hand in hand with special tax benefits for families with means to put aside money for private school tuition. \nOn the higher education side, Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and adviser to the Trump campaign, told Bloomberg that Republicans are going after university endowments because \"universities have become playpens of the left.\" Amplifying that point, a recent Pew poll showed there is a sharply rising partisan gap on higher education, with 58 percent of Republicans saying colleges have a negative effect on the country, while 72 percent of Democrats say they have a positive impact.

Despite the exhaustive diagnostic tools employed in traditional detection protocols, many unknown primaries are not found, and the patient is subjected to wide-field radiation and chemotherapy during treatment. Localizing the primary tumor has demonstrated therapeutic benefits, improved quality of life, and overall survival. The authors' objective was to determine the efficacy of a new management protocol for unknown primaries of the head and neck.\nStudy Design Prospective cohort study.\nMethods Our technique involved a preoperative positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) followed by a planned transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) approach. Efficacy was assessed based on survival statistics, disease control, detection rates, the proportion of patients not receiving adjuvant therapy, and the proportion of PET-CT scans helpful for detection of the primary cancer.\nResults The occult primary was located in 25 of the 27 patients (93%), with the majority found in the palatine tonsil (52%). Both overall survival and disease-specific survival was 80% at 36 months. Local control was achieved in 100% of patients. After surgery, 37.0% (n\u2009=\u200910) received adjuvant radiation alone and 33.3% (n\u2009=\u20099) of patients went on to receive adjuvant chemoradiation. On imaging, 72% (n\u2009=\u200918) of PET-CT scans correctly localized the primary tumor.\nConclusions Occult head and neck primaries present a diagnostic challenge that is not adequately overcome using traditional detection protocols.

These large-scale breeding facilities are considered by the Humane Society to put profit above animal welfare, housing dogs in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, and breeding females with little recovery time. \nNow the group, Stop Puppy Mills Ohio , is circulating a petition to put an anti-puppy mill issue before voters next November. Their proposed constitutional amendment would put new restrictions on commercial dog breeding. The restrictions include limiting the number of litters a female dog could produce in her lifetime. Breeders who fail to meet the standards would be banned from selling dogs. The measure is likely to be opposed by Ohio's Amish breeders and some pet stores. \nHere to discuss the movement are Senior Director of The Humane Society's Stop Puppy Mills Campaign John Goodwin ; Paws Look Listen Certified Professional Dog Trainer Nick Hof ; and Jim Tomaszewski , who serves on the boards of SPCA Cincinnati , Cincinnati Lab Rescue , and the Ohio Council for the Humane Society.

Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order. Copyright 2017 NPR.

The presenter-turned-wrestler has just made history after becoming the first Arab woman from the Middle East to join the WWE, the world\u2019s biggest wrestling promotion. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege,\u201d the 31-year-old says, \u201cbut it\u2019s also a responsibility\u2026 so I feel a lot of pressure, but in a good way. When I step into a WWE ring I feel like I will be representing the Middle East, not just women from the Middle East.\u201d \nWhen she steps into the ring in the New Year Bseiso, who grew up in Jordan, was educated in Lebanon and is now based in Dubai, will continue the WWE\u2019s run of female-led firsts: in October last year, it staged the first ever women\u2019s \u201cHell in a Cell\u201d cage match ; then in June, the first ever women\u2019s \u201cMoney in the Bank\u201d ladder match, with women wrestlers scrambling up ladder to nab a championship match contract. In July, a first-of-its-kind all-female tournament, with 32 wrestlers from across the globe, took place. \nWomen\u2019s wrestling is clearly having a moment, then - the WWE dubs it the \u2018Women\u2019s Evolution\u2019 - and Bseiso is the logical next step. She may be a late starter to the grapple game, but the CrossFit devotee and three-stripe blue belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu\u2019s impressive win-loss record speaks for itself. She began training in jiu-jitsu aged 27, and was competing in tournaments after just three months. Now, she goes by the nickname \u201c Armbar Girl \u201d, after her favourite hold. Crazy proud of @shadiabseiso for making history as the first ever Arab female WWE Superstar.As a fellow Middle Eastern, I'm rooting for you! \u2014 Rufus M (@RufusMGS) October 19, 2017 \n\u201cOver four years I did 16 competitions,\u201d she says of her fighting history. \u201cFor 13 of them I was on the podium, for either gold, silver, or bronze.\u201d \nW hile studying Business Administration at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, she began her first radio show at 18, and has gone on to become a household name in the Middle East, presenting TV shows including Dubai\u2019s spin-off of The Voice, and hosting live sports and brand events for Nike and Pepsi. \nWWE originally invited Bseiso to audition as presenter for its first Arabic language show WWE Wal3ooha back in January, but her passion for sports convinced WWE to invite her back for a four-day tryout at the Dubai Opera House \u2013 one of 34 athletes from 18 different countries. When I step into a WWE ring I feel like I will be representing the Middle East, not just women from the Middle East \nA fter impressing WWE trainers, Bseiso joins the WWE Performance Center in Orlando next January to begin her wrestling training \u2013 which involves how to properly execute wrestling holds, learning to \u201cbump\u201d (wrestling lingo for hitting the mat), and even the art of cutting a trash-talking promo. Also signed up to be a future \u201cWWE Superstar\u201d is Kavita Devi, the company\u2019s first Indian woman wrestler. \nIt may seem a strange leap to go from TV presenting and Olympic competitions to the cartoon world of wrestling, but the appeal is that \u201cI\u2019ve always worked in entertainment,\u201d Bseiso explains, \u201cAnd I have a passion for sports. This opportunity will allow me to combine [both]. It\u2019s unreal, this is the dream.\u201d \nAnd Bseiso\u2019s signing feels like another milestone for female athletes in the Middle East, where women\u2019s sport is growing - but still largely marginalised. Meet the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling: your guide to the cast and characters of Netflixs GLOW \nI n 2016, Jordan hosted the under-17s women\u2019s football world cup, the first tournament of its kind in the region. In Saudi Arabia, women have been banned from participating in national or state-organised sports, but last year created a women\u2019s sports authority and will permit women to attend some sports stadiums from January 2018. \nBseiso credits the 2012 London Olympics with helping to boost the region\u2019s female athlete contingent, when every participating country was required to send a female athlete \u2013 even Saudi Arabia, which sent two. \n\u201cIt was the first time I got to see Arab women compete on TV at the highest level,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an incredible feeling. But at the same time I wondered, what if I\u2019d seen this when I was growing up? Maybe I would have taken up sports earlier. I only started training four years ago. It\u2019s a very late start.\u201d \nWhat do her parents think about her joining the bonkers world of pro wrestling? \u201cMy brother, my sisters, and I were brought up equal,\" she says. \"My parents have supported me in whatever I\u2019ve done. They\u2019re excited, but WWE is very physical and you never know what\u2019s going to happen in the ring. They\u2019re worried about the risk of injury\u2026 but they also worry about risk of injury when I compete in jiu-jitsu.\u201d \nBseiso isn\u2019t the family\u2019s only sporting success. Her sister Arifa is a former national boxing champion and was part of a controversial Nike advert featuring female Middle Eastern athletes. \nI f there\u2019s been any backlash over Bseiso signing with WWE, she hasn\u2019t felt it. \u201cI always surround myself with a positive circle,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need that.\u201d \nUndoubtedly, it\u2019s on the big stage in WWE where women\u2019s wrestling will have the biggest impact, but it\u2019s not the only place it\u2019s happening.

We have to go game by game and see how we play without Tim. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find ways to win games.\u201d \nTheir chances are greater now that he said his right ankle was back to \u201c100 percent\u201d after he missed just two games with a sprain, though he admitted to \u201crust\u2019\u2019 shooting 8-of-19. see also Tim Hardaway Jr. isn\u2019t coming back any time soon. The... \n\u201cIt felt great,\u2019\u2019 Porzingis said. \u201cI usually recover pretty quickly from things.\u2019\u2019 \nHardaway won\u2019t be available for more than two weeks as he battles \u201ca stress injury in the lower leg\u201d \u2014 the vague description the Knicks have used. That\u2019s either a stress fracture or a less-severe stress reaction. \nMedical experts say stress fractures can take two months before it\u2019s safe to play on. The fear is a stress fracture can turn into a complete fracture. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not good for us at all,\u2019\u2019 Porzingis said. \u201cOther guys are going to have to step up and hopefully Timmy comes back as soon as possible but also he has to make sure he\u2019s 100 percent healthy before he comes back.\u201d \nThe Knicks\u2019 next seven games were slated against teams that currently have sub-.500 records. Porzingis didn\u2019t make the trip to Indiana on Monday so he could just get his ankle worked on. \n\u201cI was just doing treatment three times a day,\u2019\u2019 Porzingis said. \u201cIt was just intense, doing treatments all day long and trying to get back to the court for Wednesday and we made it happen.\u2019\u2019 see also Knicks' one defensive constant is a true leader Offense can come and go, game to game, half to... \nHardaway, the Knicks announced, will be evaluated in two weeks but probably won\u2019t be ready to return by then. He\u2019s on \u201ca treatment and rehabilitation plan.\u201d \nHornacek said he can\u2019t do any basketball activities but will work out on machines to stimulate the area. \n\u201cIn two weeks, we\u2019ll find out more, whether he\u2019s coming back sooner or later,\u2019\u2019 Hornacek said. \u201cIt\u2019s a game of basketball. Unfortunately for us it\u2019s one of our top guys. We got to pick Tim up. Hopefully he gets healthy quick.\u201d \nAndy Miller, who runs the ASM agency that represents Porzingis, was forced to give up his certification with the Players Association. The FBI reportedly broke into Miller\u2019s office to retrieve computers in conjunction with the NCAA\u2019s recent recruiting scandal. \nJanis Porzingis works for ASM and is the primary agent for his brother, Kristaps. ASM is expected to continue operation in \u201ca rebranding\u201d, according to a source. Porzingis will remain there despite Miller\u2019s status. Kyle O\u2019Quinn is also represented by Miller. \nPoint guard Jarrett Jack fell four rebounds shy of a triple-double, finishing with 10 points, 10 assists and six rebounds.

DAAP students have worked with city leaders on projects ranging from sidewalk design to re-imagining public spaces to boost economic development and tourism. \nJoining us to discuss the work DAAP students are doing to revitalize urban areas are Director of the University of Cincinnati's College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning, Dr. Danilo Palazzo ; Cincinnati Center City Development Corp. (3CDC) Executive Vice President Adam Gelter , a 2006 DAAP graduate; DAAP Urban Planning student Madison Landon ; and MKSK Urban Designer Sean Hare , who graduated with a Master in Community Planning last April from DAAP. \nTo read more about the work UC DAAP students have done with communities in Greater Cincinnati, click here .
