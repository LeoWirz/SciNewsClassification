Nevertheless, the field of oxygen-chemoreception still presents the general observer with a bewildering array of potential signalling pathways by which a fall in oxygen levels might initiate Type I cell activation. The purpose of this brief review is to address five of the current oxygen-sensing hypotheses.\nThe lactate/Olfr78 hypothesis of oxygen chemotransduction. The role mitochondrial ATP and metabolism may have in chemotransduction. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) hypothesis and its current role in oxygen-sensing by the carotid body. Reactive oxygen species as key transducers in the oxygen-sensing cascade. The mechanisms by which H 2 S, reactive oxygen species and Heme Oxygenase may integrate to provide a rapid oxygen-sensing transduction system. Over the previous fifteen years several lines of research into acute hypoxic chemotransduction mechanisms have focused on the integration of mitochondrial and membrane signalling. This review places an emphasis on the subplasmalemmal-mitochondrial microenvironment in Type I cells and how theories of acute oxygen-sensing are increasingly dependent on functional interaction within this microenvironment (see Abstract Figure).\nThis article is protected by copyright.

When she is just normally using her ability, she's able to control the wind around her, and can do multiple things with it - cut enemies with strong gusts of wind, float herself and others to an extent with it (aka levitate an enemy as a scare tactic), remove the oxygen in the air around an enemy, basically suffocating them, etc. For the second, more powerful part of her ability, she will actually say the name of her ability, and she'll start to undergo a transformation into a large, white wolf. She can still control wind in this form, on top of being able to do anything a normal wolf can. However, her most well known attack in this form is when she howls - in an enclosed room, she'll inhale all of the air in the room, leaving any within struggling for breath. Then once she's inhaled all she can, she'll unleash a piercing, bone-chilling howl that unleashes gale-force winds towards whoever she's aiming at, either slamming them into objects behind them to render them unconscious, or dead. There are side effects to using this form, however - when she first gains this power, she has a very hard time controlling it. Dazai usually has to stop the ability, before she gains full control of it herself. Also, even after she transforms back to her human form, sometimes she'll still have wolf attributes - wolf ears, a tail, fangs, and her eyes will have more of a reddish-gold hue to them. Once she gains more control of her ability though, she starts to have these attributes before she even fully activates her ability - enhancing her control of the wind around her. || Personality || During the Dark Era, Ayako is a very quiet, solemn girl. So quiet, in fact, she's known as Dazai's shadow at times by other Mafia members. However, she is known for showing dry humor, and has been known to get irritated with Dazai whenever she catches him in one of his suicide attempts. She's also pretty pessimistic, a bit of a Nihilist, and can be stubborn when she feels the need to be. However, she is also very responsible and mature at heart, as can be seen whenever she escorts Dazai home from his trips to the bar. Ayako also has a very strong sense of duty and repays any debt she owes. Whether that person wants it or not. || Background || Ayako Miura was originally born and raised in Hokkaido, with her parents and 10 siblings. However, when she turned 14, an event happened that caused Ayako's ability to activate - turning her into a large white wolf, right before her family's eyes. Being her first time using the ability, she of course had no control of it - she wasn't even conscious at that point. When Ayako awoke next, she was laying in a large pile of blood - she had slain her entire family, without even knowing how. Completely crushed at what she'd obviously done, but terrified and confused because she didn't know how, she did the only thing a 14 year old can think of - run. For the next two years of her life, she ran - along the way, becoming darker, more pessimistic, and full of despair. She even thought to commit suicide, but decided she didn't even deserve that. One day, she found herself in the city of Yokohama. She'd heard rumors of the darkness of this city, and thought perhaps she could either fit in, or find someone to end her existence she felt she no longer deserved to have, her guilt and sorrow destroying her by this point. One night, she found herself in an alley, where she noticed two large men were rummaging in the dumpsters. Despite not saying a word, the men noticed her, and started to come towards her. Ayako thought about running, but decided against it - instead, once the men got closer, she asked them if they would kill her. Obviously surprised by this question, the men looked at one another, before telling her no, and they started to leave. Upset by this, Ayako decided she'd make them listen to her request - she picked up a nearby bottle and threw it at the larger of the men, successfully smashing it against the back of his head. Enraged, the man turned back towards her, striking her. At this point, Ayako had accepted she would be killed here, by this man in a dark alley that currently had already injured her right eye, and was currently strangling her. She thought this was what she deserved, for what she did to her family. However, just as she started to slip away, suddenly she could breathe. Falling to the ground, she gasped for air, looking up with tears in her eyes in question of why the man had stopped. Ayako was shocked to see a slender man dressed in a black suit standing in front of her, the faint scent of alcohol on him as he stood above the slumped form of her attacker. She didn't know it yet, but she had just been accidentally saved by Dazai Osamu, one of the Executives of the Port Mafia. As the men scampered off into the darkness, Ayako watched cautiously as her \"savior\" extended a hand towards her, saying something about how that wasn't how a young girl should be treated. Suddenly overcome with despair and rage and being denied her well-deserved death, Ayako slapped away the man's hand, infuriated with him saving her. Dazai finds himself quite shocked that he's being yelled at for saving this girl's life, before it clicks - she was trying to die. Before he can say anything more, the girl slowly gets up, a hand to her bruised throat with a fiery glare in her eyes. She tells him that since he saved her, she was always raised to repay any debt - her life was now hers, until she felt she'd repaid him. Dazai find this almost amusing, how she's saying this, while glaring daggers at him with all her hate. Ayako listens as he explains she might want to take that back - since he's a Port Mafia Executive, and things could be rough for a young girl with a death wish. Huffing, she tells this man who called himself Dazai Osamu about her ability, and what she can do. His expression changes so quickly she tenses, immediately getting the feeling of dread just looking at the smirk that etched his face. This is how she comes to be an underling of Dazai Osamu, the youngest Executive member of the Port Mafia. Under Dazai's harsh instruction, Ayako begins to understand her ability more, and how to control it. She becomes a powerful weapon for Dazai, aiding him in many types of missions, and excelling at being a bodyguard for him. Upon being introduced to Mori, Ayako makes it abundantly clear - she only will take orders from Dazai. He is the one she owes her life to, therefore she won't be used to help anyone else. Mori surprisingly accepts this, out of respect for her stubborn values. He only has one request of her - make sure he doesn't commit suicide on her watch. At first she's puzzled by this request, but eventually after enough times catching Dazai mid-suicide attempt, she understands why Mori asked this of her. Things continue like this - she stops another suicide attempt, they go on a mission, he \"accidentally\" protects her, and she can never repay her debt, to Ayako's frustration and irritation. At least, until the incident with Mimic. The state of things rapidly changes during this series of events - all leading up to Oda Sakunosuke's death. Shortly after, Dazai goes missing - apparently, to leave the Port Mafia. It happens so quickly, Ayako was unable to figure out where he was going - and with the realization she'd lost her mentor and her chance of repaying her debt, she despairs. It isn't long after, that Mori appears before her, extending a hand with a promise - he will bring back Dazai. Until then, she just has to follow his orders. And for 13 months, she does just that - killing many enemies of the Port Mafia, with the promise of Dazai's return... However, Ayako isn't a fool. One day she realizes that Dazai is never coming back - and that Mori is just using her, with this false promise as his leverage. Soon after, Ayako attempts to leave - however, Mori knew this would happen sooner or later, and had a contingency plan in place just for this event. He didn't want to lose another powerful ability user, after all. She's soon confronted by Dazai's old partner, Chuuya Nakahara - he simply offers a quiet apology, but she should know better than to try to escape the Port Mafia - and with that, he completely immobilizes her with his ability, For the Tainted Sorrow. Once under control, Ayako is locked away deep underground, unable to even move - and she's left like this, strapped to a concrete slab, for 7 months. Mori tells her that once she's willing to cooperate again, she'll be let free. Until then, this would be her cage, where her ability won't help her, and she'll have no means of escape, with the IVs Mori hooked to her being her only source of food and water. During this time in confinement, Ayako would get visitors - K\u014dy\u014d , who would chat with her, try to get her to consent to Mori's request so she can be free; Akutagawa, who would take out his hatred of her and his despair at Dazai's desertion by attacking her with Rashoumon; and Chuuya, who would usually just come to talk with her during his free time - he already hated Dazai for leaving the Port Mafia, but for abandoning this girl too...it felt like it was all he could do, to make up for the hand she'd been dealt. One day though, on one of Akutagawa's visits, Ayako decided to actually speak to him - simply apologizing for Dazai leaving him behind, too. This of course, sets Akutagawa off - he unleashes Rashoumon: Sawarabi, impaling Ayako in multiple places, causing her to cough up large amounts of blood - the only thing keeping her alive her quick regeneration she gained from her ability. However, suddenly she notices she can move - during the attack, Akutagawa had accidentally severed the bonds that were keeping her on lock down for the past 7 months. Despite still suffering major blood loss and malnutrition, on top of a lack of muscle use in the last 7 months, she knows she'd be a fool to miss this chance. Ayako wastes no time in activating the full extent of her ability, transforming into her large white wolf form and using brute force to make her escape. Successfully free from her prison, Ayako starts to realize how weak she actually is after the injuries she'd just sustained - she can feel her strength fading fast. Looking for any kind of sanctuary, she notices a small Christian Church up ahead, and decides to go there. After breaking in and thoroughly terrifying the poor nuns and priest who were inside, Ayako collapses to the floor, shifting back to her human form, where she is still bleeding - despite her regenerative powers being boosted in her wolf form. She mutters that she needs sanctuary, before blacking out... ~This concludes her Dark Era background information~ || Relationships || Dazai Osamu Mentor. Their relationship is complicated - a vicious cycle of Ayako trying to repay her debt to him, and being unable to because he manages to always do something to keep her in his debt. She's unsure if this is on purpose or not, but wouldn't be surprised, knowing his scheming side. She has quite a bit of respect for him, but worries about his psychological well-being. He finds her to be a kindred spirit, since she too wants to die. Ryunosuke Akutagawa Fellow disciple under Dazai. He views her as his bitter rival for Dazai's attention, and loathes her \"ease\" of being noticed by him and acknowledged with her ability. Oda Sakunosuke She only sees him whenever she escorts Dazai to the bar he and Ango meet him at. Oda is the one Dazai went to when he needed to get clothes for Ayako - her torn up school-uniform wouldn't do. Oda thinks she needs a gentle hand, and therefore is uneasy about her being under Dazai's care. Will give her candies when Dazai isn't looking, and is the only person other than Dazai that Ayako will let pat her head. She's upset about his death, but that gets overshadowed by Dazai's disappearance. K\u014dy\u014d Ozaki Unsure. Ayako finds her beautiful, but can tell there's something dark beneath the surface. She did appreciate her visits during her confinement, though. Chuuya Nakahara Ally. Being Dazai's partner, she trusts him rather quickly, and admires his strength. She also feels like this is the only person in the Mafia that could be the closest thing she's ever had to a \"friend\". Ougai Mori Is her boss's boss, but that doesn't mean she'll listen to him. Even before he locked her away, she didn't trust him - she could tell he was a big part of why Dazai was the way he was. And this bothered her. || Trivia || ~ The real life Ayako Miura was actually born and spent most of her life in Hokkaido. She also had 10 siblings in real life as well, along with her parents who seemed to love her and her siblings very much. ~\"The Wind is Howling\" is actually one of Ayako Miura's novels - it's the inspiration for the idea of being able to control wind with an ability. ~Hokkaido was home to the Ainu - people who believed that one of their ancestors was a large, white wolf. This, along with some word play from the title of Ayako Miura's novel, are the reason behind my Ayako's ability having the second part, which has her transform into a similar wolf of those legends. ~The real life Ayako Miura's works were compared to Dazai Osamu's and Natsume Soseki's, both of which left deep impressions on her and her work. Took this and used it for her ties to BSD's Dazai, and how she sees him as a mentor/respects him. ~13 and 7 are used to describe different amounts of time for the real life Ayako Miura. For 13 years, she was confined to bed with caries of the spine due to Tuberculosis. 7 of those years were spent in a restrictive cast that prevented movement. This inspired the 13 months of serving Mori, where she was mentally confined with the delusional hope Dazai would come back, and the 7 months of her being bound in a way she couldn't move or even activate her ability properly. ~In real life, Ayako Miura was a Nihilist - due to her lack of belief in her own teachings after Japan was defeated in WWII. However, she eventually found God, and was converted to the Christian (Protestant) faith. This inspired my Ayako's despair and Nihilism, and why she ended up in a Church after escaping the Port Mafia. ~The first three quotes are based on actual quotes from the real Ayako Miura! || Quotes || (To Dazai, when she confronts him after Odasaku's death) \"Our last, great mission in life is to die well. Maybe you should give that some thought...\" (To herself, when she's being given looks by people in a Church) \"If God accepts that sort of person, isn't it possible that He will even accept someone like me?\" (To K\u014dy\u014d , when she asks her if she has feelings for Dazai) \"To truly love someone, is to make it so that person can live on his or her own...I think my first challenge would be to get Dazai to want to live.\" More to be added!

Received: 13 October 2017 / Revised: 28 November 2017 / Accepted: 3 December 2017 / Published: 7 December 2017 (This article belongs to the Section Green Chemistry ) No Abstract Enzymes serve as biocatalysts for innumerable important reactions, however, their application has limitations, which can in many cases be overcome by using appropriate immobilization strategies. Here, a new support for immobilizing enzymes is proposed. This hybrid organic-inorganic support is composed of chitosan\u2014a natural, nontoxic, biodegradable, and edible biopolymer\u2014and sodium polyphosphate as the inorganic component. Lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) was immobilized on microspheres by encapsulation using these polymers. The characterization of the composites (by infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and confocal Raman microscopy) confirmed the hybrid nature of the support, whose external part consisted of polyphosphate and core was composed of chitosan. The immobilized enzyme had the following advantages: possibility of enzyme reuse, easy biocatalyst recovery, increased resistance to variations in temperature (activity declined from 60 \u00b0C and the enzyme was inactivated at 80 \u00b0C), and increased catalytic activity in the transesterification reactions. The encapsulated enzymes were utilized as biocatalysts for transesterification reactions to produce the compound responsible for the aroma of jasmine.
