Victoria tries to free herself from jail and wake Anastasia; Lady Tremaine's surprising backstory is revealed; Jacinda and Nick share an exchange that could alter her future with Henry. Everything has changed as the seventh season of Once Upon A Time nears. Cast shifts and a soft reboot has things starting over \nWith Snow White (Giniffer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) gone, \"Once Upon a Time\" (OUAT) is focusing on another fairy tale couple next season: Henry Mills (Andrew J. West) and Cinderella (Dania Ramirez). But apart from telling the tale of how the two fall in love, season 7 is also going to explore the princess' past and feature the characters in it. Among those who will appear is her stepsister, Anastasia. \nTV Line claims a teenage Anastasia will appear in flashbacks in the overhauled season. But unlike how her character is commonly portrayed, the \"OUAT\" version will feature a happy and selfless girl who loves both her twin sister Drizella (Adelaide Kane) and step-sister Cinderella. \nThe young Anastasia will appear in \"Once Upon a Time\" season 7 episode 9, though the actress who will portray her has yet to be announced. Whoever lands the role will be joining \"Burn Notice\" star Gabrielle Anwar who was cast in early July as Lady Tremaine, Cinderella's wicked stepmother. \nReports say Gilmore, Morrison and de Ravin will make one-off encores in the coming season. Once Upon A Time returns Friday, October 6th on ABC \nAfter this episode aired on television by History, you will be able to watch Once Upon a Time Season 7 Episode 9.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adelaide kane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giniffer goodwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dania ramirez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cinderella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drizella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilmore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince charming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anastasia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew j. west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacinda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henry mills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lady tremaine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabrielle anwar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:46.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "920f5cfd5a2e19e6aba1d4efe9b0bc8e2e5c5015", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Gmz3g4LVGXS66Tqiun6rcQSYpDCBZzHyi3fcVfmILW0FhTRx7u2xMOLoPiMrgRZc5dqJI3CMcoq2WLj94zb4hULDDj0tH_Rz5HpbfFJKS7OdpVfm7xvtWpsyAqzws68_KTZl_ud8C7WFwVoPaph52", "site_full": "www.goal.com", "site": "goal.com", "site_section": "http://www.goal.com/en/feeds/news?fmt=rss", "site_categories": ["world_soccer", "sports"], "section_title": "Goal.com News - International", "title": "Why bench-warming Walcott's Arsenal career is not dead in the water just yet", "title_full": "Why bench-warming Walcott's Arsenal career is not dead in the water just yet", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.performgroup.com/di/library/GOAL/d3/31/theo-walcott-arsenal-2017_1srqifbp9j4lq19fpefda6d6j0.jpg?t=735376584&amp;quality=100&amp;h=300", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 529, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "920f5cfd5a2e19e6aba1d4efe9b0bc8e2e5c5015", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Gmz3g4LVGXS66Tqiun6rcQSYpDCBZzHyi3fcVfmILW0FhTRx7u2xMOLoPiMrgRZc5dqJI3CMcoq2WLj94zb4hULDDj0tH_Rz5HpbfFJKS7OdpVfm7xvtWpsyAqzws68_KTZl_ud8C7WFwVoPaph52", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Why bench-warming Walcott's Arsenal career is not dead in the water just yet", "text": "Man City match Arsenal and Chelsea's record winning run \nSenior players can almost go \u2018missing\u2019 if they\u2019re not involved in consecutive matchday squads and while some fans may believe that Arsenal are better off with Walcott, his impressive numbers and overall contribution to the cause show that they will find it difficult to get better value elsewhere right now. \n\u201cHe works hard to come back \u2013 he had a sickness a few weeks ago \u2013 and after I didn\u2019t change the squad,\u201d said Wenger in his pre-match press conference ahead of Thursday\u2019s match. \u201cIn training he looks sharp and he will show that.\u201d \nWhen asked if he would keep Walcott in the January transfer window, Wenger simply replied: \u201cYes\u201d. \nIt\u2019s worth noting that Walcott scored 19 goals last season and didn\u2019t play for the last 10 games of the campaign due to Wenger\u2019s formation switch. Indeed, the 3-4-2-1 system has somewhat rendered Walcott\u2019s position redundant in the starting line-up as Arsenal currently deploy tactics that don\u2019t play to his strengths. \nWith Alexis Sanchez seemingly on his way out of the club either in January or next summer, Walcott should be careful before making a rash decision on his future as he may yet find himself playing regularly in the team again. \nThe main word around Walcott\u2019s career over the years has been \u2018hype\u2019. From signing for Arsenal as a fresh-faced 16-year-old to being included in England\u2019s 2006 World Cup squad despite only playing sporadically for the senior side on two occasions previous to that, Walcott has had high expectations on his shoulders for over a decade. The barometer to measure him should surely be based on what he has delivered to this Arsenal team \u2013 goals, assists and match-winning contributions. Article continues below \nWalcott could find himself complementing Alexandre Lacazette if Chile star Sanchez does eventually leave in January. The two would almost certainly combine well and play off each other\u2019s unique qualities where movement, positioning and runs are concerned. As it stands however, there is no room for Walcott in the starting line-up unless Wenger opts to change Arsenal\u2019s formation to four at the back again. \nMany of Arsenal\u2019s most established performances in the Premier League and Europe have involved Walcott playing an integral part in attack. Whether it be the two assists against Manchester United two seasons ago or his contribution in last season\u2019s 3-0 win over Chelsea where he played on the right-hand side, Walcott has always managed to produce when it matters and even more so when people doubt his qualities. \nIt\u2019s clear for all to see that Walcott has a big decision to make over the coming weeks. He faces the prospect on missing out on the 2018 World Cup if his lack of game time continues and that would be a massive blow for a player who will be 33 by the time the 2022 World Cup comes around. If certain dominoes fall around him then things could change very quickly for Walcott, even if he\u2019s up against it for time on this occasion.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walcott", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alexis sanchez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandre lacazette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanchez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "arsenal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premier league", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:46.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b7fee60592b8376213846940856f6497b3862844", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxEz_N2RGkMOue", "site_full": "www.aldeer.com", "site": "aldeer.com", "site_section": "http://www.aldeer.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=17", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "TEAM ALDEER -

Bennett and Victoria Plaut (U.S. District Court (Northern District of Iowa) and University of California, Berkeley - School of Law) have posted Looking Criminal and the Presumption of Dangerousness: Afrocentric Facial Features, Skin Tone, and Criminal Justice (51 U.C. Davis L.Rev. (2018, Forthcoming))   Social psychologists have established that faces of Black males trigger thoughts of violence, crime, and dangerousness and thoughts of crime trigger thoughts and images of Black males. This presumption of dangerousness increases with darker skin tones (colorism) and greater Afrocentric facial features and affects both men and women. We examine the history of the stereotype of Blacks and crime, violence, and dangerousness arising in the United States from the time of slavery. We focus on the historical development of this stereotype through a lens of history, literature, pseudo-science, emerging neuroscience, media distortion of crime reporting, and the development of the Negro-ape metaphor. We then look beyond the Black-White race dichotomy to explore the evolving social science literature examining the influence of skin tone and Afrocentric facial features on the length of criminal sentences.

This is the belief of a study recently published in the Journal of Feminist Geography, which argued \u201chegemonic masculinity implies an imperative to eat meat\u201d and helped concrete other power hierarchies as well. For the purpose of the research, professor Anne DeLessio-Parson spoke with vegetarians from Argentina to discover the diet itself is a political act that helps break down the gender binary. \u201cThe decision to become vegetarian does not itself destabilise gender, but the subsequent social interactions between vegetarian and meat-eater demand gender enactment \u2014 or resistance,\u201d she explained. As an example of destabilising gender norms. she suggested male vegetarians opt to spend more time in the kitchen than out on the grill as expected. \u201cRefusing meat therefore presents opportunities, in each social interaction, for the binary to be called into question,\u201d Ms DeLessio-Parson explained. She said she started the study after spending five years as a vegetarian in Argentina, where she learnt the diet wasn\u2019t just a lifestyle choice, but a feminist act. Ms DeLessio-Parson believes vegetarianism is a way women can assert their agency and autonomy. \u201cOne of the ways [women] push back against patriarchy, they say, \u2018This is my body. You don\u2019t get to tell me what comes in and out\u2019,\u201d she told Campus Reform. Ms DeLessio-Parson also believes that even though many men in Argentina \u201cstill have these very hegemonic masculinity traits\u201d, male vegetarians \u201cseem more egalitarian and respectful\u201d and \u201cmore open about talking about how sexism exists\u201d. She closed her argument by suggesting vegetarianism can help destabilise hierarchies, and drive social change. \u201cIf we can pay more attention to what we put in our bodies ... we can create a better sense of peace in the world. Vegetarianism is a part of that,\u201d Ms DeLessio-Parson wrote.\" Always pick 2 crew #1 thread killer on the misc Today, 02:19 AM #2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:47.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8755d8e82d120aab5319dfeecc62767da77a380e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPz3N7WD3NxjlTtlS5k4nEBFWUP.TqdIDwU6KI56kt5tUnEAW64MhM6bTV.en.3_RZB9laBm0MKf86ponv3ZvIyqg_r7MeY0FbMc_IX5U6fhbWReQ4CWQOKx66FVEbLuuDzlMr5LHF3U0k_nQ4XQFKf8sIMuE16xfLzXQO0deKhAPKCF8Ck1h6dw--", "site_full": "www.military-technologies.net", "site": "military-technologies.net", "site_section": "http://www.military-technologies.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["table_tennis_ping_pong", "financial_news", "finance", "sports"], "section_title": "MilTech", "title": "Siyata Mobile, Inc.

The big indecision was around Councilwoman Claudette Reid's indication she could not attend the session but would be available via some type of conference call. Five votes are needed for approval of the emergency ordinance.\nThe emergency ordinance comes about because the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs recently issued a bulletin that said in places where patients have developed relationships with caregiver facilities, municipalities can allow medical marijuana dispensaries to remain open past Dec. 15.\nBut, the department said, the local government must adopt an ordinance allowing it before then. Lake Effect, which has been allowed to operate in the city for more than two years, would need council action before Dec. 15, prompting the special meeting.\nMedical marijuana entrepreneurs can apply to operate one of five types of facilities on Dec. 15, and LARA will begin giving out 1-year renewable licenses during the first quarter of 2018.\nWhile one councilman, Terry Urban, said that the city did not need to take any action on an emergency ordinance - meaning Lake Effect could just shut down while it applies for a state license - most of the council felt the emergency action was needed because the provision center is providing a needed service.\n\"I think it's important for compassionate care that we do not close a dispensary serving the medical needs of the community,\" said Mayor Patricia Randall. \"I do feel there is a sense of urgency on this.\"\nThe issue has been at the top of the new council's list since the Nov. 7 election. Tuesday's discussion follows the Nov. 30 committee of the whole meeting that lasted more than three hours and drew several speakers, most supporting city medical marijuana ordinances.\nWhile the seven council members have said they support some type of ordinance, they differ on the specifics such as how many plants a grower could have; if the city should also get into regulating safety compliance facilities, provisioning centers and transporters; or if it should start slow and just deal with provision centers and growers.\nPortage joins other area municipalities in tackling the issue. Kalamazoo Township recently voted to opt-in on allowing medical marijuana facilities. The city of Kalamazoo decided to wait until rules were released last week. Comstock Township voted this week not to allow medical marijuana facilities.\nAt Tuesday's council meeting, representatives of the Kalamazoo County Substance Abuse Task Force spoke about the dangers of marijuana use and urged the council to use caution on any ordinances dealing with the substance.\n\"We want to educate the community on the impact of marijuana,\" said Ashley Bergeon, task force coordinator who was joined by two local high school students. \"There are unintended consequences of legalizing it.\"\n Portage sets Dec. 12 special meeting on medical marijuana | MLive.com\nAuthor: Tom Haroldson\nContact: MLive contacts, services and support | MLive Contacts - MLive.com\nPhoto Credit: Jim Mone\nWebsite: Michigan Local News, Breaking News, Sports & Weather - MLive.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.mlive.com/", "http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2017/12/portage_sets_dec_12_special_me.html", "http://blog.mlive.com/mlive_contacts/page/contact_home.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:48.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0739fa7ae69327846eed756dacd848634913ba44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRylXykK8K8s_Qmv8p.Ot4sd0GU0jlPCM4sIbGzKpUjBeMctpS464XN.0w08ljerMlM4wJeoxikjYwM5uZk2E_", "site_full": "nccriminallaw.sog.unc.edu", "site": "unc.edu", "site_section": "http://blawgsearch.justia.com/blogs/categories/criminal-law/rss", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "legal_issues"], "section_title": "Recent Criminal Law posts - Justia BlawgSearch.com", "title": "What We Know (And What We Don\u2019t) About Drug-Impaired Driving", "title_full": "What We Know (And What We Don\u2019t) About Drug-Impaired Driving", "published": "2017-12-06T23:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/images/unc-sog-logo-600.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3420, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 36, "comments": 0, "shares": 36}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0739fa7ae69327846eed756dacd848634913ba44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRylXykK8K8s_Qmv8p.Ot4sd0GU0jlPCM4sIbGzKpUjBeMctpS464XN.0w08ljerMlM4wJeoxikjYwM5uZk2E_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shea Denning", "published": "2017-12-06T23:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "What We Know (And What We Don\u2019t) About Drug-Impaired Driving", "text": "by Shea Denning \u2022 0 comment \nAsk someone to identify an emerging area of interest related to motor vehicle law and chances are the person will mention drugged driving. Indeed, the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy in 2010 set a goal of reducing the prevalence of drug-impaired driving by 10 percent by 2015. People who work in the field frequently cite anecdotal evidence supporting the notion that driving while impaired by drugs is becoming more common. And they usually cite anecdotal evidence in support. Are they right? Are more people these days driving while impaired by drugs? \nI thought the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) might have an answer. Turns out NHTSA released a report earlier this year estimating the prevalence of alcohol and drug use by drivers and how that prevalence has changed over time. The report was based on data collected from a national roadside survey (NRS) conducted between June 2013 and March 2014. That data was compared to information collected in a 2007 NRS. \nBefore I reveal the results, I want to say a bit about how the researchers got them. \nSurvey methodology. \nResearchers collected data from more than 11,000 drivers at five locations in 60 sites across the United States (four of them in North Carolina) in one two-hour Friday daytime session and four two-hour nighttime sessions. \nHere is how the survey worked : Randomly-selected drivers were guided off the roadway into the research location, which usually was an empty parking lot. Research bays were demarcated by traffic cones, and each driver was directed to drive in to a specific bay. A data collector explained to the driver the purpose of the study, told the driver that that it was voluntary and anonymous, and asked for consent to continue. Drivers were offered financial incentives for completing additional parts of the survey. A driver who declined to participate was asked to provide an anonymous breath sample before the driver left the location. Drivers who were not willing to do that drove on. Nearly 80 percent of drivers participated in the survey. \nFor participating drivers, the data collector first obtained a passive alcohol sensor (PAS) reading. A PAS can detect alcohol in expired air around a person\u2019s face and provides a rough indication of a person\u2019s breath alcohol concentration. \nData collectors then questioned drivers about their general drinking behavior, driving patterns, and their driving on that particular day or evening. They then asked the drivers to provide a breath sample on a portable breath testing device, which masked the result so neither the drivers nor the data collectors saw it. \nThe data collector then asked the driver for a saliva sample, which was obtained by placing a collection swab in the driver\u2019s mouth for three to five minutes. While the swab was in the person\u2019s mouth, the person was asked to complete a written survey about his or her use of alcohol and drugs. \nThe data collector then asked the driver for a blood sample. Forty two percent of the drivers agreed to provide such a sample, which was then withdrawn by a phlebotomist. (Drivers received $50 for providing the blood sample.) \nAt the end of the study, the driver was guided back onto the roadway. If the data collector suspected that a driver may have been drinking or was otherwise impaired, a supervisor obtained a breath alcohol reading using an unmasked portable breath testing device. If the driver\u2019s breath alcohol concentration was at or above .05, the research team ensured he or she got home safely at no charge. No driver was arrested as a result of his or her participation in the survey. \nThe analysis. \nSaliva and blood samples collected from the drivers were analyzed for drugs that have the potential to impair driving, including over-the-counter, prescription, and illegal drugs. Among the drugs included were marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and phencyclidine. Samples that screened positive were then subjected to confirmatory testing using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technology. \nThe results. 22 percent of the nearly 8,000 drivers who provided saliva or blood samples tested positive for some type of drug. Drivers between the ages of 16 and 20 were least likely to test positive for drugs. Drivers between the ages of 21 and 34 were most likely to test positive. The most frequently encountered drug was THC, the psychoactive substance in marijuana. THC was detected in 8.7 percent of daytime drivers and 12.7 percent of nighttime drivers. Opioids and their metabolites were the second most prevalent drug, detected in 5.5 percent of daytime drivers and 4.7 percent of nighttime drivers. During the daytime, the next most frequently encountered drug class was antidepressants (3.5 percent) followed by benzodiazepines (2.6 percent) The third most prevalent types of drugs among nighttime drivers were cocaine and amphetamines/stimulants (2.2 percent). \nThe comparison. \nThe results of the 2013-14 NRS were compared to the 2007 NRS. Nighttime drug-positive driving increased from 16.3 percent in 2007 to 20.1 percent in 2013-14. The prevalence of THC-positive drivers increased from 8.7 percent to 12.7 percent (an increase of 46 percent). \nThe limitations. \nThe authors of the NHTSA report note that the presence of drugs does not equate to drug impairment. They explain that the study\u2019s purpose was to estimate drug prevalence, not to determine whether drugs affect driving performance or have an impact on crash risk. In fact, the authors noted, some prescribed medications may actually improve the driving of certain individuals. Questions about impairment and crash risk must be determined (and, the authors note, are currently being examined) in other studies. \nA 2016 NHTSA-sponsored Drug and Alcohol Crash Risk Study examined the risks associated with drug- and alcohol-positive driving. The study used data from crash-involved and non-crash-involved drivers over a 20-month period in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The study confirmed previous research indicating alcohol is a greater contributor to crash risk than drugs. And when age, gender, race/ethnicity, and alcohol consumption were accounted for, the researchers found no significant contribution of drugs to crash risk. \nA July 2017 NHTSA report to the U.S. Congress on marijuana-impaired driving noted that while \u201cethyl alcohol is a relatively simple drug whose absorption, distribution, and elimination from the body along with the behavioral and cognitive effects are fairly well documented,\u201d the \u201cabsorption, distribution and elimination from the body of marijuana (and many other drugs), along with the behavioral and cognitive effects is very different.\u201d In addition, the report stated that less is known about the impairing effects of marijuana use than alcohol consumption on driving-related skills. There have been fewer studies of marijuana\u2019s effects on driving, and research methods have not been consistent. The studies that exist consistently determine that the level of THC in the blood and the degree of a person\u2019s impairment do not appear to be closely related. \nThe bottom line. \nThe NHTSA report based on the 2013-14 NRS does not definitively establish that drug-impaired driving is more prevalent today than in the past. It does, however, show that a substantial and growing percentage of drivers have detectable quantities of drugs in their systems. \nMany policy makers are not waiting for definitive research results on the incidence of drug-impaired driving to combat its dangers. In August 2013, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) partnered with NHTSA to develop the online Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement ( ARIDE ) program, a program designed to improve a law enforcement officer\u2019s ability to identify drugged drivers on the road. And several states have adopted statutes that prohibit driving with any drug or metabolite or a specified concentration of drug or metabolite in his or her body. \nDrugged driving laws in NC. \nNorth Carolina\u2019s general impaired driving statute, G.S. 20-138.1 prohibits a person from driving a vehicle on a street, highway or public vehicular area (a) while under the influence of an impairing substance; or (2) after having consumed sufficient alcohol that he has, at any relevant time after the driving, an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more; or (3) with any amount of a Schedule I controlled substance, as listed in G.S. 90-89, or its metabolites in his blood or urine. In addition, G.S. 20-138.3 prohibits a person under 21 from driving a motor vehicle on a highway or public vehicular area while he has remaining in his body any alcohol or controlled substance previously consumed. \nA bill introduced last April ( H 766 ) would have amended the state\u2019s DWI laws to prohibit a person from driving with the following additional controlled substances or their metabolites in his or her blood or urine: cocaine, phencyclidine, methamphetamine, or ketamine. The bill also would have prohibited driving with certain THC levels. The bill was referred to the Committee on Judiciary I, and did not reemerge for further consideration.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shea denning", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office of national drug control policy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhtsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. office of national drug control policy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national highway traffic safety administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nrs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "advanced roadside impaired driving enforcement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "committee on judiciary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ondcp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:48.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b5fae781443e5fc0fd8355e76a910047985b3a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbXRb.hkKCvG3oFMzxail83mrYykHCwTW8iHQFc3wWkMvEbuNeD7H.nrD7Dlzb_tAbQlb.xQJQwkttzfzIBebZ9o-", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Citadelle-Of-Quebec-Hotell.0-l502426-0.Reseguide-Filter-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotell Citadelle of Quebec, Quebec | Expedia.se", "title": "Hotel Le Priori", "title_full": "Hotel Le Priori (Quebec, Kanada) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-08-18T02:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d931772131c5efabb5e82ce7c8ae64ffc2d1e928", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbXRb.hkKCvG3oFMzxail83mrYykHCwTW8iHQFc3wWkMvEbuNeD7H.nrD7Dlzb_tAbQlb.xQJQwktck3up0V_Oih2r_hsEZuAej.RawVXmxXzSo09NcqsUaQ-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-03T06:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Repas excellent...

More than just a hotel, Village offers a place to dine out, stay, work out and play, all under one roof. The brand is dedicated to providing its guests and local residents with everything they could need under one roof.\u201d \nThe cost of the scheme has not been revealed yet but the company confirmed that a planning application is to be submitted to Eastleigh Borough Council in the next few months. \nVillage Hotels said the plans to develop a new hotel in the Eastleigh borough represents the latest phase of the company's investment in Hampshire and follows the opening of the Village Hotel Club Portsmouth . \nThe news of the plans proposed for the site in Chandler\u2019s Ford has been welcomed by the local authorities. \nKeith House , council leader at Eastleigh Borough Council , said: \u201cVillage Hotels\u2019 proposal for Chandler\u2019s Ford looks really exciting. It will bring jobs and growth in the important hotel sector that also brings additional spend to the Borough. Their concept of a quality hotel with restaurant and leisure facilities looks spot on for this area.\u201d \nAs previously reported, 500 more jobs will be created by the the \u00a320m Alpha Park in Chandler's Ford and a \u00a350m train upgrade will create 200 jobs in Eastleigh while the Hamilton Business Park in Hedge End is to create up to 100 jobs. \nAlan Broadhurst, borough councillor for Chandler's Ford West ward and vice chairman at Chandler's Ford Parish Council, said new jobs are needed in the area. \nHe added: \" We'll have to see the application when it comes. If it brings jobs to the area it must be quite good. We have to make sure they don't increase traffic congestion, we have to look at it but we obviously need more jobs.\" \nHe also said: \"If they are going to have conference facilities they could have a positive impact to the area but we don't know what their market is so we can't say exactly what's the impact on the economy.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alan broadhurst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "keith house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "village hotels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandler's ford parish council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starbucks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastleigh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamilton business park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alpha park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bournemouth road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "village hotel club portsmouth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandler", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:48.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c72e325440032d5de64614144db8b45f449e03bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9lYheV1JyURrAdyM.2V3rVORW4pn6LXjWRf2og7d8_lXTXfFawpFsK", "site_full": "www.boards.ie", "site": "boards.ie", "site_section": "http://www.boards.ie/b/forum/872", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Accountancy - boards.ie", "title": "Work experience", "title_full": "Work experience - boards.ie", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "//static.boards.ie/www/i/boards.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9111, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "44a788e166653553cbacf7776046f07a4579624e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9lYheV1JyURrAdyM.2V3rVORW4pn6LXjWRf2og7d8_lV46WD._caggWAPu80Fh4Ao-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Delta1138 said: ...Tbh you lads have more experience, is the iati course worth the paper it's written in?....", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:48.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bfcdd35834a79a5f3078ec5b991879f0a66f882b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQdvlI7XM3gqCqyNJezVQFKWpoqQxHsGFU8fxHfC_YULxgEm_HlZ1v86iLArIIhKvvcSaE.oWPcgZMUHZ0sp31ZSQQFONVUOkvgvsO09873P3h1k7FSX.6tVBSSdGfKroe.SFEPHs7etdCETLicZsD8Cp0FWbyoVCY-", "site_full": "www.420magazine.com", "site": "420magazine.com", "site_section": "https://www.420magazine.com/forums/international-cannabis-news/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "International Cannabis News", "title": "WA: Marijuana Businesses Incur Violations", "title_full": "WA: Marijuana Businesses Incur Violations", "published": "2017-12-06T09:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 58201, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bfcdd35834a79a5f3078ec5b991879f0a66f882b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQdvlI7XM3gqCqyNJezVQFKWpoqQxHsGFU8fxHfC_YULxgEm_HlZ1v86iLArIIhKvvcSaE.oWPcgZMUHZ0sp31ZSQQFONVUOkvgvsO09873P3h1k7FSX.6tVBSSdGfKroe.SFEPHs7etdCETLicZsD8Cp0FWbyoVCY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ron Strider", "published": "2017-12-06T09:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "WA: Marijuana Businesses Incur Violations", "text": "WA: Marijuana Businesses Incur Violations As legalized marijuana continues to find its footing as an industry in Washington, the state\u0092s Liquor and Cannabis Board (LCB) has found that advertising violations make up one of the largest categories of infractions among marijuana businesses.\nIn a report to the House Commerce and Gaming Committee\u0092s Nov. 16 work session, the LCB found 921 enforcement violations between September 2016 and September 2017, of which 14 percent were advertising violations, the second-largest category after the 18 percent segment, made up of marijuana producers who failed to utilize or maintain traceability; in other words, tracking marijuana through the supply chain.\nLCB spokesperson Mikhail Carpenter accounted for this number by pointing out that marijuana businesses had previously operated for decades as an unlicensed industry, without any form of regulation governing how it could promote itself.\n\u0093What makes it especially tricky is that there\u0092s what was allowed by the initial set of restrictions, and then what was allowed by the LCB\u0092s additional rules, and then how the state Legislature chose to further refine what was permissible,\u0094 Carpenter said. \u0093It\u0092s tricky, because you\u0092re dealing with First Amendment free speech issues.\u0094\nAs an example, Carpenter noted that a number of marijuana businesses have been reported for employing \u0093sign spinners\u0094 to hold promotional signs on the sides of roads.\n\u0093There are restrictions on how many signs you can have, and where,\u0094 Carpenter said. \u0093You\u0092re not allowed to advertise on public streets, nor are you allowed to depict marijuana plants or products in print, or with cartoon characters or costumes. It can be complicated.\u0094\nCarpenter noted that the recorded violations are complaint-driven, with some coming from competing businesses and former employees.\n\u0093The public does file objections as well, but it can be nuanced in some cases,\u0094 Carpenter said. \u0093Not all reported violations are found to be actual violations, but they still go into that tally. But our ultimate goal is compliance, not to be punitive.\u0094\nCarpenter encouraged any marijuana business owners with questions about potential violations to reach out to LCB enforcement officers, whom he promised would work with them to try to provide avenues for avoiding noncompliance.\n\u0093We try to forward guidance emails to our licensees, including updates on what the Legislature decides,\u0094 Carpenter said. \u0093We know that not everyone follows the legislative sessions closely.\nTo bring them up to date, Carpenter suggested that marijuana businesses check the \u0093Marijuana 2017\u0094 tab of the LCB website at lcb.wa.gov.\nREQUEST FOR CONSISTENCY\nMolly Fahrenschon manages Sea Change Cannabis, the first legal recreational marijuana store to open on the Olympic Peninsula, in July 2014, and the fifth to open in the state of Washington.\nShe agreed with Carpenter that owners of any cannabis business should remain abreast of the latest changes in the law, and when in doubt about anything, should consult LCB enforcement officers.\n\u0093We always labor over the law,\u0094 Fahrenschon said. \u0093We read it very carefully. Since we first opened, we\u0092ve always operated in a way that would stand up to scrutiny. What else are you supposed to do?\u0094\nAt the same time, Fahrenschon admitted to feeling somewhat frustrated at what she perceives as slightly inconsistent standards between LCB enforcement officers.\n\u0093It\u0092s like being in middle school, when the other girls\u0092 moms let them shave their legs,\u0094 Fahrenschon said. \u0093For the longest time, we couldn\u0092t have punch cards, because our enforcement officer said they were too much like coupons, but then we\u0092d have customers come from other areas and ask if we had punch cards, like the recreational stores had where they came from.\u0094\nDespite those inconsistencies, Fahrenschon has experienced success in promoting the store and its wares through social media, with tweets and Facebook posts sharing the store\u0092s weekly newsletter of available and impending merchandise, as well as its cross-promotions with the Discovery Bay Village Store and the Disco Bay Detour bar.\n\u0093We put a lot of energy into promoting our little community here,\u0094 Fahrenschon said.\nIf Fahrenschon has one request of the state, in its enforcement efforts, it would be to create a universally recognizable, legally permitted symbol for marijuana businesses, one that would not subtract from the total space she\u0092s allowed for the two 1,600-square-inch promotional signs touching her building.\n\u0093When I lived in British Columbia, all the liquor store signs had the same font,\u0094 Fahrenschon said. \u0093I just want a brand that everyone will know.\u0094\n Marijuana businesses incur violations | Law Justice | ptleader.com\nAuthor: Kirk Boxleitner\nContact: Contact Us | Site | ptleader.com\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock\nWebsite: ptleader.com | Your independent news source for Port Townsend and Jefferson County, WA since 1889.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.ptleader.com/", "http://www.ptleader.com/site/contact_us.html", "http://www.ptleader.com/news/law_justice/marijuana-businesses-incur-violations/article_32694190-da1a-11e7-9136-5b5a0e046e3c.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:48.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "455ce9aaefa42f33a916e2be1748dacdaa36e242", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrdxPEGq7KlL9j8LEoS3I7Nc9fSUi4wkZjicdvuZ25fgy_6J6tztKQzlqXVHN0Lk4kcCQGMqNCSlA--", "site_full": "spanienleben.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://spanienleben.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "spanienleben", "title": "CENTRAL ITALY-2.6", "title_full": "CENTRAL ITALY-2.6", "published": "2017-12-07T12:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "455ce9aaefa42f33a916e2be1748dacdaa36e242", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrdxPEGq7KlL9j8LEoS3I7Nc9fSUi4wkZjicdvuZ25fgy_6J6tztKQzlqXVHN0Lk4kcCQGMqNCSlA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Angelika Giese (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "CENTRAL ITALY-2.6", "text": "You felt this earthquake.

If the results are incriminating, you'll be arrested, booked, and will probably face DUI charges . From the perspective of a defendant, it seems like the evidence against you is incontrovertible, and is put in a drawer somewhere to be kept until your trial. \nHowever, there's far more to the story than that. And now the entire state of New Jersey is hearing about that story. Police Officer Found Recalibrating Breathalyzers Improperly \nIn nearby New Jersey, one police sergeant, Marc Dennis, has been recalibrating breathalyzer machines in five central New Jersey counties since 2008. Last year, Mr. Dennis' supervisor discovered that he was skipping a crucial step in the recalibration process: He wasn't making sure that the internal temperature of the machine was 100 degrees Fahrenheit before testing it. This was not a small mistake \u2013 if the machine is a different temperature, the chemical reactions that determine your breath alcohol content (BrAC) work differently, and produce imprecise results. \nWorse, Mr. Dennis claimed to be performing this step on the paperwork associated with the recalibration. Other signs also suggested that he was deliberately skipping the recalibration step. \nMr. Dennis, a police officer, was charged with tampering with public records in the third degree, and with falsifying records in the fourth degree. Uncalibrated Breathalyzers Throw Thousands of Cases in Doubt \nIt was unclear when Mr. Dennis had started improperly calibrating the machines. However, prosecutors in the five counties that used breathalyzers handled by Mr. Dennis made a surprising move: They decided to play it safe. They assumed that all of the DUI cases that used a breathalyzer that had ever been handled by Mr. Dennis were tainted. They notified all of the people in the five counties who had either been convicted for DUI or who had been charged but had not gone to trial yet \u2013 all 20,667 of them \u2013 that there were developments and that they could have their case reviewed. Case Similar to Massachusetts' Drug Testing Fiasco \nThis new case from New Jersey is similar to a pair of fiascos from Massachusetts: The discovery that there was no actual policy for recalibrating breath testing machines , and the state chemist who tried making it seem like she was a better worker than others in the lab, and was convicted of tampering with evidence . \nAltogether, these evidentiary problems highlight the scope of potential problems that can happen behind the scenes. Miscalibrated breath testing machines are primed to produce false positives even before they are used during a traffic stop, while tampering with evidence can happen at any point after it has been gathered.

I just wanted to post some progress pictures of mine so far from my weight cut. I am 25 years old, 5'8.5 -5'9, and I currently weighed in at 201.5 lbs this morning. Before I started (Sept 15th 2017) I was the fattest and heaviest I'd ever been in my life, I was 240 lbs and depressed as ****, had a bad cannabis and alcohol habit and stuffed my face every night before I went to bed. Before I went to university I was in pretty decent shape; I lifted a lot in highschool but it was mostly heavy ego lifting with no emphasis on proper form. I was also never lean. Prior to getting back into it, the last time I had a decent workout was easily a year ago, and probably about 4 years since I was serious about exercise. I store fat very easily and will get fat if I don't watch what I eat. However, I also am able to put on muscle and gain strength fast and am able to retain it despite not training. I adopted a ketogenic/I.F. inspired eating plan, and completely cut out sugar. I did I.F. mostly for the first 6 weeks, then added the keto aspect for the next 8 weeks or so. Carbs were very low, possibly below 40g per day, below 80g for certain. I got most of my carbs from vegetables. Protein was moderate, probably anywhere between 100g and 160g per day. Fat was also high as per the keto approach, easily over 200g per day. I've been doing a lot of fasted cardio, perhaps 4-5x a week of either interval sprinting on the treadmill for about 40 mins or cycling at moderate intensity for about an hour or so. I also did a lot of weight lifting; 5x per week. I began with lighter weights and high reps to avoid injury, but have since been able to bump the weight up significantly, even to beyond my lifetime PR surprisingly. Bench: 225x9, up from 225x2 14 weeks ago. Pull ups: 14 deadhang wide group, up from 3 reps etc etc. So far my weight loss has been around 38-39lbs, which I am very pleased with. Im very happy that I also have managed to gain a significant amount of strength which I did not expect during this weight cut. I plan on still going down another 15lbs of fat minimum, and maybe 20lbs in the long term. I also would like to add more mass to my back and certainly my chest. Although all in all, I'm happy with the results. Any constructive criticism is welcome. I have pretty bad gyno I am aware and will most likely look into surgery in the future when I am ready and have enough time for the recovery. Thanks guys. (EDIT: Not sure why the photos are so blurry, if someone out there knows how to fix this, it is much appreciated.)

MICKELSEN LLP", "published": "2017-12-06T23:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "Public Defender or Hire a Defense Lawyer", "text": "Public Defender or Hire a Defense Lawyer Public Defender or Hire a Defense Lawyer 0 \nIf you have ever watched a television crime or court drama, you know that one of the first things police tell a person when they\u2019re arrested or taken into custody is that they have \u201ca right to a lawyer\u201d and that one will be appointed if they can\u2019t afford to hire their own. This part of the Miranda Warning refers to the right to counsel, which is guaranteed in the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court first clarified this important right in the 1963 case Gideon v. Wainwright . However, many people are still unclear on what the right to counsel entails. Are you always guaranteed a free lawyer? Is it better to pay for your own private defense lawyer? These are important questions, and there are several considerations you should keep in mind if you have been charged with a crime and are trying to decide whether to ask for a public defender or hire a private defense lawyer. What Is a Public Defender? \nA public defender is a real lawyer who has taken and passed the bar exam in the jurisdiction in which he or she practices law. There is no reason to think that these lawyers are people who \u201ccouldn\u2019t make it\u201d in private practice, or that they are any less skilled or qualified than a private criminal defense lawyer. \nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees that everyone has the right to defense counsel in a criminal matter (with some exceptions), but the Supreme Court also recognized that not everyone has the financial means to afford one. This is why the Court clarified the right to counsel in Gideon . \nIn some areas of the country, public defenders work full-time in their public defender roles. In other areas, including smaller municipalities, they may have their own private law practice and work part-time as a public defender. In either case, their fees for public defender work are paid by the taxpayers and not the defendant. \nDepending on the jurisdiction, the criminal defendant may have to fill out a form detailing why he or she should receive a public defender. Courts typically require these types of forms to determine if the individual truly lacks the financial means to hire his or her own private criminal lawyer. This is referred to as \u201cindigence,\u201d which means someone without the means to provide the basic necessities of life, including food, clothing, and shelter. What constitutes indigence varies depending on the jurisdiction, but it is based on income and other means of financial support. However, there are typically exceptions in certain cases, including mentally ill defendants. When Is a Defendant Entitled to a Public Defender? \nContrary to what some people believe, not every criminal defendant is automatically entitled to a public defender. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not kick in unless the defendant is charged with a felony or misdemeanor that is punishable by imprisonment. This means that certain offenses, such as a misdemeanor that is punishable only by a fine, does not include the right to a public defender. The Pros and Cons of a Public Defender vs. a Criminal Defense Lawyer \nIf you\u2019re trying to decide between asking for a public defender and hiring your own criminal defense lawyer, it\u2019s important to consider the pros and cons for each. Cost \nObviously, asking for a public defender involves no cost to the defendant. Your legal counsel is paid by the government, which means you incur no legal fees. By contrast, hiring your own criminal defense lawyer means you must pay legal fees. Choosing Your Lawyer \nOne of the main drawbacks of using a public defender is that you don\u2019t get to select your lawyer. When the court appoints your public defender, they don\u2019t allow you to have any say in the lawyer chosen for you. Facing criminal charges is a stressful experience. When your life and freedom are on the line, you want to have a good rapport with your defense lawyer. More importantly, you want to make sure your defense lawyer truly believes in you and your defense. Work Load \nAnother serious downside of using a public defender is the tremendous case load most public defenders carry. According to a report published by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, \u201cthe average amount of time spent by a public defender at arraignment is often less than six minutes per case.\u201d In most jurisdictions in the country, public defenders are in high demand, and they maintain a huge case load. \nThe report also states, \u201cOne set of workload recommendations for public defenders suggests 150 felony cases or 400 misdemeanor cases per year. Most jurisdictions across the country exceed these recommendations. In some jurisdictions, public defenders may have more than 300 cases at one time . With such high workloads, it is impossible to represent individual clients while adhering to even minimal standards of professionalism.\u201d \nBy contrast, private defense lawyers get work based on their reputation . If they aren\u2019t good at what they do, they won\u2019t stay in business very long. For this reason, they typically only take on as many cases as they can handle, and they are selective about the types of cases they accept. Having a smaller, more reasonable workload means they have more time to devote to each client they represent. \nBroden & Mickelsen", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wainwright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mickelsen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gideon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "defense lawyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "criminal defense lawyer  if", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brennan center for justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york university school of law", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:50.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e92c34bf31297129dcadbbbc38947422819dc60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZREZ84pPzuWG387a0XzmwEFgq17TbOgceC1.IxuZXQgqnA9E0tbSounPj7uaqcT2lcjIU.24p9flg--", "site_full": "lemmasoft.renai.us", "site": "renai.us", "site_section": "https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewforum.php?f=63", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "I am a Writer, Editor, Proofreader or Translator - Lemma Soft Forums", "title": "(Free/Paid) Proofreader, Editor, Writer, Critique [OPEN]", "title_full": "(Free/Paid) Proofreader, Editor, Writer, Critique [OPEN] - Lemma Soft Forums", "published": "2017-11-17T22:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b2289b23bbebbd303e062a99b9f9197f3ff2657", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZREZ84pPzuWG387a0XzmwEFgq17TbOgceC1.IxuZXQgqnA9E0tbSounPj7uaqcT2ldd9nrdIfLCVWjBYqey5QTS", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "renkka", "published": "2017-11-29T03:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Re: (Free/Paid) Proofreader, Editor, Writer, Critique [OPEN] Quote: #3 Post by Rfpnj \u00bb Tue Nov 28, 2017 7:03 pm\nI would be will to talk about an 18+ project, revenue sharing for payment structure.

However, the cameras also incentivize drivers to accept a greater accident risk from stopping. We evaluate the termination of a monitoring program via a voter referendum using 12 years of geo-coded police accident data.

SO much has happened in my life since my last post on here, and of course it was just a gift guide hahaa... nothing personal, but still, since then a lot has changed!\n\nFor starters, I'm officially blonde, and not only blonde, but platinum and I LOVE it!! Love, love, LOVE it!!! At long last too, I've wanted to go platinum for a lifetime, I'm so glad I'm now able to!\n\nOkay but other than hair, I now have a job, which has kept me very, very busy. I work in a pop-up shop for the holidays called Made. It is in Carytown, so if you live in RVA it's your one stop shop this holiday season for all your gifty needs!\n\nMost importantly though, I just spent this past weekend in Los Angeles! What?! I know. How'd that happen? Well I went for the Teen Vogue Summit, which was INCREDIBLE, but more on that later!!! \n\nI arrived in LA two days early, giving me a full day of fun prior to the summit. I stayed with my friend from SCAD, Chris. Chris, his brother and I spent our fun day by the beach! We went to Venice Beach and the Santa Monica Pier. It was really quite fun, lots of colors, people trying to sell you mixtapes, and PLENTY of roller skaters... plenty of them. Here are some of my photos from the day!!\nWe went to a spot called \"Eggslut\" for lunch, I'm not a fan of the name, however I am  a fan of their salads, yes please.\nTHE ICONIC LIFEGUARD STAND!! I couldn't help but jump for joy when I saw this... Also while there, we ran into some other blogger/insta gals doing a lil photoshoot, the photographer was taking photos of cool girls in these turbans that her friend is launching the line of very soon! She asked if she could take some photos of me wearing a few as well, which was of course a yes! It was super cool, so who knows, my head in a turban may be famous one day!! YES!\nLA was in full bloom, which was sort of crazy to see flowers everywhere, but at the same time I suppose that's normal for LA this time of year, STILL!\nNext we headed to the Santa Monica pier, which is actually quite close, we did drive however from Venice Beach, BUT! It is close enough to walk for sure . Although we didn't ride any rides, the pier was a lot of fun, besides the incredible sunset, everything on the pier was full of fun and color! So much SPUNK! My kind of place!\nMy trip to LA flew by in the blink of an eye, I can't wait to share my experience at the summit with you all (soon I promise! Stay tuned, you won't want to miss it!) But I did really enjoy doing the touristy LA things, there is seriously SO MUCH to do, LA is massive, I'll have to go back to take it all in! Whenever that is I do not know, but can't wait!

We will not relax until that happens. But we have just got to forget all this ever happened now. Nick has got to move on with his life, too much time has been wasted.\u201d \nNick, from Ashington , spent eight years in the army after joining-up at the age of 16. \nHe served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, before leaving the forces and taking on private security work. \nAnd when the now 31-year-old was offered work on an anti-piracy ship by an American company four years ago his family thought little of it. \n\u201cHe got this phonecall off an agent in Newcastle who he was in the army with,\u201d Jim explained. \u201cHe said; \u2018I have got you a contract. Can you start on Monday?\u2019 Then he went away and that was the last we seen him. We were happy because we thought it was an American company and it must be safe. It\u2019s ironic that he\u2019s been to all they warzones and come back unscathed then this happens.\u201d \nNick was working on the anti-piracy ship MV Seaman Guard Ohio along with 34 other men in 2013 when the Indian coastguard boarded the vessel and arrested them for taking weapons into India\u2019s territorial waters. \nAt first Nick reassured their family that it was probably a misunderstanding, Jim explained. \n\u201cWhen I heard he had been arrested everybody thought it was just a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had gone through things like this before but then the coastguard would just check their paperwork and they would be on their way. \n\u201cWhen they brought them into port the place was teaming with police and reporters and they realised this was pre-planned. But even then they were saying; \u2018Don\u2019t worry it will be sorted.\u201d \nThe men were then put on a bus and told they were being taken to hospital, but they were instead transported to prison. \nNick and his colleagues were locked-up for around 18 months. \nThe charges were quashed when the men argued the weapons were lawfully held for anti-piracy purposes and their paperwork, issued by the UK Government, was in order. The men were released on bail but were unable to leave India. \nThen in January last year a lower court reinstated the prosecution and Nick, along with five other men from the UK, were convicted and sentenced to five years jail. \nNick was locked up in a tiny cell at Puzhal Central Prison in the Chennai district of India. \nAs his family worked tirelessly trying to get him released, with sister Lisa lobbying local and national politicians, gym-lover Nick kept himself going by training daily with a set of weights he had made out of large stones. And he even did the Great North Run by running his own meticulously measured and timed half marathon made up of many laps of the prison yard. \n\u201cHe loved the gym, he was there 24/7. I think that and the army training is what\u2019s pulled him through. I honestly don\u2019t think he would have survived otherwise. He\u2019s super human.

They were only fed one meal a day and that was always chicken. \n\u201cHis cell was just a concrete room and his bed was a concrete block.\u201d \nLoved ones of Nick and the other jailed Brits, who became known as the Chennai 6, got the news they had been waiting for on this week when an appeal judge quashed on their convictions. \nNick has been staying in an Indian hotel with his sister Lisa as they awaited the court paperwork he needed to leave the country. 10:01", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nick dunn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paul towers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john armstrong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicholas simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ray tindall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy irving", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newcastle airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northumberland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newcastle international airport", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:53.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "712231534a42126e9028f76666c30f8ef0166b34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8iAxwKGL34562E2afUJfFju9XNg8iI9.220qTr56el8_sUMKZoshgZYtHSAZt7zxgLS.MM2PSfPw--", "site_full": "www.early911sregistry.org", "site": "early911sregistry.org", "site_section": "http://www.early911sregistry.org/forums/", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Early 911S Registry - Welcome to our Newsletter", "title": "Genuine Recaro Sport Seats Query", "title_full": "Genuine Recaro Sport Seats Query", "published": "2017-12-06T11:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "486293e162fe0136129eaf510ef80c00d5606637", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8iAxwKGL34562E2afUJfFju9XNg8iI9.220qTr56el8_sUMKZoshgZYtHSAZt7zxhPu6MFb_ynU_qGUGiLQvX65YFPhT0PSvc-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "BOYER73S", "published": "2017-12-07T12:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Genuine single locker recaro sports seat bases for sure.\n1969 to early part of 1973\nThey look nice but in pics no way of telling from the pics if they are original seats vs copies however my guess is original seats restored given the bases are original\nLooks like the side recliners have been painted as they should have chromed screws and a plated side recliner release handle", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:53.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0682620113e3b5d6a3bde2054d98efe598378aeb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz3lxWMVHVHghAU3VQwsbUDmuqY_yh7UReXmY0PbiLRvBpnq_t9xHsOPvah5NtCQPGQVI5.T4cYcK4o2XjZdu2t", "site_full": "forum.bodybuilding.com", "site": "bodybuilding.com", "site_section": "http://forum.bodybuilding.com/external.php?type=RSS2", "site_categories": ["bodybuilding", "sports"], "section_title": "Bodybuilding.com Forums", "title": "gold digger, yah or nah?", "title_full": "gold digger, yah or nah?", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 799, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0682620113e3b5d6a3bde2054d98efe598378aeb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz3lxWMVHVHghAU3VQwsbUDmuqY_yh7UReXmY0PbiLRvBpnq_t9xHsOPvah5NtCQPGQVI5.T4cYcK4o2XjZdu2t", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kiop", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "gold digger, yah or nah?", "text": "gold digger, yah or nah? * tired being tired Crew* *No P.Heyman, No Brock Lesnar Crew* * i used to postpone fisting session, know fisting is part of my daily routine* Today, 01:49 AM #2 Pedicabo ego vos et irrum Join Date: Nov 2006 Rep Power: 36467 lel And they say it's the white man I should fear, but it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here - Tupac Amaru Shakur Today, 01:49 AM #3 She is just being practical...gold digger or nah...She has a point...

An Academy by Lampligh One of Joseph Wright of Derby\u2019s most important candlelit pictures, and one of the last major works by the artist remaining in private hands, made a \u00a37,263,700 record for the artist at Sotheby\u2019s in London tonight. An Academy by Lamplight, painted in 1769, is a supreme example of Wright\u2019s dramatic rendering of light, which in itself is a kind of metaphor for the Enlightenment movement with which he was so closely associated: the introduction of light into darkness acting as a metaphor for the transition from religious faith to scientific understanding and enlightened rationalism. Almost certainly the picture that Wright exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1769, this rare painting was first securely recorded in the collection of Sir Savile Crossley, 1 st Baron Somerleyton (1857-1935), the scion of a great carpet manufacturing dynasty from Halifax, and has remained in the possession of his family ever since. It had been estimated at \u00a32.5-3.5 million. \nThe previous record for the artist was set in 2007 when Portrait of Robert Shore Milnes, with his horse and groom beyond sold for \u00a33,647,830 at Sotheby\u2019s New York. Two recently rediscovered landscapes by John Constable attracted competitive bidding: a first sketch for The Opening of Waterloo Bridge, c. 1819\u201320 made \u00a32,289,000: Dedham Vale with the River Stour in Flood, c. 1814-17 made \u00a31,809,000.

Although it is often imperative to retain the assistance of skilled legal counsel if you are interested in filing a habeas corpus motion in a federal case, few lawyers have the knowledge and experience necessary to handle these types of cases. Our firm has the knowledge and experience necessary to help individuals in these situations. Habeas Corpus Explained \nHabeas corpus is a procedure in which a court analyzes whether a person is being held illegally in jail or any other type of detainment process. If the court determines that a person is being detained illegally, the court has the authority to order state authorities to release the prisoner from custody. One of the challenges presented in filing a habeas corpus motion is that the petitioner must prove to a court that the individual should be released. Federal courts rely on the presumption that the facts decided by lower courts were correct. To win a federal habeas corpus motion, a person must establish that the court was unreasonably incorrect in its decision and denied one or more of the individual\u2019s federal constitutional rights. Types of Errors Involved in Habeas Corpus Motions \nA federal court will address a broad variety of issues in a habeas corpus proceeding. These claims, however, must arise from rights that are granted to the individual by the United States Constitution or through federal law. These laws must also relate to rights that criminal defendants possess at trial or on direct appeal. It should be noted that a person cannot base a federal Habeas corpus claim on a search or seizure that was in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Timeliness \nAnother substantial challenge presented by habeas corpus motions is timeliness. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 created a one-year time period within which federal habeas corpus petitions must be filed. The statute of limitations period begins to run from the latest of one of four potential dates: The date on which the United States Supreme Court denied a petition for certiorari to review a state court\u2019s decision. If the state created an illegal obstacle that prevented the person from filing a federal habeas corpus motion, the date on which the obstacle was removed. If the United States Supreme Court rules that a new constitutional right exists and applies to the person\u2019s case, the date on which this decision is filed. If the petitioner would not have discovered the facts supporting the claim by \u201cdue diligence\u201d, the date on which the facts at hand would have been discovered through \u201cdue diligence\u201d applies to the case.

Hi All, I have started my fitness journey recently. I am 34 years old, 5'7\" (170cm) and started at 304 lbs (138 kgs) on 30th October. On my last weight-in (30th November) I was 277 lbs (126 kgs). I am currently following Cambridge Weight Plan and will continue this until end of January 2018, by when I estimate I should be around 231 lbs (105 kg). My eventual goal is to reach 176 lbs (80 kgs) with a bodyfat percentage between 10-15%. I am not sure what should be my further diet and exercise plan, February on wards. Should I concentrate on fat loss, in which case I prefer a ketogenic diet plan, reach my goal weight and then start building muscle mass. Or should I directly start with muscle building, with lets say a high protein diet. All your advice will be extremely appreciated.
