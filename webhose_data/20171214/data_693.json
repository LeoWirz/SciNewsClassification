It was the most common form of government until the 19th century. Today, most monarchies are constitutional, that is the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power. The following speech shall discuss in detail whether the state form of monarchy is still convenient today.\r\n\r\n\tIn Romania, the first argument given by supporters of monarchy is that elected representatives are often corrupt or susceptible to bribes. Unfortunately, often that turns out to be true. Officials invested with power by the people get corrupted by this power and act selfishly, ignoring the interests of the people. Monarchists say that a monarch would act fairly and with honor, because it\u2019s in their best interest that the state prospers. However, that may not always be the case. John Dalberg-Acton, an English Baron, once said that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Opponents to monarchy say that no one person should be vested with so much power. Democracies have a system of checks and balances to better manage such a high amount of power. On the other hand, a monarch, like any other single person, can be much more easily corrupted by power. History has proven this time and again through examples like Julius Caesar or Napoleon.\r\n\r\n\tAnother important aspect to discuss is being able to choose your leaders (Leitfiguren). Usually, monarchies are hereditary, that is, the throne gets inherited from parent to child. Monarchists argue that heredity of the throne is a good thing, since the heir is given a select education from an early age to become a good leader for his country. On the other hand, elected official can be chosen directly by the citizens, and they can change their leader if he seems unfit for the job. Changing a monarch is harder and can cost us more than changing an elected official. If a country has a weak monarch, they can either suffer the consequences or change the monarch and suffer from instability. A political crisis is much easier to fix and can ultimately be solved through democratic elections.\r\n\r\n\tLastly, when talking about constitutional monarchies, people like to bring up tradition and tourism as arguments in favor of monarchy. Let\u2019s take the example of the United Kingdom. British republicans claim that the British royal family costs the state over 200 million pounds per year. That includes costs for official visits and security costs. However, royalists claim that the royal family generates profit to the budget of the United Kingdom. According to the British tourism agency, the British royal family generates 500 million pounds every year in tourism revenue. This sum includes visits to the Tower of London, Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace. Moreover, royal events also boost the economy. For example, the British royal wedding in 2011 boosted London\u2019s economy by 107 million pounds. It\u2019s also worth noting that the members of the royal family also have duties to the United Kingdom. They organize charity events, they represent the United Kingdom in meetings with official dignitaries, and occasionally have military duties to the country. Prince Harry himself serves in the Royal Air Force.\r\n\r\n\tIn conclusion, we can say that traditional monarchies certainly have their merits. They sometimes have better prepared leaders than republics, and often a monarch is more loved and respected than politicians by the people. However, electing the leaders gives people more freedom of choice and prevents leadership disasters caused by a weak or corrupt leader. Last but not least, a country with an old tradition for monarchy can benefit a lot financially from tourism and diplomacy. Given willingness to adapt to modern times, it\u2019s safe to say that monarchies can still work today.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "prince harry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leitfiguren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john dalberg-acton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julius caesar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "napoleon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "royal air force", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "romania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buckingham palace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "windsor castle", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:07.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6aaf9835eea92318d835dbfb63335cc31acb3b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwhKmPvBJ1ssX4fBJyDV0m9Zo6l7gU1q9i.FfddpibIhEaw4l8TRWpbx4L8JCBYW0QTGUE2zTF6pQ--", "site_full": "foro.fciencias.unam.mx", "site": "unam.mx", "site_section": "http://foro.fciencias.unam.mx/foro2/syndication.php", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "ForoCiencias -

In this Dec. 4, 2017 image from an Associated Press Television video, the post-World War II memoirs composed by Japanese Emperor Hirohito are displayed at Bonham's suction house in New York. On Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2... \nBy TOM McELROYAssociated Press \nNEW YORK (AP) - A Japanese plastic surgeon known for his extreme political views has purchased at auction for $275,000 a memoir by Japanese Emperor Hirohito offering his recollections of World War II. \nThe 173-page document was sold Wednesday at Bonhams auction house in Manhattan for nearly double its expected top price. \n\"It should have been in Japan, but it ended up overseas,\" Dr. Katsuya Takasu told The Associated Press in Tokyo. \"So it feels like it's finally coming back.\" \nTakasu said he wants to give the memoir to the only grandson of current Emperor Akihito, but said there is a limit of 150,000 yen (about $1,300) on gifts to the imperial family. He has no plans to show the work to the public or the media, and said he's trying to figure out a way to get it to Akihito's grandson. \nTakasu was a member of the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, but the organization terminated his membership last month after the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights group, pointed out his use of social media to praise Adolf Hitler and deny the Holocaust and the Nanjing massacre. \nHirohito dictated the memoir to his aides soon after the end of the war. It was created at the request of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, whose administration controlled Japan at the time. \nThe document, also known as the imperial monologue, covers events from the Japanese assassination of Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin in 1928 to the emperor's surrender broadcast recorded on Aug. 14, 1945. \nIts contents caused a sensation when they were first published in Japan in 1990, just after the emperor's death. \nThe two volumes are each bound with strings, the contents written vertically in pencil. It was transcribed by Hidenari Terasaki, an imperial aide and former diplomat who served as a translator when Hirohito met with McArthur. \nThe monologue is believed among historians to be a carefully crafted text intended to defend Hirohito's responsibility in case he was prosecuted after the war. A 1997 documentary on Japan's NHK television found an English translation of the memoir that supports that view. \nThe transcript was kept by Terasaki's American wife Gwen Terasaki after his death in 1951 and then handed over to their daughter Mariko Terasaki Miller and her family. \n___ \nAssociated Press videojournalist Kaori Hitomi in Tokyo contributed to this report.

Benjamin Graham, Keesler Air Force Base Honor Guard Delta Flight NCO in charge, honor guard, a year-long contract, was not what he expected it to be. \n\u201cWhen I joined honor guard I didn\u2019t know a lot about it,\u201d said Graham. \u201cI just saw the face of the Air Force Honor Guard; them doing shows, performing and twirling rifles. Now that I\u2019ve gotten into it, it means a lot more.\u201d \nEach Keesler Honor Guard member goes through several months of training to be proficient in posting the colors, flag folding, firing party and pallbearer skills but despite their training to have a stoic persona, precise facing movements and meticulous uniform, they face difficulties as well. \nOctober 26, 2017 - Keesler Air Force Base Honor Guard members practice flag folding procedures before a funeral ceremony at the Biloxi National Cemetery in Biloxi, Mississippi. Every month the Keesler Honor Guard participates in a monthly funeral ceremony at the Biloxi National Cemetery to honor the unaccompanied remains of military members. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Suzanna Plotnikov) \nArriving to his first funeral at a dark, cloudy rain-filled New Orleans cemetery Graham had to focus on keeping his military bearing to present the proper funeral military honors for a grieving family. \n\u201cIt was raining several days prior to the funeral so the cemetery was run down, the tombstones were folded over and weeds were growing everywhere,\u201d said Graham. \u201cThere was two inches of muddy water throughout all the gravesites so it gave it a really disturbing look. The whole group was trying to get our bearing to figure out each honor guardsman\u2019s position.\u201d \nThe final handing off of the flag to the next of kin can be one of the most remembered parts of a military funeral. Like some parts of life, not every situation goes to plan and for Graham, handing the flag to the mourning family at his first funeral was no exception. \n\u201cThe family showed up to the funeral 30 minutes early so we had to improvise,\u201d said Graham. \u201cThere were tons of people in a small area so it gave me a claustrophobic feeling. There was nowhere for the family to sit so I had to hand the flag to someone who was standing up instead of the norm of them sitting down.\u201d \nLooking into the eyes of someone you don\u2019t know and handing them the U.S. flag may bring a sense of sadness to anyone but according to Graham, this last moment of each military funeral reinvigorates each honor guardsman to perform better at each funeral. \n\u201cThey\u2019re crying and they\u2019re thankful; you\u2019re kind of healing their sadness a little bit,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been very appreciative of and I think that\u2019s what reignites the fire into most of the honor guard teams whenever they\u2019re handing off that flag.\u201d \nGraham wouldn\u2019t have had a chance to experience the sense of pride and patriotism that comes with performing honor guard duties if it weren\u2019t for his superiors. After speaking to his mentor, a prior chief master sergeant, Graham realized he was going to be a part of something much bigger than himself and possibly the last time some families have contact with the military. \n\u201cMost people who aren\u2019t affiliated with military don\u2019t really know what to expect from military members and this might be the first and last time they see a military member,\u201d said Graham. \u201cThey can see how passionate we are and it instills some sense of pride in America and gives them hope that there are people who are still willing to do what needs to be done . . . even as an honor guardsman.\u201d \nBy U.S. Air Force Airman 1st Class Suzanna Plotnikov", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "suzanna plotnikovde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suzanna plotnikov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin graham", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. air force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keesler air force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keesler honor guard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "air force honor guard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "biloxi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new orleans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biloxi national cemetery", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:08.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d37dc9229c264ceef7fb3460a07d95d2d6d9d286", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwnkSD_ftRAJpsI243B3lECiwiqUHpPD346u3DGck5C7Fe51vMrH2ck8SrLhaLVzwOw3GwD6kaDdaKD.1ZgtzkbDe2r6oTGQPkXhpEuiu.wrbquMUhRdOS8dOU8E2n3h1z9.xbYrnY9STuSmiXumQ9sbKTbgVkLKnxN6kHTXuYfdWooKqKqrnW52h1v0KntZT9P4TNR4frq3fjqaRxYbBW", "site_full": "thefield.scroll.in", "site": "scroll.in", "site_section": "https://scroll.in", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Scroll.in", "title": "Much has changed for India since Dipa Karmakar, and the inaugural Indian Gymnastics League is proof", "title_full": "Much has changed for India since Dipa Karmakar, and the inaugural Indian Gymnastics League is proof", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5685, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d37dc9229c264ceef7fb3460a07d95d2d6d9d286", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwnkSD_ftRAJpsI243B3lECiwiqUHpPD346u3DGck5C7Fe51vMrH2ck8SrLhaLVzwOw3GwD6kaDdaKD.1ZgtzkbDe2r6oTGQPkXhpEuiu.wrbquMUhRdOS8dOU8E2n3h1z9.xbYrnY9STuSmiXumQ9sbKTbgVkLKnxN6kHTXuYfdWooKqKqrnW52h1v0KntZT9P4TNR4frq3fjqaRxYbBW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zenia D'Cunha", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "Much has changed for India since Dipa Karmakar, and the inaugural Indian Gymnastics League is proof", "text": "\n\u201cThere has been a sea change in Indian gymnastics, from circus to IGL\u201d\nThe inaugural Indian Gymnastics League, held in Mumbai, began with this sentiment from Sushmita Joshi, a former gymnast who is now working with the District Sports Office.\nDespite the administrative issues over the last four years, a lot has changed for Indian gymnastics since the girl from Tripura missed the Olympics podium by a whisker.

Published on 7th December 2017 Image: Alastair Humphreys Share this \nTraditionally, adventurers have tackled far-flung challenges in remote landscapes. I was no different, cycling round the world, crossing Iceland on foot and rowing across the Atlantic Ocean. \nOnly when I returned home did I begin to open my eyes to something I\u2019d never noticed before: that wilderness and beauty had surrounded me all the time. You don\u2019t need to travel halfway around the globe for gorgeous sunrises, or to marvel at starry skies from your sleeping bag. All you actually need to do is make a plan, this very weekend, to do something wherever you happen to live. To plan a microadventure. \nThe UK is the perfect place to evangelise about microadventures. It\u2019s a crowded country. The mountains are small and the rivers short. In other words, if microadventures are great here, then the idea works everywhere in the world. \nEven if you live in a city, you\u2019re no more than an hour away from trees, hills and natural water. You may feel you don\u2019t have enough time, but everyone can manage a night out in a bivvy bag. Microadventures are cheap too: anyone can enjoy cooking on fires or exploring woodlands. You don\u2019t need to be fit or a professional adventurer. Since I began sleeping out on hilltops and swimming in rivers, thousands of people have joined the idea, sharing their experiences online with the #microadventure hashtag. The only hard bit is making the decision to go out and do it. Image: Alastair Humphreys \n1// A bothy microadventure Scotland has a great collection of unlocked bothy huts you can stay in for free, by lochs, in valleys and on clifftops. There are some in England and Wales, too. Planning is half the fun of a bothy trip. The Mountain Bothies Association is the charity that maintains them and is well worth supporting. \n2// A journey round your home A regular complaint people say is: there\u2019s nowhere interesting where I live. Draw a circle around your home on a map. Then walk out to that line, and make a journey round your home. A two-mile radius becomes a 16-mile walk. I guarantee you\u2019ll see places you\u2019ve never seen before. In other words, you\u2019ll be exploring! If you live in the countryside, camp out along the way to add to the feeling of adventure. \n3// A five to nine Microadventure Imagine leaving work at 5pm one warm, sunny evening. Instead of heading home as usual, hop on a train with a rucksack and a friend. Climb a hill, turn off your phone and watch the sunset. Sleep under the stars and wake at sunrise. Dash back down the hill, get on the train and be back at your desk by 9am. A simple but memorable adventure! \n4// Cycle to the sea A bicycle is a great machine for exploring as long distances become manageable. Nobody in the UK lives more than 70 miles from the coast so why not jump on a bike and cycle to the sea, or begin training for that challenge? Take a dip, have an ice cream, stare out at the horizon. Visiting the ocean is always good for the soul. Either cycle home or hop on a train, depending on your energy levels. \n5// Take the tube Microadventures encourage recapturing child-like joy. What kid wouldn\u2019t love floating down a beautiful river on a tractor tyre inner tube, or cooking a meal on a stove they made themselves from a drink can? And wouldn\u2019t most adults enjoy that as well? This is a chance to slow life right down, to simplify, to laugh and to appreciate seeing the landscape from a fresh perspective. It\u2019s far cheaper and simpler than buying and transporting a canoe, too.

( Isaiah 9:6 KJV) \nMore than 2,500 years ago, the prophet Isaiah told of One who would be the hope of mankind, the long awaited Messiah who would establish an eternal kingdom based on justice and righteousness. Isaiah\u2019s important pronouncement told that this one would be a God-man: a child born\u2014His humanity; a son given\u2014His deity. The quintuplet of names ascribed to this One gives further insight into His character and ministry: \u2022 Wonderful\u2014 He would be wonderful in what He would accomplish for the fallen human race. \u2022 Counselor\u2014 He would be our guide through life, and our advocate before the heavenly Father. \u2022 The Mighty God\u2014 He would be the God before whom every knee shall one day bow. \u2022 The Everlasting Father\u2014 He would be the God of eternity. \u2022 The Prince of Peace\u2014 He would be the one who would ultimately bring a true tranquillity among all nations. \nAudrey Mieir has been widely known for several decades as the composer and author of many fine gospel songs and choruses. \u201cHis Name Is Wonderful,\u201d written in 1959, is one of her finest. She tells in her biography how the inspiration for this song occurred while she watched the annual Christmas program given at her Bethel Union Church in Duarte, California. After the usual procession of angels, shepherds, Mary and Joseph, the singing of \u201csleep in heavenly peace,\u201d the pastor of the church suddenly exclaimed\u2014\u201cHis Name Is Wonderful.\u201d Audrey Mieir tells that she quickly grabbed her Bible, searched the concordance for names given to Jesus in the Scriptures, and soon composed this song, which has since been sung around the world: His name is Wonderful, His name is Wonderful, His name is Wonderful, Jesus, my Lord; He is the mighty King, Master of ev\u2019rything; His name is Wonderful, Jesus, my Lord; He\u2019s the great Shepherd, the Rock of all ages, Almighty God is He; bow down before Him, love and adore Him; His name is Wonderful, Jesus my Lord. For Today : Psalm 72:19; Proverbs 18:10; 22:1; John 1:12; Acts 4:12; Philippians 2:9,10 \nThe more intimately we know the \u201cchild-Son,\u201d the deeper grows our love and devotion for Him. Worship Him even now and throughout the day with the singing of this song\u2014 \nOsbeck, K. W. \nEZC And blessed be his glorious Name forever: and let all the earth be filled with his glory. So be it, even so be it . Psalm 72:19 The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous runneth unto it, and is exalted . Proverbs 18:10 A good name is to be chosen above great riches, and loving favor is above silver and above gold . Proverbs 22:1 But as many as received him, to them he gave prerogative to be the sons of God, even to them that believe in his Name , John 1:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for among men there is given none other Name under heaven, whereby we must be saved . Acts 4:12 Wherefore God hath also highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name.

Private colleges had received Rs 3,000 to Rs 6,000 from local students as processing fee. Some colleges received online applications while others had asked the students to purchase prospectus from colleges. Advertisement of the admissions were published in national newspapers as well as posted on official websites of the colleges. The admission process started in July and it is still incomplete despite the lapse of six months. Papers leaked for MDCAT conducted by the University of Health Sciences (UHS) was another factor that not only caused loss of students and their parents\u2019 confidence in the conduct of entry tests but this also contributed delay in admissions. The Higher Education Commission (HEC) also conducted entry test twice. However, the UHS conducted new test at the end of October. This clearly showed mala fide on the part of the authorities who were responsible for holding transparent test. There is no uniformity in entry tests for admissions in medical colleges controlled by the Higher Education Commission (HEC), National University of Medical Sciences (NUMS) and University of Health Sciences (UHS) as they hold separate tests. It is now learnt that some litigation is going on between Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) over admission policy which is causing delay in completion of admission process. Parents, worried about the future of their children, criticized PMDC for delaying the admissions. They also flayed the sudden increase in admission fee from Rs 600,000 to Rs 900,000 by the colleges. They demanded that the government frame a uniform policy for admissions to medical colleges. \u201cThere should be one entry test for admission to private colleges and in private colleges; old fee structure should be restored,\u201d they added. In every province, there should be one authority to control admission process on the basis of merit. Action should be taken against the private colleges who force the students to pay heavy fees, they demanded.

Warner, a practicing cardiologist and the CEO of UT Southwestern University Hospitals in Dallas, promptly collapsed following the episode. He was taken to a local hospital, where doctors inserted a stent to open a clogged artery. The heart attack was termed minor by the operating surgeons, and Warner was soon on his way to recovery following the stent procedure. Nancy Brown, the Heart Association\u2019s CEO, said in a statement; \u201cJohn wanted to reinforce that this incident underscores the important message that he left us with in his presidential address yesterday \u2013 that much progress has been made, but much remains to be done,\u201d Warner\u2019s family was on-hand to see him deliver his presidential address following his recovery, during which Warner, 52, talked about the toll heart disease has taken on his family. Both his father and paternal grandfather required bypass surgery in their 60s, and he lost a maternal grandfather and great-grandfather to heart disease. He was 6 years old when his great-grandfather died suddenly, Warner said in his speech. It was the first time he was exposed to the term \u201cheart attack,\u201d he said. \u201cI know this is also true in far too many other families, not just in the U.S. but around the world,\u201d Warner added. \u201cTogether we can make sure old men and old women are regulars at family reunions, that people live long enough and healthy enough to enjoy walks and fishing trips with their grandchildren and maybe even their great-grandchildren. In other words, I look forward to a future where people have the exact opposite experience of my family, that children grow up surrounded by so many healthy, beloved, elderly relatives that they couldn\u2019t imagine life any other way.\u201d December 7, 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warner",

Dershahn Stewart of the Vipers made 36. \nAfter a scoreless first period, the Vipers took a 2-0 lead in the second. \nTyler Russell scored 47 seconds into the period and Aidan Ryan followed at 12:25. \nBushnell cut the Vipers' lead in half at 17:26 with his 10th goal of the season. \nEric Kirby scored for the Vipers on a power play at 2:28 of the third period. \nManny Silverio ended the scoring at 5:32. \nThe Maroons will play two games this weekend. They'll visit the Strathroy Rockets on Saturday and host the Vipers at 7 p.m. Sunday at Chatham Memorial Arena. \nThe Maroons (12-13-0-1) remain in sixth place in the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League's Western Conference. \nThe Vipers tied the St. Thomas Stars and Leamington Flyers for second place, seven points behind the London Nationals.
