"title": "MailBee Objects 9.1", "text": "MailBee Objects   MailBee Objects 9.1 full description MailBee Objects is a set of full-featured and easy-to-use ActiveX COM objects which let your applications create, send, download, parse and manage e-mails on mail servers, file system or in memory. Supports SMTP, POP3, IMAP, SS/TLS (including Gmail), S/MIME (mail encryption and signing), HTML mail, multiple attachments, international charsets (including UTF-8), international e-mail addresses (IDN domains), secure login (incuding APOP, NTLM, GSSAPI/NTLM, GSSAPI/Kerberos, CRAM-MD5), Integrated Windows Authentication, send to queue, DNS MX lookup (direct send without SMTP relay server), email address validation, ESMTP authentication, events, logging, error handling. The MIME parser is fast but very accurate, it can even decode wrong-formatted e-mails. You can also convert HTML body to plain text, create or display HTML body with embedded pictures, examine or add custom headers to e-mails (such as request read receipt), work with TNEF (winmail.dat) attachments, download headers or entire messages, manage IMAP folders, check read/unread and other IMAP flags, use IMAP IDLE and QUOTA extensions, determine special IMAP folders like Sent or Drafts using SPECIAL-USE and XLIST extensions, search e-mails, sort them if SORT is supported by IMAP server, upload files to web server in ASP IIS applications, and much more. The components can work together. For instance, you can download e-mail message from POP3 server, parse and modify it, and then forward it through SMTP server. MailBee.dll is available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. It's very light-weight and has no visual interface (pure COM component).

His country was also keen to set up a large manufacturing unit in the state, the envoy added. The Ambassador further offered unique 15-seater aircraft for boosting regional mobility in Punjab, saying these planes can take off from any terrain, from mobile airports that can be set up in remote areas. The chief minister directed his officials to take the Czech ambassador's suggestions forward through further discussion.

Guyler-Alaniz shared her story of how FarmHer started and how it is helping to shine a light on women in agriculture. \nMarji Guyler-Alaniz spent more than a decade working in a corporate setting and, although she was successfully climbing the ladder, felt there was more she wanted to do. \nSpeaking to an audience of more than 50 people at the 16thannual Farm News Ag Show, Guyler-Alaniz shared her story of how she went from risk management for a large crop insurance company to founder and president of FarmHer. \nGuyler-Alaniz was born in Webster City where her grandparents farmed. Now the farm remains in the family with the next generation farming. \nShe and her family moved to the Des Moines area when she was a young girl and lived on farm before she eventually went to school at Grand View University, majoring in graphic design, journalism and photography. \nThrough her time at the crop insurance firm Rain and Hail, she earned her MBA from Drake University. -Messenger photo by Kriss Nelson Mike Richards, instructor for Iowa Central Community College\u2019s agricultural technology program, talks with with Marji Guyler-Alaniz, founder and president of FarmHer, and Lexi Marek, communications and marketing coordinator for FarmHer, during the Farm News Ag Show. Guyler-Alaniz shared her story Wednesday afternoon at the show. \n\u201cI spent 11 years climbing that ladder trying to get to what I wanted to do, and when I got there I realized it wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do anymore,\u201d she said. \nGuyler-Alaniz said Feb. 1, 2013, was her last day working in the corporate world. \nJust a few days later, during the 2013 Super Bowl, it was the Dodge Ram pickup truck commercial \u201cGod Made a Farmer\u201d narrated by Paul Harvey and featuring still pictures of farmers that eventually changed her life forever. \nGuyler-Alaniz said she was reading a newspaper article about the commercial when she became aware of the lack of women represented in the ad. \n\u201cI read the article and thought, man this doesn\u2019t seem right,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd coming off of a career in corporate agriculture it was the same way. Very rarely did I travel with other women, or was in meetings with other women. I was a serious minority. So when I read this, it affected me. I found it frustrating because we are here.\u201d \nApril 17, 2013, Guyler-Alaniz started taking pictures of women in agriculture. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to start this project,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew I was going to take pictures, and it was a beginning of a cool journey.\u201d \nGuyler-Alaniz said she had a goal that first summer to take a picture of seven women. She soon started up a basic website, started sharing those photos on social media and FarmHer was born. \n\u201cIt was in the middle of July when all of that went public and what happened after that shocked me,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew this mattered to me and I visited those seven farms, and I knew there was something really cool out there. Something amazing and something beautiful that I was seeing.\u201d \nGuyler-Alaniz said she was shocked at the number of women in agriculture that started coming to her, thanking her and telling her how they could relate with those photographs. \nSoon she was advised to trademark the name \u201cFarmHer\u201d which, she said, made it into a real business. She started selling shirts, expanded from the online world and ventured out into speaking about her business. \nThis led to interest from RFD TV. \n\u201cThey had been looking for ways to showcase women, to talk about women, to talk to women on their network,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wanted to talk about doing a television show that took exactly what I was doing and bringing that to life on television.\u201d \nFarmHer continues to grow. \n\u201cWhat is FarmHer? Our mission is to shine the light on the role that women play in agriculture,\u201d she said. \u201cIt always has been and always will be.\u201d \nGuyler-Alaniz said over the last four years she has come up with a lot of different ways to accomplish that mission through social media, podcasts, radio, merchandise, publications, conferences and television. \n\u201cWe are about connecting, empowering and inspiring women,\u201d she said. \nFarmHer has allowed Guyler-Alaniz to see a lot of different aspects of agriculture \u2014 taking her out of the corn and soybean fields of central Iowa to ranches and farms in Montana and Texas to vineyards in California to oyster farms in Maine and cranberry bogs in Massachusetts. \n\u201cYou name it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have seen a lot of different things and as you have seen by the women I have told you the stories of today, some of them work on farms, volunteer on farms, some work in corporate agriculture, some of them have thousands of acres, some of them have less than one acre. At the end of the day, each and every one of these women is an important part of agriculture and it has been such a neat thing for me to get to experience and see. An absolutely amazing thing.\u201d \nFarmHer is now in its second season on RFD TV.

Holiday shopping budgets are up 8 per cent from last year to an average of nearly $650 , and Canadians plan on spending on average about another $300 on entertaining and other celebrations over the festive season.\nYet, more than half ( 52 per cent ) expect to go over budget, and two in five ( 41 per cent ) admit they really can't afford the holiday spending, but feel pressured to participate, the poll findings show.\n\"While the holidays are meant to be a time to reconnect with loved ones, Canadians are telling us that they're secretly frustrated with the shopping, stress and overspending that can end up eclipsing the joy of the season,\" says David Nicholson , Vice-President, Imperial Service, CIBC. \"It's time to reset expectations, so the holidays can be enjoyed to their fullest. No tradition is set in stone. Take some time with friends and family to discuss new traditions that might better reflect your shared values and help to reduce the costs and stress of the holidays.\"\nKey poll findings:\n64 per cent of Canadians say 'holiday spending is out of control' Canadians plan to spend on average $643 on holiday shopping, up 8 per cent compared to $597 last year Millennials are upping their spending by 39 per cent to about $555 this year, with nearly half saying they're modern-day Santas who 'absolutely love giving holiday gifts' Those in Atlantic Canada remain the country's top gift-buyers, spending on average $827 Spending is higher in all provinces except Alberta , where holiday shopping budgets are slightly down this year $291 is the amount Canadians will spend on additional holiday expenses, including d\u00e9cor, entertaining, New Year celebrations and Boxing Day sales; highest in B.C. and Ontario at $413 and $302 , respectively More than half ( 52 per cent ) expect to go over their holiday-spending budget 74 per cent wish they could save more money at this time of year\nWhile most will use credit ( 59 per cent ) and cash/debit ( 50 per cent ) to cover their holiday bills, the poll finds that using rewards points or gift cards to offset expenses is growing in popularity, particularly among women, millennials and Atlantic Canadians.\n\"With as many three-quarters of Canadians conceding that they 'wish they could save more money' at this time of the year, it's clear we need to do things differently, put savings first, and find new ways to trim costs this season,\" says Mr. Nicholson. \"While part of that means having tough conversations, it also means sticking to a firm budget and having a savings plan in place so that the holidays don't derail you from your goals.\"\nBah Humbug: Costly holiday traditions\nThe hectic shopping, excess spending, time crunch, and the pressure to give gifts \u2013 in fact, 'the entire holiday season itself'\u2014are Canadians' biggest holiday irritants, the poll finds. As many as two in five ( 41 per cent ) admit they can't afford the holiday spending, but don't want to be the Scrooge, who raises the idea of not giving gifts first, or know of at least one person who they wish would stop giving them a gift so they wouldn't have to give one back.\nFully half ( 50 per cent ) of Canadians admit they only somewhat enjoy, or feel duty bound to participate in the gift-giving, including 9 per cent who say they hate giving gifts because it's too stressful and expensive.\nThe survey also showed that 38 per cent of Canadians have already changed a holiday tradition to reduce stress and spending, with 43 per cent setting a limit on gift-spending, 27 per cent agreeing to give gifts to small children, and 20 per cent opting for the single gift-exchange of a Secret Santa or Kris Kringle.\nOne in four ( 27 per cent ) of them have done away with gift-exchange altogether, and 14 per cent have opted to get together for a shared experience in lieu of gifts.\nGive the gift of cash\nCash or gift cards are this holiday season's hottest gifts, with more than half ( 56 per cent ) putting it on their wish list. That's in line with an earlier CIBC Savings Poll that found many Canadians receive extra cash throughout the year, which could be used to bolster short- or long-term savings.\nAs well, the poll finds that nearly half ( 48 per cent ) of those surveyed send money or packaged gifts by mail to loved ones over the holidays.\n\"Sending money electronically can be a great way to reduce stress and keep costs down,\" says Mr. Nicholson, who suggests a fast and easy way of sending money is via electronic transfers or no-fee remittance CIBC Global Money Transfer service. \"The best part is that you can immediately transfer that extra money into your savings account to get you closer to your savings goals and, ultimately, the bigger items on your wish list.\"\nFive tips for holiday happiness:\nReboot expectations with family and friends Make a list and track your spending Use prepaid cards to avoid over-spending Use rewards points or gift cards to offset costs Direct cash gifts towards your savings goals\nKEY POLL FINDINGS :\nAverage amount Canadians say they plan to spend on holiday shopping this year, by region:\n2017\n2016\nAll Canadians\n$643\n$597\nBritish Columbia\n$661\n$529\nAlberta\n$676\n$688\nManitoba/Saskatchewan\n$653\n$647\nOntario\n$692\n$670\nQuebec\n$479\n$406\nAtlantic Canada\n$827\n$803\nAverage amount Canadians say they plan to spend on holiday shopping this year, by age:\n2017\n2016\n18-34 years\n$555\n$399\n35-54 years\n$669\n$670\n55 years and older\n$696\n$693\nAverage amount Canadians will spend on other holiday related expenses including entertaining, new year traditions, Boxing Day sales and d\u00e9cor, by region:\n2017\nAll Canadians\n$291\nBritish Columbia\n$413\nAlberta\n$284\nManitoba/Saskatchewan\n$285\nOntario\n$302\nQuebec\n$221\nAtlantic Canada\n$252\nAverage amount Canadians will spend on other holiday related expenses including entertaining, new year traditions, Boxing Day sales and d\u00e9cor, by age:\n2017\n18-34 years\n$266\n35-54 years\n$306\n55 years and older\n$296\nPercentage of Canadians who say they are likely to go over-budget this holiday season on all holiday related expenses, by age:\nAll Canadians\n18-34\n35-54\n55+\nVery likely\n17 %\n24 %\n18 %\n10 %\nSomewhat likely\n35 %\n38 %\n38 %\n29 %\nSomewhat unlikely\n28 %\n28 %\n25 %\n30 %\nVery unlikely\n20 %\n10 %\n19 %\n31 %\nCanadians' top five biggest holiday irritants:\nThe craziness of holiday shopping\n23 %\nGoing over budget or unplanned spending\n16 %\nTime crunch around the holiday season\n13 %\nFeeling pressure to give gifts\n10 %\nAll of it \u2013 the holiday season itself\n16 %\nHow Canadians describe their gift-giving personality, by age:\nAll Canadians\n18-34\n35-54\n55+\nModern Day Santa - I absolutely love giving holiday gifts to friends and family, it's part of the holiday magic!\n42 %\n47 %\n40 %\n40 %\nTraditionalist - I somewhat enjoy giving holiday gifts to friends and family - it's tradition\n29 %\n27 %\n30 %\n29 %\nDuty-Bound - I give holiday gifts to as few people as possible - and mostly because I feel obligated or receive a present from them\n12 %\n15 %\n12 %\n11 %\nScrooge - I hate buying holiday gifts - it's too stressful and too expensive\n9 %\n6 %\n12 %\n10 %\nNon-conformist - I simply don't participate in the holiday gift-giving\n8 %\n5 %\n8 %\n11 %\nAbout the 2017 CIBC Holiday Spending Poll:\nFrom November 27th to November 28th 2017 an online survey was conducted among 1,512 randomly selected Canadian adults who are Angus Reid Forum panellists. The margin of error\u2014which measures sampling variability\u2014is +/- 2.5%, 19 times out of 20. The results have been statistically weighted according to education, age, gender and region (and in Quebec , language) Census data to ensure a sample representative of the entire adult population of Canada . Discrepancies in or between totals are due to rounding.\nAbout CIBC\nCIBC is a leading Canadian-based global financial institution with 11 million personal banking, business, public sector and institutional clients.
