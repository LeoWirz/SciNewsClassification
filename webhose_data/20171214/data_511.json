His character is one of the most nuanced in the franchise.\nA lot of things about Arno's character weren't immediately obvious on my first playthrough of the game: like how he blamed himself for his father's death and how he carried the weight of that guilt with him since childhood; or how his sarcastic humour and brashness was a mask for his vulnerability, or how, unlike most of the other Assassins, all his rage was direct inwardly at himself, instead of outwardly at people whom have wronged him.\nI say Arno is most relatable compared to other Assassins, because I've never desired revenge against people who've wronged me or needed to save a country.

Caldwell, who is active in the community and currently is chairman of the board of directors of the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce, has been with Wacker Wealth Partners for 10 years. In addition to being a lead advisor and partner, Caldwell has been largely responsible for the successful launches of the company\u2019s alternative investment funds. \n\u201cRyan is a gifted leader with great interpersonal and technical skills as well as unfaltering values,\u201d Wacker said. \u201cHe is the right person to execute the firm\u2019s vision for the future, maintain our collaborative and caring fiduciary culture, and make sure that we continue to serve our clients at the highest level for years to come.\u201d \nKrill, who has been with the firm for nearly 20 years and currently is chief operating officer, will continue to be in charge of the firm\u2019s service infrastructure, which includes trading and operational activities, state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art technology, delivery of timely and accurate reports to clients, cyber security, regulatory compliance, and facilitation of the advisory team\u2019s investment and planning advice. \n\u201cBryan has been my steady right hand for two decades,\u201d Wacker said. \u201cHe has made it possible for us to assist more and more clients without compromising service quality,\u201d Wacker said. \u201cOur clients should continue to sleep well knowing that Bryan is making sure we do all the right things in the right way.\u201d \nAfter 19 years in the same offices downtown, the company\u2019s move to its new quarters at the corner of Broad and Aerovista will provide 60% more space with multiple conference rooms for client meetings and seminars. \nWacker Wealth Partners was founded by Bob Wacker in 1988 as R.E. Wacker Associates, one of the nation\u2019s first firms providing strictly fee\u2010only financial advising. Today, Wacker Wealth Partners is owned by eight equity partners and has 16 employees, eight of whom are Certified Financial Planners working together to deliver fee\u2010only investment management and financial planning to individuals, families, businesses and non\u2010profit organizations.

Former Russian Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev waits for a hearing at a court in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017. Ulyukayev who is on trial for allegedly taking a $2 million bribe is expected to deliver... \nBy NATALIYA VASILYEVAAssociated Press \nMOSCOW (AP) - Wrapping up one of Russia's most high-profile trials of the year, a former economic development minister charged with bribery on Thursday accused an oil executive of setting him up and apologized for \"turning back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nAlexei Ulyukayev, the highest-ranking Russian official to be arrested since 1993, was detained last year at the headquarters of Russia's largest oil producer, the state-owned Rosneft, after a sting operation by Russia's main intelligence agency. Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared - what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" \nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised.

Slager, who fatally shot a black motorist in 2015, could learn his fate as soon as Wednesday afternoon, Dec. 6, 2017, as his federal sentencing hearing winds down on its third day. (Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via AP, Pool, File) The Associated Press \nBy MEG KINNARD, Associated Press \nCHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) \u2014 For three days, attorneys representing the federal government and a former South Carolina officer charged in an unarmed black motorist's shooting death have presented technical testimony to a judge to consider how much time Michael Slager should spend in federal prison. \nThat includes use of Slager's stun gun, which the former officer says Walter Scott grabbed and turned on him, causing Slager, who is white, to fear for his life and shoot in self-defense, firing five times into his back as he ran away. \nOn Thursday, attorneys are expected to call friends and relatives of both men who will tell the judge the effect Scott's death and the officer's arrest have had on their lives. What's known as victim impact testimony is intended to help the judge determining the defendant's sentence weigh the personal implications a crime has had. \nA preview of that testimony came Wednesday, when Scott's youngest son spoke to the court so he could return to his high school classes. Clutching a photograph of his father, Miles Scott said he has had trouble sleeping ever since his father's death. He said he misses watching football games with his dad and can't fathom not being able to watch with him the game they both loved. \n\"I miss my father every day,\" Miles Scott said through tears. \"I would like you to sentence the defendant to the strongest sentence the laws allows because he murdered my one and only father.\" \nSlager, 36, pleaded guilty in May to violating Walter Scott's civil rights. Federal officials have recommended 10 to nearly 13 years in prison, but his attorneys argue Slager should face far less time. \nSlager pulled Scott over for a broken brake light in April 2015, and Scott, 50, ran during the stop. After deploying his stun gun, Slager fired eight bullets at Scott as he ran away, hitting him five times in the back. \nBefore he hands down Slager's sentence, U.S. District Judge David Norton must decide whether the April 2015 shooting was second-degree murder or manslaughter. Slager faced murder charges in state court, but a jury in that case deadlocked last year and the state charges were dropped as part of his federal plea deal. \nSlager has said the two men scuffled and he fired in self-defense after Scott grabbed his stun gun. In his closing argument, defense attorney Andy Savage acknowledged the shooting was criminal but reiterated the stance that his client was protecting himself and feared for his own safety. \nDuring closing arguments, prosecutor Jared Fishman disputed that story. \n\"Walter Scott never assaulted the defendant. Walter Scott never took the defendant's Taser,\" Fishman said. \nThe attorney portrayed Slager as a calm, calculated officer who hadn't killed Scott in a moment of passion but did so intentionally \u2014 a hallmark of murder, not manslaughter. \n\"He was not in a frenzy,\" Fishman said. \"He was not in the throes of passion.\" \nFishman also said Slager had changed his story several times as to what he remembered about the shooting, including flawed state trial testimony about Scott charging him with his own stun gun. Fishman said those statements aren't backed up by evidence. \n\"This is not memory loss,\" Fishman said. \"This is a concerted, deliberate effort to obstruct justice and to cover up for his unjustified shooting.\" \nIn an unusual move, attorneys for Slager called the state prosecutor to the stand to question her about their assertions that she and federal prosecutors unfairly teamed up on Slager. \nSolicitor Scarlett Wilson said she had interacted with federal prosecutors but couldn't recall specific contacts and hadn't planned prosecutorial decisions with them. \nAlso Wednesday, Scott's mother, Judy Scott, said she was on the phone with her son when he was pulled over and told him to comply with the officer's demands \"so there wouldn't be any trouble.\" \n___ \nKinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

If you are an enthusiast, however, may wish you had a way to organize titles and find new ones based on your preferences. Coollector Movie Database is a tool well-suited for this job, as it allows you to categorize the discs you own, create wishlists and search for movies that match certain criteria. It comes equipped with an extensive database that is updated frequently, so that you do not have to add each title manually.

When searching through such an extensive database, finding the ones we are interested in is not a simple task. This is something Coollector Movie Database can help you with, as the movie recommendations it offers are based on how much you've liked or disliked other titles you have watched in the past. The application also provides a broad range of filters, making it possible to narrow down the results until you are left with titles that match your preferences. Useful app for keeping a detailed inventory of the movies you own You can use this utility to catalog your entire DVD and Blu-ray collection while also including video files on your Mac. These are scanned automatically and imported to the database. With the help of this app, you will always know which discs you own, where they are located and whether they have been loaned to other people. Powerful application that offers single and dual-panel modes Normally, the panel that contains the movie list and the one that provides detailed movie info are displayed at the same time, but you can choose to stretch them across the entire screen and switch between them using your Mac's arrow keys. However, Coollector Movie Database does feature a rather cluttered and outdated interface, which some users might find difficult to navigate. Overall, this is a useful OS X application, designed with movie lovers in mind, that can help you organize the discs you own and find new movies to watch, based on your previous ratings.

Security Council the number of all African peacekeepers in Somalia will be reduced by 1,000 before the end of 2017. \nUganda has over 6,000 troops deployed in Somalia as part of the multi-national African Union force. Other African countries such as Burundi and Kenya also contribute to the regional force. \nThe Western-backed deployments have helped to push Islamic extremists out of Somalia's capital and other centers, even though the rebels still make frequent bombing attacks targeting public places.

REUTERS/Osman Orsal Reuters \nANKARA (Reuters) - The jailed leader of Turkey's pro-Kurdish opposition went on trial on Thursday, 13 months after his arrest on terrorism-related charges, facing up to 142 years in prison in a case closely watched by rights groups and Western governments. \nSelahattin Demirtas, the co-leader of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), was not allowed to appear in court for security reasons and refused to take part via video link. A state prosecutor demanded he remain in jail for trial. \nA charismatic former human rights lawyer who was once dubbed the \"Kurdish Obama\" by some in the international, Demirtas was arrested on Nov. 4 last year, one of more than a dozen HDP lawmakers who were arrested in a crackdown following last year's attempted coup. \nA crowd of several hundred gathered to show support for Demirtas in snowy weather outside the court near the capital Ankara. They joined hands and danced around small fires, singing songs in Kurdish. \"Demirtas is our honor,\" they chanted. \nDemirtas and other detained HDP members are mostly accused of links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, which has conducted a decades-old insurgency in which 40,000 people have been killed and which is deemed a terrorist group by the United States, Turkey and Europe. All deny the charges. \nThe HDP is the third-largest party in Turkey's parliament. \nSome 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended and roughly 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial since the failed coup. Rights groups and some Western allies say Erdogan has used the putsch as a pretext to quash dissent. The HDP says as many as 5,000 of its members have been detained. \nErdogan says such measures were necessary given the danger represented by the putsch in which 250 people were killed. \n(Reporting by Ece Toksabay; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by David Dolan) \nCopyright 2017 Thomson Reuters .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daren butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "demirtas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david dolan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "selahattin demirtas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pkk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hdp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orsal reuters  ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdistan workers party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pro-kurdish peoples' democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ece toksabay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peoples' democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:12.043+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b67bc78c068c2470e4c16800f4aae6c095885046", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFe4ivcScYmQYY_VmBUu73Z8Y_76nWNUQDgzJcduP.SKJNkcf0YOVqQY8lQWFZz2iG_Wh_zIFD9yrXtR2lsnBUn1gPXtIRDq3nzECd0MtFer0DkCMpU8XHmAyW8GpYOh1ruhInU3no3W_v78QjsmAyS.fGGWa_ukD4k", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/zero-installments/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "0% Installments - Buy 0% Installments at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Lenovo A6600 Plus (5\u201d /Quad-Core/ 2GB RAM)- Black", "title_full": "Lenovo A6600 Plus (5\u201d /Quad-Core/ 2GB RAM)- Black | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-07-04T12:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 25, "participants_count": 23, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.032, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0060c96b76e76269a1d525a353e7e0105b4ab5ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFe4ivcScYmQYY_VmBUu73Z8Y_76nWNUQDgzJcduP.SKJNkcf0YOVqQY8lQWFZz2iG_Wh_zIFD9yrXtR2lsnBUn1gPXtIRDq3nzECd0MtFer0DkCMpU8XHmAyW8GpYOh1ruhInU3no3W_v78QjsmAyS.WJSKg5v1Vvtxen0Fn5nAdQ-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "Lazada Guest", "published": "2017-11-15T02:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "???", "text": "???", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:12.043+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "57ba6e73ea1dceafa2e4291191ef946e7380f42c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKxcltYSq3lRjmEedNjhRMK.oBgjMfZMjjR13htoZiFkpv9VNVAhsHRI55jtrhq2Ea_MamKmS0CBZ_gSO.unWoqljiuOv0CgGkx5PwbkS8v8QB2H7jWMoSHQiQQX8au0NHw--", "site_full": "community.ubnt.com", "site": "ubnt.com", "site_section": "https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi/ct-p/UniFi", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "UniFi - Ubiquiti Networks Community", "title": "Solved: USG WAN Port has no IP-Address in PPPoE mode", "title_full": "Solved: USG WAN Port has no IP-Address in PPPoE mode - Ubiquiti Networks Community", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6846, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "919a9595ea673c16341b07be779e685ec67a8e7f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKxcltYSq3lRjmEedNjhRMK.oBgjMfZMjjR13htoZiFkpv9VNVAhsHRI55jtrhq2Ea_MamKmS0CBZ_gSO.unWoqljiuOv0CgGkx5PwbkS8v8QB2H7jWMoSHRDweCGlGNdm4NYCeN8eqaJ", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "@mhubig", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "@mhubig ,\nWhen using PPPoE the virtual PPPoE interface receives the IP from your ISP.
