This decline in infrastructure investment is attributed to the slowdown in overall private sector investment, though it has partially been offset by the fiscal stimulus measures into infrastructure in recent years.Inthe next five years (2017-22), in order to maintain a similar level of infrastructure investment, it is estimated that spending on infrastructure needs to increase to Rs. 50 lakh crore. This would require the Government to take proactive and expeditious measures to leverage on the private sector finances and to judicially exploit private sector capacity to build and manage infrastructure facilities, in a sustainable manner.\nA mature PPP framework is one of the most useful tools with the Governments to facilitate private investment into infrastructure.PPPs are long term contracts between the Government (sponsoring authority) and a private company that may typically provide for financing, construction, operation, and maintenance under a single firm or a consortium. It is generally advised to adopt a suitable PPP framework in case of large and complex projects that can justify the associated transaction and monitoring costs and thus provide value for money considering the project\u2019s life-cycle cost to the Government.\nThe advent of PPP framework can be dated back to 1980s, when governments in countries like U.K and Chile, post success of privatization in sectors like electricity, telecommunication and sanitation, sought to extend benefits of privatization to sectors deemed exceedingly difficult to privatize, such as transportation, schools, and hospitals under suitable PPP models.\nIn India, the period from mid 1990s to 2004 marked the inception of PPPs, with transport and power being the focus sectors. The country, however experienced limited success due to absence of a mature PPP framework.Subsequently during2004-12, with the government laying foundation for a mature PPP framework, by formulating guidelines and standardization of documents for PPP projects, the country experienced a spurt in award of PPP projects.As per the latest available data from Ministry of Finance, 1,539 PPP projects have been awarded so far in India. Out of these, about 50% are currently in operational stage, while others are either scrapped or are under different stages of implementation. Sector-wise break-up shows that transport sector accounts for 58% of the these projects, followed by energy sector with 24%, while social and commercial infrastructure sector accounts for 9% and water & sanitation for the balance 8%. However with the absence of a robust PPP enabling ecosystem, i.e. \u2018twin balance sheet problem\u2019, paucity of credit from alternative sources, lack of a suitable framework for dispute resolution,and with the dearth of bankable PPP projects, a significant number the projects awarded during 2004-12 period failed to take off and the private sector investments witnessed considerable decline thereon, thereby further miring India\u2019s PPP ambitions.Also, given the federal structure of India, and in the absence of a unified PPP law or policy and a national level PPP institution, the framework of PPP in India remains heterogeneous. Only about 32% of the projects are implemented by the Government or its agencies, while the remaining are implemented by theState governments. This emphasizes on the importance of State level policy and governance framework in overall success of PPP in India. In terms of number of operational PPP projects, States like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Maharashtra are much ahead of others while States like Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh can be considered progressing. Some State governments have even formulated laws and policies and set up the necessary institutional structures for streamlining PPPs.\nSuccess of PPP to a large extent depends on optimal risk allocation among stakeholders, environment of trust among stakeholders, robust institutional capacity to undertake grooming and implementation of PPP projects. Further to foster successful implementation of a PPP project, a robust PPP enabling ecosystem including liquid and diversified financial institutions; sound regulatory and arbitration framework; mature developers and experienced consultants etc. is also essential.\nBuilding on the learnings from the past experience, the Government has in the last three years, undertaken some noteworthy steps to strengthen the PPP framework and the enabling ecosystem in India.This includes formulation of guidelines for new innovative PPP models, with due consideration to the extant risk outlook and investor appetite, like monetization of publically funded highway projects worth ~Rs. 35,600 crore under Toll-Operate-Transfer Model (ToT) and construction and expansion of over 60 highway projects under Hybrid-Annuity-Model (HAM). With implementation of PPP models like HAM & TOT, the Government has optimally taken over the project implementation risk and thereby revived the interest of private players and financial institutions in PPP projects in the road sector to a considerable extent. Further the Government has liberalized the exit policies for concessionaires to free-up equity for re-investment into new projects; approved the policy of railway station development through PPP and is currently in the process of formulating suitable PPP policy for newer sectors and asset classes.\nSome of the other measures include, setting up of National Infrastructure Investment Fund (NIIF) to channelize foreign institutional funds into infrastructure; introduction of PPP component in new metro policy; amendment in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to make dispute resolution more cost effective and time-bound; Rs.2.11 lakh crore plan to recapitalize public-sector banks aimed at reviving bank-lending; and introduction of ease of doing business (EODB) state-level ranking, to help the Government to push through reforms in sectors that are primarily State subject.\nAs a result of these measures and more, the implementation of languishing and newer projects has been considerably put back on track.In a recent study by the rating agency ICRA, it has been highlighted that infrastructure companies, especially the ones with exposure to the airport and the highways sectors, have started witnessing an improvement in their operational and financial performance. Further, India has also managed to perform significantly well with its EODB World Bank ranking rising to 100 (out of 190 nations)from 130 a year earlier, and with India\u2019s sovereign Moody\u2019s credit rating getting upgraded to Baa2 with \u2018Stable Outlook\u2019 from Baa3 Positive.\nA lot has been done, but a lot more still needs to be done. Going forward, the Government needs to undertake more concerted efforts to revive the credibility of PPP framework and build capacity within various public institutions for PPP implementation. These may include implementation of some of the key recommendations of the Kelkar Committee Report including setting-up of national level PPP institution, a dedicated PPP tribunal, and a formal framework for post award contract renegotiation.Undertaking these measures shall send strong signal to the market about the commitment level of the nation to overall PPP framework. Further it is imperative for the Government to push PPP pilot projects in newer sectors, along with formulation of newer or revision of existing Model Concession Agreements (MCAs), to ensure replicability.\nA mature PPP framework, along with a robust enabling ecosystem shall enable the Government to accomplish, to a considerable extent, what our Prime Minister, Shri. Narendra Modi has said \u201cThe Government has no business to do business\u201d and thereby promote private sector investments and participation towards the nation building.\n(Aman Hans is Public Private Partnership Specialist in NITI Aayog)\nDisclaimer: NITI blogs do not represent the views of either the Government of India or NITI Aayog.

I don't really like the look of a flat section there, a curve gives it a nice touch. I have arched sanding blocks to rough out the shape of the neck heal. Basically it's the opposite or congruent curve used for the head block itself.\nOne thing I do strive to do, in light of the flat saddle slot argument, is make it so that the face of the heal is fully flush to the ribs at the headblock. I use a bolt on butt joint and like to think of it more as a traditional Spanish heal only bolted together. Most builders will rout out the middle area of the heal face leaving the cheek edges proud for only about 2mm along the edge to make flush contact with the sides. I am also armchair hypothesizing on that too but I like to make it a flush contact and it's not that hard to do by just flossing the heal after roughing it out.\nOn most of my guitars too I build the lower bout flat. When I do put a slight arch in the top I just glue the bridge on flat too.\nIt always seemed to me that the arch top bridge design was wasting energy some how. It is what it is though.

Flat front to back makes referencing everything a lot easier, but once you get your eye in, so to speak, a very slight convexity in the sides front to back will give an almost perfect fit on a \"dished V\" (AKA standard, heel shape) with straight, slightly undercut shoulders, even before you start flossing.

Here's my situation:\nBasic facts:\nI live in SoCal, but am looking to buy a house in a slightly more affordable area than the city of Los Angeles. I have $150,000K to put down. I make $225,000/yr. My only debt is $14,000 left on my car, at $400/mo. My credit score is 749. My record should overall be good. I'm looking to live in the house for around 5-7 years. No guarantee past that. Having surveyed Zillow and open houses on the market for several months, my ideal home in the surrounding area would cost between $650,000 and $750,000. I cannot go higher than 750, that would be tough to swallow. $650,000 would be ideal given the houses I'm interested in.\nSome other things to consider:\nI really want to own a home (with keys in hand) by no later than April 1st, 2018. Save a long story short, this is based on a lot of professional/personal calendar reasons. I have absolutely no experience with home buying and have never bought a home before. I can't afford (time-wise) for some bank to spend 2-3 months in the underwriting process, and I really don't have the time in my day to be 100% on top of them harassing them every step of the way, or whatever other burdens there would be to seeing this through. My #1 goals are:\nSpend as little money as possible.. Spend as little time and headache as possible. That's probably unrealistic, but given my particulars, what would guys recommend?\nI have Chase bank account, but I've heard horror stories about them. If the overwhelming advice is to find a bank and use them, I have no idea what I'm in for. I do like the idea of having a broker working on my behalf and hand-holding me through this process, but... is that worth it?\n submitted by /u/RelocationWoes\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:27.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe5e5f3f60f5ae2360cc5d6fc6f858fa8792c58a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg861fPXF59xzvoUj0bjFQNKDBfNH59ypHttshyyVA0ipKAUfym8kwLuAKFpboNNJ3pO.n4c_9eOlUfoT4UtSoo_qGa.EVPMtPWDJ4KmXxb0ZA--", "site_full": "www.michiganradio.org", "site": "michiganradio.org", "site_section": "http://www.michiganradio.org/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Michigan Radio", "title": "Who might run to replace Rep.

Rick: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any political experience,\u201d said Pluta. \u201cHe has a social media history that might be a little problematic.\u201d \nA number of years back, Conyers III was on a number of occasions caught driving a Cadillac Escalade that belonged to the congressional office of the 14th District (which Conyers had been representing at the time). He had also posted on social media images of himself drinking alcohol while driving (he was underage at the time). He has also posted on Twitter conspiracy theories about the U.S. government\u2019s involvement in the September 11th attacks. \u201cWhen the opposition research experts of the other campaigns really dig into it, just imagine what might be out there,\u201d said Gorchow. \nOn Ian Conyers \nIan Conyers, John Conyers\u2019s grand-nephew, has also signaled his intent to run for the seat. Conyers would bring \u201ca modicum of political experience,\u201d said Pluta. \u201cHe\u2019s a state senator and he\u2019s holding his first political office.\u201d \nStill, Democrats in the state senate hold a super-minority, so Conyers hasn\u2019t had much of an opportunity to make much of an impact. \u201cSo, there really hasn\u2019t been much of any opportunity to see what he can do in a legislative setting so far,\u201d said Gorchow. \nOn other potential candidates \n\u201cI don\u2019t think this will happen, but you could conceivably have all five members of the Michigan Senate who represent Detroit in the race,\u201d said Gorchow.

Coleman says he quickly established himself as a champion of civil rights and other issues of racial and social justice, and a challenger to abuses of presidential power. \nBut Conyers was also dogged by a sense that he\u2019d \u201cstayed too long\u201d in Congress as early as the 1990s, Coleman said. And the multiple allegations of sexual harassment that preceded his sudden resignation this week \u201cwill be included in his biography.\u201d \n\u201cSo it\u2019s a complicated history, but I think no question, on balance John Conyers will leave a strong legacy for the people he served, his constituents,\u201d Coleman said. \nColeman predicts there will likely be a number of \u201cbig name\u201d challengers vying to replace Conyers in Michigan\u2019s 13th Congressional District. Gov. Snyder will need to call a special election to fill the now-vacant seat. \nThe 13th district is still a majority African-American district. But it\u2019s no longer a majority Detroit district, and now encompasses wide swaths of western Wayne County. State Sen. Ian Conyers \nColeman says that could make for a crowded and unpredictable race. \u201cIt will be interesting to see whether or not someone surfaces from Detroit that enough people can get behind to offset the other challengers from Detroit,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I suspect there will be challengers from western Wayne as well.\u201d \nConyers made his pick to succeed him known when he announced his retirement this week on Detroit\u2019s Mildred Gaddis Show. \nConyers said he had faith his legacy would be carried on by his two children, \u201cespecially my oldest boy, John Conyers III, who incidentally I endorse to replace me in my seat in Congress.\u201d \nConyers III, 27, is a self-described \u201cmulti-discipline consultant \u2026 committed to melding community engagement, entertainment and politics.\u201d \nConyers\u2019 great-nephew, Detroit State Sen. Ian Conyers, 29, also told The New York Times he intends to run for that seat.

Therefore, regardless of whether the size of the business it is crucial to have a source of money to ensure the business is stable financially. A lot of banks do not give loans unless one has a guarantee. This is to ensure that you do not fail to repay the money. In addition, your assets are included as security and are taken upon failure to repay the money. It is, therefore, more advantageous to obtain a no personal guarantee business loans Utah .\n\nYou will have no property to give the funder as a security if the business has just been established. This means that a loan that will ask for the assets cannot work for you. It is a good idea to seek loans that will no demand for assets. This protects what you own and there are more other advantages.\n\nOne of the benefits of is that you will not lose your property. As much as you are trying to make your enterprise to flourish, it might not be a good idea to use assets for securing the loan. Remember that business that has just been established face a lot of problems and it is likely that paying the creditors will not as smooth as many people think. When your assets are not used in any way you can be sure that they always are yours and no one will claim their ownership.\n\nThe reason why creditors derail your business is that they take longer to determine how to solve your financial crisis. Eventually, the banks send representatives to evaluate the value of your assets and determine their worth. As a matter of fact, this tends to take a toll on the progress of the business waiting for the determining of the assets.\n\nAlternatively, there will be no need to do any form of assessment of the assets if they are not linked in any way to the loan. This makes things much easier for the person seeking financial support. The process is shorter and time taken to obtain the loan is faster. The creditors will avail the money soon and it can be used to improve the business.\n\nAnother advantage is that the value of the property is maintained. In most cases when the property 9is being evaluated, it will be given a value that is less than what is worth. This means the loss on your part. When your creditor does not require any of your property, you can be sure that all the value is maintained.\n\nAs with other methods of financing, there are certain qualifications that should be met for one to be credible for a loan. Even in the case where the creditor does not ask for your assets, they may require another kind of collateral before giving you the loan. It is important for you to carry out your research beforehand.\n\nPatience is a very important virtual for business people. Running a successful enterprise and obtaining money. Some of the processes might be tiresome and only a patient people can succeed. At times the financer might reject your requests more so if there are faults in the application process. You should be willing to rectify all the mistakes.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nCheck out eaglecapital.org for details about the benefits of taking out no personal guarantee business loans Utah firms offer, today.

Longtime Michigan Congressman Sander Levin to retire By Vincent Duffy & Associated Press \u2022 Dec 2, 2017 \nDetroit-area Rep. Sander Levin says he won't run for an 19th term in Congress next year and will teach at the University of Michigan. \nThe 86-year-old Democrat confirmed today he will retire after 36 years in Washington. Levin has served on the House Ways and Means Committee for almost three decades. The powerful panel sets tax and trade laws. \nLevin, known as Sandy, says he's grateful to have served residents all over the Detroit area, especially with districts being redrawn every decade. He says he'll continue \"sharing the values\" that he learned from his family.

Google collaborated with MediaTek to ensure that Android Oreo (Go edition) works well on its line of processors, enabling a faster time-to-market mechanism for device manufacturers, and ensuring a quality Android smartphone experience that is both secure and affordable for devices with 512MB to 1GB of memory. This marks one of the first times that entry-level SoCs are ready to be used shortly after the latest version of Android, in this case Android 8.1 Oreo, has been released to the Android Open Source Project. \nWith Android Oreo (Go edition), Google has optimized its OS platform, first party apps and the Google Play\u2122 Store to improve the capabilities of entry level devices. Limited processing power and storage are top pain points for entry-level device users. Android Oreo (Go edition) was created to not only address these issues, but to also ensure that the devices are secure and that users have more control over data usage. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages the existing Google Play Store ecosystem to deliver apps that run smoothly on low memory devices. This improves the overall user experience with, and support for, devices that have 512MB to 1GB of memory, which results in significant bill of materials (BOM) cost savings. These savings enable device makers to provide the 400 million users who buy entry-level smartphones every year, a better option. \n\u201cEntry-level devices are the gateway to the internet for many people, and we want to make sure everyone has a great experience when they use these devices,\u201d said Sameer Samat, VP of Product Management, Android & Google Play. \u201cWe\u2019re excited that Android Oreo (Go edition) will significantly improve storage, performance, data management, and security.\u201d \n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement builds upon our existing work with Google, including our recent collaboration on Google\u2019s GMS Express to speed up the certification process,\u201d said TL Lee, General Manager of MediaTek\u2019s Wireless Communication business unit. \u201cWith Android Oreo (Go edition), we are partnering with Google to tackle the performance challenges of lower memory phones, improving the user experience of entry level smartphones for consumers in key markets across India, the Middle East & Africa, Latin America and South East Asia.\u201d \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages MediaTek\u2019s acclaimed turnkey references and chipsets that are designed specifically to reduce product development time and compliance testing. A wide range of MediaTek SoC\u2019s supports Android Oreo (Go edition), including the MT6739 and MT6737 for 4G devices, as well as the MT6580 for 3G devices. This gives device makers the range of capabilities they need to develop devices for specific price points and markets. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) smartphones powered by MediaTek will be available in world-wide market by Q1, 2018. \nFor more information about the program, please explore: https://www.android.com/ \n*Google, Android, and Google Play are trademarks of Google LLC. \nAbout MediaTek Inc.

First time thread starter here. 33 year old living in Chicago, working full time making around 50k. Looking for some advice on where to put 12k I have in savings now. I have 60k in VTSAX(stocks only), 5k in silver bars, 16k in employer roth 401k, and 12k sitting in savings looking for something better to do. I'm pondering opening a vanguard bond fund to lessen risk a bit. Also pondering putting 5500 into a new roth RIA, or traditional? I'm not interested in adding much to VTSAX due to an inflated market. My general strategy is to focus on VTSAX as a long term retirement fund, but maybe putting more money into tax advantaged account(s) is wise. I appreciate any ideas given my situation.

Technological advances in artificial intelligence are fuelling a new race between hackers and those toiling to protect cybersecurity networks.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson \nMONTREAL \u2013 Technological advances in artificial intelligence are fuelling a new race between hackers and those toiling to protect cybersecurity networks. \nCybersecurity is always a race between offence and defence but new tools are giving companies that employ them a leg up on those trying to steal their data. \nWhereas past responses to cybercrimes often looked for known hacking methods long after they occurred, AI techniques using machine learning scan huge volumes of data to detect patterns of abnormal behaviour that are imperceptible to humans. \nExperts expect machines will become so sophisticated that they\u2019ll develop answers to questions that humans won\u2019t clearly understand. \nDavid Decary-Hetu, assistant professor of criminology at the University of Montreal, says defenders have an edge right now in using artificial intelligence. \n\u201cBut who knows what\u2019s going to happen in a few years from now,\u201d he said in an interview. \n\u201cThe main issue is that if you\u2019re defending a system you have to be good 100 per cent of the time, but when you\u2019re attacking the system you only have to be successful once to get in.\u201d \nDecary-Hetu said a growing list of corporate and government officials, including Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz, who say infiltrations are their top worry have a very good reason to fear. \nThe Bank of Canada warned in its semi-annual review released this month that the high degree of interconnectedness among Canadian financial institutions means any successful cyberattack could spread widely throughout the financial system. \nReports suggest cybercrime costs the Canadian economy between $3 billion and $5 billion a year, including ransom paid to foreign criminals. \nHacks of Sony Pictures, Uber, Ashley Madison, Yahoo and multinational retailers have sparked unsettling headlines about security of personal information. \nOne of the latest to face scrutiny is global credit-reporting firm Equifax. Hackers accessed the personal information, including names, social insurance and credit card numbers, as well as usernames, passwords and secret question/secret answer data of 19,000 Canadians and 145.5 million Americans. \nCurrent detection systems tend to only recognize improper activity based on past events, often long after the damage is done. \nAn example of this is Equifax, which discovered the breach in July, months after hackers first infiltrated the system. It only notified the public in early September. \nNiranjan Mayya, founder and CEO of Toronto-based Rank Software, said it takes on average 143 days for a breach to be detected. \nThe challenge is growing as the number of connected devices in the world continues to soar. \n\u201cClearly the old style techniques of looking at cybersecurity threats and having people go through each threat aren\u2019t working anymore, so automated means of detecting threats has become more and more important,\u201d he said. \nDavid Masson, Canadian manager for U.K.-based Darktrace, said artificial intelligence will help to keep up with threats by quickly identifying and stopping attacks by picking up on subtle markers that identify bad behaviour. \nHe said his company\u2019s systems map a customer\u2019s entire network, including every user and device, to discern even the slightest deviations as they emerge. \nMasson said AI is needed to keep up with threats by automating defence responses to growing machine-on-machine attacks launched by sophisticated hackers. \n\u201cYou\u2019re kind of looking at a cyber arms race,\u201d he said in an interview. \n\u201cIf you want to keep up with this threat and put the advantage back in the hands of the defenders you\u2019re gonna have to use AI.\u201d \nOntario-based utilities company Energy+ Inc. said installed Darktrace technology alerted it to a user going to a malware site in Russia and uploading undisclosed sensitive data to a third-party cloud provider that its existing security was unable to catch. \nSome observers temper the current exuberance about AI, saying it\u2019s not a silver bullet and these are nascent days for the technology. \nReceptiviti CEO Jonathan Kreindler says the hype around artificial intelligence has accelerated and has almost become a branding exercise for some companies that aren\u2019t even offering truly leading edge technology. \n\u201cThe term AI is now being applied to any sort of algorithmic reasoning unfortunately,\u201d said Kreindler. \nHis firm uses AI to scour writings for unconscious use of language to understand the psychological state of company insiders who are responsible for 80 per cent of cybersecurity issues. \nCanada\u2019s largest IT company, CGI Group, said artificial intelligence is a growing field of interest for customers, although the average client is in the fairly early stages of considering AI adoption in cybersecurity. \nCGI cybersecurity expert Andrew Rogoyski said that still puts them one step ahead of most hackers, who are typically interested in stealing data using the cheapest tools possible. \nRogoyski added that he expects a strengthening of defensive mechanisms might force hackers to also adopt innovative techniques such as AI. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a race, it\u2019s been going on for 20 years plus and the race just keeps evolving. We keep leapfrogging each other,\u201d he said. Join the conversation Sign in to comment (not connected to your Insider Club login). You're logged in as Loading profile... Unexpected error.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Toronto Police Service MANDATORY CREDIT \nTORONTO \u2013 The judge at the trial of two men accused of killing a young Toronto woman five years ago and then burning her body is to begin his legal instructions to the jury today. \nDellen Millard and Mark Smich have pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the presumed death of 23-year-old Laura Babcock. Babcock\u2019s body has not been found. \nIn its closing address on Wednesday the Crown said a \u201cmountain\u201d of circumstantial evidence points to Millard and Smich killing Babcock at Millard\u2019s home some time after 8 p.m. on July 3, 2012 and then disposing of her body at Millard\u2019s farm near Waterloo, Ont. \nThe prosecution alleges Babcock was killed after becoming the odd woman out in a love triangle with Millard and his girlfriend. \nSmich\u2019s lawyer told the jury on Wednesday that his client had no motive to kill Babcock because he was never part of a love triangle and all the Crown has is a rap song in which Smich says he killed a girl and burned her body. \nMillard, who represented himself, told the jury in his closing address Tuesday that several witnesses testified to having seen or heard from Babcock after July 4, 2012.

Trump, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker pose during a group photo for the G7 summit in the Ancient Theatre of Taormina ( 3rd century BC) in the Sicilian citadel of Taormina, Italy. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Andrew Medichini \nOTTAWA \u2013 The Liberal government wants to lift the mystery surrounding the G7 summit as it prepares to host the gathering next year, in hopes that Canadians will feel more included and, perhaps, less inclined to protest on the periphery. \n\u201cThe idea is to get input from Canadians,\u201d Peter Boehm, the Canadian G7 summit sherpa, said in an interview with The Canadian Press. \n\u201cWhat are they thinking about some of the big themes in the world, whether it\u2019s economic inclusion, what the jobs of the future might look like, climate change, energy and, indeed, some of the big foreign policy and security questions that might be out there?\u201d said Boehm. \nThe efforts to open the process up to Canadians includes Boehm speaking at a public event Thursday night, organized by the Toronto branch of the Canadian International Council and the G7 Research Group at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto. \n\u201cA lot of this is listening and then feeding it through, but also a chance for us to demystify what the G7 is,\u201d said Boehm, who is preparing for Canada to assume the G7 presidency in January, six months before it hosts the summit at a resort in La Malbaie, Que. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a big gathering where you see a lot of people and even more security.\u201d \nHeavy \u2014 and armed \u2014 security presence is a common sight on the edges of G7 summits, where the need to protect the leaders of powerful countries takes on added urgency due to crowds gathered for demonstrations, which have sometimes turned into violent clashes with police. \nThe turbulent Toronto G20 summit in 2010, which included mass arrests and cases of police misconduct, reverberated for years. \nBoehm suggested involving Canadians along the road to the G7 summit is one way to get ahead of the issue. \n\u201cWe all have the right to express our views and we fully expect that there will be people who will be expressing their views,\u201d said Boehm. \u201cMy own view is that it is best to do that from an informed perspective, so that\u2019s part of the reason for the outreach.\u201d \nStill, Boehm said the summit organizers will nonetheless be prepared for protests. \n\u201cIn the past at large gatherings there has also been infiltration by less desirable elements who do not want to express views nor hear views, but they want to create mayhem,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, on the security side, we will certainly be ready for that.\u201d \n\u2014 Follow @smithjoanna

getting a picture of two very different Larry Nassars. \nThere\u2019s the man his siblings and friends describe in their letters: a \u201cgentle hearted,\u201d \u201cdevout Catholic\u201d who put all his energies into healing athletes and advocating for his autistic daughter. They describe the kind of guy who\u2019d \u201crun across the street barefoot in the winter to come to the aid of a neighbor\u201d having a heart attack, and spent the last year in jail talking daily to his brother in law, writing a book, and helping inmates getting their GEDs. Larry Nassar in court in recent months with his attorneys, Shannon Smith and Matthew Newburg. Nassar is facing federal sentencing on Thursday, December 7th. Credit Kate Wells / Michigan Radio \n\u201cYour Honor, I would like the court to know that I love Larry Nassar very much,\u201d his brother in law wrote. \u201cI will always support him through these trials and tribulations.\u201d \nThen there\u2019s the Larry Nassar described by federal prosecutors: a man with a \u201clong history of hands-on sexual assault against children,\u201d who possessed some 37,000 images of child porn, including images depicting \u201cchildren as young as infants.\u201d \nNassar should get the maximum 60 years in prison, writes Assistant U.S. Attorney Sean Lewis in a presentencing memo to Judge Neff, because of the \u201cscope and duration of [his] sexual assaults against children and vulnerable patients, and the magnitude of harms he inflicted on his victims.\u201d \nNassar recently pleaded guilty in Eaton and Ingham Counties to multiple first degree charges of criminal sexual misconduct, admitting to the court that he digitally penetrated patients under the guise of treatment. \n\u201cLarry Nassar is a predator without boundaries \u2026 If he is ever allowed to reenter society he will not hesitate to reoffend,\u201d one victim writes in the prosecution\u2019s presentencing memo. \u201cI implore you to do your part to exercise your power to the fullest extent. Show all the predators watching that we as a judicial system and community will no longer tolerate this behavior.\u201d \nUpdate: December 6th, 2017 at 3:45 pm \nFederal Judge Janet Neff says while she won't allow victims to make impact statements during Thursday's hearings, she does consider their stories - and Nassar's history of sexually abusing minors - to be relevant here. \nSurvivors will have an opportunity to make statements in \u201cmultiple state criminal cases and multiple civil lawsuits,\u201d Neff says in an order issued November 30th. \u201cTheir voices will, and properly should, echo through the halls of justice for years to come,\u201d Neff writes. Instead, Neff says, she believes this sentencing hearing needs to focus on the federal child pornography crimes, and the victims of that child pornography don\u2019t have a voice. Some of the women who wished to make a statment during the hearing, including former Olympian McKayla Maroney, will attend still attend court on Thursday and give a press conference afterwards. Maroney's attorneys released her victim impact statement Wednesday, which reads, in part: \"Dr Nassar...is, was, and forever shall be, a child molester, and a monster of a human being. End of story! He abused my trust, he abused my body and he left scars on my psyche that may never go away. It all started when I was 13 or 14 years old, at one of my first National Team training camps, in Texas, and it didn\u2019t end until I left the sport. It seemed whenever and wherever this man could find the chance, I was \u201ctreated.\u201d It happened in London before my team and I won the gold medal, and It happened before I won my Silver Medal. For me, the scariest night of my life happened when I was 15 years old. I had flown all day and night with the team to get to Tokyo. He\u2019d given me a sleeping pill for the flight, and the next thing I know, I was all alone with him in his hotel room getting a \u201ctreatment.\u201d I thought I was going to die that night.\" \nThis comes as mediation ended today in a lawsuit filed by more than 100 women abused by Nassar, against Michigan State University, USA Gymnastics, and others they say should have protected them from abuse. \n\u201cMSU entered mediation in good faith, but as a public institution, it must be a responsible steward of its resources,\" says MSU spokesman Jason Cody. \"As we remain in civil litigation on the Nassar case, it is not appropriate or fair for MSU to comment in detail out of respect for the process and everyone involved.\u201d \n\"I do think that it's important to understand that this mediation was voluntary - I see the media is describing it as a failure, and so on,\" says civil attorney James White. \"But it was voluntary, and for that reason, I don't think the community should think that there will not be another to come to some settlement without a jury trial. But at this point, we are preparing to put this matter in front of a jury.\" \nWhite says the next step is for both sides to meet with a judge and lay out a schedule for upcoming legal proceedings, including the discovery process, when attorneys are able to interview witnesses. \nCorrection: a previous version of this article incorrectly stated Judge Janet Neff would allow 6 women and girls to make a victim impact statement during the sentencing hearing. While Judge Neff says she will \"fully take the conduct suffered by these victims into account in sentencing,\" she is not allowing them to make in-person statements. The prosecution has filed summaries of these assaults with Judge Neff when they requested to speak at the sentencing, which she says she will take into account.

The Conservative leader and byelection candidate weren't shopping just to soothe a sugar craving. They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they're pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck \nSURREY, B.C. \u2013 Inside a colourful candy shop in a bustling Vancouver suburb, Andrew Scheer and Kerry-Lynne Findlay marvelled at delicate British chocolate bars, chewy Red Vines and an edible Monopoly board. \nThe Conservative leader and byelection candidate weren\u2019t shopping just to soothe a sugar craving. They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they\u2019re pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. \n\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I\u2019m paying a lot higher taxes than I was before. I\u2019m being called a tax cheat because I\u2019m an entrepreneur with a small business,\u2019\u201d said Findlay, 62, a former national revenue minister. \nThe riding is one of four across Canada where a byelection will be held Monday, but it\u2019s anticipated to be the closest race. Conservative Dianne Watts won by just 1,400 votes over the Liberal candidate in 2015, while the NDP placed a distant third. \nThe vote arrives midway through Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s term and it\u2019s expected to test his popularity, as well as the potential of rookie leader Scheer, ahead of the 2019 election. Both men have visited the riding twice and both have suggested the outcome will indicate whether the Liberal surge of 2015 is continuing or waning. \n\u201cTwo years ago, in the election, Canadians didn\u2019t randomly or suddenly change who we are,\u201d Trudeau said at a recent rally to support Liberal candidate Gordie Hogg, 71. \n\u201cWe have always been progressive, forward-thinking, open, compassionate, ambitious people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just about getting a government that recognizes that.\u201d \nSouth Surrey-White Rock has older, wealthier and whiter demographics than other ridings in Surrey, which is the fastest-growing city in Metro Vancouver. It\u2019s home to a picturesque waterfront and an array of restaurants, shops and other small businesses. \nIn July, Trudeau\u2019s government announced plans to close loopholes that it said have allowed high-earning business owners to avoid higher taxes. The measures included changes to \u201cincome sprinkling,\u201d which allows owners to split income among family members. \nAfter a backlash, the government said it would cut the small business tax rate from 10.5 per cent to nine per cent by 2019. \nHogg said he and Trudeau are committed to cutting taxes for small businesses, while the Conservatives voted against a tax cut in 2015 for \u201cmiddle-class\u201d Canadians earning between about $45,000 and $90,000 a year. \n\u201cTo me, their record is more important than their rhetoric,\u201d said Hogg. \u201cThis byelection is about electing the strongest positive voice for our community, and only Justin Trudeau and I have a positive plan to strengthen our middle class and offer real help for families.\u201d \nThe seat became vacant after Watts resigned to run for leader of the B.C. Liberal Party, an informal coalition of federal Conservatives and Liberals. \nByelections will also be held in Battlefords-Lloydminster in Saskatchewan, previously held by the Conservatives; Bonavista-Burin-Trinity in Newfoundland, a Liberal seat; and Scarborough-Agincourt in Ontario, also won by the Liberals in the last election. \nIn South Surrey-White Rock, Hogg has name recognition and deep roots. He was White Rock mayor for 10 years before being elected to the B.C. legislature for two decades. Findlay, meantime, represented Delta-Richmond East in Parliament from 2011 to 2015. \nAsked about her connection to the riding, Findlay said her parents lived in the community and she has also lived there at various points, including after she was widowed at 34 and was raising her children alone. She said she moved to White Rock this summer. \nThe NDP candidate is Jonathan Silveira, 40, a real estate agent and founder of advocacy group Surrey Kids Matter. He said the byelection was an opportunity to train new volunteers and strengthen relationships, but added he was serious about winning. \n\u201cThere are two big sharks fighting here. I am not afraid of the fight as well,\u201d he said. \nNew Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has not joined Silveira in the riding. \nTrudeau\u2019s recent rally with Hogg in Surrey drew hundreds.

UPI.com", "text": "\u2014 Golden State Warriors (@warriors) December 7, 2017 \nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- It was originally supposed to be Stephen Curry 's night. \nBut instead, the night clearly belonged to Kevin Durant . \nWith Curry and Draymond Green sidelined with injuries, Durant stepped into the spotlight and led the Golden State Warriors to a 101-87 victory over the Charlotte Hornets Wednesday night at the Spectrum Center. \nDurant notched his ninth career triple-double, finishing with 35 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists and seemingly taking the game into his own hands whenever he wished. He scored 16 points in the first quarter to set the tone as the Warriors led by as many as 26 in the first half. \nDurant said it was a matter of everyone stepping up as Charlotte native Curry was out with a sprained ankle and Green was a late scratch with a sore shoulder. The Warriors also lost Zaza Pachulia early in the game with a shoulder injury. \n\"I think everybody just rallied around each other, from the coaches to the players to the trainers, everybody,\" Durant said. \"Everybody was encouraging on the bench. The coaches coached us up every possession. The defense was on point tonight and we got off to a good start.\" \nWarriors coach Steve Kerr marveled at the play of Durant, especially under the circumstances. \n\"What a luxury to be able to just throw him the ball, especially with Steph out,\" Kerr said. \"He took over. It wasn't really scripted, it was just a natural product of Steph being out, Draymond being out. I just liked his pace, his energy. He was attacking from the start. It was like a 'I've got this' type of thing.\" \nDurant shrugged off any desire to take over the game, but he liked the chance to be creative, which he certainly was. \n\"It's fun when you get to create,\" Durant said. \"It's fun to just be creative out there. Passing for the lob, or creating the jump shot -- all the things you work on. It felt like tonight I was able to go to my bag of tools and pull some stuff out. I don't expect it to be like that every single game but we set the tone early and after that I didn't have to handle the ball that much.\" \nThe Warriors (20-6) have now won five straight and seven of their last eight. \nKlay Thompson added 22 points, Nick Young scored 10, and Quinn Cook stepped in for Curry at point guard and had eight points with only one turnover in 22 minutes. \nKerr was especially happy with the Warriors' defense, which held the Hornets to 35.1 percent shooting from the field. The Hornets shot just 31.5 percent in the first half, enabling the Warriors to lead by 48-22 midway through the second quarter and 53-38 at halftime. \n\"Our first-quarter defense was great,\" Kerr said. \"It set the tone right from the beginning. KD took over, but I thought as a team we did a great job of defending and getting us off to a good start.\" \nThe Hornets (9-14) have now lost five of their last six. \nKemba Walker led the Hornets with 24 points. Nicolas Batum scored 15 and Dwight Howard scored 14. But Marvin Williams was a whopping minus-23 in the plus-minus in 29 minutes of action. \n\"They have a lot of guys that can guard one through five, and they do a ton of switching,\" Williams said. \"I think that's where they make it difficult on other teams. That's where we struggled.\" \nAssociate head coach Stephen Silas coached the Hornets for the second straight game with Steve Clifford out because of illness. \n\"Even without those other guys, they're still pretty good,\" Silas said of the Warriors. \"Obviously with Durant and Klay it was hard to stop those guys tonight. I thought we started the game pretty slow. At the beginning of the second quarter we weren't getting the ball moving and playing with the right pace. We finally got it going a little bit at the end of the second quarter with some pace, and that carried over to the third and fourth quarter. But those guys made big plays down the stretch. To hold that team to 101 points isn't all bad.\" A post shared by Golden State Warriors (@warriors) on Dec 6, 2017 at 7:12pm PST \nNOTES: The Hornets issued a statement Wednesday that said coach Steve Clifford would be away from the team \"for the immediate future\" to address health concerns. They did not identify the health issue. ... Clifford missed time in 2013 to undergo a heart procedure, but published reports said his current issue is not heart-related. ... The Warriors' 125-115 win at New Orleans on Monday, when they rallied from a 20-point halftime deficit, made them the first team in the shot-clock era to rally from 20-point halftime deficits to win twice in the same season. They also rallied from 20 down to beat Philadelphia last month. ... The Hornets were completely healthy for the first time all season. ... The Hornets were coming off a 104-94 win over Orlando on Monday. ... The Warriors were playing the fourth game of a five-game road trip. They will close out the trip on Friday at Detroit. ... The Hornets were playing the second game of a four-game home stand. They will host Chicago on Friday, and the LA Lakers on Saturday.
