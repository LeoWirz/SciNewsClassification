Expats got Talent 2017 is the brainchild of the local Department of Culture and Sports along with a group of expats living and working in the Vietnamese city of Da Nang , and will take place on December 17/18 at the Treung Vuong Theatre. The contest was planned as part of a series of culturally-based events slated to run in 2017-18 in the hopes that tourists will enjoy the offerings as much as locals and the expat community. Contestants have a wide range of accomplishments to choose between, including playing all kinds of musical instruments, dancing, singing anything from pop to classical, performing magic tricks or circus acts and devising original works of performance art. It\u2019s hoped the acts will be able to incorporate cultural features of their home countries in their performances. Acts can be anything for individual through duos to groups of any size. Potential solo stars are being asked to present performances of up to seven minutes in duration, whilst groups can give up to five performances of three to four minutes each, up to a total of 15 \u201320 minutes on stage. The contest represents a totally new effort to promote cultural exchange between locals and expat communities across the city as part of a celebration of the upcoming New Year. Winners of the group sector will walk away with a prize of VND 10 million, with two runners-up taking home VND eight million each. Three winners in the individual sector will get first prizes of VND5 million, and five second prizes of VND3 million will be awarded. The names of the judges haven\u2019t yet been released yet, but it\u2019s hoped by a good few expat male contestants that at least two will be as gorgeous as the girls in the X Factor team!

Records Inc. View on Apple Music Also Available in iTunes About Seal Seal emerged from England's house music scene in 1990 to become the most popular British soul vocalist of that decade. Although his earliest material still showed signs of acid house, by the mid-'90s he was known for a distinctive fusion of soul, folk, pop, dance, and rock that brought him success on both sides of the Atlantic. Early on, he enjoyed a very high level of success -- an Ivor Novello Award was given to him for the writing of his first single, and he won three Grammy Awards only a few years later. His albums were typically released a few years apart, yet they tended to earn multiple gold and platinum certifications in different countries.The son of Nigerian and Brazilian parents, Seal, born Sealhenry Samuel in 1963, was raised in England. After graduating with an architectural degree, he took various jobs around London, including electrical engineering and designing leather clothing. After a while, he began singing in local clubs and bars. He joined an English funk band called Push, touring Japan with the band in the mid-'80s. When he was in Asia, he joined a Thailand-based blues band. After a short time with that group, he traveled throughout India on his own.Upon returning to England, Seal met Adamski, a house and techno producer who had yet to make much of an impression in the U.K. Seal provided the lyrics and vocals for Adamski's \"Killer,\" which became a number one U.K. hit in 1990 and was acknowledged with an Ivor Novello Award. Seal signed a solo recording contract with ZTT and recorded his eponymous debut album with label founder Trevor Horn, who had previously worked with Yes, ABC, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and Grace Jones, among others. The first single pulled from the album, \"Crazy,\" became a number 15 hit in the U.K. in 1990 and reached number seven in the U.S. upon its release there the following year. Seal was likewise a success, reaching number 24 in America and selling over three-million copies around the world.Seal subsequently took three years to complete his second album. In between the two records, he appeared on the Jimi Hendrix tribute album Stone Free, singing on Jeff Beck's version of \"Manic Depression.\" In the summer of 1994, he released his second album, also titled Seal. Preceded by the American Top 40 hit \"Prayer for the Dying,\" the album did well upon its release, peaking at number 20 and selling a million copies by the spring of 1995, but it didn't really take off until a year after its release, when \"Kiss from a Rose\" was featured on the soundtrack to Batman Forever. That song became a number one pop single in America and spent a total of 12 weeks at the top of the adult contemporary chart. Its success sent the parent album into multi-platinum status; two years after its original release, the album had sold over four million copies in the U.S. alone. Additionally, the song was connected to three Grammy awards: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.Human Being, Seal's third album, hit the shelves in 1998 and didn't fare nearly as well on a commercial level. Five years passed -- a period that included the recording of Togetherland, a shelved album Seal termed \"crap\" -- prior to the release of Seal IV. That album put the singer back in the Top Ten of the U.K. album chart and, for the first time, in the U.S. Top Ten. As another lengthy between-album period ensued, there were a couple stopgap packages, namely Best: 1991-2004 and the live CD/DVD combo Live in Paris. Additionally, Seal married Heidi Klum, who appeared as a duet partner on \"Wedding Day,\" a song on the 2007 album System.For the next several years, Seal was more productive than ever. He switched gears with Soul (2008), for which he covered classic soul songs. In eight territories, the album was certified gold, platinum, or diamond, while it reached number 13 in the U.S. It was produced by David Foster, who remained a creative partner for Commitment (2010) and Soul 2 (2011), the latter of which -- a second set of covers -- also involved Trevor Horn. The album 7 (2015), issued three years after Seal and Klum's divorce, was previewed with the tracks \"Every Time I'm with You\" and \"Do You Ever.\" Those two songs, as well as all others on the album, were produced by Horn. Signing with Republic Records, began working with producer Nick Patrick at Los Angeles' historic Capitol Records studios on a set of standards from the classic pop songbook. Enlisting a seasoned team of jazz and pop veterans in the studio where Frank Sinatra famously recorded, Seal emerged with his tenth album, Standards, which was slated for release in November 2017. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine ORIGIN ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nick patrick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adamski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "horn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david foster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen thomas erlewine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heidi klum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samuel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimi hendrix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grace jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankie goes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor horn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "klum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff beck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank sinatra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "warner bros", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "abc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol records", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:51.087+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88fa25178f5261cc6dd95f9e7361ce025902960f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeMNwajAJk7GHwSfGZvtl7pbwa9keEJ9kKEnxoOxO.hn.3coTI0eva7mMiDp6BjDUxU3Qhzhm4.SBIVm17u6hoqhmNBUYely0J1hwLhWqJK0xCnuNY.UEc1vkGAUJqWmWx", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/cardio-training-equipment/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Cardio Equipment -

The latest haven for expats with a view to investment as well as the good life is Panama, home to the iconic Canal as well as a host of new updates and improvements aimed at attracting wealthier tourists, retirees and potential residents. Set in Latin America, it\u2019s a safe country with up-to-the-minute medical services, a high standard of living and great nightlife. Its government is pro-investment and pro-business, actively promotes its tax-friendly regime and offshore company formation to investors and has a liberal immigration policy. For retirees, there\u2019s the Pensionado programme, offering discounts on everyday purchases, entertainment, restaurants, prescriptions and airline tickets, with those eligible for permanent residence also able to get a second passport. Real estate developments in Panama now tend towards modern homes, with incoming expats able to purchase without restrictions. The world-famous Panama Canal is undergoing a $5.4 billion expansion at present, in line with the government\u2019s commitment to improve the country\u2019s infrastructure and transportation systems. The international airport is also expanding via two new terminals, with a third already on the drawing board. New runways and a direct metro link to commercial and residential areas are in the planning stages. For potential incomers, Panama\u2019s government is making much of the country\u2019s stunning natural beauty and its charming beachside towns surrounded by rainforests, jungles, hot springs and mountains. Its capital boasts a national park within its boundaries as well as a great selection of malls, international standard restaurants and lively nightclubs, and is one of the safest locations in the Americas. For those deciding Panama is their dream destination, developments just outside the city limits give the best of both worlds, and are also suitable for investors looking for high levels of rental income. The buy-to-let sector serves not only tourists looking for a great place to stay, but is also popular with expats on assignment with multinational organisations with regional headquarters in the capital.

Dutch lawmakers were over the moon last month when Amsterdam became the destination of choice for the relocation from the UK of the European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam residents, however, were far less than pleased with the reality of yet another influx of foreign professionals into their already crowded city. Dutch media and Dutch citizens are sick to death of expats arriving, forcing up already soaring rental charges as well as property prices and generally adding to the crowds of tourists clogging up the streets and searching for strip joints. The relocation of some 900 expat professionals will be a boost to the city\u2019s economy, but citizens simply care about the changes due to be made to suit foreign tastes. Dutch social media is full of reports lamenting the city\u2019s former edgy, free-wheeling spirit and its crushing in favour of the wants of an army of EU bureaucrats. Amsterdam\u2019s rebranding as a \u2018respectable\u2019 city dedicated to economic progress and sanitization began a decade ago with the shutting down a third of the city\u2019s world-famous brothels and the closing of its equally famous marijuana cafes. Tourist arrivals have soared since 2011 and are now double the number, with six million arriving every year. Wealthy expat arrivals have also soared, from 39,000 in 2009 to last year\u2019s record of 77,000. The local government has no problem with immigrants, according to lawmaker Reiner van Dantzig, who refers to Amsterdam as a historic open city for immigrants since its 17th century Golden Age. One 5th generation Amsterdammer, Danielle van Diemen, told reporters her town is now being defined by foreigners from Western countries who still see it as edgy when it isn\u2019t. There\u2019s a huge, unbridgeable gap between wealthy, non-Dutch speaking expats and the local people, she said, adding foreigners should simply go home and leave the city to its native residents. Another local said he feels like a tourist in his own neighbourhood, as all the local shops and cafes have been taken over by greedy tourism-orientated retailers. Amsterdam\u2019s real estate market is another cause for local complaint, as house prices and rentals have soared beyond the reach of the average Dutch worker. The city was recently voted \u2018best for millenials\u2019 from professionals to start-ups, but it\u2019s clearly no longer best for its original residents as a result. Many feel the entire population is being replaced by incomers, and 40 percent of young couples with children are being driven out by rising prices and replaced by foreigners on high wages.

News \u00bb Wealthy expats fleeing Britain in fear of post Brexit tax status Wealthy expats fleeing Britain in fear of post Brexit tax status Published: 5   Property Abroad , USA , UK , China , Hong Kong , UAE , Switzerland , Exchange Rates , England Reports show over 12,000 non-domiciled expat professionals have left the UK over the past year, with another 55,000 planning to leave. The mass exodus is focused on the City of London financial district with its specially orchestrated non-dom tax rules, introduced to encourage top financial talents to take temporary assignments in the UK. With Brexit looming, the privileged few aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hedging their bets after an announced new crackdown on long-term non-doms. Changes in the law will mean non-doms will need to have been resident in Britain for 15 years out of the last 20 before the British taxman considers them as domiciled for tax purposes. UK tax lawyers have confirmed wealthy non-doms are worried about their futures in the UK, especially as tax law changes over the past 10 years have been squeezing their personal revenues, with Brexit being seen as the last straw. According to HMRC, the UK was home to 121,300 non-doms paying a total of nine billion in income tax on their UK salaries as well as national insurance contributions. Should 50 per cent desert the UK in favour of Switzerland or the USA, the UK will lose some five billion sterling in tax revenue. In the meantime, expats across the world are taking advantage of the plunging pound to purchase property in the UK. For those based in Singapore, Malaysia, China and Hong Kong, payments in local currencies have given them a 21 per cent discount over UK real estate prices before the Brexit referendum. One upscale real estate agency reports expat purchases are making up for a slump in UK-based buyers, especially in fashionable semi-rural areas within 20 miles or so of provincial cities such as Bath. As well as fuelling increases in actual purchases, expat enquiries are also surging. Foreign buyers are also snapping up country homes at over two million pounds, with new laws such as the three per cent charge on second homes being cancelled out by the exchange rate between sterling and major foreign currencies. Buy to let mortgage enquiries from expatriates are up by 162 per cent on their pre-referendum figures, with professionals working in Singapore and the UAE the most active.

spoke to you cause i was scared to, i thought you were an amazing girl to actualy play cod and would be used to guys annoyign you, and i didnt want to annoy you... when i finaly worked up the courage to talk to you and get to know you  i realised that i liked you, a lot... you were amazing, you still are amazing.\r\n\r\nwhen i 1st met you it felt liek a movie seeing you across the street on your phone just one look at you and i smiled, i was embarased to be wht you, like when we were playing games together i sat next to you and kept bumping into you on purpose :D not letting you sit back down, then when we had to part our ways i didnt want to leave you... i tried to delay it as much as i could... jsut to spend a couple of extra moments with you... even on the train trip home when i got the message from you saying you had a good day i was so relived and so happy. \r\n\r\nthen we had our date together :D and i sheepishly held your hand not wanting to scare you... or make u feel weird around me... i felt so comfortable around you, like i have been friends with you for my whole life , like a best friend. it wasnt weird at all which i felt lucky about.when we went and had coffee i wanted soo bad to lean in and kiss you, but again i didnt want to scare you... i wanted you to feel safe with me... to like me...then when we went for our walk we cuddled on the peer i really liked being with you, it feelt so natural. \r\n\r\nwe then went to get lunch and i wouidlnt let you pay :D i wanted to make u feel special like how you were to me, to feel liek a princess... i was suprised when you kissed me that you liked me like that i felt so relived =D that you felt the same way. and our movie together i just didnt want it to end , to cuddle with you for all eternity it was so nice with you. then you wanted to go have dinner with me it was amazing :D it was my 1st real dinner date i have ever had... and it was so nice i was scared to actualy say do you want to go out wiht me... hence why i was tryign to subtily say it with facebook....so scared and embarased that u would reject me... but alas you said yes and it was the best day of my life. i didnt want it to end ever!\r\n\r\nthankyou for that night becky, you mean the absolute world to me, thankyou for everyhting you have done for me , how speical you make me feel \r\n\r\ni love cuddling with you \r\ni love kissing you \r\ni love you smile\r\ni just love being wiht you , holding your hand \r\ni love you becky with all my heart \r\nforever and allways \r\n\r\n~Brandt xoxo", "highlightText": "",

Entering the season, all players will be able to earn a new Rank Medal on their profile that represents their highest performance level for the current season. A Seasonal Rank Medal never decreases in rank once you\u2019ve achieved it. Initial calibration games will be seeded roughly based on your previous skill. \nThere are seven levels of Rank Medals, and within each level are five stars of progress to earn towards the next Medal. These Medals are: Herald, Guardian, Crusader, Archon, Legend, Ancient, and Divine. \nYour performance in both Party and Solo games is considered when evaluating your skill and determining when your Medal gets upgraded, with Solo games having a bigger impact. In order for players to achieve either the Ancient or Divine Medals, only Solo-game performance is considered. \nThis update also expands the Leaderboard system to include many more players. Players with 5 stars on the Divine Rank Medal (the highest rank) will now have a leaderboard number listed with the medal that broadcasts their position amongst other players. This leaderboard position will always be displayed alongside the Medal, and will be visible to all players in the game and on your profile. \nSource: Dota 2 Blog ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dota", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "archon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:55.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c0a46f64bb34f545f4fc334c6aa93b4aa45b3b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwj3wydD8tfME6K.I.ynYtrLaggImQ2bE4.oeOvEOrmZ0RbxsOxDyEmPhbTreL6rTlqrLRw2e3spw--", "site_full": "forums.thefashionspot.com", "site": "thefashionspot.com", "site_section": "http://forums.thefashionspot.com/f50/", "site_categories": ["fashion", "style_and_fashion"], "section_title": "Star Style - the Fashion Spot", "title": "Winona Ryder - Page 66", "title_full": "Winona Ryder - Page 66 - the Fashion Spot", "published": "2016-09-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19214, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ec38857bf09ab95dc6a26ecea33ee8f47a206f7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwj3wydD8tfME6K.I.ynYtrLaggImQ2bE4.oeOvEOrmZ0RbxsOxDyEmPhbTreL6rTmOhyVuSORDJKdh81.JIMf0", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "Sylphide", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "1.She wore that Tom Waits tee in her Johnny Depp days!

CEO Mark Stogdill has been awarded the accolade of Best CEO- Telecommunications Industry, USA in this year's line-up.\nThe ever evolving world of tech and communications is hard for the average business leader to keep up with, but not so for Hammer Fiber's President. Mark Stogdill is firmly at the cutting edge of technology and launched the company himself in just 2014. Prior to taking the helm he'd already enjoyed a successful career in the telecoms industry, so was perfectly placed to set up a brand new and forward thinking organisation that would see him gaining worldwide recognition as an industry pioneer.\nIt's hard to remember a time when we weren't connected by the internet- it's become such an intrinsic part of our daily lives. Since the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) we've seen even more changes that have revolutionised the way businesses (and our personal lives) work, but there's still a significant part of the US where internet connections are far from perfect. Hammer Fiber was born out of Mark's desire to give everyone access to super-fast, reliable broadband no matter how remote their location- and he's achieved great success in just three years.\nThe company has recently joined forces with Go Long Wireless Ltd, a Florida based company that specialises in multichannel video distribution and data services. This meeting of two powerful and innovative organisations will target areas with lacklustre broadband, TV and internet phone services to bring enhanced communication and entertainment to residential and commercial customers.\nMark Stogdill puts his success down to his team of highly engaged employees, and team building and worker satisfaction is high on the company's agenda. \"The internet is a people business and delivering on our promises takes great people, from our esteemed Board of Directors down to our service technicians. Hammer's success is a team effort,\" he told our reporter.\nTo read more about Hammer Fiber visit http://www.hammerfiber.biz/\nAn article on the company can also be found on BWM website\nhttps://www.bwmonline.com/2017/12/03/hammer-fiber-attack-the-digital-divide/\nAbout Business Worldwide Magazine\nBusiness Worldwide Magazine is the leading source of business and dealmaker intelligence throughout the world.
