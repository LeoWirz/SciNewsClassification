CT and MRI findings were compared on the following imaging findings: the shape of the cystic lesions and the presence or absence of septum, calcification, and high-intensity fluid on T1- and diffusion-weighted images ( b factor\u2009=\u20091000). The degree of contact with the pancreatic tail was compared between the EDCs and six of the MCNs at the edge of the pancreatic tail.\nResults The EDCs were round ( n \u2009=\u20093) or oval ( n \u2009=\u20095), while the MCNs consisted of three round, five oval, six pear-like, and six multilobulated lesions ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). Septum was present in 4 of 8 (50%) EDCs and 19 of 20 (95%) MCNs ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). The presence of calcification (2 of 8 [25%] EDCs vs. 8 of 20 [40%] MCNs), high-intensity fluid on T1-weighted images (2 of 7 [29%] EDCs vs. 5 of 20 [25%] MCNs), and high-intensity fluid on diffusion-weighted images (5 of 7 [71%] EDCs vs. 5 of 20 [25%] MCNs) were not significantly different. The degree of contact with the pancreatic parenchyma was similar between the two types of lesions.\nConclusion Although the imaging findings for EDC without a solid component and MCN overlap, a pear-like or multilobulated shape may favor a diagnosis of MCN.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2B9CifE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "edc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:50.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "810159bdc3c1832f75ba72ba2d4eba47b93539df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439np9dpw43PgXXTF9rgpLiSFbdBgo2nGaTp05skj1bUN3HunjMObdIMl8RvY0mDhs4daWOFLm3CsQQzR4UV8XpbA3ubMem0fypDYa1OoBoiCj5D6P1t1bVJ28CgC7ygJZxnqm0lfZEGWp0hor3cbGr8bqWAZ.vnMLbJLHUgEf98R8-", "site_full": "www.ebay.co.uk", "site": "ebay.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.ebay.co.uk/b/Shoe-Polish/106123/bn_9325374", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Shoe Polish | eBay", "title": "Tarrago-Mink-Oil-100-Ml-Softens-Nourishes-Waterproofs-Shoes-BOOTS-Bags", "title_full": "Reviews: Tarrago-Mink-Oil-100-Ml-Softens-Nourishes-Waterproofs-Shoes-BOOTS-Bags | eBay", "published": "2016-12-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.021, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c24f24415b1d2b6a3e9d282d210beff45e27d391", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439np9dpw43PgXXTF9rgpLiSFbdBgo2nGaTp05skj1bUN3HunjMObdIMl8RvY0mDhs4daWOFLm3CsQQzR4UV8XpbA3ubMem0fypDYa1OoBoiCj5D6P1t1bVJ28CgC7ygJZxnqm0lfZEGWp0hor3cbGr8bqWAZ.vnMLb_9Hxr8qmBXgl7.fJyypFDgV6q8J7GcGHfSoIq80cAO0-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "0191dorothy1", "published": "2017-11-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mink Oil", "text": "Works OK on my Russian Chrom Boots", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:50.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aed60151984cd9b0d2a53f30f5f763a5228d98ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVFhmmSbhKHDBLgRIfV19pNcwLxjtyccElTBQX1qDWC5l7PrF_WJlT3GNKtRruTVqlBHv8IwK9LMeJFyJlaFn0r4vL8dPxYuH07Z6L2wCq.V", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Vernon-Hotell.d183727.Reseguide-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotell Vernon, Utica - 57 billiga hotell | Expedia.se", "title": "Radisson Hotel Utica Centre", "title_full": "Radisson Hotel Utica Centre (Utica, Amerikas F\u00f6renta Stater) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-08-25T23:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "291a21d6b438fee5bcde6a945f3dc0f4eadfc1bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVFhmmSbhKHDBLgRIfV19pNcwLxjtyccElTBQX1qDWC5l7PrF_WJlT3GNKtRruTVqlBHv8IwK9LMeJFyJlaFn0r4vL8dPxYuHynFmZi95AJ3JyDYPk.DXLd3ILMKhPIlU1.4DTT7ypUd", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-17T22:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "When booking a room through Expedia, I was guaranteed a king size room through the site (both times I've booked here), however, the standard double room is what is actually booked with the hotel.

Entries can be lodged with the FIA from 15 December until 30 January 2018. \nThe new name, WTCR, has been introduced to reflect the switch from TC1 to the TCR technical regulations. Meanwhile, the change of status from world championship to world cup signals the start of an exciting new era for international touring car racing when it is hoped that more affordable technical regulations will trigger a flurry of competitor interest, while building on the existing fan and media following enjoyed by the WTCC. \nQuotes ?Fran\u00e7ois Ribeiro (Head of Eurosport Events): \u201cThe combination of the TCR technical regulations, the expertise and neutrality of the FIA and its stringent sporting rules and procedures, plus the promotional strength of Eurosport Events gained since 2005 will deliver a highly competitive grid, exciting racing and a fan-friendly format that can only drive success.\u201d \nMarcello Lotti (Chief Executive, WSC): \u201cWe are very proud of this agreement that fully respects the very spirit of TCR.

Only TCR cars homologated by WSC and assigned with the FIA WTCR passport issued by the FIA will be eligible. The FIA and TCR technical departments will determine the balance of performance (BOP) at each event, while success ballast will be allocated per driver. The FIA will be responsible for technical management in consultation with TCR representatives. \nPromotion WTCR promoter Eurosport Events will provide a level of promotional resource similar to that enjoyed by the WTCC to ensure that WTCR benefits from live coverage on Eurosport and more than 50 networks around the world, the expertise of Eurosport Events\u2019 promotional and marketing personnel and a comprehensive social media campaign. \nCalendar The calendar will consist of 30 races over 10 events in four continents and will be announced shortly. \nWeekend format Day one: Free Practice 1 (30 minutes); Free Practice 2 (30 minutes); Qualifying (30 minutes), ?Race 1 (top 10 classified finishers score points as follows: 27-20-17-14-12-10-8-6-4-2) \nDay two: Qualifying Q1 (25 minutes)?, Qualifying Q2 (10 minutes)?, Qualifying Q3 (top-five shootout)?; Race 2 (top 10 positions reversed after Q2, top 10 classified finishers score points as follows: 25-18-15-12-10-8-6-4-2-1); Race 3 (grid as per combined order after Q3, top 10 classified finishers score points as follows: 30-23-19-16-13-10-7-4-2-1) \nTCR regulations explained The TCR technical regulations cater for front-wheel-drive, four/five-door saloons or hatchbacks using turbocharged production engines with a capacity of between 1750-2000cc and with a maximum power output of 350bhp.

Al Franken is expected to talk about his political future Thursday, and appears to be on the verge of resigning . Until a few weeks ago, the two-term senator was earning attention for his grilling of Trump administration nominees and a new book . \nFranken rose to fame as a writer and comedian on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But his career began breaking toward politics in the early 2000s when he worked as a radio host on the now defunct liberal network, Air America. \nAfter the plane crash death of his hero Sen. Paul Wellstone in 2002, Franken began pondering a run for the Senate. Franken, who spent his childhood in Albert Lea and St. Louis Park, moved back to Minnesota in 2005 and campaigned on behalf of other DFLers around the state. \nAs he hosted his final show on Air America in 2007 Franken announced his run for U.S. Senate, telling his audience, \"I'm not a professional politician. I know I'm going to make some mistakes and this is going to be the hardest thing I've ever done.\" \nFranken admitted his background in comedy might hurt him, including old sketches and off-color jokes. One of the most damaging was a sexually explicit article he wrote for Playboy nearly a decade before. Democrats and Republicans also criticized him for floating a joke about rape with other comedy sketch writers. The anecdote was in a 1995 story about Saturday Night Live in New York magazine. \nFranken addressed his past during the DFL convention in 2008 . \n\"The things I said and wrote send a message to some of my friends in this room and the people of this state that they can't count on me to be a champion for women, and for all the people of Minnesota in this campaign and in the senate,\" Franken said. \"I'm sorry for that.\" \nIn a year in which Barack Obama took 54 percent of the vote in Minnesota, the race between Franken and incumbent Sen. Norm Coleman hinged on so few votes that recounts and court battles dragged on for more than six months after election day. \n\"I won by 312 votes, so I really have to earn the trust of the people who didn't vote for me and of all the people of Minnesota,\" Franken said. \nIn the Senate, Franken took on issues including drug costs for seniors, oversight for credit rating agencies and net neutrality. He made an effort to stay away from comedy. \nHis political star rose, as he became a strong fundraiser nationally for Democrats. He was even mentioned as a vice presidential candidate during the 2016 election. \nHe also gained a strong political voice in the party, most notably, during confirmation hearings for President Trump's nominees. His questioning of Jeff Sessions grabbed the attention of national media at the time. Franken asked what the Attorney General nominee, who spoke on behalf of Trump at rallies before the election, would do if \"there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government...\" \nSessions responded that he \"did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it.\" \nThat answer led in part to Sessions' recusing himself from the Russia investigation. \nOn Nov. 16, radio host Leeann Tweeden posted a 2006 photo showing Franken appearing to touch her breasts as she slept wearing body armor and a helmet during a USO tour. She said he'd also forcibly kissed her during a rehearsal of a script he'd written. \nFranken apologized and welcomed a Senate ethics committee investigation. But in the days and weeks following, more allegations of sexual misconduct have been made by women, some anonymously. \nOn Wednesday, a former Democratic aide alleged in a Politico article that Franken had tried to forcibly kiss her in 2006. Franken immediately denied the allegation made anonymously, but by evening almost all of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had called for him to resign. \nCorrection (Dec. 7, 2017): This story has been updated to correct that Leeann Tweeden posted a photo taken during the 2006 USO tour. \nSubscribe to our politics newsletter.

Read more Young Americans stories . \nReliably conservative Tennessee has managed to show a decline in hate crimes over the past few years, but the statistics may not tell the whole story. \nOn May 4, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) released a report stating hate crimes in Tennessee went down from 2015 to 2016. The number of racially-motivated hate crimes had increased from 95 in 2014 to 127 in 2015, but went back down to 112 in 2016. Racially-motivated offenses made up more of the state's total reported hate crimes in 2016, about 40 percent. In comparison, in 2014 they comprised about 25 percent, and in 2015, about 21 percent. \nThe number of ethnicity or national origin bias hate crimes dropped from 68 to nine and about 11 to about 3 percent of the state's total from 2015 to 2016. Of the 68 crimes committed in 2016, 51 of them were against people other than Latin, Hispanic or Arab ethnicities. \nBut Maria Tcherni-Buzzeo, a criminal justice professor at the University of New Haven, cautioned too big a deal could potentially be made from fluctuations from one year to the next because that alone is not enough data.

It's perfectly normal to feel the contractions in your stomach when it's empty. But you can still function, and preparing and/or waiting for a good, planned meal, can be just as delightful as eating it.\nSo - are you eating enough? What's your age, height and current weight? Are you active, or breastfeeding, or both? What have you set your calories to? Are you tracking macros? Do you get in your five-a-day? Do you get 8 hours of sleep? Do you exercise moderately?

CT and MRI findings were compared on the following imaging findings: the shape of the cystic lesions and the presence or absence of septum, calcification, and high-intensity fluid on T1- and diffusion-weighted images ( b factor\u2009=\u20091000). The degree of contact with the pancreatic tail was compared between the EDCs and six of the MCNs at the edge of the pancreatic tail.\nResults The EDCs were round ( n \u2009=\u20093) or oval ( n \u2009=\u20095), while the MCNs consisted of three round, five oval, six pear-like, and six multilobulated lesions ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). Septum was present in 4 of 8 (50%) EDCs and 19 of 20 (95%) MCNs ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). The presence of calcification (2 of 8 [25%] EDCs vs. 8 of 20 [40%] MCNs), high-intensity fluid on T1-weighted images (2 of 7 [29%] EDCs vs. 5 of 20 [25%] MCNs), and high-intensity fluid on diffusion-weighted images (5 of 7 [71%] EDCs vs. 5 of 20 [25%] MCNs) were not significantly different. The degree of contact with the pancreatic parenchyma was similar between the two types of lesions.\nConclusion Although the imaging findings for EDC without a solid component and MCN overlap, a pear-like or multilobulated shape may favor a diagnosis of MCN.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2B9CifE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "edc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:53.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12862ef58323589ceb1a713307088d6dbec391dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBfEW16Icr0LCK3hINuWiLXOLqrjMa4ye0yWHcQwnQXK.XA5bYHXK16AhBG.PLDfd2diQmxA9ToAm3MuShp.sI0Y-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

Every day, it seems there's a new set of stories about men in power using sex as a weapon to humiliate and intimidate women (and sometimes other men). Now Time magazine has named \"The Silence Breakers\" as Person of the Year, crowning this surge of anger over sexual harassment as one of the most important stories of 2017. \nIt's been a big media story, but has all this righteous anger over sexism really penetrated the consciousness of everyday Americans? Has this genuinely rattled ordinary people and their views on gender and power? A new study out by the research firm PerryUndem provides a surprising and encouraging answer: Yes, the past year has seen something of a feminist awakening in the American public. It's not just about Weinstein or the revelations of the past two months. It's been a year in the making, as evidenced by the outrage over Donald Trump's election and the Women's March in January that was likely the largest single protest event in modern history. \nTresa Undem, the pollster in charge of the study, told a press call on Wednesday that Hillary Clinton's defeat, Trump's infamous comments on the \"Access Hollywood\" tape and the Women\u2019s March all \"really contributed to the atmosphere we\u2019re in right now.\" \nOn questions designed to gauge whether voters believe sexism is real and serious, Undem found a huge surge in more feminist-minded thinking in voters over the last year. Last year, 65 percent of those polled felt men had more positions of power in society than women. Now 87 percent do. There were similar findings on questions about women's leadership, the impact of sexism and whether the respondents talked about sexism with their friends and family. \n\" As pollsters, we don\u2019t see shifts in attitudes this big,\" Undem said. She noted that similar findings have cropped up in more than 200 focus groups PerryUndem has conducted in the past year. Women are using the word \"misogyny,\" something that used to be unheard of. People are talking about sexism in more concrete, thoughtful ways than they had in previous years. \nLast year, a similar survey found that Republicans of both genders were skeptical that sexism was a real issue. But now a gender split is widening, and Republican women are starting to say things that indicate an acceptance that sexism is real, even as Republican men still resist the idea. For instance, the only group surveyed that denied that men experience social pressure to be dominant were Republican men. \nThe majority of Republican women joined with Democrats and independents of both genders to agree that men have more power than women at work. Only Republican men dissented, with 58 percent believing it was balanced between the genders or that women had more power. \nFox News and other conservative media outlets have opportunistically made a huge fuss out of sexual harassment accusations against Democratic elected officials or celebrities associated with liberal causes (like Harvey Weinstein), while selectively ignoring similar accusations against conservatives. Whatever short-term partisan gain they got from this move appears to have backfired, however, by making sexual harassment seem like a nonpartisan issue and thereby giving Republican women an opportunity to express more disapproval of sexism in the workplace. \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it turned Republicans into feminists, by any means,\" Undem said, but she noted that people are talking about these issues more to friends and family and \"that\u2019s when you see culture change.\" \nThe poll also indicates that the public has learned a lot about the nature of sexual harassment from the #MeToo movement and widespread coverage of Trump's comments on the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" video, where he bragged about kissing and groping women without consent, adding, \"when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it.\" The myth that sexual harassers are misguided Romeos who are just clumsily trying to flirt has given way to a greater understanding that men harass in order to dominate women, as feminists have long asserted. Eighty-six percent of those surveyed indicated a belief that men harass because of the \"desire for power and control over women,\" and 88 percent expressed a belief that they do it \"assuming they won't get caught or face consequences.\" \nGranted, 52 percent of people still believe that some men harass women because they want \"to date or start a relationship,\" but only 14 percent said that was definitely a primary component in harassment. It seems as if Americans finally understand that the main reason that men harass women is to express power and cause harm. Even when they are trying to get sex, that's a secondary concern; having power over a non-consenting woman is a big part of the erotic thrill. \nMany feminist commentators in the past two months have expressed frustration over the fact that while many men in media and politics are being held accountable for sexual harassment, President Trump, despite the mountains of evidence against him, seems to be escaping justice. The good news is that PerryUndem found the public agrees with them. Seventy-six percent of Americans believe Trump has \"definitely\" or \"probably\" sexually harassed women, and the same number believe he should be investigated for it. Startlingly, even 43 percent of Trump supporters said they wanted an investigation. \nWhen people were asked what word came to mind when thinking about Trump and women, the answers were largely negative. \nWhile Americans are starting to wake up to the problem of gender inequality in the public sphere, however, there's still a widespread reluctance to look at inequality in the home. Forty-eight percent of voters surveyed believed men and women are equal in romantic relationships, while only 40 percent say the man tends to have more power. Democratic women were the only demographic slice where a majority of respondents said men had more power in the the home. Republicans and independents of both genders were likelier to say romantic relationships were equal, and Democratic men were dead even, with 43 percent claiming romance is egalitarian and 43 percent saying men have more power. \nSocial change happens slowly, and asking people to interrogate their own life choices is always going to be harder than asking them to cast judgment on issues like sexual harassment in the workplace. These results are genuinely heartening, however, and seem to make clear that the #MeToo movement is more than a media trend. It might actually be the beginning of a real shift in American culture.

No tax bill, no spending bill and no coherent policy: Republicans stare at disaster, and hope to blame Democrats Matthew Sheffield 2017-12-07T10:00:00Z \u2022 2017-12-07T10:00:00Z \u2022 0 Comments 0 Comments \nDespite having passed a controversial and widely despised tax bill through the Senate, congressional Republicans still face numerous difficulties before anything reaches President Donald Trump's desk. Significant differences remain between the two bills passed by the Senate and the House. With the GOP holding a minimal 52-vote majority in the Senate, the odds are high that whatever final bill emerges from the conference committee of members from both chambers will lean toward the Senate\u2019s version. \nFurther complicating matters for House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is that the stopgap funding law that currently funds the federal government expires on Friday at midnight. At this writing, the GOP has no agreement on what would replace it. \nFar-right Republicans have long chafed at the idea of passing temporary \u201ccontinuing resolutions,\u201d since they believe -- entirely without empirical evidence -- that Americans want to cut federal spending as much as they do. The GOP\u2019s congressional leaders are at least somewhat aware that this opinion runs counter to public polling, which has repeatedly demonstrated that budget cuts are wildly unpopular, even among Republican voters . \nAs a result, GOP leaders have tried to draw Democrats into their spending reduction proposals with concerns about the federal budget deficit. It has worked in the past, including in 2011 when President Barack Obama signed the Budget Control Act (better known as the \u201cbudget sequester\u201d), which even now forces some mandatory spending reductions. \nGetting Democrats to sign on has sometimes allowed Republicans to make actual spending reductions and offered the possibility of even larger cuts, such as the \u201cgrand bargain\u201d Obama and former Speaker John Boehner nearly reached in 2011 to cut Social Security and Medicare in exchange for some additional taxes. But \"bipartisanship\" has become a bad word or fatal sign of weakness among conservative activists, so the built-in preference for Republicans has been to try and get things done within the walls of the GOP. \nBut making major federal policy changes has proven very difficult for Republicans, largely thanks to the efforts of a group of 30 or so far-right House members who call themselves the Freedom Caucus. The progeny of the moribund Tea Party movement, the Freedom Caucus has essentially tried to operate as a party within a party, its members banding together to try and force leadership\u2019s hand in their direction. \nAs might be expected given the caucus' lack of legislative experience, the unpopularity of its viewpoints and its close relationships with outside activist groups with no expertise at anything besides monetizing their members , none of the strategies advocated by the Freedom Caucus -- such as the failed brinksmanship that led to a 2013 government shutdown -- have ever worked. \nFailure has never been much of an obstacle for conservative groups, however. Despite the fact that even the sainted Ronald Reagan was never able to cut domestic spending , American conservatives have persistently tried to push this unpopular viewpoint since the 1980s. The Trump presidency, however, has presented a special challenge to right-wing elected officials: Republican voters arguably never supported their policies in the first place and are now far more interested in Trump\u2019s signature issues of restricting immigration and stirring up anti-Islamic sentiment. \nSince Trump has little personal interest in policy outside those core areas, he has largely allowed Ryan and McConnell to dictate the legislative agenda. This was exactly the dynamic that Republican elites noticed as early as January 2016, when they began openly talking about how they preferred the smash-mouth real estate tycoon over his principal rival for the GOP presidential nomination, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. \nGOP leaders figured that embracing Trump, despite his bizarre, vulgar pronouncements and unorthodox personal life, would be better for them than elevating Cruz and his Christian supremacist and radically anti-government allies . They also figured -- correctly, as things turned out -- that Trump likely had a better chance of winning the presidency. \nPicking Trump has certainly had negative effects on the Republican Party's future coherence. But in terms of keeping the GOP\u2019s anti-government wing in check, McConnell and his allies appear to have made the right choice. Despite his periodic swipes at the Republican congressional leadership, Trump has essentially allowed them wide leeway and largely abandoned the populist economic policies on which he campaigned . He has even shown a willingness to attack the Freedom Caucus, as he did in March when he repeatedly bashed the group after it briefly killed one of several House bills to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Trump has also leaned heavily on the GOP elites for his executive and judicial nominations, and also for his campaign endorsements. \nFar-right Republicans have also lost some leverage since Trump has already shown a willingness to work with Democratic leaders on continuing resolutions. At this moment, however, House GOP leaders appear to be trying to go it alone, even though a potentially catastrophic government shutdown is less than 48 hours away. \nEven if the GOP can somehow pass single-party budget resolutions out of the House, the Senate\u2019s filibuster rules only allow revenue bills to pass with a simple majority. According to Politico, Republican leaders are hoping to peel off a few red-state Democrats -- there are 10 from states Trump carried last year who face difficult re-election battles in 2018 -- to pass a two-week continuing resolution by including spending for children\u2019s health insurance and hurricane relief. \nIt's conceivable that might work, but it also seems the federal bureaucracy is preparing for a shutdown. On Dec. 1, the Office of Management and Budget held a conference call with top officials at various agencies instructing them to get ready for it. \nWhile Republican congressional leaders have been busy trying to wrangle votes, Trump spent his Wednesday trying to blame Democrats for a possible shutdown -- a blatant lie even by his standards. \n\"It could happen,\" the president said at a news briefing when asked whether a shutdown might happen. \u201cThe Democrats are really looking at something that is very dangerous to our country.

It promises greater convenience and speed for delivering basic health care services \u2014 but it isn\u2019t what patients really want.\nRetail thinking views patients as consumers: faceless targets for buying services and products that aren\u2019t always health-related. It\u2019s the thinking behind technology-assisted health care services, like ZocDoc, Amwell, and One Medical, which quickly triage symptoms or serve up medical advice. It\u2019s the thinking that makes it possible for me to walk in, no appointment needed, to my local CVS or Target to have a cough or sore throat examined.\nAt the same time, it gives web-based apps  opportunities to sell  some of your information to advertisers, who want to sell you other things. It gives brick-and-mortar organizations cross-selling opportunities for everything from allergy medications to Halloween candy as I walk down the store aisle to get my flu shot from the pharmacist or have the nurse practitioner apply guideline-driven diagnosis and treatment. The providers I see during these interactions know nothing about me, offer little tailored advice, and the services they provide will be both limited and standardized in how they are delivered.\nWhat patients want most in health care is something human and intimate, maintained through regular one-on-one interactions with experts they knew and trusted who were compassionate, empathetic, friendly, and respectful. Being viewed through the retail lens also means that I am asked to consume other offerings pitched to me by whoever provides me with health care, be it my insurance company or my employer. They try to get me interested in legal and babysitting services, gym memberships, pedometers, mail-order pharmacies, round-the-clock nurse help lines, life insurance, and more. They do this to help them earn more of my loyalty, generate more revenue for themselves, or reduce their costs.\nThe hospitals and medical offices I visit seek to keep me within their system of care delivery, make me a long-term customer, and refer me only to their providers and services, both of which they control. By using retail tactics like offering one-stop shopping \u2014 where I can get primary, specialty, and other types of care all without leaving the same building \u2014 and marketing their brand to me with simplified rating systems that show their high quality, they want me to trust that they have my interests at heart and can deliver any type of health care transaction I require.\nRetail thinking has its place in health care today because there are some services and products that people need quickly and which do not require a personal touch or someone who understands them as unique individuals. Such services might be low-level acute care (think strep throat), flu shots and immunizations, and some forms of simple chronic disease management, such as blood sugar checks or foot and eye exams for people with diabetes, especially if they are guideline driven. There\u2019s no question that retail thinking can also create purchasing opportunities for things patients find useful, if not always essential, and perhaps do so in ways that are cost-effective or convenient for us.\nBut retail health care is impersonal, lacks relational warmth, and isn\u2019t what patients really want.\nI interviewed 80 patients and doctors for a  new book  on the doctor-patient relationship in the era of efficiency-driven innovation, corporate care, and retail medicine. What I heard from patients is that the impersonal nature of retail thinking is frustrating them and lowering their expectations about the levels of emotional support and customized help they can get from any doctor, or from others in the health care system.\nNo patient with whom I spoke wanted transactional care at the expense of relational care. No one prioritized  Fitbits , web-based assessments of symptoms, or seeing a stranger about a sore throat in a big-box store over a long-term personal connection with a doctor. What these individuals wanted most in health care was something human and more intimate, maintained through regular one-on-one interactions with experts they knew and trusted who were compassionate, empathetic, friendly, and respectful.\nThe physicians with whom I spoke wanted the same things.\nThis type of sustained personal experience between two people who know something about each other, and who are motivated to really talk and listen as care partners, is something retail thinking does not do well. It is not concerned with the emotional aspects of care, building interpersonal trust between doctor and patient, or getting to know people as individuals with their own relevant life stories.\nYet existing research demonstrates that these are the very features that are good for patients. For example,  care continuity  through a stable doctor-patient relationship improves health care quality and patient satisfaction.  Doctor-patient trust , established through extended interpersonal contact, helps patients become more engaged in their care; creates a positive patient experience; and increases perceived effectiveness of care.  Extended dialogue  between patient and doctor positively affects health outcomes ranging from high blood pressure to mental health problems.  Physician empathy  is linked to more accurate diagnoses, better health outcomes, and an enhanced patient experience.\nIf you don\u2019t believe the literature, just ask the patients I interviewed. Teddy, a healthy man in his 30s, believed that without feeling trust towards a specific doctor \u2014 which for him was forged over time through regular face time and conversations with that doctor \u2014 little could be uncovered of the more intimate, life story information that he felt was most important for keeping him healthy. He said he had never been completely honest with clinicians he didn\u2019t know.\nHallie, a 50-year-old woman with several chronic diseases, talked confidently about better understanding how to manage her many conditions, and how they affected her everyday life \u2014 the result of having a doctor who knew something about her personally, who spent time not reading off a care guideline but instead asking her real-time questions about how she felt, and then showing genuine compassion with her daily struggles. Hallie felt better able to self-manage her care, which kept her from using the system unnecessarily.\nCliff, a stressed-out dad in his 50s, talked excitedly about finally having the same physician he could see on a consistent basis; a doctor who in their first visit had spent time just listening to him, nothing more; then taking that information and asking him questions about his own life; and finally tailoring therapeutic advice based on the entire dialogue. Janell, a career-minded mom in her 40s, recalled with joy the memory of a past primary care physician who remembered conversations they had during previous visits and who used that knowledge to give Janell tailored guidance about how to manage her life stressors more effectively.\nCan an industry that wants to use retail tactics also deliver on the relational excellence that patients and research say is important? It\u2019s not easy, given retail thinking\u2019s focus on speed and efficiency. Here are four ways that might meld these two approaches.\nFirst, put more thought into where  not  to use retail thinking in health care. It may make sense for care delivery that is routine, care that can be standardized in a straightforward way, and in situations where the patient wants convenience above all else. But that actually amounts to a limited menu of services, and even routine care can often reveal deeper problems in patients, requiring the kinds of relational features I\u2019ve described.\nSecond, better measure and monetize the components of relational excellence, making it matter to health care organizations and third-party payers. That means carefully assessing dynamics like interpersonal trust between doctor and patient; analyzing those data to see how they positively affect health outcomes; and then giving this metric the same relative importance in high-quality care delivery compared to other things like prescribing a particular drug for a particular condition.\nThird, look for innovative ways to  strengthen  the doctor-patient relationship, not undermine it. For example, the industry should experiment with using technology as a tool to give doctors more face time and direct contact with their patients. Right now, both doctors and patients perceive technology, primarily the electronic health record, as interfering with their relationship.\nFourth, and most important, the patient voice must be heard. This could include adopting greater transparency with respect to assessing patient satisfaction with retail tactics, say through  Yelp-type accountability mechanisms , and conducting market research that goes beyond simple binary questions of \u201cwould you use this\u201d or \u201cwould you like greater convenience in accessing your care\u201d and instead delves deeper into discovering what patients really value.\nIn thinking about my discussions with patients, there is one other important thing they want. They want to decide when their health care should work like the drive-through at McDonald\u2019s or buying with one click at Amazon and when it should be more personal than that, involving extended human-to-human interaction, highly trained experts who know their patients, and an abundance of the time, trust, and soft skills required to make us healthier long-term and see health care as the important part of our lives that it really is.\nTimothy J.

The tumor blood flow (TBF), fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD) of the enhanced lesion and related edema were calculated. The lesion was categorized as recurrence/residual or postradiation changes.\nResults There was significant differences between residual/recurrent gliomas and postradiation changes of TBF ( P \u2009=\u20090.001), FA ( P \u2009=\u20090.001 and 0.04), and MD ( P \u2009=\u20090.001) of enhanced lesion and related edema respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of TBF of enhanced lesion and related edema used to differentiate residual/recurrent gliomas from postradiation changes were 0.95 and 0.93 and of MD were 0.95 and 0.81 and of FA were 0.81 and 0.695, respectively. Combined ASL and DTI metrics of the enhanced lesion revealed AUC of 0.98, accuracy of 95%, sensitivity of 93.8%, specificity of 95.8%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 93.8%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.8%. Combined metrics of ASL and DTI of related edema revealed AUC of 0.97, accuracy of 92.5%, sensitivity of 93.8%, specificity of 91.7%, PPV of 88.2%, and NPV of 95.7.\nConclusion Combined ASL and DTI metrics of enhanced lesion and related edema are valuable noninvasive tools in differentiating residual/recurrent gliomas from postradiation changes.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AyyMKS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "dti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asl", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:54.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "002fb57f365e6e9e845c44cc29f0d5d39fc80ac2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBRw7H69tt8rZcKPM53sXpcOMl4viMNys_vT8tn0iFFpo.OI4lfbXgy71SsJONAu5BB0DUF91EKWa6DB6laa1xfY-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money", "title": "BitPay Is Raising A $30M Series B to Expand, Add New Cryptocurrencies", "title_full": "BitPay Is Raising A $30M Series B to Expand, Add New Cryptocurrencies : btc", "published": "2017-12-07T10:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 27, "participants_count": 21, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b11d2fa39eddd737dabc92784c45d0e170c65022", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBRw7H69tt8rZcKPM53sXpcOMl4viMNys_vT8tn0iFFpo.OI4lfbXgy71SsJONAu5BB0DUF91EKWaRquDYUWYlqBXIHZsdZv.lEPxlmqWFnVR", "ord_in_thread": 27, "author": "emfyo", "published": "2017-12-07T16:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "even if you under pay someone around 50k/year that ignores all the business expenses that go along with employing anyone, and the rest of the overhead involved in operations.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:54.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "28743aad5ca66b375b3690157e6c5df8a9cc9c03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQcnPNf8fIeeylcio6l9.qV5T", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/Bitcoin-Invt-GBTC-29559/", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Invt.

Like most students coming to university for the first time, I chose to live in halls where I would be able to meet and socialise with new people who were all in the same boat as me. Before applying for halls, I was lucky enough to be able to view a couple of them at an open day in the summer before I moved in \u2013 I would definitely recommend viewing beforehand if you can to help you decide where you want to stay! \nOf course, I decided I liked the most spacious, modern en-suite rooms the best. I applied for 5 different halls all within walking distance of the main university campus. I chose not to apply for any on campus because I\u2019ve always thought it would feel too much like being at university constantly and never having the space to de-stress away from lectures. \nThe halls I was eventually allocated was the most expensive compared to the others I applied for so was not necessarily my first choice, however, after living here for my first term, I wouldn\u2019t rather live anywhere else. \nIt is right in the city centre, a 10-minute walk from main campus and close to all the shops and entertainment. \nWhen September came around and it was time to move in, surprisingly I wasn\u2019t nervous at all. I was more excited to meet everyone and, more importantly, decorate my room with an abundance of cushions and fairy lights. Moving in was a very positive experience; I had already met most of my flatmates thanks to social media and everyone was extremely welcoming. Before I had even finished bringing my belongings from the car up six flights of stairs in the rain (definitely pack a coat on moving day!), I was getting to know my new surroundings and had already logged on to the Wi-Fi on every device possible. There were even friendly student ambassadors on hand to bring my stuff up for me! \nWhen I had settled in and my parents had gone home that evening, I only had one day to relax and explore the city before my induction lectures started so I made the most of that Sunday afternoon by having a wander around town with one of my flatmates. There\u2019s lots of ways to meet other students in your halls before you move in, so definitely try and do this and it will make the whole process a lot easier. \nSo far, I\u2019ve settled well into university life and have got used to living independently. \nI\u2019m now at the stage where I\u2019ve started thinking about accommodation for next year. \nAt the moment, I\u2019m looking into getting a studio flat in a new block of student housing that has recently been built just a short walk away from where I am now. Although I\u2019ve enjoyed living with flatmates this year, most of my flatmates are looking to move out of the city centre. As I\u2019ve neglected to mention, healthcare courses aren\u2019t taught on the main Plymouth University campus but instead a 40 minute bus journey away. Therefore, moving out of the city centre with my flatmates would make it more difficult to get to uni as it\u2019s further from the bus route. So I\u2019m choosing to move elsewhere in the city centre and stay close to some friends also studying healthcare courses. I also feel that I would enjoy the extra bit of freedom that comes with living in a studio flat! \nThis post was written by one of our Uni Life Bloggers, Hannah.

Whether it\u2019s a spouse declining to tell a partner, or an elderly parent hiding it from the children, many seniors keep quiet because they are embarrassed and fear losing their independence.\nBy remaining silent, however, many of these patients become more afraid and more sedentary, medical experts say. That increases their risk for additional falls and injuries, which can lead to fatal complications such as intracranial bleeding, flail chest and respiratory failure. Indeed, falls are the leading cause of injuries and death from injuries in older Americans, according to the CDC.\nWhile falls can occur at any age, the elderly are most at risk. The CDC says that in 2014, almost one-third of adults 65 or older reported falling at least once in the preceding year, representing an estimated 29 million falls and seven million injuries. Of those who fell, 37.5% reported at least one fall that either restricted their activity or resulted in medical treatment, costing an estimated $31 billion in annual Medicare costs, according to the CDC.\nAlso read: Health care costs in retirement will only grow \u2014 here\u2019s how to save \nWith large numbers of baby boomers turning 65 each year, falling is likely to become an even more serious medical issue in years ahead, experts say.\nThe good news is that there are steps the elderly can take to reduce their risk. Medical experts increasingly believe that strength and mobility, not age, are the biggest factors in determining whether a person will fall.\n\u201cWith balance training and physical therapy, some muscles and nerves can regenerate at any age and compensate for the atrophy often seen in aging, thus reducing the risk of falling,\u201d says Daniel Deems, an otolaryngologist and chief medical officer of Fyzical Therapy & Balance Center, a physical-therapy franchise in 39 states. Falls can be reduced, he says, by working with trained physical therapists to increase balance function in the brain and improve core muscle strength for stability.\nElizabeth Phelan, a geriatrician and associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, agrees, saying, \u201cThe single most effective prevention strategy is the practice of strength-balance exercises like Tai Chi and the development of muscle strength.\u201d\nPhelan also recommends that home environments be assessed and modified as people age. Good lighting is essential, she says, while handrails along staircases can enhance balance and steadiness, and stairs with clearly marked edges can help improve visibility. In the bathroom, grab bars by tubs and showers and around commodes are useful. Toilet seats can be raised and tub-transfer benches added, she says. Showers that are flush with the floor help, as well. (The CDC has a list of health and home practices to reduce fall risk and help seniors continue to live independently.)\nJon Pynoos, co-director of the Fall Prevention Center of Excellence and professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California\u2019s Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, recommends that older adults be screened for fall risk at least once a year, and after any fall occurs.\nChecking a patient\u2019s medications and dosages is a good idea, he says, since many drugs can cause dizziness, confusion, balance problems and a drop in blood pressure, all of which contribute to falls. Eyeglass prescriptions should be kept up-to-date, and periodic eye exams (every one to two years) also should be conducted, he says.\nPhelan believes that communities and state officials could do more to make public spaces safer for the elderly. She recommends making sidewalks even, adding lighting, lowering curbs and adding benches.\nIn Massachusetts, a commission examines data and makes recommendations to the governor and Legislature on how to reduce falls and the health-care costs associated with them. The state\u2019s Department of Public Health, meanwhile, works with community partnerships to make strength training and balance programs available to older adults at risk of falling. (Seniors should check to see what resources their state has to offer.)\n\u201cFalling is an expensive problem with huge ramifications that can affect the quality of life of an entire family,\u201d says Carlene Pavlos, director of the Bureau of Community Health and Prevention in Massachusetts. In 2014, she says, falls accounted for 500 deaths, 22,000 hospitalizations and 48,000 emergency-room visits in her state. \u201cLifetime health-care costs associated with falls in one year are projected at about $1 billion,\u201d Pavlos says.\n\u201cWith solid strategies,\u201d however, \u201cfalls don\u2019t have to be inevitable and can be prevented,\u201d she says.\nBarbara Sadick is a writer in New York.

Neurologic involvement in these conditions is generally thought to be limited to cognitive delay and entrapment neuropathies (primarily carpal tunnel syndrome).

This week, we have Denise ( @denisetws ) who loves exploring new things and places. She can\u2019t leave the house without blusher, making her the perfect candidate to review the Tarte Blush Bazaar Palette. I was super excited to have received the Tarte Blush Bazaar Palette , mostly because I absolutely LOVE blushers. It\u2019s the one thing I would never ever skip even if I were in a rush and already late for an appointment. Tarte\u2019s blushers have always held a special place in my heart, because of how long-wearing they are. I find that it\u2019s the most important thing for me \u2013 aside from pigments \u2013 and look out for that when choosing one. I also love how compact the palette is, and how gorgeous it looks on both the inside and outside. I was slightly apprehensive about the palette at first, because of how dark the shades were. To my pleasant surprise, they didn\u2019t come up too harsh or splotchy, and were buildable and wearable for both day and night looks. All 10 colours were impressive, ranging from subtle natural pinks to darker reddish browns. They come in both warm and cool tones, and in both matte and shimmery shades too. The best part? Two out of the 10 are actually highlighters. Saves me the whole trouble of digging up another palette \u2013 which is crucial when it comes to beating the clock. In particular, I love the peachy \u201cAngelic\u201d blush paired with the subtle-pinkish \u201cWorthy\u201d as a highlighter. The next time I get on a plane, I\u2019m definitely packing this baby in for sure. The versatility and convenience make it great for travel, and even doubles up as eyeshadow. Thanks, Denise!

After expressing doubt that U.S. gasoline supplies jumped during the Thanksgiving holiday break, Flynn said on Wednesday that \u201cit is very disturbing that week after week we have to continue to question the accuracy of these weekly figures.\u201d \nSo we may once again be in for some volatility, and can expect the EIA to release revised figures.\nHow the biggest U.S. players have fared Before showing you which energy stocks are most favored by analysts for 2018, here\u2019s how shares of the 10 largest energy companies, ranked by market capitalization, have performed this year:\nCompany Ticker Market capitalization ($mil) Total return - 2017 through Dec. 5 Exxon Mobil Corp.
