The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Dershowitz President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital is a perfect response to President Obama's benighted decision to change American policy by engineering the United Nations Security Council Resolution declaring Judaism's holiest places in Jerusalem to be occupied territory and a \"flagrant violation under international law.\" It was President Obama who changed the status quo and made peace more difficult, by handing the Palestinians enormous leverage in future negotiations and disincentivizing them from making a compromised peace.\nIt had long been American foreign policy to veto any one-sided Security Council resolutions that declared Judaism's holiest places to be illegally occupied. Obama's decision to change that policy was not based on American interests or in the interests of peace. It was done out of personal revenge against Prime Minister Netanyahu and an act of pique by the outgoing president.\nIt was also designed improperly to tie the hands of President-elect Trump. President Trump is doing the right thing by telling the United Nations that the United States now rejects the one-sided U.N. Security Council Resolution.\nSo if there is any change to the status quo, let the blame lie where it should be: at the hands of President Obama for his cowardly decision to wait until he was a lame-duck president to get even with Prime Minister Netanyahu. President Trump deserves praise for restoring balance in negotiations with Israel and the Palestinians. It was President Obama who made peace more difficult. It was President Trump who made it more feasible again.\nThe outrageously one-sided Security Council Resolution declared that \"any changes to the 4 June 1967 lines, including with regard to Jerusalem,\" have \"no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.\" This means, among other things, that Israel's decision to build a plaza for prayer at the Western Wall \u2014 Judaism's holiest site \u2014 constitutes a \"flagrant violation of international law.\" This resolution was, therefore, not limited to settlements in the West Bank, as the Obama administration later claimed in a bait-and-switch. The resolution applied equally to the very heart of Israel.\nBefore June 4, 1967, Jews were forbidden from praying at the Western Wall. They were forbidden to attend classes at the Hebrew University at Mt. Scopus, which had been opened in 1925 and was supported by Albert Einstein. Jews could not seek medical care at the Hadassah Hospital on Mt. Scopus, which had treated Jews and Arabs alike since 1918. Jews could not live in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem, where their forebears had built homes and synagogues for thousands of years. These  Judenrein  prohibitions were enacted by Jordan, which had captured by military force these Jewish areas during Israel's War of Independence, in 1948, and had illegally occupied the entire West Bank, which the United Nations had set aside for an Arab state. When the Jordanian government occupied these historic Jewish sites, they destroyed all the remnants of Judaism, including synagogues, schools and cemeteries, whose headstones they used for urinals. Between 1948 and 1967, the United Nations did not offer a single resolution condemning this Jordanian occupation and cultural devastation.\nWhen Israel retook these areas in a defensive war that Jordan started by shelling civilian homes in West Jerusalem, and opened them up as places where Jews could pray, study, receive medical treatment and live, the United States took the official position that it would not recognize Israel's legitimate claims to Jewish Jerusalem.\nIt stated that the status of Jerusalem, including these newly liberated areas, would be left open to final negotiations and that the status quo would remain in place. That is the official rationale for why the United States refused to recognize any part of Jerusalem, including West Jerusalem, as part of Israel. That is why the United States refused to allow an American citizen born in any part of Jerusalem to put the words \"Jerusalem, Israel\" on his or her passport as their place of birth.\nBut even that historic status quo was changed with President Obama's unjustified decision not to veto the Security Council Resolution from last December. The United Nations all of a sudden determined that, subject to any further negotiations and agreements, the Jewish areas of Jerusalem recaptured from Jordan in 1967 are not part of Israel. Instead, they were territories being illegally occupied by Israel, and any building in these areas \u2014 including places for prayer at the Western Wall, access roads to Mt. Scopus, and synagogues in the historic Jewish Quarter \u2014 \"constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.\" If that indeed is the new status quo, then what incentives do the Palestinians have to enter negotiations? And if they were to do so, they could use these Jewish areas to extort unreasonable concessions from Israel, for which these now \"illegally occupied\" areas are sacred and nonnegotiable.\nPresident Obama's refusal to veto this one-sided resolution was a deliberate ploy to tie the hands of his successors, the consequence of which was to make it far more difficult for his successors to encourage the Palestinians to accept Israel's offer to negotiate with no preconditions. No future president can undo this pernicious agreement, since a veto  not  cast can never be retroactively cast. And a resolution once enacted cannot be rescinded unless there is a majority vote against it, with no veto by any of its permanent members, which include Russia and China, who would be sure to veto any attempt to undo this resolution.\nPresident Trump's decision to officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital helps to restore the appropriate balance. It demonstrates that the United States does not accept the  Judenrein  effects of this bigoted resolution on historic Jewish areas of Jerusalem, which were forbidden to Jews. The prior refusal of the United States to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital was based explicitly on the notion that nothing should be done to change the status quo of that city, holy to three religions. But the Security Council Resolution did exactly that: It changed the status quo by declaring Israel's de facto presence on these Jewish holy sites to be a \"flagrant violation under international law\" that \"the U.N. will not recognize.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump displays the signed \"Presidential Proclamation Recognizing Jerusalem as the Capital of the State of Israel and Relocating the United States Embassy to Israel to Jerusalem,\" on December 6, 2017, in Washington, D.C. (Image source: White House video screenshot) \nSince virtually everyone in the international community acknowledges that any reasonable peace would recognize Israel's legitimate claims to these and other areas in Jerusalem, there is no reason for allowing the U.N. Resolution to make criminals out of every Jew or Israeli who sets foot on these historically Jewish areas. (Ironically, President Obama prayed at what he regarded as the illegally occupied Western Wall.)\nAfter the UN, at the urging of President Obama, made it a continuing international crime for there to be any Israeli presence in disputed areas of Jerusalem, including areas whose Jewish provenance is beyond dispute, President Trump was right to untie his own hands and to undo the damage wrought by his predecessor. Some have argued that the United States should not recognize Jerusalem because it will stimulate violence by Arab terrorists. No American decision should ever be influenced by the threat of violence. Terrorists should not have a veto over American policy. If the United States were to give in to threats of violence, it would only incentivize others to threaten violence in response to any peace plan.\nSo let's praise President Trump for doing the right thing by undoing the wrong thing President Obama did at the end of his presidency.\nAlan M.

While in Salt Lake City on Monday, Trump is expected to announce he's shrinking the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Both are in Utah. Back in April, Trump asked Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to review roughly two dozen national monuments created by Bill Clinton, George W. Bush or Barack Obama. SEE MORE: 10 National Monuments Could Be Losing Certain Important Protections Obama designated Bears Ears before he left office, while Clinton designated Grand Staircase-Escalante in 1996.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) \nBy CARLA K. JOHNSONAP Medical Writer \nCHICAGO (AP) - Modern birth control pills that are lower in estrogen have fewer side effects than past oral contraceptives. But a large Danish study suggests that, like older pills, they still modestly raise the risk of breast cancer, especially with long-term use. \nResearchers found a similar breast cancer risk with the progestin-only intrauterine device, and they couldn't rule out a risk for other hormonal contraceptives like the patch and the implant. \nBut the overall increased risk was small, amounting to one extra case of breast cancer among 7,700 women using such contraceptives per year. Experts who reviewed the research say women should balance the news against known benefits of the pill - including lowering the risk of other cancers. \n\"Hormonal contraception should still be perceived as a safe and effective option for family planning,\" said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital, who was not involved in the research. \nWomen in their 40s may want to consider non-hormonal IUDs, getting their tubes tied or talking with their partners about vasectomy, Manson said. \nStudies of older birth control pills have shown \"a net cancer benefit\" because of lowered risk of cancer of the colon, uterus and ovaries despite a raised breast cancer risk, said Mia Gaudet, a breast cancer epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society. \nThere was optimism that newer, low-dose contraceptives would lower the breast cancer risk, but these results have dashed those hopes, said Gaudet, who wasn't involved in the research. \nAbout 140 million women use some type of hormonal contraception, including about 16 million in the United States. \nResearchers analyzed health records of 1.8 million women, ages 15 to 49, in Denmark where a national health care system allows linking up large databases of prescription histories, cancer diagnoses and other information. \nResults were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Novo Nordisk Foundation funded the research, but played no role in designing the study. The foundation has ties to the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, which primarily makes diabetes drugs and does not make contraceptives. \nCurrent and recent use of hormonal contraceptives was associated with a 20 percent increased risk of breast cancer. Risk increased with longer use, from a 9 percent increase in risk with less than a year of contraceptive use to a 38 percent increase after more than 10 years of use. \nDigging further, the researchers found no differences among types of birth control pills. Because of fewer users, the results for the patch, vaginal ring, implant and progestin shot were less clear, but the analysis didn't rule out an increased breast cancer risk for those methods. \n\"No type of hormone contraceptive is risk-free unfortunately,\" said lead author Lina Morch of Copenhagen University Hospital. \nResearchers accounted for education, childbirth and family history of breast cancer, but they weren't able to adjust for several other known cancer risk factors such as alcohol use and limited physical activity, or protective factors such as breast-feeding. \nWomen with a family history of breast cancer may want to ask their doctors about other contraceptives, said Dr. Roshni Rao, a breast surgeon at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. \n\"Oral contraceptives are like any other medication,\" Rao said. \"There are risks and there are benefits. If you have a reason to be taking them, it's perfectly reasonable to do so.\" \n___ \nFollow AP Medical Writer Carla K. Johnson on Twitter: @CarlaKJohnson Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

How did that work out for Africans? Coptic Christians? Native Americans? Reform is an idealist's game.\nNo not advertising, think. A nuclear family model encourages a small unit to have it's own home and income. That means more real estate purchases and less providers within each unit. Less capital per unit weakens the bargaining ability of the proletariat in labor market. It's also anti mutual aid as most forms of charity were family based. Malls and shopping centers emerged as a result of these units spreading across rural farmland (displacing less capital dependent farmers in the process) and the need to accommodate the many separate families' needs.\nYou're right that the nuclear family is disappearing. But the current trend is towards smaller and smaller affinity groups, ie families. Single parents are a capitalist dream.\nI love being a tranny desu\nWhy are those conditions so dismal? If they could choose to produce more locally relevant products instead of being forced to purchase them from others might their conditions improve? Would them being able to keep the profits of their labor in full not improve their lot?

Lindop has explained why she is riding for Victoria in the Origin Jockey Series in Queensland.\nChampion jockey Clare Lindop can understand why people are surprised she is representing Victoria in the annual Origin Jockey Series this weekend.\nLindop will join Luke Nolen to ride for Victoria against jockeys from six other teams at Doomben on Friday and Saturday and Caloundra on Sunday.\nShe was among the jockeys at a series launch in Brisbane on Thursday.\nLindop has ridden 1409 winners including a Victoria Derby on Rebel Raider and a Magic Millions Classic on Augusta Proud.\nShe has also been a dominant force in South Australian racing for more than a decade where she is a multiple Adelaide premiership winner.\n\"Yes, I can see why people would be confused I am riding for Victoria,\" she said.\n\"But I actually started my career in Victoria as I am a Warrnambool girl and rode there for six or seven years before going to South Australia.\n\"I have ridden all around Australia and I have had some success in Queensland at the Gold Coast on Augusta Proud.\n\"It is a great chance to ride a winner at Doomben and also Caloundra where I have never ridden before.\"\nLindop has a huge wrap on Jamie Kah who will be riding for South Australia in the Origin series.\nKah, turned 22 on Thursday, but missed the launch because she was riding at the Gold Coast barrier trials.\n\"I think you will see something special in Jamie as she really is riding very well,\" Lindop said.\nKah is expected to do the riding for Tony McEvoy during the later part of the Brisbane summer series.\nDwayne Dunn, who is the other South Australian rider in the series, agrees Kah is a future superstar.\n\"Jamie has real talent and you are in for a treat watching her ride,\" he said.\nKah wasn't the only visiting jockey to miss the launch but New Zealand hoop Mark Du Plessis had an unusual reason.\nDu Plessis got a cab to the launch but the hotel receptionist gave the driver the wrong address and he was halfway to the Gold Coast before realising the mistake.\nAAP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

I was defence secretary for almost three years. I am a huge advocate for our armed forces,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThere is no question of the defence budget being cut. The defence budget is being increased but I recognise also the defence is facing some pressures, particularly around currency movement. A lot of defence procurement is denominated in US dollars. \n\u201cI expect that once he has had a chance to understand the situation in the Ministry of Defence and to get his head around the defence budget, the new Defence Secretary will be wanting to come and talk to me and he will find no one more sympathetic to the challenges of defence than me.\u201d Philip Hammond (Matt Dunham/PA) \nIt is understood that Mr Hammond used BAe 146 jets and A109 helicopters to fly to more than 20 destinations this year on official business, including Manchester, Leeds, Wolverhampton, Dudley, Aberdeen, Paris, Brussels and Frankfurt. \nPrime Minister Theresa May\u2019s official spokesman told reporters: \u201cMy understanding is the Chancellor used a Government jet yesterday. \n\u201cI gather there is an administrative discussion going on. This matter is being resolved.\u201d \nA Downing Street source said the issue had not been raised with Number 10, but was \u201cbeing sorted out between the two departments\u201d. \nA spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cThe Government\u2019s problems and the Cabinet\u2019s problems are multifarious. \n\u201cThis is a Government in a shambles on both the most important issues facing the country and the more minor ones, and I would suggest that this is one of those. \n\u201cI\u2019m sure we would be in favour of the Treasury paying its bill.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hammond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy corbyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt dunham/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dudley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vin williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stefan rousseau/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip hammond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "defence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commons treasury committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the times of london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal squadron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of defence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabinet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new defence", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankfurt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wolverhampton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:28.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "638288209d0e0c1d0fdc36d1b4cfb2bb5dc46586", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzLw3sBYTG6I4n9vErUEDRaRa8gxwrBYBz.HVySPu_zG.WphYA4zsEjpb8_rRmWDnUmncsHr8_21MKryPszJMHy6aZlGyE9Vfc-", "site_full": "forum.accurateshooter.com", "site": "accurateshooter.com", "site_section": "http://forum.accurateshooter.com/forums/tools-dies-rests-reloading-components-misc.11/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Tools, Dies, Rests, Reloading Components &amp; Misc | Shooters' Forum", "title": "\"Selling\" 7.62 M118LR Brass", "title_full": "\"Selling\" 7.62 M118LR Brass | Shooters' Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T19:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forum.accurateshooter.com/styles/accurate/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 66571, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "638288209d0e0c1d0fdc36d1b4cfb2bb5dc46586", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzLw3sBYTG6I4n9vErUEDRaRa8gxwrBYBz.HVySPu_zG.WphYA4zsEjpb8_rRmWDnUmncsHr8_21MKryPszJMHy6aZlGyE9Vfc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dixiecricket", "published": "2017-12-06T19:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Selling\" 7.62 M118LR Brass", "text": "Bump.

What Makes The German Commerce? \nWith Germany being considered by the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the biggest exporter of goods worldwide, it is no longer surprising why the German Stock Exchange is one of the most important stock exchanges that make or break global commerce. Companies like DK MSCI US LC enjoy to be the part of German stock exchange. German Stock Exchange \nThe German Stock Exchange consists of eight stock exchanges located throughout Germany. DK MSCI US LC were included in one of its units as well. The biggest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the FWB Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse, which is owned and operated by Deutsche B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt. These companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange alone represent 80% of the overall market capitalization in Germany. The second largest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Stuttgart Stock Exchange or the B\u00f6rse Stuttgart. Most financial companies are listed here. \nOther major components of the German Stock Exchange include the B\u00f6rse Berlin-Bremen, the B\u00d6AG B\u00f6rsen AG, and the Hamburg Stock Exchange or the Hamburger B\u00f6rse. \nThe B\u00f6rse Berlin-Bremen, which is located in Berlin-Charlottenburg, was established in 2003 from the union of the Berlin Stock Exchange and the B\u00f6rse Bremen. \nMeanwhile, the B\u00d6AG B\u00f6rsen AG, which oversees trade in Hamburg and Hanover, was established in 1999 from the union of the Hamburg Stock Exchange and the Hanover Stock Exchange. Benchmark Index \nThe major index on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is the German Stock Index, commonly known as Deutsche Aktien Xchange 30 (DAX 30), which is the benchmark equity market index in the country. \nDAX 30 tracks the top 30 companies in terms of market capitalization listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Consequently, DAX 30 is a vital indicator of the health of the German economy and investor sentiment as well. Many investors are interested in such DAX companies as DK MSCI US LC. \nThe companies tracked by DAX 30 are capped at 10% weight in order to meet its provisions. This also prevents index heavyweight that might result from mergers and acquisitions (M&As). \nDAX 30 has two versions: 1) performance index, which is usually quoted; and 2) price index, which is similar to indices quoted in other countries. \nThe index has a base value of 1,000 since December 1987. DAX 30 indices are calculated using XETRA since June 1999. Since 2006, they are being calculated after every second. \nThe movement on DAX 30 is in 0.50 increments. The margin requirement among most brokers is 2% while the minimum trade size is one index. \nDAX 30 had its longest period of glory days around 2003 to 2007. During that time, it had peaked at \u20ac8,105.69. However, after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, DAX 30 had hit \u20ac3,580. \nBeing able to fully recover from the repercussions of the turmoil in the earlier decade, DAX 30 had recorded its all-time high in September 2013 at \u20ac8,736. \nThe performance index, on the other hand, had hit the 12,000 mark in March 2015. DAX 30 had attained its all-time high a month later at 12,374.73 after reaching an intraday high of 12,390.75. Its all-time low had been posted in November 1974 at 372.30. \nBecause of the world-renowned success of the DAX 30, more and more investors are betting on the German equity market.

He again was asking some questions and telling me about what he had been doing and what his week looked like. He was a bit more cold and distant than usual though so at the end of the conversation I let him know I could leave him alone from now on, to which he responded \"I think I could use a break from talking for a bit.\" I tried to clarify why and he just responded \"Sometimes people need space.\" Which is kind of the rudest response I've ever gotten from him ever. I guess I don't know why he's become more cold and shut off toward me.\nI don't know if it's because at first I ignored his first attempts to reach out and when I finally did respond a month later after his concern of my snap story I eventually stopped responding. He started another conversation a few days later and we actually went back and forth in asking questions and stuff, and I ended the conversation as I was going out. From then on it has been me initiating contact via snapchat or text. He was pretty talkative during those next conversations asking how I had been and whatnot and sending lengthy texts about stuff going on with him. Asked him about a burger he got at this one place we went because I was going the next night and wanted to try it and he asked me to let him know how I liked it and I didn't. So that was my fault. But at the end of that conversation we were joking around and flirting about something that happened when we were together once.\nLater on he found out I was in the hospital for surgery and we had a conversation about that and about how I got my xbox and he wanted my name so we could play. Ended up falling asleep so not responding to the last text in that conversation. The next time we talked the fact that I was casually seeing someone else came up, and that's when he started ending conversations by not responding to texts. He asked about my surgery and I told him and mentioned the other guy and then he asked what the timeline for my next few days looked like and then never responded again. Then the next day I had asked why he wanted to know what my timeline was and he said it was because he was curious about what the recovery time was and asked how I was feeling. Again we went back and forth and joked around a bit but the conversation ended with him not responding. I then wished him a happy thanksgiving a few days later and again he stopped responding. I asked about seeing him and that's what lead to the post above.\nI guess I don't know why it's like this. I figured he'd be fine since he broke up with me, we had a month of no contact in which I assumed he'd get over it, and since he's in contact and friendly with his other exes (there are only two of them, one of which treated him like crap and played him for everything he was worth), and has always said he'd want to be friends, I figured I'd try. I don't know why he's gone more cold and distant even though we have been talking fine and why he doesn't want to meet and needs space. He seems to feel negatively about me right now and I have no clue what I've done or why.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:28.078+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f80350ebe9605669bd2d8cb38127fe1d5ad5f635", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQgu07tTT3wff6axExzIeu_DXRorfRt1OZxFsCgftqKzAAPGvQtJMxX", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual?page=3", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 3", "title": "HMV Premium Blu Rays - 2 for \u00a315", "title_full": "HMV Premium Blu Rays - 2 for \u00a315 - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-04T21:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.615, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2847618_2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "73224552bebf12f14a7c785f22f649a9cf7a6a66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQgu07tTT3wff6axExzIeu_DXRorfRt1OZxFsCgftqKzOZTl_.3kwxAWdbRi39FFqxodPiq9KpYhw--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "webhose.io", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thanks, I have been waiting for this.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:28.086+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2481635da375e5e85cd7a5517559ea00a5a06b6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.IruvvdNA6s7JQcjzwI4k2K7nEVZX10RVRmj.fkVsiyHfwbn7fW8BPlpOXkCSWPMLcmC46sci.FIKNns60iXy4u7D1Za2ZYRKoCPvsG2k5d315y6djhZWYcVAL0wCKybvezmre9Fti_r8Gcg9sU2K_", "site_full": "www.loveshack.org", "site": "loveshack.org", "site_section": "http://www.loveshack.org/forums/breaking-up-reconciliation-coping/second-chances/", "site_categories": ["dating", "marriage", "social"], "section_title": "Second Chances - LoveShack.org Community Forums", "title": "Weird response to trying to meet up", "title_full": "Weird response to trying to meet up - LoveShack.org Community Forums", "published": "2017-11-24T14:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 66290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "444fa516cf36e9759017c653395a8538c760fe41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.IruvvdNA6s7JQcjzwI4k2K7nEVZX10RVRmj.fkVsiyHfwbn7fW8BPlpOXkCSWPMLcmC46sci.FIKNns60iXy4u7D1Za2ZYRKoCPvsG2k5d315y6djhZWYcVAL0wCKybvezmre9Fti_kTAgf3vvKA6YUKI_ZSgEPvxfodh92KLVQ--", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "marky00", "published": "2017-11-28T19:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Sorry OP.\nIt's pretty obvious to me.\nHe isn't invested in this thing as much as you are.

At my job even if someone's been doing it for 20 years and me 2, if we are the same rank they don't have any actual power over me, and sometimes they are even LOWER than me and I literally have the power to boss them around, but I don't really like to act like that. However, they see me as a young kid even though I'm 29, partially due to my physical appearance but I'm not going into that right now. The point - this stupid NUN, literally I mean this, a NUN, who works where I work, has tried to BOSS ME AROUND and act like I don't have the authority to say what I say when I say it, when I do have that authority and training and qualifications, and she absolutely and clearly does not, but for some reason she is incapable of understanding this. Why?\nBecause you don't actually need a power apparatus for people to do that. Literally, everyone could be 100% legally equal and everything else like that, and people will still -CREATE- such situations, and not every time will there be a pissed off faggot getting a nun in trouble with the boss because not everyone can be that strong.\nNot everyone can be strong enough, WHEN THEY HAVE AUTHORITY, to speak up when someone who DOESNT tries to act like they do, because that's conflict and conflict is hard, especially when the other person is extremely stubborn and refuses to view anything coming out of your mouth as valid. It really makes it hard.\nSo please, maybe this worked to help you understand my views a bit better. The main point of this post is to say:\nIt literally doesn't matter if you have destroyed every single power apparatus.

I told them that I would be visiting on my own so I was quite worried about taking care of myself. As soon as they knew this, they were quite persistent in asking where I was from, if I was an overseas Korean or a foreigner, if I was from China, where I found out about them, etc. I told them that their BA pictures looked promising so I really just wanted to know the price but they kept on pushing for my replies. I eventually stopped replying and I kept getting messages on if I was still interested in coming. Idk, just thought this would be something for some others to consider.\nI did come to Korea but ended up having my chin lipo at Beautyline Plastic Surgery. Although it's only been a month, I can see the difference already! It's still a bit sore if I look up too quickly, but the compression band really helps. I'm excited to see the maximum results from the third month onward ^_^ Click to expand... Hi Teeteetee!

I haven\u0092t done anything out of the ordinary. I guess I\u0092m just confused and questioning what\u0092s going on. Did I do something?\nI want to stay friends and now I\u0092m worried I won\u0092t ever hear from him again.\nWhy is this happening? Because there are unresolved feelings on his behalf? He doesn\u0092t want anything to do with me? I don\u0092t get it. He\u0092s friends with all his other exes. First it's a good thing to tell your mutual friends to stop telling you things about him. I also believe that he saw your mutual friend and believed that you moved on without him and it probably got to his feelings. That's none of your concern anymore because he broke it off with you. Use this as an opportunity to move on with your life and heal!

Donald J. Trump \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc. Show Caption Next \nPresident Donald Trump fully endorsed Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore on Twitter Monday morning. \nTrump had hesitated to throw his full support behind the embattled Republican candidate in the wake of explosive accusations against him. His tweet Monday comes as recent polls show a close race. \n\"Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama,\" Trump tweeted . \"We need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones, a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!\" \nLast month, The Washington Post published a bombshell report on allegations based on interviews with more than 30 people. One woman alleged she was 14 years old when Moore initiated sexual contact with her. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16. After the report, another woman came forward to accuse Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was 16. Moore vehemently denies the allegations. \nTrump all but endorsed Moore last month, when he defended the candidate following his denials. \n\"He denies it. Look, he denies it,\" Trump said of Moore. \"If you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours. He totally denies it. He says it didn't happen.
