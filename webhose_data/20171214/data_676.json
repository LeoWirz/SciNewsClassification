We came here when our job was done in the Champions League. Now we are going to see how we react on Sunday. But I saw how we reacted after we went 2-0 down here and we passed it well. The world will not finish on Sunday no matter happens and now we will prepare for that game. \u201c \nSergio Aguero netted a consolation penalty in stoppage time, but the Sky Blues were largely outplayed by the hosts at the Metalist Stadium, with Bernard putting Shakhtar ahead after 26 minutes before Ismaily netted the second just after the half-hour. \nGuardiola fielded a much-changed side, which included 20-year-old Tosin Adarabioyo and 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup winner Phil Foden. \nFor City, it was an ideal game in which to suffer a first defeat of the season given its lack of importance. \nB/R Football @brfootball The last time Manchester City lost a competitive game (April 23): \n\u2014Ronaldo had one kid \u2014America was optimistic about the World Cup \u2014Chris Pratt and Anna Faris were still together https://t.co/dB0MSjuE0p \n2017-12-6 22:50:24 \nBut it did not come at an ideal time, with the derby looming on Sunday. \nUnited will likely take confidence from the fact City were finally defeated on Wednesday and also that Guardiola\u2019s men have required late goals to earn 2-1 wins in each of their preceding three Premier League games. \nJose Mourinho\u2019s side sit second in the league, eight points back from table-topping City. \nMany people will believe the Premier League title race will all but over if United lose. \nBut a victory for the hosts at Old Trafford would not only move United closer to City in the league but could interrupt the Sky Blues\u2019 momentum heading into the crucial, and busy, Christmas period. \nBreaking Sports News \nvia Bleacher Report \u2013 Front Page http://ift.tt/yO6Sgr \nDecember 7, 2017 at 01:36AM Advertisements", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pep guardiola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronaldo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose mourinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tosin adarabioyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergio aguero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ismaily", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phil foden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guardiola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris pratt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna faris", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pep guardiola after shakhtar donetsk defeat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "champions league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uefa champions league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sky blues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premier league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "metalist stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakhtar donetsk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old trafford", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:28.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aadb5dd5e65209ec6ecf00528dc05b2ba6caf0b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb.m7ahFGfJ7BAdiiZGK3p4K0YNkh1FMzLqI5idf2MQKF6uZTlNRyXx18nb50yfwFbZKGT7fMUzKWaN5Om1Kq.pC", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9830315) Trump's global credibility is shot.

Couples who intend to marry must give a calendar-month notice, making gay weddings legal on Jan. 9, Turnbull said.\nNeville Wills, 98, plans to marry his partner of 39 years, Ian Fenwicke, 74, next month.\nNow Playing: Australian Member of Parliament Tim Wilson proposed to his longtime partner, Ryan Bolger, right after the Australian House of Representatives began debating the same-sex marriage bill on Dec. 4.\nMedia: Mic ALSO Why this photo of two politicians from opposite sides hugging says so much about Australia's same-sex marriage debate Some practical reasons to marry become pressing with age. Relatives have contested wills that left estates to same-sex partners, and gays and lesbians want rights to access and medical consultation when a partner is hospitalized.\n\"The reason is to have a legal relationship that's not in any way challenged \u2014 and, of course, we love each other,\" Wills said. \"We'll get the legal relationship straightened out in January. Call it a wedding if you like, I'm not romantic,\" he added.\nTurnbull described Parliament voting late Thursday for gay marriage, with only four lawmakers registering their opposition, as a historic moment.\n\"Containing my emotions to a suitable, prime ministerial level of calm is quite challenging. I am absolutely pumped. I think this is so wonderful,\" he said after Parliament passed the bill and the public gallery erupted with a standing ovation.\nCelebrations continued late into the night in Oxford Street, the center of Sydney's gay nightlife which is in Turnbull's electorate.\nTurnbull has been a long-term advocate for marriage equality and is the first prime minister to attend Sydney's renowned annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, which is also in his electorate.\nHours after Parliament's action, a Sydney municipal council offered free venues to host same-sex marriages.\nThe Inner West Council is accepting bookings for same-sex marriages in its halls, community centers and parks at no charge over a 100-day period from Jan. 7.\n\"This is an historic day in the struggle for civil rights in Australia,\" Mayor Darcy Byrne said.\nIt follows the downtown Sydney municipality's decision in October to offer free venues for same-sex weddings should they become lawful.\nThe Australian Capital Territory government, which administers Canberra, the national capital, introduced its own same-sex marriage law in 2013 that was overturned by the High Court within a week.\nACT Attorney General Gordon Ramsay said his government would waive the 55 Australian dollar ($41) cost of wedding certificate for any of the 31 same-sex couples whose short-lived marriages were ruled invalid and want to marry again.\n\"It's a way of being able to acknowledge the difficulties that some of those couples have been through,\" Ramsay told Australian Broadcasting Corp.\nAnne-Marie Delahunt, who married her partner Meg Clark in Canberra in 2013, said she would take up the government's offer when they marry again in February.\n\"I think it was a touching measure from the ACT Government to say that our second marriage certificate will be free,\" Delahunt told ABC.\nGay marriage was endorsed by 62 percent of voters who responded to a national postal ballot by November.\nMost gay rights advocates believed the government should have allowed marriages years ago and saw various ideas for a public survey as a delaying tactic. The U.N.

(PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nSTARKART , the largest grocery cart advertising company in the U.S. and Canada, recently posted its original creative design entries for the CokexAdobexYou campaign to its Twitter and Instagram accounts, with the #cokexadobexyou hashtag. The CokexAdobexYou campaign is a benefit for the Special Olympics . \nSTARKART graphic designers, Pete Ibarra and Dennis Viloria, created special designs for the campaign, along with digital artists from around the world. To celebrate the creative community, Coca-Cola will make a one-time contribution of $35,000 to Special Olympics. \n\u201cI relate to being an adolescent that craves to be inspired and wants to win. The Special Olympics youth deserve to have the chance to be exposed to great opportunities,\u201d said Ibarra, the graphic designer responsible for spearheading the STARKART team\u2019s submissions for CokexAdobexYou . \nAdded Viloria, \u201cMy design features a swimmer for sports, as I love water sports.

Ms. Roost\u2019s parents brought home Angelle as a baby, but decided not to keep her. By John Eligon Dec. 7, 2017 This article is part of the Race/Related newsletter. You can sign up here to have it delivered weekly to your inbox. She grew up a tomboy in suburban Chicago, a fan of Hot Wheels, baseball cards and Blackhawks hockey. So when her two brothers tossed a football in the family\u2019s half-acre backyard one day, Amy insisted on playing. They said no, she begged, and one of them whipped the ball at her so hard that it sent her to the ground in tears. \u201cOur other sister was a real girl,\u201d one of the boys blurted out. The comment left Amy, about 8 at the time, dumbfounded. There was no other sister, or so she thought. She raced inside, found her mother smoking at the kitchen table, and told her what her brother Bobby had said. \u201cIs it true that you had a daughter before me?\u201d asked Amy, who, like her brothers, was adopted at birth. Marge Sandberg slowly blotted out her cigarette in an ashtray. \u201cListen carefully,\u201d Amy recalled her mother saying, \u201cbecause I\u2019m only going to tell you this story once.\u201d It was around 1970 in Deerfield, Ill., and Ms. Sandberg told her youngest child a closely guarded secret about a choice the family had made, one fueled by the racial tensions of the era, that sent a black girl and the white girl that took her place on diverging paths. Decades later, the journeys of the two women tell a nuanced story of race in America, one that complicates easy assumptions about white privilege and black hardship. Lives take unexpected twists and turns, this family story suggests, no matter the race of those involved. And years later, it is not easy to figure out the role of race when looking for lessons learned. It all started in 1959 when a developer bought a plot of land in Deerfield to build 51 homes. He said he would sell a dozen of them to black people. This small community about 30 miles north of Chicago had spent years growing in the image of mid-20th-century suburban America: tract housing, green lawns and a population that was virtually all white. Deerfield residents made it clear that they wanted to protect the racial order. Vandals struck two houses under construction. Someone burned a cross on the lawn of a resident who supported the development. A local pastor who advocated the housing received an anonymous letter that called him a vicious racial slur and told him to \u201clet your children marry one of them and present you with a nice dark brown grandson or daughter,\u201d The New York Times reported on April 17, 1960. Among those who wanted to see the housing built were Marge Sandberg and her husband, Len, who had moved to Deerfield with their two adopted sons in the mid-1950s. As a Jew, Mr. Sandberg said he had always had sympathy for persecuted minority groups. Ms. Sandberg joined a local group that supported the development. But the efforts to get the homes built were unsuccessful; the city ultimately seized the land from the developer and built a park. While the talk of the town was about the housing development, the Sandbergs were talking about expanding their family. They wanted a daughter. And so they hired a lawyer, who found a woman looking to put up her newborn girl for adoption. The baby, whom they planned to name Rebecca, was born on April 19, 1962, and when she arrived at the Sandberg house days later, what they saw surprised them. She was black. Immediately, Mr. Sandberg said, he thought of the burning crosses and racist taunts, the upheaval in their community over the prospect of black people moving in. Interracial adoptions were far less common then. \u201cI said at that point that I wasn\u2019t going to go forward with it,\u201d Mr. Sandberg, now 89, recalled.

Credit Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times His wife protested vigorously. She cried. She called on a pastor at the Unitarian church they attended to try to convince him to change his mind. Mr. Sandberg would not budge. \u201cI thought, \u2018My God, how are you going to raise a child in this neighborhood with the way people are feeling about this thing?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Sandberg, the owner of a prosperous manufacturing company. \u201cIt just wouldn\u2019t have been great for her.\u201d The Sandbergs returned the child. A few months later, they adopted a newborn white girl and named her Amy. Even as the Sandbergs moved on, the impact of what they did lingered. Ms. Sandberg, who died of cancer in 1997, kept journal entries saying she thought about the girl every April, the month she was born. The Sandbergs eventually separated and divorced. The family almost never talked about what had happened. But the white daughter they kept, Amy, who is now married and goes by the last name Roost, began thinking about the family secret again in 2012, after Trayvon Martin , a black teenager, was killed by a neighborhood watchman in Florida, setting off a national conversation about racial disparities in America. Ms. Roost wondered if the girl her parents had sent back had ended up on the short end of the country\u2019s racial divide. Ms. Roost, now 55, had graduated from George Washington University with a degree in political science, and worked as a press aide on Capitol Hill, as a university administrator, and as a grant writer for nonprofit organizations. She became a freelance journalist, and, using her reporting skills, set out to find the woman her parents had given up. Ms. Roost documented this search for a story that will air on WNYC\u2019s Snap Judgment podcast. Ms. Roost dug through Illinois adoption and birth records and searched the internet, eventually finding the woman: Angelle Kimberly Smith. It was 2015, and Ms. Roost called Ms. Smith, nervous about what she might say. The conversation did not go as Ms. Roost had imagined. \u201cShe was really, really cool about it,\u201d Ms. Roost said. That\u2019s because after the Sandbergs had given her up, Ms. Smith had landed with a loving couple, Harry and Ruth Smith, who were black. Her father ran a stationery store. He also was heavily involved in an underground lottery, with tentacles that extended into the city\u2019s political and organized crime worlds, she said. Her mother was a homemaker. Her upbringing, Ms. Smith said, was comfortable and loving in a solid, black middle-class neighborhood on Chicago\u2019s South Side. She attended a private grammar school. But tragedy struck when Harry Smith died of a heart attack when his daughter was just 8. Ms. Smith and her mother endured. Her mother ran the stationery store, she said, and neighbors treated them like family. \u201cI was raised by people that really loved me and really wanted me,\u201d said Ms. Smith, now 55. As she entered adulthood, Ms. Smith moved to Los Angeles, lured by the prospect of a glamorous life. Instead, she found trouble. In spite of her stable home life, Ms. Smith said she was sucked into freewheeling circles in which drugs were common. She became addicted to cocaine, she said, and became homeless and was incarcerated for burglary. She had four children, two of them while living on the streets, and lost custody of all of them. Ms. Smith eventually pulled her life back together. She earned an associate degree, started working on bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees online and worked as a counselor. By 2007, all of her children were back in her life. She wanted to learn more about who she was, so she searched for her biological parents, listed as Neal Gordon and Juanita Green on her birth certificate, but never found them. But life had taken so many twists and turns that by the time she heard from Ms. Roost, she felt she could handle anything. She greeted the news that she had been given up by a white family by telling Ms. Roost that she held no hard feelings, and would not have wanted to be raised by white parents in a white neighborhood. Image Ms. Roost, left, and Ms. Smith now. Credit Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times Over time, the two women built a relationship, discussing the good and the bad places that life had taken them. They talked openly about whether they had traveled stereotypical racial trajectories \u2014 the white girl soaring to success with the support of a wealthy, white family; the black girl struggling in despair. That jaded narrative, it turned out, was far from the reality. Ms. Smith wondered whether she actually would have been worse off had the Sandbergs kept her. The way she saw it, Ms. Smith said, race never felt like much of a determining factor in her life. She went to school with white children and enjoyed some of the same benefits as white people, from her education to her family\u2019s vacation home. She felt lucky to have grown up in a predominantly black neighborhood, rather than in Deerfield, where she said she likely would have faced discrimination. \u201cThere were no people of color in that community at all,\u201d Ms. Smith said, adding that \u201cwhen white people have to deal with black people, I think, there\u2019s a misperception of who we are, what we stand for.\u201d When Ms. Roost learned what Ms. Smith had gone through as an adult \u2014 hustling to make ends meet, living in Los Angeles\u2019s once notorious MacArthur Park \u2014 she could not help but think of how different her own life had turned out and how her parents\u2019 racially motivated decision might have impacted both of them. As she contrasted her life with Ms. Smith\u2019s, Ms. Roost said she believed that without having to face racism, her family was able to do well financially, allowing her to get a college education and stable jobs. It felt like white privilege, she said. Yet she also realized that her assumptions about Ms. Smith\u2019s life did not fully ring true. \u201cWhen I found out she had been adopted by a black family, I assumed her life probably wasn\u2019t as good as mine,\u201d Ms. Roost said. But Ms. Roost has endured her own tumultuous times, despite enjoying the overseas vacations and luxe Christmas parties that her family\u2019s wealth afforded her. A family member sexually assaulted her. With her parents divorced by the time she was 10, her relationship with her father grew distant and her mother\u2019s alcoholism complicated their relationship. \u201cYou can look at it and think, \u2018Oh, the white child probably had the better childhood in this ritzy, tony suburb,\u2019\u201d Ms. Roost said. \u201cBut then again, peel it back a layer and you\u2019ll see it was a horrible childhood.\u201d Had she experienced Ms. Roost\u2019s childhood, Ms. Smith said, she very well might have slid into drug addiction more quickly. Those possibilities, however, are of little consolation to Mr. Sandberg, the man who refused to keep a girl because of the color of her skin. \u201cIt was a tough decision and I did feel guilty,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed of myself. I don\u2019t know whether I made the right decision or the wrong decision. As I look now, in this day and age, I feel that I was wrong.\u201d When he met Ms. Smith two years ago for the first and only time at a restaurant in La Jolla, Calif., she ran toward him and they embraced. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d Ms. Smith recalled whispering in his ear. He asked why she was thanking him. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve battled with this through the years, but you did the right thing,\u2019\u201d Ms. Smith recalled telling him, adding that he seemed visibly relieved. \u201cI watched 50 years worth of guilt and shame roll off of him.\u201d Are you a parent or child in a transracial adoption?

But for all of the attention such incidents have attracted in recent years, many organisations worldwide still struggle to comprehend and manage emerging cyber risks in an increasingly complex digital society. \nPwC launched its 2018 Global State of Information Security\u00ae Survey (GSISS), based on responses of more than 9,500 senior business and technology executives from 122 countries. \nAccording to the survey, executives worldwide acknowledge the increasingly high stakes of cyber insecurity. Forty percent of survey respondents cite the disruption of operations as the biggest consequence of a cyberattack, 39% cite the compromise of sensitive data, 32% cite harm to product quality, and 22% cite harm to human life. \nYet despite this awareness, many companies at risk of cyberattacks remain unprepared to deal with them. Forty-four percent say they do not have an overall information security strategy. Forty-eight percent say they do not have an employee security awareness training programme, and 54% say they do not have an incident-response process. \nCyber interdependence drives global risk \nCase studies of non-cyber disasters have shown that cascading events often begin with the loss of power-due to which many systems are impacted instantaneously or within one day, meaning there is generally precious little time to address the initial problem before it cascades. Many people worldwide-particularly in Japan, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and South Korea-are concerned about cyberattacks from other countries whilst the tools for conducting cyberattacks are proliferating worldwide. It\u2019s also worth noting that the leaking of US National Security Agency (NSA) hacking tools has made highly sophisticated capabilities available to malicious hackers. \nIn May 2017, G-7 leaders pledged to work together and with other partners to tackle cyberattacks and mitigate their impact on critical infrastructure and society. Two months later, G-20 leaders reiterated the need for cybersecurity and trust in digital technologies. The task ahead is huge, since rising threats to data integrity could undermine trusted systems and cause physical harm by damaging critical infrastructure. \nNext steps for business leaders \nSo what can business leaders do to prepare effectively for cyberattacks? PwC recommends three key areas of focus: \nRole of senior executives and boards of directors: Senior leaders must take ownership of building cyber resilience. Setting a top-down strategy to manage cyber and privacy risks across the enterprise is essential. \nResilience not merely to avoid risk: Achieving greater risk resilience is a pathway to stronger, long-term economic performance. \nPurposefully collaborate and leverage lessons learned: Industry and government leaders must work across organisational, sectoral and national borders to identify, map, and test cyber-dependency and interconnectivity risks as well as surge resilience and risk-management.

He grew out his hair and his beard and wore the shortened trousers required by the extremists. He forced himself to witness the beheadings and deaths by stoning, so he could hear killers call out the names of the condemned and their supposed crimes.\nBy night, he was Mosul Eye, and from his darkened room he told the world what was happening. If caught, he knew he would be killed. Associated Press For more than three years, he has been known only as Mosul Eye, an anonymous blogger documenting Islamic State\u2019s atrocities. Now Iraq's Omar Mohammed, in Europe on Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2017, wants the world _ and his family _ to know his identity. \nBut over three years, his double life grew too heavy to bear. His secrets consumed him, sapping the energy he needed to work on his doctoral dissertation and to help Mosul rebuild. In face-to-face conversations with AP reporters over the course of two months, he agonized over how to end the anonymity.\nThe day he revealed his identity to the world, Mohammed told AP: \"I feel free.\"\nHe received scores of media requests, and on Facebook and Twitter, his fans poured out their feelings.\nTahani Saleh posted on Facebook: \"When death was sweeping over us, you said: We are the life. I am very proud of you, Omar.\"\nBella Oskar, a member of the \"Women of Mosul\" Facebook group, wrote, \"I used to read what you posted on Mosul and your love for it and for its people. The voice of Mosul reached the world by the son of Mosul.\"\nMohammed decided to reveal his identity for his thousands of readers and followers, for all his volunteers in Mosul who have been inspired by a man they have never seen. But above all, he did it in memory of his older brother, who died in the final battle for the Iraqi city, and for his grieving mother.\n\"I can't be anonymous anymore. This is to say that I defeated ISIS. You can see me now, and you can know me now,\" he told AP.\nMohammed first posted about the Islamic State group under his own Facebook account, in the first few days after its fighters swept into the city, but a friend warned him he risked being killed. A newly minted teacher with a reputation for secular ideas, he lost his university job when IS took over.\nOn June 18, 2014, he became Mosul Eye. His motto: Trust no one, document everything.\n\"My job as a historian requires an unbiased approach which I am going to adhere to and keep my personal opinion to myself,\" he wrote on that first day.\nMosul Eye became one of the outside world's main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself.\nMuch of what he collected went on the blog. Other details he kept in his computer, for fear of blowing his cover. Someday, he promised, he would write history with them.\nMohammed's information sometimes included photos of the fighters and commanders, complete with biographies surreptitiously pieced together during the course of his normal life \u2014 that of an out-of-work scholar living at home.\nWhen intelligence agencies made contact with Mosul Eye, he rebuffed them.\n\"I am not a spy or a journalist,\" he would say. \"I tell them this: If you want the information, it's published and it's public for free. Take it.\"\nHis computer hard drive filled with death, filed according to date, cause of death, perpetrator, neighborhood and ethnicity. Accompanying each spreadsheet entry was a separate file with observations from each day.\n\"IS is forcing abortions and tubal ligation surgeries on Yazidi women,\" he wrote in unpublished notes from January 2015. A doctor told him there had been between 50 and 60 forced abortions and a dozen Yazidi girls younger than 15 died of injuries from repeated rapes.\nApril 19, 2015: \"The forensics department received the bodies of 23 IS militants killed in Baiji. They had no shrapnel, no bullets, no explosives and the cause of death does not seem to be explosion. It is like nothing happened to the bodies. A medical source believes they were exposed to poison gas.\"\nJuly 7, 2015: \"43 citizens were executed in different places, this time by gunfire, which is unusual because they were previously beheadings. A source inside IS said that 13 of those who were executed are fighters and they tried to flee.\"\nFinally, he decided it was time to get out. On Dec. 15, 2015, he left with a smuggler whom he paid $1,000. Overnight, Mohammed had transferred the contents of his computer to a hard-drive that he packed with him.\nOnce in Europe, Mosul Eye kept at his mission: via WhatsApp and Viber, from Facebook messages and long conversations with friends and relatives who had contacts within IS.\nBy mid-2016, deaths were piling up faster than he could record.

The French fashion collective is recruiting local graffiti artists to do custom work on army jackets at the shop and on the first weekend even enlisted Parsons School of Design students to do some on-the-spot embroideries \nFaith Connexion is a global brand with hundreds of points of sale, but the way it goes about its business is distinctly unconventional and non-corporate, which burnishes its appeal with the young people who respond to the look of its clothes. \n The Faith Connexion aesthetic exalts the DIY, with a side dish of French savoir faire. If its DIY feels more legit than that of most other brands, it\u2019s because FC engages in so many collaborations with young designers and artists. The doodled-on jean jackets are the work of NTMB, a collective from Naples, Italy, whose initials stand for Never Too Much Basics, and the cool tie-dye-effect jeans are the creation of the 20-something Austin Blaisdell, who\u2019s made a habit of bleaching clothes on a sunbaked Los Angeles rooftop.\n\nFC\u2019s new Spring collection relied heavily on a nude couple depicted in silhouette, the kind that you used to see on the hubcaps of unevolved truck drivers. As for the side dish of savoir faire, it was a small helping this season, showcased best in military jackets with vertical zips that arched over the shoulders. Unzipped, the sleeves can be pulled partially off for a look that\u2019s much sexier than those obvious nude silhouette prints. The label\u2019s first-ever bags, modeled after an unstructured vintage style Kate Moss has carried with major brass hardware, will be customizable in store, just like their best-selling army jackets. \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kate moss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin blaisdell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fow24news.com faith connexion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parsons school of design", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ntmb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naples", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:30.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfb4b0054fb3aedb6757a49de54462afe8879836", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxaOoUs78mOoiyhYuunU4gQLfZ2WVuf6D1qT7lhR8YTwjZkAUWmi86zadqhVnYutqVCjdCFW181QLgGqBGqynfNw--", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Language Rules for the Digital Age - The New York Times", "title_full": "Language Rules for the Digital Age - The New York Times", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.172, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/10/books/review/10Simpson/10Simpson-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 532, "comments": 0, "shares": 532}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 58}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dfb4b0054fb3aedb6757a49de54462afe8879836", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxaOoUs78mOoiyhYuunU4gQLfZ2WVuf6D1qT7lhR8YTwjZkAUWmi86zadqhVnYutqVCjdCFW181QLgGqBGqynfNw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "John Simpson", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Language Rules for the Digital Age - The New York Times", "text": "Language Rules for the Digital Age By JOHN SIMPSON The Essential Guide to Language in the BuzzFeed Age By Emmy J. Favilla 392 pp. Bloomsbury. $26. I don\u2019t actually remember a world that seriously included the word \u201cwhom\u201d \u2014 but that\u2019s not the point of Emmy Favilla\u2019s provocative and jaunty romp through the dos and don\u2019ts of writing for the internet (which gets the thumbs-up over \u201cInternet\u201d). As chief copy editor for BuzzFeed, Favilla\u2019s at the sharp edge of online editing. There she was tasked with creating and maintaining a style guide that had a logical integrity (but also room for considered variation); addressed those language issues that demanded a rethink; was attractive to readers; and, of course, encouraged them to click through to the all-important articles. \u201cA World Without \u2018Whom\u2019\u201d tells the story behind this handbook: the decisions, and how they were reached. The fast-paced, conversational tone gives the book a Chicago-Manual-of-Style-meets-cute-cat-video (aww) feel. Once you adjust to that, though, it also provides a fascinating examination of how a modern grammar guru handles the quandaries that arise out of the dialect of social media, at a time when we are afraid \u2014 or perhaps excited \u2014 that the way we communicate online may be re-engineering our language itself. In fact, many of these stylistic issues are chestnuts, but they demand fresh answers for each generation. Some questions Favilla raises were being debated when I started working on the Oxford English Dictionary in 1976. We whispered in corners that \u201calright\u201d might be an acceptable spelling of \u201call right,\u201d and we hemmed and hawed over whether abbreviations should take points (\u201cU.S.\u201d or \u201cUS\u201d), or if the possessive of \u201cEuripides\u201d was \u201cEuripides\u2019s\u201d or just \u201cEuripides\u2019.\u201d I have to confess, however, that I\u2019ve since forgotten whether we ever thought of putting two spaces rather than one between our sentences as we typed happily away in those distant days. But language is very much part of the culture of its day. Back when we were still living in the shadow of the postwar era, the rules were stricter and more religiously observed; you weren\u2019t supposed to challenge time-honored authority. But the internet was a product of that era, and of a generation that demanded a new order (or disorder). Breaking the rules was part of the game, and this book witnesses the latest wave of rule-breakers reaching their own adaptation of our changing lexicon. Favilla introduces us to the online punctuation police (\u201ccomma panic,\u201d vanity capitalization), helps us read between the lines in our inboxes (\u201cthe 48 most annoying ways to start off an email\u201d) and steers us through the etymological minefield that is modern digital communication (\u201c42 ways to type laughter\u201d). She accommodates variation with alacrity, but generally advises consistency. In fact, she may be closer to the mainstream than she realizes. In some parts the book is a guide for the initiated, in others one for the outsider who is surprised to have landed in the online world. Despite her self-deprecation (she lives in perennial fear of \u201ceveryone in my office and my life discovering that I am a fraud\u201d), Favilla is admirably suited to the \u201caccidental livelihood\u201d that has come her way at a fast-paced, high-energy digital news organization. Once she acclimates to this new speed, she is well in command of the stylistic questions she encounters in her daily ride through BuzzFeed text. Although her research involves typing questions into Google and firing microbrief questions to her editing team and friends (\u201cglueing or gluing \u2026 both look terrible but are acceptable per MW,\u201d the in-group abbreviation for \u201cMerriam Webster\u201d), Favilla always balances the results against the established style manuals, sometimes finding them deficient and sometimes not. As her own enthusiastic interoffice emails often end, \u201cBests.\u201d \nJohn Simpson was chief editor of the Oxford English Dictionary until his retirement in 2013.

Advertisement \n\"This is Australia: Fair, diverse, loving and filled for respect for everyone,\" said an effusive Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, as he introduced the bill for a final vote. \n\"This is a great day, it belongs to every Australian.\" \nThe move follows a two-month national postal survey that showed 61% of more than 12 million respondents were in favor of marriage equality. \nThe country is now the 24th in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry, according to Pew Research. \nAustralia's first same-sex weddings will not take place until at least January, however, due to a longstanding requirement for all Australian couples to provide a full month's notice of their intention to get married. \nHistoric moment \nMarriage equality campaigners have fought for years for Thursday's vote. Though the bill was expected to pass into law without significant opposition, the lengthy legislative process was excruciatingly slow for the hundreds of advocates watching from the public gallery. \nAmong them was Christine Forster, the gay sister of Tony Abbott, the former Australian Prime Minister who has long been seen as the face of the \"no\" campaign. \nForster was joined in the public gallery by her partner, Virginia Edwards. They plan to marry next year, and Abbott has said he'll attend despite his personal views. \nAbbott and other conservatives proposed amendments to the bill to include further religious protections, all of which were voted down. \n\"These amendments are important and I stress they are not against same-sex marriage, they are simply in favor of the rights of religious organizations to keep doing what their doing,\" Abbott said. \nOpponents of the changes argued they would legalize discrimination against the gay community. The 500 or so people in the gallery were vocal in their disapproval of the amendments. They were warned multiple times that parliamentary rules prohibit them making noise and even applauding. \nAn emotional week \nAfter the bill passed the Senate last week, House proceedings kicked off with fireworks Monday when Liberal MP Tim Wilson surprised his colleagues by proposing to his long-time partner Ryan Bolger. \nThe next day, Liberal MP Andrew Wallace, who is a devout Catholic, shared with his colleagues how his gay daughter helped change his position on same-sex marriage. \n\"She said: Dad, in the years to come, my generation will look back and judge your generation about how you deal with the issue of homosexuality in the same way that your generation considered your parents' generation in the way that they dealt with our Indigenous people,\" Wallace said. \nFighting back tears, Liberal MP Sarah Henderson told the story Wednesday night of a close gay friend of hers who died months ago and who, in one of their last conversations, asked her to continue to push for same-sex marriage. \nSurvey says yes \nThursday's vote comes three weeks after Australia voted overwhelmingly to legalize same-sex marriage as part of a national postal survey lasting two months. \nUnder political pressure to find a solution, the ruling Liberal National Coalition government announced the non-compulsory survey in August, saying if the result was \"yes\" they would allow a free vote in Parliament. \nIn the end, 61.6% of Australia voted in favor of allowing same-sex marriage, with 38.4% saying \"no.\" \nAbout 12.7 million people participated in the survey, which had a response rate of nearly 80% -- which is considered very high. \nAustralians have long been in favor of same-sex marriage, with polling from as long as 10 years ago showing a majority support for legalizing marriage equality.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan bolger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pew research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal national coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:31.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7bb87a8111984e7108fbc0cbdcfdafde492fc574", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAis8suioV.U.B4xTxotQCIyI-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/computer-email-program-please-specify-apple-mail-outlook-thunderbird-etc", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum -

It was a strange situation. He is a tough guy and if he cannot continue the game then you should consider it could be something serious. In the treatment room then, he was a little bit more positive, so maybe we are lucky and it\u2019s not too serious.\u201d \nGoal\u2019s Melissa Reddy also expressed her hope Moreno is not facing a serious problem: \nMelissa Reddy @MelissaReddy_ Alberto Moreno devastated to be coming off injured for #LFC, with James Milner replacing him. Hopefully it\u2019s a minor rather than a major issue. \n2017-12-6 20:32:29 \nAside from some high-profile mistakes in the 3-3 draw with Sevilla last month, Moreno has largely been much-improved this season after an unconvincing start to his Liverpool career. \nThe left-back has perhaps stepped up his game having lost his place to midfielder Milner for large swathes of last season and seen Andy Robertson arrive in the summer. \nRobertson has impressed during some limited opportunities this season, having made just four appearances, but he\u2019s a strong back-up for Moreno if he does face a spell on the sidelines, while the versatile Milner remains an option, too. \nLiverpool\u2019s 7-0 win was the second time they\u2019ve achieved such a scoreline in the UEFA Champions League group stage this year having done the same against Maribor, and they\u2019ve been fairly prolific in the other four matches: \nB/R Football @brfootball \n2017-12-6 22:32:25 \nEach of their front four got in on the action \u2014Philippe Coutinho bagged a hat-trick, Sadio Mane grabbed a brace and Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah netted once apiece \u2014and the team are becoming increasingly ruthless in front of goal after lacking a clinical edge at times earlier in the campaign. \nDespite topping their group, though, Liverpool can still get Real Madrid , Bayern Munich or Juventus in the last 16. \nKlopp isn\u2019t looking forward to the possibility of facing one of them, but he believes his side can cause problems: \u201c I don\u2019t think anybody is happy when they get us in the draw, so we will not be happy in the moment when we see who we will face in the next round, but we will be ready, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d \nThe German added: \u201c If we perform like this tonight in these moments, if we are as clinical as tonight, but had with the same players situations where we didn\u2019t score. It\u2019s not a criticism but the past. If they perform like this then obviously 100 per cent [they are a threat].\u201d \nFormer Manchester United star Roy Keane believes the Reds will find it much more difficult against one of the top sides, though, per ITV Football: \nITV Football @itvfootball \u2018Lovely going forward but there will be tougher tests to come\u2019 \nWatch all the highlights from the @ChampionsLeague on @ITV now. https://t.co/GFlX4AUrcR \n2017-12-6 23:15:33 \nIndeed, there will be less to exploit going forward, and the Reds\u2019 defensive issues will be far more exposed against one of Europe\u2019s elite, but Liverpool would equally represent a difficult draw for any side they might face. \nThe Reds will no doubt be hoping to instead draw Basel, Shakhtar Donetsk or Porto, who \u2014while they should not be taken lightly by any means \u2014will offer a much more favourable route to the quarter-finals. \nThe draw will take place on Monday, December 11, while the last 16 fixtures will be played in February and March next year. \nBreaking Sports News \nvia Bleacher Report \u2013 Front Page http://ift.tt/yO6Sgr \nDecember 7, 2017 at 12:39AM Advertisements", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jurgen klopp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberto moreno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moreno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james carroll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roberto firmino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippe coutinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy keane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james milner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robertson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamed salah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa reddy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "klopp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy robertson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sadio mane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "juventus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sevilla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uefa champions league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bayern munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "real madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spartak moscow", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "basel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maribor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakhtar donetsk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:31.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7bb87a8111984e7108fbc0cbdcfdafde492fc574", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAis8suioV.U.B4xTxotQCIyI-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/computer-email-program-please-specify-apple-mail-outlook-thunderbird-etc", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "Recover deleted archive email", "title_full": "Recover deleted archive email - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "96c732d8f3033f475b2516ec37966f0c969936ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAis8suioV.U.Bem_rQKd9qEZTwAZSMp9U4g--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "bkennelly", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Deleted messages in Gmail are moved to the Trash for at least 30 days.

Interestingly, Zhouran isn't a Christian nation, rather it's a secular nation, with 34% of the population being adherents to the indigenous religion called the Spiritual Mandate , 31% being members of the Zhouranese Orthodox Church , 28% being non-religious, and 7% being adherents to other religions. As a result, Zhouran is indeed a secular-but-religious nation and because of this Christmas is celebrated in the traditional way, regardless if someone is Orthodox Christian, a follower of the Spiritual Mandate, or an atheist.\nPeople in Zhouran like to celebrate Christmas for as long as possible, and as a result the nation has one of the world's longest Christmas season. Christmas season in Zhouran is treated as an important time for families to come and meet together as one and reunite. Christmas in Zhouran is one of the most colorful in Asia and the whole world, with firework shows being very popular.\nNativity scenes are very popular in Zhouran. They are often very large, with the figures being life size. For Zhouranese Orthodox Christians, sometimes a whole room in a house can be used for the nativity scenes. The figures are often made of clay. As well as the normal figures of the Mary, Joseph, Jesus, the Shepherds and Three Kings, there are often lots of other figures of different people and different animals. The figures can be bought from markets in towns and cities all over Zhouran. The baby Jesus is normally added to the scene during the evening of Christmas Eve. The Three Kings are added at Epiphany.\nHospitality is very important for all Zhouranese people, with families and any friends they've invited having a meal together. Tables are covered with fruits and nuts, chocolates, cookies and biscuits, various types of Zhouranese breads, salads and various Zhouranese main meals such as Zhouranese soft rice with barbecued and marinated lamb, chicken or beef with nuts and various spices. Some Zhouranese Orthodox Christians don't eat any meat or fish during the Christmas Eve meal/feast.\nFor Zhouranese Orthodox Christian families, prayers might be said after the meal and the family then goes to the midnight Church services. They often don't wash the dishes until they get home from Church - sometimes not until 4.00am or 5.00am.\nIn suburban areas, children will go carol singing round the homes of friends and family and to wish people a happy new year. They are normally rewarded with cookies, sweets and money.\nChristmas Eve is very important in Zhouran.

They are very different from each other.\u201d \nAlready there has been much speculation about the intent behind Leo Messi\u2019s description of his two sons. \nClearly, Messi is enamoured with both his sons, as you would imagine from any parent. \nAnd, his description of Mateo is given with a huge smile on his face. \nIt is refreshing to hear Leo Messi talk of his youngest son in this manner. Pretty much like any other parent. Leo Messi\u2019s face as he discusses Mateo Messi Leo Messi\u2019s face as he discusses Mateo Messi Leo Messi on whether Thiago & Mateo like football \nAlso in the interview, Leo Messi discusses whether his two sons like football. \nOn Thiago, Messi compares his oldest son with Luis Suarez\u2019s son Benjamin. \nMessi: \u201cThiago\u2019s friend, Luis\u2019s son, Benja. They have the same age and he\u2019s football crazy. He loves to play football, he watches football, he knows all the players. And Thiago no, he likes cars, he likes motorcycles, he plays other things. He likes football, but just a bit.\u201d \nOn Mateo, Leo says: \u201cMateo does play a bit of football, right-footed. He\u2019s more coordinated. He hits it well.

Gandoorese Christmas dinner usually consists of a roasted ham (ham, it should be stated, isn't commonly eaten in Gandoor outside of the holiday season) accompanied by sweetcorn and brown rice. Sides will include roasted potato slices, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage soup. Christmas dessert is almost always 'Christmas bread', which is a sweet bread, only sold during the holidays, that is topped with cream cheese and ground cinnamon.

He answered, \u2018Look I have to start again from zero,\u2019 basically. And it\u2019s very sad, honestly. What he has gone through, this guy, is unbelievable. \n\u201c It\u2019s really, really sad. But unfortunately, he has to start again from zero. That means if all goes well, he has to wait until he can run. And after, when he starts to run, it will at least take six weeks to come back to training. When he will be able to start to run again, I don\u2019t know. I hope [he will be back]. But certainly now, not before February. \u201c \nCazorla\u2019s last appearance for Arsenal was way back in October 2016 against Ludogorets in the UEFA Champions League. \nIn November of last year, Wenger then described the Achilles problem as \u201c not a big injury, it\u2019s not an injury which will harm his future,\u201d per Metro \u2018s Mark Brus . \nHowever, it could potentially prove to be an injury that ends Cazorla\u2019s career at the Emirates Stadium, as his contract with Arsenal expires at the end of the season. \nA long-term favourite of the Emirates faithful, he continues to receive the support of Arsenal fans, per Karen: \nMattias Kar\u00e9n @MattiasKaren Chants of \u201cOh, Santi Cazorla\u201d ringing out around the Emirates, after the midfielder\u2019s latest injury setback. \n2017-11-29 20:48:26 \nBut Arsenal have had to learn to cope without Cazorla for so long now that the news of his extended lay-off should have little impact on the team\u2019s form. \nIt would be a major boost, though, were he to finally return to fitness at some point before the end of the season. \nAt his best, Cazorla is arguably Arsenal\u2019s most influential central midfielder. \nWhen he was first sidelined last year, Ben McAleer of WhoScored.com examined how crucial his absence could prove given how important Cazorla was to Arsenal\u2019s creativity. \nThe north London outfit have been able to adapt to life without the Spain international in the side and have looked largely impressive this season, even in Saturday\u2019s 3-1 defeat to Manchester United , which ended a 12-game winning run at home in the Premier League. \nBut news of Cazorla\u2019s latest setback will be met with huge disappointment at the Emirates, as he is a popular player and could still play a huge role in the side if he were fit. \nBreaking Sports News \nvia Bleacher Report \u2013 Front Page http://ift.tt/yO6Sgr \nDecember 7, 2017 at 12:39AM Advertisements", "highlightText": "",

\nRockwell\u2019s new 5 inch Random Orbit Sander with Vibrafree and 20V brushless Sonicrafter are tools that continue to bring joy long after the holiday season is over. Skip the tie, sweater and slippers and give tool gifts that provide solutions to jobs throughout the house and beyond. \nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nRockwell\u2019s new 5-inch Random Orbit Sander with Vibrafree and 20V brushless Sonicrafter are tools that continue to bring joy long after the holiday season is over. Skip the tie, sweater and slippers and give tool gifts that provide solutions to jobs throughout the house and beyond. \nThe Rockwell 5 inch Random Orbit Sander with Vibrafree technology makes a big difference when it comes to reducing vibration. In fact, the Vibrafree sander features up to 50 percent less vibration than other leading-brand sanders. \nUnlike conventional random orbit sanders with a single sanding disc, Vibrafree employs an inner and outer disc that move in opposite directions of one another to cancel vibration. Vibration is redirected into sanding, and not the operator\u2019s hand. As a result, there\u2019s greater productivity, due to the sander\u2019s rapid removal rate. \nDust removal capability is up to 50 percent greater than that of conventional sanders with cloth dust bags. Vibrafree\u2019s bag-less, filter-less Cyclonic Dust/Air Separator system\u2019s air flow design separates dust from the air, while maintaining constant suction. This cyclonic action eliminates clogs. The dust box has a pushbutton release for easy emptying. \nRandom orbit sanders are handy in the workshop. Their speed and aggressive action is like a belt sander. The sanding disc moves in small ellipses to help produce smooth, swirl-free finishes. \nThe variable-speed 5-inch diameter random orbit sander is powered by a 3.3 amp motor that delivers 6000 to 13,500 orbits-per-minute (no load speed) for fast and smooth material removal. \nThe 3.3 lb. sander\u2019s ergonomically designed, elongated palm grip handle features a comfortable rubber overmold grip for optimum balance and control. Its on/off rocker switch is conveniently located and sealed for long life. \nIncluded with the sander and the dust box is a 15-pc. accessory set, including 5 pcs. each of 60,120 and 180 grit hook-and- loop sandpaper. Other features include a 7-ft. power cord and carrying bag. \nThe Rockwell 5 inch Random Orbit Sander with Vibrafree technology (RK4248K, $69.99) is available at rockwelltools.com, Menards, and online at Walmart and Amazon. The Vibrafree sander is covered by Rockwell 3 year warranty. \nOne of the most versatile power tools is an oscillating multi-tool. This compact workhorse can cut, grind, sand, polish and hone just by swapping out accessories. Oscillating tools can handle a myriad of jobs and projects around the house and shop to save time, energy and money. \nThe latest oscillating tool from Rockwell is the 20V Brushless Sonicrafter. It\u2019s Rockwell\u2019s first brushless oscillating tool, and it features a 20 year warranty with free batteries for 20 years, once the tool is registered. \nWhen an independent lab tested the 20V Brushless Sonicrafter against a leading competitor, it achieved 20 percent more cuts-per-charge in HDF boards, and 35 percent more cuts in 1 in. oak dowels. \nThe multi-tool features a 4\u00ba oscillating angle. Most tools in this category have 3.2\u00ba oscillating angles. The advantage of a wider oscillating angle is its enhance cutting capacity by making quicker cuts. \nRockwell pioneered Universal Fit, the industry\u2019s first true universal accessory system, which enabled Sonicrafters to accept other major brands\u2019 accessories without adapters. Rockwell\u2019s universal accessories are manufactured to fit all other competitive oscillating tools as well. \nThe 20V brushless Sonicrafter also features Hyperlock, a tool-less blade change system that eliminates blade slippage by providing one ton of clamping force. \nThe Rockwell\u2019s 20V Sonicrafter\u2019s brushless motor features up to 10 times the motor life and 25 percent more power than a comparable, conventional brushed motor. Highly magnetic rare earth metals increase power output. Plus, battery run time increases by up to 50 percent per charge versus standard brushed motors. The brushless motor features computer-controlled power distribution, which improves motor efficiency and durability by reducing heat, friction, noise and wear. \nThe 20V brushless Sonicrafter has a tapered, compact body powered by a 20V 2.0 Ah MAX battery. The tool\u2019s variable speed brushless motor has a no-load speed of 8,000 to 18,000 oscillations-per-minute (opm). The 3.1 lb. (with battery) multi-tool has a full metal head and also features constant speed control, which electronically maintains speed-of-cut under load. Plus, an integrated LED light helps illuminates the work area. \nThe 20V brushless Sonicrafter includes an 8-pc. accessory kit, one 20V 2.0 Ah MAX battery, one hour charger and carrying bag. \nThe Rockwell 20V Brushless Sonicrafter (RK2701K, $179) is available at rockwelltools.com, Lowes and online at Amazon.com \nFollow Rockwell through social media links, including, Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RockwellTools?ref=hl and twitter: https://twitter.com/RockwellTools . \nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/12/prweb14990022.htm Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes, all others at least 20 minutes.

Although he has just 699 yards in 12 games, putting him at risk of falling short of 1,000 yards on the season, Landry has caught a career-high six touchdown passes this term. \nWhile he may not catch as much hype as former LSU teammate Odell Beckham Jr., Landry has been a model of consistency since entering the league, and the 2017 season has been no exception. \nApart from the first game of his career, in which Landry was held to zero receptions, he has logged at least three receptions in all but one game, a 2015 tilt against the Baltimore Ravens wherein he caught two passes. He has yet to finish a game with less than five receptions this season. \nIn addition to being a steady producer on offense, Landry has been consistent with his availability. Heading into Week 14, the fourth-year wideout has not missed a game for the Dolphins. Landry will next take the field Sunday, when the Dolphins host the New England Patriots in an AFC East matchup. \nBreaking Sports News \nvia Bleacher Report \u2013 Front Page http://ift.tt/yO6Sgr \nDecember 7, 2017 at 12:39AM Advertisements", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jarvis landry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "landry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odell beckham jr.", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "miami dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver broncos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baltimore ravens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england patriots", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lsu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:32.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cdfe4a047aa082920b787bfef06eb6303e817017", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_6hChVsJSN_dE9368L0J5WI479dfiyyZ9uG8cM8slpJNm9MZhtOW50jN4eHa.d6zUiaoMeKNKDAYQfB6XKm5E9DjjLfOts7Tp4AfFTC41QGkj8IJQyD43A23FphUTQkI0Qoh1u3klSV9Xse8CVnKBLE0l6txzuaU-", "site_full": "highvelocitysportsnews.com", "site": "highvelocitysportsnews.com", "site_section": "https://highvelocitysportsnews.wordpress.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "High Velocity Sport", "title": "Power Ranking Every Player for Liverpool in 2017 Champions League Group Stage", "title_full": "Power Ranking Every Player for Liverpool in 2017 Champions League Group Stage", "published": "2017-12-07T10:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://ift.tt/IEPnfR", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cdfe4a047aa082920b787bfef06eb6303e817017", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_6hChVsJSN_dE9368L0J5WI479dfiyyZ9uG8cM8slpJNm9MZhtOW50jN4eHa.d6zUiaoMeKNKDAYQfB6XKm5E9DjjLfOts7Tp4AfFTC41QGkj8IJQyD43A23FphUTQkI0Qoh1u3klSV9Xse8CVnKBLE0l6txzuaU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "highvelocitysportsnews", "published": "2017-12-07T10:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Power Ranking Every Player for Liverpool in 2017 Champions League Group Stage", "text": "http://ift.tt/2ACun7z \nLiverpool trounced Spartak Moscow on Wednesday to secure a place in the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League for the first time since the 2008/09 season. \nA European campaign that started with a tricky play-off against Hoffenheim way back in August will now stretch into 2018, even if the Reds at times made heavy weather of qualifying from Group E. \nA cosy draw didn\u2019t look so comfortable after picking up just two points from their opening pair of games. However, Maribor were dismissed twice by a 10-0 aggregate scoreline, and despite a second-half collapse in Seville, Liverpool sealed top spot in style with a 7-0 triumph over Spartak at Anfield. \nThe list of possible opponents in the next round includes reigning champions Real Madrid , last year\u2019s beaten finalists Juventus , Bayern Munich, Basel, Shakhtar Donetsk and Porto. \nWhile they wait to see who they are drawn against next Monday, Bleacher Report decided to look back at Liverpool\u2019s European season so far, ranking every player who has appeared in the competition for the club. \n\n20. Marko Grujic \nMidfielder Grujic was spotted on the field for all of six minutes, barely getting on prior to the final whistle in the first leg of the play-off in Hoffenheim before enjoying a slightly earlier introduction at home to Maribor . \nIt appears that might be his only contribution in the competition this season, too. Klopp has said he is open to the idea of allowing the talented young Serb to leave on loan in the January transfer window, per James Pearce of the Liverpool Echo . \n\n19. Dominic Solanke \nSigned from Chelsea in the summer, Solanke has shown promise in his brief appearances for his new club, including setting up the opening goal in the away win at Stoke City on his first Premier League start. \nHowever, he\u2019s barely had a chance in the Champions League to date. Like Grujic , the striker came off the bench away to Hoffenheim and also at home against Maribor . If Klopp has a fully fit squad to choose from, the 20-year-old could be nothing more than a spectator for the next round. \n\n18. Simon Mignolet \nKlopp \u2018s decision to rotate his goalkeepers came after Liverpool had qualified for the group stage. Before then, Mignolet was between the posts for both legs with Hoffenheim , conceding three goals over the tie. \nThe Belgian did save a penalty away in Germany, guessing right to keep out Andrej Kramaric\u2019s weak spot-kick when the score was still 0-0, but he has since had to settle for being Loris Karius \u2018 back-up. \nWill the manager maintain the same policy further down the line, choosing to split playing time between the two? \n\n17. Alex Oxlade -Chamberlain \nOf the 127 minutes Oxlade -Chamberlain has played in the Champions League for Liverpool so far, all-but four of them came in the two lopsided games against Maribor . \nThe deadline-day signing from Arsenal did open his account for the club when scoring in the 7-0 rout in Slovenia, coolly slotting home Daniel Sturridge \u2018s through ball. Oxlade -Chamberlain was signed with a long-term plan in mind\u2014while sporadically involved for now, things could easily be different by next February. \n\n16. Joe Gomez \nNathaniel Clyne\u2019s injury issues opened the door for Gomez to step in at right-back. More at home in the centre of the defence, the 20-year-old has had to learn on the job. \nHe flunked his first test in the Champions League, as he was sent off at home in the 2-2 draw with Sevilla , while he was also part of the back four that failed to hang on to a commanding lead in the return fixture on Spanish soil. \nEven with a clean sheet to finish against sorry Spartak (which saw Gomez finish the game alongside Ragnar Klavan at centre-back), the England international doesn\u2019t have a strong case to crack the top 10. \n\n15. Dejan Lovren \nLovren recovered from a shocking start to help Liverpool progress. His early error that gifted Sevilla the lead at Anfield didn\u2019t prove too costly in the end, but the team cannot afford similar mishaps moving forward. \nThe Croatian has to be marked down for his involvement in the 3-3 result in the return fixture against the same opponents, too. While there were clean sheets against inferior competition, they count for little. \n\n14. Daniel Sturridge \nAs seems to be the case under Klopp these days, Sturridge played second fiddle to Firmino , though he still managed a goal and two assists during his limited time on the pitch in the Champions League. \nThe England international came off the bench in five of the six group games, scoring the third and final goal at home to Maribor , but his brief cameos only added up to a lowly total of 83 minutes played. \nIt will be interesting to see if Sturridge is still a Liverpool player by the time they next play in Europe. According to El Gol (h/t Harry Howes of the Star ), the Reds are in talks over a potential deal for the player to move to Real Betis in the next transfer window. \n\n13. Jordan Henderson \nLiverpool\u2019s two 7-0 victories in the group came without their club captain on the field. Henderson sat on the bench and watched on as his team-mates put Maribor and Spartak to the sword. \nShould the midfielder be worried by the team\u2019s performances without him? Not really, no. He should, though, be concerned how his presence on the field couldn\u2019t help stop the second-half slide at Sevilla . \nHenderson doesn\u2019t deserve the level of criticism he receives from some fans on social media\u2014but, as skipper, he also needs to exert greater influence over his colleagues when the going gets tough. \n\n12. Alberto Moreno \nNow established as the first-choice left-back, Moreno has started every one of Liverpool\u2019s games in Europe. He\u2019s provided three assists in those appearances, demonstrating how he can make a difference in attack. \nAnd yet, despite all he\u2019s contributed to the campaign, it is hard to forget his meltdown away in Sevilla . Playing against his former club, the Spain international endured a nightmare return to familiar surroundings. After being at fault for two of the three goals Liverpool conceded, he was hauled off after 63 minutes. \nHe didn\u2019t finish the emphatic victory over Spartak in the next game either, albeit his early departure on that occasion was down to an ankle injury. \n\n11. Ragnar Klavan \nKlavan has experienced both ends of the spectrum in the Champions League. \nWhile the veteran centre-back kept a clean sheet on his first European start for the club, he was also a member of the back four who collapsed on Spanish soil, as Sevilla rallied to grab a point that had seemed so unlikely at the half-time interval. \nWhile he returned from illness to help secure qualification at Anfield, concerns over Klavan \u2018s lack of pace, as well as his inability to cope under pressure, is worrying ahead of games against stronger opposition. \n\n10. Loris Karius \nA Champions League specialist, Karius has still yet to fully convince he has what it takes to establish himself as Liverpool\u2019s No. 1 in all competitions. \nStill, whoever starts between the sticks is too often let down by those playing in front of him. The German was left badly exposed in both outings against Sevilla but was a virtual spectator in the other games. \nThere were some smart saves at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in particular, and he could do little about the three goals the visitors conceded after the break. Karius is a work in progress, though rustiness could be an issue early next year if he remains stuck behind Mignolet for domestic duties. \n\n9. Georginio Wijnaldum \nWijnaldum is the footballing equivalent of a cheese and pickle sandwich. Neither are overly flash, but both do a job in terms of filling a hole. \nThe Dutchman is a steady Eddie, a seven-out-of-10 type who Klopp clearly trusts in the big games. If there\u2019s one disappointment with the former Newcastle United player in Europe so far, it\u2019s his lack of impact in the final third. He registered just one assist, away in Sevilla , during the group games. \n\n8. Joel Matip \nMatip played every minute of the campaign until a thigh problem ruled him out of the last two group games. Liverpool missed him away at Sevilla as well, as they fell apart after the break to let slip a 3-0 lead. \nWhile the Reds comfortably survived without the centre-back against a Spartak side who had seemingly failed to bother doing any research on their opponents, they will hope he is fit to feature in the next round. \nJames Pearce of the Liverpool Echo reported Matip \"may not play again until January.\" With the last-16 ties taking place the following month, the defender is likely to slot straight back into the lineup once healthy. \n\n7. Emre Can \nAfter scoring twice in the 4-2 home win over Hoffenheim in qualifying, Can was more often than not used in a defensive role in Group E. The only game he didn\u2019t start was in Sevilla , when his presence in front of the back four might have helped prevent the second-half rot setting in. \nBy the time he was summoned from the bench, it was too late to stem the Spanish tide as Liverpool\u2019s lead was swept away in what was the definition of a game of two halves. \nThe German is also pushed outside the top six due to picking up a careless yellow card in the final game, with his third booking in the group stage ruling him out of the first leg of the last-16 tie. Tut-tut, Emre . \n\n6. Trent Alexander-Arnold \nTeenager Alexander-Arnold scored the club\u2019s opening goal in their European campaign, curling home a glorious free-kick to set Liverpool on their way against Hoffenheim . \n\"Well I have to say for an 18-year-old who has the balls to take a free-kick like that it is rather exciting and interesting for me than a little mistake he did,\u201d Klopp said in the aftermath, per Mark Critchley of The Independent. \nHe also found the net in Maribor , once again demonstrating his attacking instincts. With Klopp opting for the more defensive-minded Gomez in both games against Sevilla , Alexander-Arnold\u2019s position is improved by his lack of involvement in the sloppy draws with the La Liga club. \n\n5. James Milner \nDespite totalling just 252 minutes of action in the group stage, Milner managed more assists (five) than any other Liverpool player. In fact, according to UEFA .com , no one had more in the entire competition. \nHis final tally was boosted by three against Spartak on Wednesday, all of them coming in the second half after he\u2019d replaced the injured Moreno at left-back just before the break. \nIn the games against Maribor , Milner captained the team from a midfield role. That versatility is useful for Klopp , yet it may take an injury crisis for the 31-year-old Yorkshireman to get a starting berth in the last 16. \n\n4. Sadio Mane \nMane could easily have been ranked higher than fourth had a hamstring injury not sidelined him for the home-and-away fixtures against Maribor . Liverpool coped easily without him, yet the Senegalese missed the chance to fill his boots. \nStill, a tally of three goals in four appearances is impressive. Mane found the net twice in the second half of the thrashing of Spartak , including an acrobatic volley in front of the Kop straight after half-time. \nPerhaps overshadowed by the top three in this list, the 25-year-old still remains a pivotal part of Liverpool\u2019s newest fab four. No team will relish having to deal with the Reds\u2019 forwards in the knockout stages. \n3. Mohamed Salah \nSalah is the signing of the summer, surely. Some suggested Liverpool had overpaid for a player who failed previously to make the grade at Chelsea, yet the Egyptian has emphatically silenced those doubters with his scoring form for his new employers. \nThe addition from AS Roma is a sniper who has pace to burn. With Salah settling in so quickly, Liverpool\u2019s supporters have a new hero to cherish. Best of all, his relatively young age (25) means there should still be room for improvement. \nSalah finished with a final total of five goals in the group stage, including bagging a brace in the 7-0 demolition of Maribor before he was substituted just shy of the hour mark. \n\n2. Philippe Coutinho \nA group stage that started with a tentative return to club duty finished with Coutinho wearing the captain\u2019s armband as he scored his first hat-trick for the club. \nThe cameo off the bench against Sevilla on September 13 was the Brazilian playmaker\u2019s first appearance since his failure to force through a move to Barcelona\u2014and the fans demonstrated their continued support by applauding his introduction for the final 15 minutes. \nHe received another ovation at Anfield when claiming the match ball at the end of Wednesday\u2019s game with Spartak , having notched Liverpool\u2019s first treble in the Champions League since Yossi Benayoun achieved the same feat a decade ago. \n\n1. Roberto Firmino \nWhile Salah \u2018s been Liverpool\u2019s star turn in the Premier League, Firmino \u2018s first-class performances in Europe (and overlooking his missed penalty against Sevilla ) deservedly sees him sit atop of these rankings. \nThe Brazilian scored six goals in as many games and also weighed in with three assists. However, his most crucial contribution in the competition came before the group stage had begun, as he helped oust former club Hoffenheim in the play-offs with a sensational display in the second leg. \n\"Roberto Firmino \u2018s performance has been absolutely stunning. His quality, his vision,\" former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said after the game on BT Sport, per Jack Lusby of This Is Anfield. \nWhen Firmino \u2018s link-up play is on point, Liverpool look a far more dangerous side. Hopefully he carries this form forward to the knockout stages, as no one else in the squad can replicate his role in the team. \n\nRob Lancaster is a featured columnist for Bleacher Report who covers Liverpool.

habit I let slip. I hope this inspires you to pick up something you\u2019ve forgotten about. If it does, hit the Clap button as you read. \nWhen you start a new habit, you must not to think of it as a constant. It isn\u2019t.\nA new habit will break as easily as you made the decision not to continue with it. A new habit is crumbly in texture, prone to collapse. It needs tender care, light fingers on it. Every time you pick it up, complete the action of the habit, you must remember to place it back down with care and more importantly, with the promise to return once more.\nThe action of doing it is invigorating and you need not worry that your tending to a new habit is sub-par while you do it. You innately know what it means to create this habit and the pure joy of doing so.\nBut, your new habit is most vulnerable when you stop. Like a child, the moments where you take your eyes off it are the moments where the breakdown happens. A momentary loss of focus\u2026 and poof, the habit is gone. Here is where new habits and young children break apart in their similarities\u2026 because a new habit may be lost for a period of time, but it is always possible to revive it from the grave. It\u2019s rebirth requires only a glimmer of hope, an optimistic grace, that says\u2026\nI made a mistake letting you go, but I want to try again. And again and again and again. When you tend to your habit each day, each month, each year, it grows through your care, past you, beyond you, until it is you. Then you are the habit and the habit is you.\nBut still\u2026 you are vulnerable. Your habit is you until it isn\u2019t you anymore. It will seperate from your core, unravel around you and disintegrate into dust once more if you don\u2019t tend to yourself. Because that\u2019s what creating a new habit is\u2026\nTending to yourself, to what you need and want for yourself in the future, each day, each month and each year. The timeless pursuit of a life driven around choices and actions that leave you a person you can respect. Capable of attracting others you respect. Helpful to those who have not learnt to respect themselves. Free of inaction.\nStrong, not fragile. \nI hope you\u2019re having an amazing week and if you\u2019d like to stay in touch, click the button below (I don\u2019t sell anything). \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:32.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "30dbd026ead58205b557b3c95d3a4bbd4804373a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAir1RJTW0UILEZmF._th1d5k-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/computer-email-program-please-specify-apple-mail-outlook-thunderbird-etc", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "Gmail blocking Outlook 2016 \u2014 even after turning on Less Secure Apps again", "title_full": "Gmail blocking Outlook 2016 \u2014 even after turning on Less Secure Apps again - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "30dbd026ead58205b557b3c95d3a4bbd4804373a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAir1RJTW0UILEZmF._th1d5k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hans Peter Guttmann", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Gmail blocking Outlook 2016 \u2014 even after turning on Less Secure Apps again", "text": "Re: Outlook 2016 & Windows 10 1703 > 15063.729\nA cousin inadvertently followed Gmail's warnings about an unfamiliar device \u2014 in fact signing into her account via her browser for the first time in over a year \u2014 and allowed Gmail to Turn off 'access for less secure apps', namely Outlook 2016.\nGoing to 'Sign-in & Security' [in myaccount\u2026] to Re-Allow less secure apps has NOT unblocked Outlook 2016.

I might not even blog about it. Ugh. Well, i was actually already so ready to blog about my convocation day last November. But then i was waiting for our pre-convocation photos. And when we already got all the photos, i just don't have that much time no more. Nah, i do have some free time, but i prefer to sleep, eat and sleep, eat and repeat. Like, what else? I need my rest too duh! And thank God for this 1 hour waiting for my evening class in the FSKM Postgraduate Lounge. So instead of doing my tons of work, i'm just gonna fly my fingers on the keyboard for this post. Hehe.  \nLiterally we only have like 2 weeks until we end this semester. I swear especially next week gonna be hellish to achieve the tightest schedule possible since it feels as if all the lecturers were like sitting together and like \"Ok let's just torture these kids. Tell them to submit everything, give them all the freaking tests during week 13 hahaha\" And the students were like, \"What even guys? Have you guys ever heard the word mercy?\" And the lecturers reply altogether, \"Kids, we invented MERCY. All of you are postgraduate students already. Stop being such a baby or we will send all of you back to degree or maybe kindergarden\" (?) \nOK. Enough with the voices in my head. Damn. I swear i can go all day with the voices since i have a lot of imaginary friends and imaginary situations and all of the imaginary thingy.  \nBack to the point. So, this semester gonna end on this 22nd Dec. But we will present our dissertation proposal on 10th Jan. I really really really hope that i can pass all of these 5 subjects of the semester including my proposal (AMEN!). So that i can celebrate my 25th birthday next Feb worry free. I know it's only Dec and i'm already looking forward for Feb. But i swear time is racing toward us like no other. I know i may be too young to feel like i'm running out of time. But honey, everybody always running out of time regardless their age. I don't even know why. Only God knows. May Allah ease us our December. Amen!

U.S. President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said: \"No one has the right to play with the fate of billions of people for the sake of personal whims. Erdogan warned warned that the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital will lead to \"public unrest\" in the Islamic world. \" Palestinians play cards during U.S. President Donald Trump's televised speech in the West Bank City of Nablus, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017.

Palestinian protestors burn tires as they wave Palestinian flags and pictures of late Palestinian president Yasser Arafat during a protest at the main Square in Gaza City, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. Defying worldwide warnings, U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke with decades of U.S. and international policy by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. December 07, 2017 \nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in a statement on Thursday warned of \"dangerous consequences\" for the region's stability and the world. He says the U.S. should \"retreat from that decision in order to stop a dangerous escalation that leads to extremism and creates an atmosphere which helps terrorism.\" \nMeanwhile, hundreds of Iraqis are gathering in Baghdad to protest President Donald Trump's move. The protest leader, Abdul-Latif al-Himaim from Iraq's Sunni Religious Endowments, told the protesters: \"Jerusalem is our identity, Jerusalem is Arab.\" \nHe says: \"You can uproot a palm tree from a grove, but you will not be able to uproot Jerusalem from our hearts and from Palestine.\" Iraq is a key U.S. ally in the region, with more than 5,000 American troops remaining in Iraq, according to Pentagon. With the backing of the U.S.-led coalition, Iraqi forces have retaken nearly all territory held by the Islamic State group since 2014. 11:35 a.m. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says President Donald Trump \"bound himself forever\" to the history of Jerusalem by recognizing the city as Israel's capital. Netanyahu claimed other states are considering following the U.S. lead and recognizing Jerusalem. He spoke on Thursday at the Foreign Ministry. Netanyahu says that \"we are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition.\" He says the \"time has come\" and expressed confidence that others will follow suit and move their embassies to Jerusalem. Meanwhile, the Israeli military said it will be deploying additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when mass Palestinian protests are anticipated in response to Trump's move. The army statement on Thursday says it will deploy several battalions to the territory while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" Palestinians went on strike across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip on Thursday and protests are expected on Friday after midday prayers. 11:25 a.m. The top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas is calling for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Ismail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip on Thursday and called the U.S. decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries.\" He says the uprising should begin Friday, the Muslim holy day. Haniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" Hamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. Even so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. 10:30 a.m. Saudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. It's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. Saudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" Trump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. U.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. 9:40 a.m. Schools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Political groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. Trump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. The Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. 9:30 a.m. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Erdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. The Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" Erdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" He also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" Erdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. 8:50 a.m. Palestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. In Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. Trump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.
