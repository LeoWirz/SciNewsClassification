I\u2019ll take the easy one first.\nI\u2019ve never written about bitcoin in this column because, well, it just wasn\u2019t important enough in the great scheme of things. (It still isn\u2019t\u2014 it represents only 2.4% of the $7.6 trillion in coins and bank notes in circulation .) Will cryptocurrencies or electronic cash replace bank notes at some point? Quite possibly, and bitcoin is very innovative. \nBut history shows early innovators often aren\u2019t the ultimate winners of the technological disruption they cause, and bitcoin is as likely to dominate global currencies as Tesla is to prevail in electric, autonomous cars against Volkswagen, Toyota and General Motors . \nAnd bitcoin is in the kind of mania this column spotted before with silver in 2011 and Chinese stocks in 2015 , at the top of those two markets. Consider:\n\u2022 Bitcoin has soared over 10,000% since 2013, and 1,733% in the 12 months ending Nov. 30, giving it a market value of around $170 billion . \nRead: Here\u2019s what bitcoin\u2019s monster 2017 gain looks like in one humongous chart \n\u2022 The Winklevoss twins (you might remember them with a pompous, patronizing Larry Summers in \u201cThe Social Network\u201d) may have lost out on tons of Facebook money, but they put $11 million of their $65 million settlement into bitcoin. It\u2019s now worth $1 billion, making them the first bitcoin billionaires .\n\u2022 More than 100 hedge funds are dedicated to cryptocurrencies, and Kardashian wannabe Paris Hilton and boxing champ Floyd Mayweather have endorsed initial coin offerings . That\u2019s right: C-list celebrities hawking ICOs. Need I say more?\nRead: George Washington used bitcoin, Alan Greenspan says \nOn the mere euphoria side, the FAANG stocks\u2019 recent selloff has caused the Nasdaq Composite Index to fall only about 2%. But Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet have lost more than 5% of late, Netflix is down 8%, and Nvidia has slumped 13%.\nBefore the selloff, the S&P 500\u2019s information technology sector had surged 39% in 2017 (the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF XLK, +0.62% lagged behind), four of the five FAANGs had gained at least 50% for the year, and the FAANGs had a total market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, 10% of the value of the entire U.S. stock market . At one point they accounted for 20% of the S&P 500\u2019s total return for 2017 . Take a deep breath and think about that. \nThe FAANG stocks sold off big in June\u2014and I was premature in saying they\u2019d peaked . They came roaring back, in some cases hitting new highs. This could be another correction that sets them up for even bigger things in the future, or it could be the start of a rotation into other strong sectors like energy and financial stocks, which also have been market leaders. \nOverall, stocks are trading at very lofty valuations , and cash holdings for Merrill Lynch clients are below where they were in 2007 . Margin debt is at a record . Institutional sentiment indicators tracked by Barron\u2019s are wildly bullish . \nSo, what else is new? These indicators have been flashing red for months, and the market has continued to rise. We also haven\u2019t seen the usual signs of mania like stock tips from Uber drivers, shoeshine men, etc.\nThat\u2019s why I think except for manias like bitcoin and the FAANGs, we\u2019re in the early stages of stock-market euphoria. The best\u2014or worst\u2014is yet to come.\nHoward R.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe captain of a trawler which crashed into rocks at Mount Batten Pier had been drinking on an empty stomach before the collision. \nMichael Kinnaird, of Fore Street in Newlyn, pleaded guilty to failing to prevent his ship from causing serious damage to a structure when he appeared at Plymouth Magistrates Court. \nHe was found to have alcohol in his system when he was breathalysed almost two hours after the incident, although he was not over the legal limit. \nThe Coastguard was alerted to the incident at 9.45pm on October 7, after the fishing vessel, Algrie, got stranded and crashed into railings at Mount Batten Pier.

But he didn't disclose rogue software that had long fooled authorities into believing that VW was meeting emissions rules on nearly 600,000 vehicles. He also misled American investigators and destroyed documents. \u201c I made bad decisions and for that I am sorry\u201d advertisement \n\"I'm sure, based upon common sense, that you viewed this cover-up as an opportunity to shine \u2014 to climb the corporate ladder at VW,\" U.S. District Judge Sean Cox said. \"Your goal was to impress senior management.\" \nThe judge called Schmidt, who had led VW's engineering and environmental office in Michigan for three years, a \"key conspirator\" in the deception. \n\"Without trust in corporate America,\" Cox said, \"the economy can't function.\" \nThe diesel vehicles were programmed to trigger certain pollution results only during testing, not during regular road use. The plan was hatched in 2006, and the vehicles were marketed as \"clean diesel.\" Justice Department prosecutor Ben Singer called it the \"height of irony.\" Oliver Schmidt Joe Wilssens / EPA file \nSchmidt, 48, was arrested in Miami in January while trying to return to Germany after a vacation. He's been in custody without bond. \n\"For the disruption of my life, I only have to blame myself. ... I accept the responsibility for the wrong I committed,\" Schmidt told the judge. \"I made bad decisions and for that I am sorry.\" advertisement \nSchmidt was charged with 11 felony counts and federal prosecutors said he could have faced a maximum of up to 169 years in prison. As part of his guilty plea, prosecutors agreed to drop most of the counts and Schmidt consented to be deported at the end of his prison sentence. \nRelated: So where exactly will we charge all these electric cars? \nEngineer James Liang cooperated with the FBI and was sentenced to 40 months in prison last summer. Six others at VW or Audi were charged, but they are in Germany and out of reach of U.S. authorities. Among them is Heinz-Jakob Neusser, who was described as Schmidt's boss. He was head of engine development and, later, VW brand development. \nVW pleaded guilty as a corporation in March and agreed to pay $4.3 billion in civil and criminal penalties on top of billions more to buy back cars. \nVolkswagen rebounded from the scandal during the past year. Chief Executive Matthias Mueller last month predicted record deliveries of vehicles for the company this year.

This powerful upgrade adds Neustar\u2019s state of the art WAF (web application firewall) solution to the award-winning Neustar SiteProtect solution to extend network protection to the application layer. A new real-time user interface provides consolidated in-depth trend analysis and gives brands unprecedented access to attack forensics that are not currently available through traditional defense services. \n\u201cYears of experience and cybersecurity engineering capabilities have gone into the development of the SiteProtect NG defense network and operating portal,\u201d said Barrett Lyon, Vice President, Research and Development, Neustar Security Solutions. \u201cNeustar is investing in the future of DDoS defense from an architectural standpoint and sees the expansion and closer integration of its security solutions portfolio as a long term strategic commitment for the company.\u201d \n\u201cNeustar\u2019s clients have the best protection, best user experience, broadest selection of configurations, and powerful analytics at their disposal. DDoS attacks will continue to present brands across the globe with significant challenges to their operational efficiency for the foreseeable future, and our investment in mitigation solutions will continue at pace,\u201d added Lyon. \nSiteProtect NG breaks with the tradition of designing network protection that makes use of a high volume of small scrubbing centers with fewer, highly fortified and highly connected locations. SiteProtect NG network has deployed large, full scale, nodes, each with its multi-terabit scrubbing capacity in North America, Europe, and Asia with South America, Africa, Australia, and India slated for early 2018. \n\u201cDDoS attacks reached unprecedented levels in 2017 and all trends Neustar is mapping indicate that 2018 is going to see the situation worsen dramatically. Cybercriminals, both private and state funded, have the wherewithal to surgically target individual brands, or initiate brute force attacks with the potential to cause catastrophic damage on a global scale. For many cybersecurity professionals, there is no respite, with attackers probing and often breaching defenses on a daily basis,\u201d commented Rodney Joffe, Senior Vice President and Fellow, Neustar. \n\u201cFuture proofing mitigation networks to stop attacks before they reach their target destination will save brands billions each year from the impact of DDoS attacks. Neustar\u2019s R&D spend is reflective of the very real need to continually innovate in the face of such adversity and today protects thousands of brands from an increasingly diverse threat landscape. SiteProtect NG is a product that leverages the latest innovations in internet security and evolves to meet existing and future requirements.\u201d \nNeustar is giving clients more control and more functionality to build stronger defenses for their brands against DDoS attacks than ever before. The SiteProtect NG mitigation network combines innovative technologies and advancements from existing Neustar security solutions with powerful data traffic analytics powered by machine learning data analytics. This gives brands in-depth trend and attack analysis, leaving them with invaluable insights, which enable them to make smarter decisions about the configuration of their network security moving forward. \nAbout Neustar Security Solutions \nNeustar Security Solutions defend against network threats, inform you of potential network vulnerabilities, accelerate online asset performance, and monitor client website performance through multiple services and offerings.

The North's spokesman said Pompeo provoked the country by \"impudently criticizing our supreme leadership which is the heart of our people.\" advertisement \n\"The large-scale nuclear war exercises conducted by the U.S. in succession are creating touch-and-go situation on the Korean Peninsula and series of violent war remarks coming from the U.S. high-level politicians amid such circumstances have made an outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsula an established fact. The remaining question now is: when will the war break out,\" the spokesman said.

It has been particularly sensitive about B-1B bombers, describing them as \"nuclear strategic\" although the planes were switched to conventional weaponry in the mid-1990s. \nChina, North Korea's neighbor and lone major ally, again urged calm and said war was not the answer. advertisement \n\"We hope all relevant parties can maintain calm and restraint and take steps to alleviate tensions and not provoke each other,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement. \"The outbreak of war is not in any side's interest. The ones that will suffer the most are ordinary people.\" \nRelated: Microwave weapon could fry N. Korean missile controls \nTensions on the Korean Peninsula have risen markedly in recent months after North Korea's latest missile and nuclear tests, conducted in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and international condemnation. \nNorth Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and the United States and says its weapons program are necessary to counter American aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South . \nNorth Korea has said in public statements that it wants an official end to the Korean War. The conflict was halted by a 1953 armistice but no peace treaty has been signed. It also wants nothing short of full normalization of relations with the U.S. and to be treated with respect and as an equal in the global arena.

On a non-GAAP basis, the company\u2019s net income totalled 8.3 million dollars or 0.23 dollar per diluted share against 7.6 million dollars or 0.21 dollar per diluted share. \nCommenting on the third quarter results, Robert Wallstrom, Vera Bradley\u2019s CEO said in a statement: \u201cOur ability to implement certain expense reductions in conjunction with the initial implementation of our Vision 20/20 plan more quickly than originally expected, along with diligent expense management, drove third quarter EPS meaningfully ahead of our guidance.\u201d Third quarter result highlights \nCurrent year third quarter direct segment revenues totalled 83.2 million dollars, a 3.4 percent and comparable sales including e-commerce decreased 7.4 percent for the quarter reflecting a 6.9 percent decline in comparable store sales and an 8.6 percent decrease in e-commerce sales, which the company said, was partially offset by new store growth. The company opened one full-line store and seven factory outlet stores during the past 12 months. \nThe company added that indirect segment revenues decreased 23.8 percent to 30.9 million dollars reflecting a reduction in the number of specialty accounts coupled with a reduction in orders from both specialty accounts and certain key accounts. \nGross profit for the quarter was 63.8 million dollars or 55.9 percent of net revenues, compared to 72.9 million dollars or 57.6 percent of net revenues, in the prior year third quarter. The year-over-year 80 basis point gross profit decline, the company said, was primarily related to increased promotional activity at the company\u2019s factory outlet stores and channel mix changes, partially offset by a reduction in product cost, all of which caused the gross profit percentage to fall below the low end of the guidance range of 57.1 percent to 57.6 percent. \nThe company\u2019s operating income totalled 0.5 million dollars or 0.4 percent of net revenues compared to 11.4 million dollars or 9 percent of net revenues, in the prior year third quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, the company\u2019s operating income totalled 13 million dollars or 11.4 percent of net revenues compared to 12 million dollars or 9.5 percent of net revenues, in the prior year. Review of the nine month results \nCurrent year net revenues for the nine months totalled 322.6 million dollars compared to 351.1 million dollars in the prior year. Direct segment revenues were 241.3 million dollars, a 2 percent decrease from 246.3 million dollars in the prior year. Comparable sales including e-commerce decreased 7.7 percent for the period reflecting a 6.1 percent decline in comparable store sales and an 11.4 percent decrease in e-commerce sales. \nIndirect segment revenues for the nine months decreased 22.4 percent to 81.3 million dollars from 104.8 million dollars. Gross profit totalled 179.8 million dollars or 55.7 percent of net revenues, compared to 201 million dollars or 57.2 percent of net revenues, in the prior year. The company\u2019s operating loss was 0.6 million dollars or 0.2 percent of net revenues, in the current year nine month period, compared to operating income of 23.6 million dollars or 6.7 percent of net revenues, in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, the company\u2019s operating income was 17.1 million dollars or 5.3 percent of net revenues, compared to 26.7 million dollars or 7.6 percent of net revenues, in the prior year. Vera Bradley predicts Q4 and FY18 expectations \nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company expects net revenues of 127 million dollars to 132 million dollars compared to prior year fourth quarter revenues of 134.8 million dollars, a gross profit percentage of 55.4 percent to 55.8 percent compared to 55.7 percent in the prior year fourth quarter and diluted earnings per share of 0.30 dollar to 0.33 dollars. Net income totalled 3.5 million dollars or 0.09 dollar per diluted share, in the prior year fourth quarter and excluding charges, net income totalled 10.1 million dollars or 0.28 dollar per diluted share. \nFor fiscal 2018, the company expects net revenues of 450 million dollars to 455 million dollars compared to 485.9 million dollars last year, a gross profit percentage of 55.8 percent to 55.9 percent compared to 56.8 percent last year and diluted earnings per share of 0.57 dollar to 0.60 dollars.

Muigai did not name anyone but opposition leader Raila Odinga said in November he would be inaugurated by a people\u2019s assembly on Dec. 12, Kenya\u2019s Independence Day. \u201cThe criminal law of the Republic of Kenya stipulates that sort of process is high treason. \u201cIt is high treason of the persons involved, and any other person facilitating that process,\u201d he told a news conference. President Uhuru Kenyatta won a repeat presidential election on Oct. 26 that was boycotted by Mr. Odinga, who said it would not be free and fair. The Supreme Court nullified the first presidential election, in August, over irregularities. Kenyatta\u2019s speech acknowledged that the extended election season has divided Kenya, a Western ally in a volatile region, and blunted growth in East Africa\u2019s richest economy. \u201cThe elections are now firmly behind us \u2026 I will devote my time and energy to build bridges,\u201d Kenyatta told the rapturous crowd in a sports stadium in the capital of Nairobi as he formally began his second, five-year term. He said Kenyans needed to \u201cfree ourselves from the baggage of past grievances, and \u2026 keep to the rule of law\u201d. Supporters of Kenyatta, who won with 98 per cent of the vote after Odinga\u2019s boycott, want him to engage in talks and move on.

Last month, Zoona also scooped the Agent Chain Development Award at the UNCDF Digital Chikwama Awards in Zambia \nCommenting in the same statement, Zoona\u2019s head of people Erica Hannath said the awards were a result of the company\u2019s investment into its culture, which she said the startup regarded as an asset. \nShe added the awards will help Zoona attract top talent that would assist the company to \u201d help communities thrive\u201d. \nThe awards come on the back of Zoona\u2019s CEO Mike Quinn having received Accion\u2019s Edward W Claugus Award for Social Entrepreneurship. \nLast month, the company was also recognised for its work in improving financial inclusion in Zambia at the UN Capital Development Fund \u2018s Digital Chikwama Awards where it won the Agent Chain Development Award . \nFeatured image: Zoona marketing head Lelemba Phiri accepting the startup\u2019s award at the World Marketing Congress.
