Asian shares hovered above two-month lows as some high-tech bellwethers bounced back after a searing sell-off although softer oil and copper prices and uncertainty over U.S. policy kept many investors cautious. Investors are looking to final tax reform legislation in the United States, where a potential U.S. government shutdown looms if Congress fails to agree on a spending package. Singapore's FTSE Straits Times Index, which had shed 1.5 percent this week as of Wednesday's close, closed 0.3 percent lower. \"Yesterday was quite bad\u00e2\u0080\u015a I guess it was part of the broader selloff\u00e2\u0080\u015a So I think now it's just waiting for the next catalyst, which is the Senate and House having to reconcile their tax bill,\" said Joel Ng, an analyst at KGI Securities in Singapore. Jardine Matheson Holdings dropped 2.2 percent and Jardine Strategic Holdings declined 2.9 percent. However, property stocks rose with City Developments climbing 4.6 percent. \"They are probably rangebound at this level, so I think you are starting to see investors coming in, in view of the positive outlook over the next few years for property,\" Ng added. Philippine shares closed more than half a percent higher, helped by gains in telecom and energy stocks. PLDT Inc rose 1.7 percent, while Semirara Mining and Power Corp jumped 7 percent. Indonesian shares closed 0.5 percent lower, snapping three consecutive sessions of gains, with financials leading the decline. An index of the country's 45 most liquid stocks dropped 0.6 percent. Malaysian stocks closed little changed with a 6 percent rise in Sime Darby Plantation negating losses in Telekom Malaysia and IJM Corp Bhd. Vietnam dropped 1 percent, extending falls into a third session, hurt by losses in Vietnam Dairy Products JSC and Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp.

Not at all. Winter is our busiest time of year at work and because of this I haven't had a minute to myself lately - my life has just been work, work, work - oh and taking my son to rugby on a weekend too - if I wasn't working of course. My beard got all out of control due to neglect and I've only just managed to get it sorted out - check out this little video I recently published testing out my new electrical shaver. My skins feels old, which I'm not sure even makes sense but when look in the mirror all I see right now is \"old\". It's getting alittle out of control really. Don't get me wrong I don't want you to think that I haven't been washing myself or anything because I have - I don't stink or anything - I just haven't been following my usual, quite time consuming (when you have no time spare) grooming routine. But this all changed a few weeks ago when the guys over at Murdock London sent me a few of their fantastic male grooming products to try for me to let them - and you guys too of course - know what I thought about them. First though let me tell you a little bit about them which may be very helpful if you didn't already know anything. Now if you are really into your grooming products you may know of them already, especially if you are from London you may know of their barber shops which are dotted around the capital. I know for sure if I lived down South then I would definitely have paid them a visit by now but being a Northerner it's quite an impossibility really. So, in 2006 the first Murdock London barbershop was established in Shoreditch and it offered grooming treatments for gentlemen with really good taste who were dissatisfied with unisex salons and high street barbers. They wanted to create a grooming experience inspired by the grand heritage of St James. 'Barbershops but tailored for modern, style-conscius men' And when I first received the products I could see this style conscious element running through them straight away - my initial thought when I opened the box was that everything looked very luxurious, from the packaging to the bottles and the tubs the products were housed in - it was all very high end. Then, when I opened up the products the scent of them (at the time I didn't know the price of any of the items) just screamed luxury and I knew instantly that they were going to cost a little more than your average products. (and, after research, I was correct!) In total I was sent five products, I can only give you my honest opinion on three because I haven't used the the two shaving products as I am currently reviewing some others and haven't had chance to use these yet, but don't worry, I am quite sure they will feature on another post just after Christmas. So first up two products that I have been using to style my hair. I don't know about you but when my hair is styled I feel like a different person, my confidence is high and I just feel really good about myself, so having the correct products is a must. My hair is quite thick and I have a natural curl but I do like to wear my hair slicked back a little, so to achieve this I need products which are going to have a really good hold and ones which (normally anyway) have no moisture to them. I find I need to use a couple of products at once to create the hold that is required to last me through the day too. And the two products I have been using from the Murdock London range are the Sea Salt Spray and the Matt Mudd . Now I've used quite a few mudds before but I've never used a Sea Salt Spay, so this was quite new to me. The Sea Salt Spray contains tangerine, orange and lemon oils and obviously sea salts which is why the spray smells so nice - it's almost a smell you wish you could eat. You can apply the spray to wet or dry hair - I used it with dry hair and then I used a blow dryer to comb it through. I found this helped to straighten my hair giving it the pushed back look I was after and I did this a few times to get it as straight as possible and also to get rid of any excess moisture left over (otherwise the curls/frizz comes back full force). Then I added alittle of the Matt Mudd - which has a high hold rate and should only be used on dry hair. Once again I combed it through to give my style the shape I wanted and then added a little bit more at the end to give it a final finish. I'm really happy with the products, the photo above was taken around eight hours after using them and whilst my hair wasn't as slicked back as it was at the start of the day, the hold was definitely still there. Up next is a product I have had a bit of love-hate relationship with over the last few years and this is beard oil. If you have been following my blog for a number of years then you will know that I used to write about beard oils loads and I will still say that the products did help me with my beard growth journey but because I had so many of them I just became bored with them and stopped using them for a while. So now, if a beard oil features on my blog then you guys will know it's because I really like it. The Murdock London Beard Oil is just like the other products in the set - it looked great, it smelt great and looked full of quality. Now the oil itself contains apricot, jojoba, organic argan and sunflower oils with extracts of calendula flower. The oil has a light weight formula, hand crafted for over two years to ensure a rich, conditioning and nutritive treatment is created. I've used this oil a few times now and it does do what any good beard oil should - it gave my beard a good look by helping it hold its shape when I gave it a brush, it gave a slight shine and also conditioned the skin under my beard, helpingto keep the itch at bay and also helping leave me with no dry skin.

Practically everybody wishes to be rid of his most glaring and destructive handicaps. No one wants to be so proud that he is scorned as a braggart, nor so greedy that he is labeled a thief. No one wants to be angry enough to murder, lustful enough to rape, gluttonous enough to ruin his health. No one wants to be agonized by the chronic pain of envy or to be paralyzed by sloth. Of course, most human beings don't suffer these defects at these rock-bottom levels.\n\np. 66 \n\nTwenty-Four Hours \nA.A. Thought For The Day\n\nWhen people come back to A.A. after having a slip, the\ntemptation is strong to say nothing about it. No other\nA.A. member should force them to declare themselves. It is\nentirely up to them. If they are well-grounded in A.A., they\nwill realize that it's up to them to speak up at the\nnext meeting and tell about their slip. There is no\npossible evasion of this duty, if they are thoroughly honest\nand really desirous of living the A.A. way again. When they\nhave done it, their old confidence returns. They are home again.\nTheir slip should not be mentioned again by others. They are\nagain a good member of A.A. Am I tolerant of other\npeoples' mistakes?\n\nMeditation For The Day\n\nIt is in the union of a soul with God that strength, new\nlife and spiritual power come. Bread sustains the body but\nwe cannot live by bread alone. To try to do God's will is\nthe meat and support of true living. We feed on that\nspiritual food. Soul starvation comes from failing to do\nso. The world talks about bodies that are undernourished.\nWhat of the souls that are undernourished? Strength and\npeace come from partaking of spiritual food.\n\nPrayer For The Day\n\nI pray that I may not try to live by bread alone.\nI pray that my spirit may live by trying to do the will\nof God as I understand it. \n\nDaily Thought ^*^*^*^*^ \n(\\   ~~   /)\n(    \\( AA )/    )\n(_ / AA \\ _)\n/ AA \\ \n^*^*^*^*^ \nDiagnosis \n\n\" W e do not like to pronounce any individual as alcoholic, but you can quickly diagnose yourself.

True ambition is the deep desire to live usefully and walk humbly under the grace of God. TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, pp. 124-25 \nDuring my drinking years, my one and only concern was to have my fellow man think highly of me. My ambition in everything I did was to have the power to be at the top. My inner self kept telling me something else but I couldn't accept it. I didn't even allow myself to realize that I wore a mask continually. Finally, when the mask came off and I cried out to the only God I could conceive, the Fellowship of A.A., my group and the Twelve Steps were there. I learned how to change resentments into acceptance, fear into hope and anger into love. I have learned also, through loving without undue expectations, through sharing my concerns and caring for my fellow man, that each day can be joyous and fruitful. I begin and end my day with thanks to God, who has so generously shed His grace on me. \n\n\nPot Luck \nBetter Relationships \n\nI pray for the opportunity to form better relationships now that I am in recovery. \nThe Program has revealed a need to completely overhaul my attitudes about intimate and personal relationships. \nMost of the time I never really needed better partners, I just needed to be a better person. \nYou are reading from the book: The 12 Step Prayer Book Volume 2 by Bill P. and Lisa D. \n\n\nSpeaker Recordings \nWee Willie\u2019s Sobriety First Media AA CD\u2019s Literature and tapes https://www.mediafire.com/sobrietyfirst \nThe Lights are On http://xa-speakers.org/ \nAA Speaker Tapes http://www.aaspeakers.org/AA_Speaker_Tapes \nRecovery Speakers http://recoveryspeakers.com/ \n\nARCHIVES \n*NEW* http://www.bigbookfordummies.com/ An On-Line Study Resource \nDaily Meditations Group Home http://groups.google.com/group/Your_Daily_Reprieve?hl=en \n\nDaily Meditations Archive http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/7AMmeeting/ \nBlog http://todaysreprieve.blogspot.com/ \n\n\nYour Daily Reprieve is now on Facebook It is a PRIVATE GROUP https://www.facebook.com/groups/yourdailyreprieve/ To be added, email: txm1@comcast.net Please share your wisdom, anecdotes and travels with other members of Your Daily Reprieve. \nTwitter https://twitter.com/YourDailyReprie \n\nAA Membership Survey (2014) http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-48_membershipsurvey.pdf \n2015 http://www.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk/Members/2015-Membership-Survey/Survey-Results-Page-2 \n\n\nMeditation Resources \nhttp://www.peterrussell.com/TV/3Min.php \n\nLoving Kindness Meditations \nWith Music \nhttp://www.excelatlife.com/mp3/direct_download.php?file=lovingkindnessmusic.mp3 \n\nVoice only http://www.excelatlife.com/mp3/direct_download.php?file=lovingkindness.mp3 \nFree Guided Meditations http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22 \n\n\nResources \nGreat Minds Quotes https://twitter.com/GreatestQuotes \nBIG BOOK SEARCH ENGINE: http://www.whytehou se.com/big_ book_search/ \nTwenty Four Hours a Day Since 1954, Twenty-Four Hours a Day has become a stable force in the recovery of many alcoholics throughout the world.

7 MINUTES AGO WETHERSFIELD, Conn. \nA Connecticut town's feathered celebrity has been taken back to his natural habitat. \nKevin the Turkey wandered freely in Wethersfield for years.

Maybe seven or eight years ago if we decide to raise taxes. Highly unlikely. But in the here and now, and next year after this tax bill gets passed, working families are going to get a tax cut. How on Earth can you look at a standard deduction doubling -- okay, we're going from $6,000 to $12000 per individual and $24,000 per family. What does it mean? That standard deduction means that that money isn't going to get taxed. So we're increasing the number of people who will not pay taxes. One of the brackets we haven't talked about that I think we should are the number of people who go to a zero tax bracket under the Senate noon and to a large - under the Senate plan and to a large extend under the House plan.\" \n\nSenator Durbin: (2:37 p.m) Spoke on DACA. \"They weren't American citizens, but they joined our military willing to sacrifice their lives in defense of a country that doesn't legally recognize them as lawful immigrants. 900 of them did that, signed up for America's military. 20,000 of them became teachers in schools all across the United States. Most of them are students working because they can't qualify for federal assistance to go to school, and there are some amazing stories. So there they were kind of in limbo, half here, half not here, uncertain about their future but the protection of that executive order. President Trump came in and said it's over.\" \n\nSenator King: (2:45 p.m) Spoke on tax reform. \"It's a shift of the tax from you to your kids. You're on your deathbed, you're lying there, and you say to your children, come on over, I'll give you my last words. They come over, they are listening, they want wisdom. What they say is, here's the credit card, we had a great trip to Acapulco - we had a great trip, you can pay for it. That's what we're doing in this bill. It's wrong and it's not necessary. It's not necessary. And I think one of the questions that we're going to have to ask and answer and we're going to see it, it's going to play out is, what are companies going to do with this new-found income when the taxes are cut dramatically from 25% to 30%, is that money going to go into wages?\" \n\nSenator Stabenow: (2:58 p.m) Spoke on tax reform. \"That's the promise that has been made over and over again to working men and women, that these cuts being made and changes being made will result in $4,000 in increased wages in people's pockets. I think they have the right to know that the majority means it when they say it and to make sure that is written into the final bill. The reason for this motion is very clear. As I indicated, Republicans have promised American families that an increase in income from $4,000, $7,000, even $9,000 increases in wages. I think that is great. I would strongly support that. There is no evidence that this approach would do that and so far have not put language in that will happen for middle-class working families. President trump has called this a great big, beautiful Christmas present for the American people. I would argue in reality, it is a great big Christmas present for the wealthiest 1%.\" Related Items", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tillis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stabenow", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "durbin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "acapulco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:49.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0ff8461934274a49eb8bf221eb440836c4405a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_bkUMJ8iPPIdEfyDZRAQ7X9wgb6mAUIe2jSh3E68Nxkmo3CAsUvLCyhZWIvc53EAnsCxWoEGYA.hinin828o8NrV1AIMk7bNze1iwoOCOksQw8Zo_F.fNAMmB05q4r7DrA--", "site_full": "forums.androidcentral.com", "site": "androidcentral.com", "site_section": "http://forums.androidcentral.com/external.php?type=RSS2", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "Android Forums at AndroidCentral.com", "title": "What is the message at the bottom of the screen when someone calls you?", "title_full": "What is the message at the bottom of the screen when someone calls you?", "published": "2017-12-07T10:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1053, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0ff8461934274a49eb8bf221eb440836c4405a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_bkUMJ8iPPIdEfyDZRAQ7X9wgb6mAUIe2jSh3E68Nxkmo3CAsUvLCyhZWIvc53EAnsCxWoEGYA.hinin828o8NrV1AIMk7bNze1iwoOCOksQw8Zo_F.fNAMmB05q4r7DrA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Android Central Question", "published": "2017-12-07T10:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "What is the message at the bottom of the screen when someone calls you?", "text": "What is the message at the bottom of the screen when someone calls you?

They have reinvested in cheaper financial shares, which are set to benefit from the U.S. tax cuts plan. \nOil and gas stocks which had weighed overnight on indices in the United States and Asia were also slightly in positive territory, up 0.2 percent after oil prices gradually edged up. \nShares in Steinhoff plunged more than 30 percent, extending dramatic losses of over 60 percent suffered during the previous session after the South African retailer revealed accounting irregularities and its chief executive quit. \nIn London, shares in Ladbrokes Coral surged 28 percent after Bookmaker GVC Holdings said it had offered up to 3.9 billion pounds ($5.2 billion) to create a betting giant. \nRoche shares were flat after it announced that adding its immunotherapy Tecentriq to older drugs doubled the percentage of lung cancer patients who survived a year without their disease advancing. \nCarrefour lost 2.8 percent, the worst performance of Paris' CAC 40 after a downgrade by broker Berenberg. \nIn the telecoms sector, French operator Orange was up 1.5 percent after plans to add customers and boost profit margins through to 2020 by investing on its networks rather than buying foreign rivals or media content, it said on Thursday.

But strategists said the currency would trade in narrow ranges until the release of the closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday. \nBitcoin soared to a record high of more than $14,500, up almost 7 percent on the day and continuing a staggering surge from less than $1,000 at the beginning of the year. \nSTOCKS RECOVER \nEuropean stock markets appeared to take their cues from a general recovery in tech stocks overnight in Asia and Wall Street. \nThe pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.2 percent with tech stocks initially up 0.5 percent. Financials, industrials and healthcare shares also added points to the index. \n\"We have seen some aggressive moves in Asia, whereas Europe seems to be a bit more subdued,\" said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets in London. \n\"It's almost like European markets look for an excuse to selloff but it takes them a lot to be convinced to actually push higher.\" \nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets \nShares in the energy sector, which weighed on shares earlier in Wall Street and Asia, rose in Europe, as oil prices recovered from a big fall on Wednesday. \nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded at $56.13 per barrel in European trade, up 0.3 percent on the day. \nBrent futures gained 0.4 percent to $61.45 per barrel. \nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.2 percent as some technology bellwethers rebounded, with Tencent rising over 3 percent and Alibaba more than 2 percent. \nIn Japan, the Nikkei jumped 1.5 percent, recouping much of its 2.0 percent loss the previous day, which was its biggest fall since late March. \nThe price of copper, seen as a barometer of global economic health because of its extensive industrial use, also fell sharply earlier this week, raising worries about the world growth outlook. \nCopper traded at $6,576 a tonne, up 0.5 percent on the day and above a two-month low of $6,507.5 touched on Tuesday. \n(Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Jemima Kelly in London) SEARCH", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david madden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ritvik carvalho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jemima kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ritvik carvalho  london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jane foley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tencent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cmc markets in london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabobank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia-pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:50.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "20d9264b159075f93d73058243c79d51a9df3848", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz7BlhxJztBdnC0bGyhzSaBpo9Cw300n39f4qNah5RF4.kOi6rbksq65TrS5ggZ_hw-", "site_full": "forum.mensdivorce.com", "site": "mensdivorce.com", "site_section": "http://forum.mensdivorce.com/viewforum.php?f=4", "site_categories": ["divorce_support", "non_standard_content", "adult", "social"], "section_title": "Divorce Forum and Child Custody Forum \u2022 View forum - Before and During Divorce Forum", "title": "Bearing it ALl", "title_full": "Divorce Forum and Child Custody Forum \u2022 View topic - Bearing it ALl", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ea4b0b939a6fd5f0fee6ec3e20b168504953ad9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz7BlhxJztBdnC0bGyhzSaBpo9Cw300n39f4qNah5RF4.kOi6rbksq6Zu9vegcR92IYSTJxdHLWBg--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Somdomguy", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Key thing to note.

Mr. President, another thing that's been going on has been the tremendous relief from Washington regulations that Republicans are providing. You know, I think a lot of people lost track of exactly how much damage Democrats in the Obama Administration had been doing to the American economy. The Obama Administration added 285 major regulations during the course of the previous administration. Every one of them imposed a burden on Americans. The total cost of these, $122 billion per year. Now, that's both the direct cost in terms of the money and also counting the time, the time it needed to fill out paperwork created by these excessive rules.\" \n\nSenator Reed: (1:02 p.m) Spoke on DACA. \"Here was no reason throw nearly 800,000 dreamers and their families into uncertainty.

Now, these young people who are American in every way but on paper maybe forced - may be forced to be uprooted and moved to countries that that are wholly foreign to them.

The wing also urged Zaid, who is a DAP member, to refrain from repeating the same mistake in the future. \u201cMalay leaders of all political parties must set a good example and be courteous when talking about the royal institution as per the Rukun Negara,\u201d it added. \n\nSpeaking to  Malaysiakini  yesterday, Zaid, when asked if he would  apologise  to Sultan Sharafuddin ( photo ), said he was merely following the Islamic tradition of offering sincere advice to leaders. \"The Caliph Umar once encouraged citizens to provide advice. He said 'If I stray from the right path, you have to tell me',\" he added. Sultan Sharafuddin has since rebuked Zaid over his remarks which the ruler described as being rude. The ruler also told the Kelantan-born politician to  return  to the east coast state if he disagreed with him. Zaid courted flak over his response to the sultan's criticism of Mahathir, including his  warning  that the former premier's anger could raze the nation. After tweeting a  Malaysiakini  report on the sultan's remarks, Zaid said: \"Selangor Sultan should be careful with his words. No one is immune when the country burns. \"When some rulers play politics; they must know the consequences. Don't think there's no price for partisanship.\" \n\nYesterday, Sungai Besar Umno chief  torched  cardboard cutouts of Zaid, accusing the former minister of being insolent. Selangor Umno has planned to hold a  public rally  over the weekend to express support for the ruler and called on the police to investigate Zaid under the Sedition Act. 'No need to prolong this issue, there are more important matters' Meanwhile, Selangor Bersatu Youth defended Mahathir with regard to his \u201cBugis pirates\u201d remark which led to the sultan reprimanding the former premier. \u201cWe are certain Mahathir did not intend to hurt the feelings of any quarters nor deliberately act in a rude manner towards the sultan. \u201cThere have been several police reports filed regarding Mahathir's statement and an investigation is ongoing. \n\n\u201cWe will respect whatever decision is made (based on the probe) and request the public not to be hasty in judging the true meaning of Mahathir's statement before the investigation is concluded,\u201d it added. Mahathir ( photo ) has claimed that his \u201cBugis pirate\u201d remark was aimed at Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak and not the entire community. Selangor Bersatu Youth also requested for the matter to be resolved in the best manner possible, and urged that the process is expedited to prevent irresponsible quarters from using this as political fodder and dragging the ruler into partisan politics. \u201cWe feel there is no need to prolong this issue as there are numerous other issues affecting the people which require greater attention such as widespread corruption, the increase in living cost, leaders abusing their powers and many more,\u201d it added.- Mkini ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zaid ibrahim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zaid   selangor bersatu youth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "- mkini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysiakini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir mohamad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sultan sharafuddin idris shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib abdul razak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sultan sharafuddin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "selangor bersatu youth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sungai besar umno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rukun negara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "selangor umno", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:51.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc86f80022703f532501b7b887bbe1dba169cd44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9NvLNeQWBDUSDboUDq9Bz7wDVtTC3uezMLOeN4fIDzVPjtkUUmn9._EHXzISqv4Axa.79Q.sc7orBUPJn0yPv_QA-", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java?page=5&sort=newest&pagesize=30&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'java' Questions - Page 5 - Stack Overflow", "title": "java - maven download plugin to add downloaded resource to jar", "title_full": "java - maven download plugin to add downloaded resource to jar - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.027, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d88fca0581a872d470f4e50c574a0675dd134642", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9NvLNeQWBDUSDboUDq9Bz7wDVtTC3uezMLOeN4fIDzVPjtkUUmn9._EHXzISqv4Axa.79Q.sc7orBsTXeQUHVuBpnnnjO3vNqKw--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "answered 2 hours ago", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Just download it to ${basedir}/target/classes before packaging phase.

Last week when the bill passed, I said it wasn't just about changing the trajectory of our economy. It's about changing the future we hand to our kids and our grandkids. I really think, Mr. President, that's what this bill will do. Lots of talk in Washington about things that, frankly, will never turn out to be the facts that we're hearing. Maybe they're the alternative facts. But one thing I think will happen is working families will see in one of their first paychecks next year that this tax bill, these tax cuts really affect them.\" \n\nSenator Capito: (1:59 p.m) Spoke on the reauthorization of CHIP. \"In my state of West Virginia, a smaller state, 22,000 children are in the West Virginia CHIP program, and that includes over 10,000 families, and it is essential for these working families, and it's essential that we recognize that some working families are unable to get insurance. Maybe they can get it for the person who is working or the spouse, but a lot of times it's prohibitive to get the insurance for the children at the same time. That's where CHIP comes in. It's preventative. It's for sickness and illness. And it has really helped, I think, the - increase the health of our young people in the state of West Virginia. I was pleased that the bill passed out of the Finance Committee with strong bipartisan support, and I want to thank them for their efforts.\" Spoke on tax reform. \"I voted for the bill because it cuts taxes for folks in all income brackets. These are the people who are tired of Washington telling them how to spend their hardworking dollars, or even yet Washington spending their hardworking dollars for them. Now we are telling these hardworking men and women that they can keep more of their own dollars to make those decisions. They can decide how to spend it. Not a novel idea, but I think very welcome increase in our tax dollars coming home are going to be welcomed by every individual family. So whether they are spending it on something that helps them today or tomorrow or whether they are saving for the future, let's make that decision.\" \n\nSenator Hoeven: (2:11 p.m) Spoke on tax reform. \"Through the combination, not just tax relief but the combination of tax relief and the regulatory relief that we have done through the course of this year. It's that regulatory relief and that tax relief that really empowers our small businesses across the country, which is really the backbone of our economy. We're talking farmers, we're talking ranchers, we're talking small businesses of all kinds. We're talking entrepreneurs. We're talking innovators. We're talking about the job creators in this country creating more jobs and opportunity, and the wage earners and the workers benefiting through lower taxes and higher wages.

Echoing Kuala Lumpur mayor Mohd Amin Nordin Abdul Aziz, See-to said yesterday that the sale of the 7.5-acre Residensi Desa Satumas land at below market value was  justified , as it would be used to accommodate the Federal Territories Housing Scheme (Rumawip) social housing project. However, Kok contended in a statement today that the \u201csocial housing card\u201d is only played when below market value sales are highlighted. \u201cOtherwise (these sales) are shrouded under blurred secrecy, and as such undermine the general principle of public authorities\u2019 transparency, and the legal requirement under the Planning Act, to promptly produce structure plans,\u201d she said. The DAP lawmaker also claimed that Rumawip \u2013 along with the Federal Territories Ministry\u2019s welfare arm, Yayasan Wilayah Persekutuan \u2013 are used as excuses to \u201cbreak all government procedures and regulations,\u201d such as in the sale of Residensi Desa Satumas. \n\n\u201cIn the absence of the KL City Plan 2020, we have seen DBKL, with impunity, taking away green areas like children's playgrounds and football fields for developers to build highrise buildings under the excuse of building Rumawip. \u201cOn top of that, this local council has also been directed by the Federal Territories Ministry to approve condominiums and privatisation projects under the pretext of Yayasan Wilayah Persekutuan. A laudable aim, but... Kok insisted that although the construction of more Rumawip in the city is a laudable aim in theory, its implementation nevertheless left a lot to be desired. \u201cIncreasing population via building more Rumawip in Kuala Lumpur will not only increase the hardship of the KL folk, but it will definitely exacerbate traffic snarls and further congestion in the capital city of Malaysia. \u201cRumawip is a good plan for the rakyat, but the implementation of it, with no consultation of the rakyat and us as MPs, is one of the major grouses of city dwellers, who have channelled such anger and frustration to us to raise. In her statement, Kok also reiterated her call for MACC to investigate the Residensi Desa Satumas sale, following  a report  lodged by Taman Desa resident Edmund Teoh yesterday. The basis of Teoh\u2019s report was the 2016 Auditor-General's Report itself, which highlighted non-compliance with standard procedures in the land sale.
