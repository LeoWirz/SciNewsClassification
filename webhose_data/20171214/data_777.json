The color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high,\" into the color that means \"extreme.\"\n\"The forecast for tomorrow (Thursday) is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\"\nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure almost certain to grow.\nBut hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday, reports CBS Los Angeles .\n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will (be) no ability to fight fires.\"\nCategory 1 hurricanes have maximum sustained winds ranging between 74 and 95 mph.\nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away.\nView Gallery Flames of a wildfire are seen from the 405 highway in Los Angeles, California, Dec. 6, 2017, in this picture obtained from social media.\nTwitter/MAJORCA @CoCo_Mayo76/ via Reuters Millions of cellphones buzzed loudly Wednesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger.\nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero.\nThe alert, with a long, loud tone, startled users on social media, who were quick to comment on the message. Some responses were serious, reports CBS Los Angeles . Some were less so.\nEmergency wildfires alert sent to many L.A.-area residents on December 6, 2017\nCBS Los Angeles The station is updating viewers with the latest on all the major wildfires .\nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire known as the Thomas Fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Wednesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee.\n\"I was expecting, you know, this year to see snow on that mountain, and now the thing's on fire,\" Jake Sandell said.\nAs the Thomas Fire inched west toward Santa Barbara County, one man pulled over on the side of Highway 1 in La Conchita and rushed to rescue an animal, \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Jeff Glor reports.\nOn Thursday morning, officials closed U.S. 101 for more than a dozen miles along the coast, cutting off a major route between Ventura and Santa Barbara counties as fire charred heavy brush along lanes.\nUS 101 is closed in both directions between Carpinteria and Ventura. With S/R 150 also closed between Carpinteria and Ojai, there is no viable route between Santa Barbara and Ventura. Avoid the area. #ThomasFire\n\u2014 Ventura Co. Sheriff (@VENTURASHERIFF) December 7, 2017 The wilder winds could easily make new fires explode too, as one known as the Skirball Fire did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles.\nFew flames were visible late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes.\nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres of vines, a spokeswoman said.\nWhere the California wildfires are expected to strike.\nCBS News Across the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. UCLA canceled Thursday classes.\nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses.\nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again.\n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Or if that\u2019s not your style, you may have found your perfect match in the form of another student at Exeter, and are longing for the days when you get that (suspiciously) free wedding ceremony at Reed Hall. Either way, you\u2019re probably having sex. So, just in time for the Christmas ball shenanigans and end of term blow outs, here is a bit of information on how to keep your sexual health in fighting shape ready for the Christmas holidays and the New Year. \nSidwell Walk-In Health Centre aka The Holy Grail \nSidwell Walk-In health centre is a widely unacknowledged haven of sexual health in Exeter, and even as a third year, there are many people who have never used its services. It\u2019s pretty self-explanatory, you can walk in at any point during their open times and get most services for sexual health including STI testing, blood tests, pregnancy tests and contraception. The only time you won\u2019t be able to get tested for STIs Saturday mornings. Naturally, depending on the time you go determines how long you\u2019ll have to wait to be called in. Sometimes, if it\u2019s really busy, you can call up to book an appointment and they\u2019ll fit you in within the next 24 hours. \nHere is a list of all the services they can provide. Information and advice on contraception and sexual health related problems. Emergency contraception up to 5 days after unprotected sex (and sometimes beyond). All methods of contraception including: Pills Patches Injections Implants Coils \u2013 IUDs/IUS. Free Condoms. Unplanned pregnancy advice and onwards referral. Advice and Information about fertility and sterilisation. Testing for all sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Diagnosis and treatment of all STIs including warts, herpes, male urethritis, Chlamydia and Gonorrohoea. Diagnosis of non-STI genital conditions including bacterial vaginosis, 'thrush' (candida), male balanitis. Hepatitis vaccination where appropriate. Care for people living with HIV. Management of genital skin problems. Care for patients who have been sexually assaulted / raped. Help with sexual problems. \n\n\nNot only do they provide all of these services, but the nurses are amazing too. Confronting issues surrounding your sexual health can be a really intimidating experience, especially if it\u2019s your first time and (shocker) you weren\u2019t educated about it in school. However, all the nurses are so encouraging and proud of the fact that you\u2019re being responsible and looking after your body. There\u2019s always an expectation that you\u2019ll be shamed into abstinence or they\u2019re going to announce to the whole staff/everyone you\u2019ve ever met what you\u2019re telling them in the office, but that\u2019s simply not the case. They\u2019re just pleased that you\u2019re safe or are at least taking the actions to be safe in the future. If anything, they\u2019ve almost always heard worse stories than what you\u2019re about to tell them and you most definitely are not the only one who didn\u2019t use a condom/had a one night stand/slept with someone and never spoke to them again. Honestly, it\u2019s all good, we\u2019ve all been there. \nRating: 10/10 would recommend. \nHere is a link to any more information you might need regarding services, or contacting the team at the clinic. \n\nStudent Health Centre (on campus) \nThe fear of running into someone you know when you\u2019re about to get an STI/pregnancy test or pick up your fresh pack of contraception is enough to put anyone off a visit, however, the student health centre is a really convenient way to keep in touch with your sexual health. \nServices include:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "holy grail  sidwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sidwell walk-in health centre", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "exeter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gonorrohoea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reed hall", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:05.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bbd378d1ab8061672650603faf77de9a59a25474", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQXXg92yMXZtLj7DY17c9QXBYJ58uL4R3OJQlwbiNL50WTXNFb0VjsY2ObzUiSbulVDyAEoArMoSAEG4wh1FsFZCqvVlE_87MH5G.5vM.lPywoPfCGsp3Ds", "site_full": "www.hercampus.com", "site": "hercampus.com", "site_section": "http://www.hercampus.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["sexuality", "college_life", "social", "health", "teens", "education"], "section_title": "Her Campus", "title": "Animal Collective's ninth EP throws indie pop out the door", "title_full": "Animal Collective's ninth EP throws indie pop out the door", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn2.hercampus.com/meetingofthewaters1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 16752, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bbd378d1ab8061672650603faf77de9a59a25474", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQXXg92yMXZtLj7DY17c9QXBYJ58uL4R3OJQlwbiNL50WTXNFb0VjsY2ObzUiSbulVDyAEoArMoSAEG4wh1FsFZCqvVlE_87MH5G.5vM.lPywoPfCGsp3Ds", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Oregon Contributor", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "Animal Collective's ninth EP throws indie pop out the door", "text": "Portland Share this article \nEven with a 2016 album followed by a current worldwide tour, Animal Collective is back again with a four track EP that packs a creative punch. Titled \u201cMeeting of the Waters,\u201d the collection of songs, released May 5, feels like an expedition through South America\u2019s deepest swampland. With atmospheric electronic sounds paired with quite literal nature elements, the EP will no doubt be another cult classic amid their discography. \nThe first track, \u201cBlue Nose\u201d may be a little too lengthy (it clocks in at 13 minutes and 20 seconds) with its guitar strumming and repetitive sampling; but the weirdness of \u201cAmazonawana / Anaconda Opportunity\u201d and \u201cSelection of a Place,\u201d mixed with the silky, melodic voice work on \u201cMan of Oil,\u201d the album sustains the band\u2019s renowned obscurity.

It is justifiable to relax and have time off in order to not feel stressed but it is also just as important to still do your work and feel on top of things. So, we\u2019ve got some tips for you to make sure you increase your productivity. \nSet smaller, daily goals. \nIf you have an essay, don\u2019t just write down on your planner \u201cdo essay\u201d, break it down into small, manageable tasks such as \u201cIntroduction\u201d, \u201c1st paragraph\u201d etc so you can see the essay slowly develop over time (alongside the satisfaction of highlighting too much). \nMake sure to get enough sleep \nIt is easy to lose sleep \u2013 whether it\u2019s clubbing, chatting too much with friends or watching hilarious dog videos. However, you know the amount of sleep you need to function in a day so it is vital to maintain that number of hours of sleep or else you\u2019ll find yourself dozing off in lectures and not understanding a thing (and midday napping will eventually be a thing). \nPlan each day the night before \nJust spend 15 minutes before you sleep creating a to-do list for the next day and sorting it out to figure out what needs to get done. You\u2019ll be able to wake up the next day with a clear mindset, ready to go. \nMinimise distractions \nYou\u2019ve probably heard this incessantly but I cannot stress how true it is to minimise any distractions. Nowadays, our phones are constantly glued to our hands and all of the work we do is from computers so it may seem that there\u2019s no way to escape the realms of social media and the Internet. However, turn your phone off for an hour and download an app which blocks certain websites on your laptop for a certain amount of time and you\u2019ll find yourself more focused than ever. \nHave a motivating view \nWhether it\u2019s in your room or Billy B, it\u2019s more inspiring to have a new location to work in and a lot of sunlight. Make sure you have a lot of space to put all your books/laptop on and it\u2019ll keep you motivated during the day. \nTake care of yourself \nWhilst I may have stressed in the previous points on how important productivity is, you have to take care of yourself (whether it means putting a face mask on and having a night off or over-indulging in a pepperoni pizza) and feel good. No one likes feeling burnt out so don\u2019t feel guilty if you\u2019re a day behind your schedule.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "billy b", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:05.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "01635ebef77c06965676244298c57e2dc63b0f5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poyCpL7VKQhzhw8kpFvy718gmA0Tqgx6QeB2cgKSKUgy3PtvR6P6CbvVM_ljsMDyFkie97B6gyGU4UfZ1rjtBRzvj.eFqKNTqQpirpREGqj3LEAJLs1e9TbL", "site_full": "infowebsitetraffic.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://infowebsitetraffic.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Website Traffic", "title": "Google Alert - website value +\"website traffic\"", "title_full": "Google Alert - website value +\"website traffic\"", "published": "2017-12-07T12:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "01635ebef77c06965676244298c57e2dc63b0f5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poyCpL7VKQhzhw8kpFvy718gmA0Tqgx6QeB2cgKSKUgy3PtvR6P6CbvVM_ljsMDyFkie97B6gyGU4UfZ1rjtBRzvj.eFqKNTqQpirpREGqj3LEAJLs1e9TbL", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rachmad baso (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - website value +\"website traffic\"", "text": "website value +\"website traffic\" As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 WEB Viratkohli.club Mysitewealth Viratkohli.club is 3 years, 7 months & 4 days old.

Its uses in gout treatment.", "text": "Losartan for gout. The anti- hypertensive that's also good for gout \nThis page about Losartan for gout was last reviewed or updated on 7 December 2017 \nOne brand name: COZAAR. Also available as a generic. \nWHY LOSARTAN IN GOUT TREATMENT? \nLosartan is not a top-flight gout medicine for lowering uric acid or alleviating pain, It is primarily an anti-hypertensive for controlling high blood pressure, a member of the class of drugs known as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB\u2019s). \nLosartan and uric acid I have included it in our gout drugs\u2019 pages because, unlike anti-hypertensives such as diuretics, beta blockers, ACE Inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and non-losartan ARB\u2019s, all of which can raise uric acid, losartan can lower blood uric acid. This property makes it a unique anti-hypertensive. It does this by blocking the kidneys from re-absorbing uric acid and so they excrete more. By enough, in fact, to reduce the blood uric acid level. That's the rationale for losartan for gout. \nBecause so many people with gout also have high blood pressure, you can see why losartan is useful. To repeat, it can lower both high blood pressure and uric acid. \nBut Losartan does not lower uric acid by large amounts . It isn\u2019t allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid or another specifically uric acid lowering med. But it can reduce uric acid by an amount useful enough to give it a role in some gout therapy cases. And if you simply have hyperuricaemia (that is high uric acid above 7.0 mg/dL (0.416 mmol/L) plus high blood pressure, but not gout, and you live in a country where drugs are used for hyperuricaemia without gout, you might be prescribed it. \nIn a Spanish study (1) losartan was used to control uric acid in patients who had lowered uric acid to below 6.0 mg/dL and who were monitored to see if their uric acid would subsequently rise above 7.0 mg/dL, the level around which gout trouble often begins. \nLosartan was used by some patients in one group who did not have a repeat gout attack for 2\u00be years because they kept uric acid below 7.0 mg/dL, after they had successfully lowered it to a crystal dissolving level. \nIn a Chinese study (2) in patients who received 50 mg of losartan daily for six months, serum (blood) uric acid fell continuously through the study. Even in the 6th month it still fell, although in another study it was seen that reductions eventually stabilise (stabilize). \nAnd in number crunching of the very large United Kingdom general practice database (3) \u2013 involving 24,768 patients in whom gout first developed, between 2001 and 2007, compared with 50,000 non-gout patients, those taking losartan were found to have a lower risk of gout. (And calcium channel blockers also showed a lower risk of gout, by almost the same amount as losartan). \nThe longer losartan was taken, and the higher the dose, the lower the risk compared with all the other anti-hypertensives mentioned in this article\u2019s first paragraph. The risk of gout was lowered by approximately a third to a quarter less than the risk of a gout attack in those who didn\u2019t take losartan, and compared to those who took other hypertensives. \nOn the other hand, the risk of gout from diuretics was twice as likely. \nLosartan has one more gout interesting effect. It may also raise the pH of urine, (achieving more alkaline urine) an effect similar to that caused by potassium citrate. What is useful about this is that elevated urine pH increases the solubility of uric acid, which it is thought aids its excretion. \nIn a 2011 Japanese study, acidic urine reduced uric acid excretion. (6) And in another study, (in 2010) alkaline urine (achieved by eating a more alkaline diet) raised uric acid excretion by about 37%. (7) \nDosage How much losartan for gout? One 50 mg tablet daily for four weeks has been found to lower blood uric acid by \u2013 0.79 mg/dL (0.470 mmol/L) from 9.05 mg/dL(0.538 mmol/l) to 8.26 mg/dL (0.491 mmol/L). (4) In another study it decreased serum (blood) uric acid by \u2013 0.70 mg/dL from 5.9 to 5.2 mg/dL. That is nearly 12% (5). It has done somewhat better than this in other studies and it might for you. \nIt is also available in 25 mg and 100 mg tablets. Losartan tablets are swallowed with a glass of water. \nTo put these results in context. Someone who has gout will usually have a blood uric acid level above 7.0 mg/dL (e.g. 8.5 or 12 or even 14+) and needs to reduce it to below 6.0 mg/dL. So losartan is useful in controlling uric acid once it\u2019s been lowered to MSU crystal dissolving levels, and perhaps in treating gout cases where uric acid is not elevated or is only slightly elevated. There are better drugs than this to reduce uric acid and gout attacks. \nBut if you have hypertension and gout, or hypertension and an elevated risk of gout, (e.g. it runs in the family), your doctor may prescribe it. It might also be prescribed to offset the uric acid raising properties of other anti-hypertensives you might take. \nSide effects and interactions Losartan\u2019s side effects in people with hypertension are infections (colds, flu), dizziness, congestion of the nose, even back pain. All these are in a small percentage of takers.

I developed it years ago, and it accounts for defensive quality of play by position, adjusts for game situations and strength of offenses and spits out an adjusted Fantasy Points allowed. Using Fantasy Football Points allowed is valuable in itself to help make lineup decisions, but it\u2019s imperfect, as a team facing Tom Brady should give up more points and passing yards than one facing Jay Cutler every week. This isn\u2019t a tool to argue benching Mike Evans for Kenny Stills , but it helps you decide which RB3 is a better play or which WR4 could put up a WR2 type Week 14-16. Fantasy Football Week 14-16 Matchup Rankings QB Matchup Rankings \nDon\u2019t look know, but if you find another solution for this week ( Jimmy Garoppolo ?), Blake Bortles might lead some QB-needy teams to a championship. Dak Prescott has two nice matchups before Ezekiel Elliott returns to help offset the Seahawks. Drew Brees has the best three-game slate, but he just doesn\u2019t need to pass as much as we\u2019d like for Fantasy reliability. Carson Wentz has a tough go this week, but he has the second best final two weeks. \nRussell Wilson is unbenchable despite the next two weeks looking rough. It\u2019s going to tough to trust Jared Goff down the stretch. Josh McCown went off last week and the Broncos aren\u2019t as fearsome as you might think, but he has a tough go in Weeks 15-16. Ben Roethlisberger faces the tough Ravens defense, but it\u2019s at home and it\u2019s without Jimmy Smith\u2026 which aspect will win out? \nOther Week 14 Matchup Boosted QBs: Alex Smith , Jameis Winston , Eli Manning , Tom Brady , Marcus Mariota RB Matchup Rankings \nKenyan Drake \u2019s toughest game is this week, and even then, it\u2019s just middle of the road. The Patriots running back duo of Dion Lewis and Rex Burkhead are the poor man\u2019s Saints duo but still highly valuable. The Steelers game sandwiched in the middle creates some concern. Kareem Hunt has a nice run the final three weeks, and maybe Andy Reid can get his head out of\u2026 you know the rest. Jordan Howard has three mostly-favorable matchups, but as seen, that doesn\u2019t matter as much as the game script. If the Bears are losing and passing, Howard sees too much of the bench. The Eagles have a nice three-game set as well, but you can\u2019t trust any of the options. If you are daring enough, Jay Ajayi has the highest ceiling. \nTodd Gurley has the worst schedule, but just as with Russell Wilson , he\u2019s unbenchable. Jamaal Williams has been great of late (yay! Finally!) but Aaron Jones could get more involved and he has the second worst championship week matchup. Alex Collins is a risky start this week but has a decent two-game finish. Giovani Bernard is a solid play if Joe Mixon is out, but no matter if it\u2019s Bernard on his own or Mixon is back next week, it\u2019s a tough week to trust either. \nOther Week 14 Matchup Boosted RBs: Frank Gore , Theo Riddick (if Ameer Abdullah is out again), Samaje Perine , Matt Forte , Melvin Gordon , Alfred Morris , Peyton Barber WR Matchup Rankings \nDevin Funchess draws one of the toughest matchups this week in Xavier Rhodes but has an amazing two-game finish. Dez Bryant has a terrific two-game start for the playoffs but finishes a bit tougher. Larry Fitzgerald has a tougher matchup in the middle of two great ones, and the same goes for the Vikings receivers. Marqise Lee has a decent run and is still underrated. The Lions receivers have a golden matchup this week, but that hand of Matthew Stafford \u2019s is concerning. Marquise Goodwin is going to win some people playoff games\u2026 until Week 16. \nNo one has a worse run of matchups than Josh Doctson does. At least Jamison Crowder can exploit the slot against the Chargers and Cardinals, but not as much against the Broncos. T.Y. Hilton might have put up his final good game of the year. The Jets have the fourth-toughest finish, and Robby Anderson \u2019s touchdown rate is begging for regression. \nOther Week 14 Matchup Boosted WRs: Brandin Cooks , Michael Crabtree , Tyreek Hill , Jarvis Landry , Mike Wallace , A.J. Green , Sterling Shepard TE Matchup Rankings \nBlaine Gabbert \u2019s love of Ricky Seals-Jones couldn\u2019t come at a better time with the remaining games. Jason Witten can finish strong, especially with his ability to show up against the Giants. You can\u2019t bench Zach Ertz (if playing) against the Rams, but here\u2019s hoping he\u2019s back for those final two great games. Austin Seferian-Jenkins went missing of late but could bounce back for at least this week, while Jack Doyle also has one remaining strong game on the schedule. \nGreg Olsen is untrustworthy with that injury and it\u2019s made worse by the schedule. People are fawning over David Njoku , but the schedule is among the toughest. Jared Cook shows up when you don\u2019t want him and disappears when you try to use him\u2026 so expect two big games and a quiet one against the Cowboys\u2026 because, Cook. Stephen Anderson is an intriguing fill-in this week, but it might be his only startable game. \nOther Week 14 Matchup Boosted TEs: Evan Engram , Hunter Henry , Cameron Brate \nMain Image Credit: AP Photo/Stephen B.

Good or bad ? \nThis page about cauliflower for gout was last reviewed or updated on 29 September 2016. \nDoes cauliflower cause gout? This is a puzzle. It sometimes gets mentioned as a food gouty folk suspect has caused their gout flare. Some doctors think so too and that must come from listening to gout patients over the years. So they think cauliflower should be avoided - it can make existing gout condition worse or maybe even trigger a gout attack. But its detractors may have confused it with something else as a cause of gout. \nBut the puzzle is that there isn\u2019t much evidence that cauliflower causes gout. It is not exceptionally high in purines, although some website pages claim it is high purine. On one uric acid/purines table It holds 51 mg of uric acid/100 grams, which just gets it into the medium purines category. On another table, 45 mg of uric acid and 19 mg of purines, also from 100 grams of cauliflower. \nThis is higher than fellow brassicas such as kale, cabbage, and broccoli, which are not considered gout causing, and about the same as spinach (57mg/100 grams). \nSo is Cauliflower bad for gout? \nAs well as not being especially high in purines there isn\u2019t a study showing the link between cauliflower and gout. If a study could find cauliflower \u201cguilty,\u201d we would be somewhat clearer about it. But there isn't. The best we have are results from Purine rich foods, dairy and protein intake and the risk of gout in men, reported in the March 2004 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. It found there was no increased risk of gout from eating purine rich vegetables, which included cauliflower. You can read this report here , courtesy of the New England Journal of Medicine . \nFellow brassica spinach was also included in the study\u2019s tested vegetables which were also - peas, beans, lentils, and mushrooms. So it's likely not enough cauliflower was examined. But the study did find the usual suspects (seafood, red meat) moderately culpable. \nIs cauliflower good for gout? \nMany of the foods with about the same capacity to create uric acid do not have a reputation for causing gout. Close to cauliflower (51 mg/100 grams) are foods such as black pudding (51), whole grain wheat (51), sweet corn (52), green peppers (55) spinach (57), bananas (57), parsley (57). Of these only spinach has been though to raise uric acid. It may be the case that cauliflower is only a problem if you eat a lot of it, and you already have a high uric acid level. \nVegetables contain flavonoids which are believed to lower uric acid. Cauliflower has them too, but not in large enough amounts to make a noticeable difference - kaempferol 0.36 mg/100 g; and quercetin 0.54 mg/100 grams. Compare that with the best source of quercetin, red onions, 39.2 mg/100 grams. \nBut it is also good for diets. Cauliflower is low in calories (25 kcals) and carbohydrates (3 net carbs). If it wasn't for the gouty rumblings about cauliflower I'd be singing the praises unreservedly that cauliflower is good for gout. It has plenty of good vitamins and minerals, although slightly fewer than broccoli, kale, and cabbage. \nBest cauliflower tip \nBased on the word of mouth stuff, it is just to be careful of it if you suffer gout. You can probably eat cauliflower if you exercise, are not over weight, have reduced your meat and seafood consumption, and your uric acid has fallen. And you take gout meds regularly. So if you have gout, eat cauliflower if you are doing what you should be to get your uric acid down to 6.0 mg/dl or lower. \nIf you are being careful, don\u2019t have a portion of cauliflower head larger than 100 grams (3\u00bd ounces). Or you could cut that to 2 ounces which would be around 25 mg of uric acid. \nHere are the nutrients in cauliflower: \n100 grams raw cauliflower", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "new england journal of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:06.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1763069166e11349742be05c3a13d7fc51dfaa1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZREJ0xl3Nto8DuK_YPmUhNGgBpKt6goLg4BB7cyAoCTNHwGifYiLpBd4vsgfUjby1B915iLYD9m9y2CVN7nptxdXZsgqSQZv1RcMvhMSzqKiQ--", "site_full": "www.chrono24.com", "site": "chrono24.com", "site_section": "http://www.chrono24.com/others/rssfeed.htm", "site_categories": ["style_and_fashion", "jewelry"], "section_title": "Chrono24 - The World's Watch Market", "title": "Panerai Luminor Marina 1950 3 Days Automatic for sale $6,675", "title_full": "Panerai Luminor Marina 1950 3 Days Automatic for sale $6,675", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn2.chrono24.com/images/uhren/images_26/s6/7373626_xxl.jpg?v=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17807, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1763069166e11349742be05c3a13d7fc51dfaa1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZREJ0xl3Nto8DuK_YPmUhNGgBpKt6goLg4BB7cyAoCTNHwGifYiLpBd4vsgfUjby1B915iLYD9m9y2CVN7nptxdXZsgqSQZv1RcMvhMSzqKiQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Panerai Luminor Marina 1950 3 Days Automatic for sale $6,675", "text": "Report suspicious offer Description Well regarded for its bold, stylish and easily recognised design features this Panerai Luminor Marina 1950 3 Days Automatic is in Fine condition.
