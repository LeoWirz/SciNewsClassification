No one has all the answers. This will come as a relief to you now, because it means that you don\u2019t have to offer a turnkey solution for your people. Instead, introduce them to the issues and invite them to work together to solve this. Taurus (April 20-May 20). What\u2019s more important than being right? Understanding. This isn\u2019t about knowing more. Knowledge and understanding are not precisely the same thing. The former is more akin to facts, the latter to processes. Gemini (May 21-June 21). You\u2019ve already survived your worst days, so even if this one isn\u2019t unfolding ideally, there\u2019s still enormous potential here if you keep your attitude buoyant. Positive people around you will help. Cancer (June 22-July 22). Everything is moving quickly, and you\u2019ll get plenty of participation points over the next three days. You\u2019ll win a few and lose a few \u2014 and don\u2019t worry, because anything you lose will come back around. Leo (July 23-Aug. 22). There\u2019s something you want to accomplish that seems not to be in the cards. It\u2019s like for every push you make, life pushes back. Don\u2019t give up. These pushes from life are just trying to guide you to a better way. Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). Your creativity is not going away just because you happen not to be using it much lately. It\u2019s actually swelling up, eager for an outlet. Schedule time for exploration of this side of you in the near future. You\u2019re long overdue. Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). Tenacity, in its less appealing form, is called stubbornness. You\u2019ll have this sort of stick-to-it-ness to work with now. Be careful what you agree to, because it won\u2019t be so easy to back out. Scorpio (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). Develop your plans on paper. This will help you order your thoughts and take stock of your resources, as well as the resources you\u2019ll have to acquire to make your wishes a reality. Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). Still worried about what to give the important people in your life who seem to already have everything? Actually, what you write in the card will be more important. Put time and thought into this and you\u2019ll be a hit. Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). Changing your brain chemistry isn\u2019t so mysterious really. There\u2019s very little you can do that won\u2019t alter it. Ways to get the good chemistry flowing: hugs, music, exercise, learning, laughter and so much more. Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). You\u2019ll look for the drama, humor and general human-interest aspect of life with the zeal of someone who\u2019s been invited to a very important dinner party. It just feels better to have a few good stories in your arsenal. Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20). We all talk too much now and then. But one who\u2019s proven to be a habitual conversation bully will have you running and hiding in avoidance today. Sad, really, but a good lesson in the importance of generous communication. Today\u2019s Birthday (Dec. 7). You\u2019ll get the attention you deserve with one stipulation: that you don\u2019t settle for less. Stick with those who celebrate and support you and you\u2019ll rise past their high expectations and up to your own even-higher ones. Get help in setting up processes that will earn you the extra money and satisfaction you\u2019ve lacked. Aquarius and Gemini adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 12, 38, 1, 42 and 25.

She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive.\n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\"\nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee.\nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles.\nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes.\nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said.\nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday.\nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses.\nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again.\n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\"\n___\nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

"published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "30 Years of A Muppet Family Christmas", "text": "Michael Wermuth, Jr \nA Muppet Family Christmas was first broadcast in 1987 and is one of the greatest Muppet specials, if not one of the greatest Muppet productions, of all-time. The special brings together the casts of the Muppets, Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, and even a scene involving the Muppet Babies . It\u2019s perfect for fans of the Muppets, Christmas, or both. And today we take a little look back at this awesome special.\n \n\nFor those who haven\u2019t seen it, Fozzie Bear decides to take his Muppet friends to his mothers farm house for Christmas, deciding to make it a surprise, unaware that she had planned to spend the holiday in California and had rented it out to Doc and Sprocket. Ma Bear ends up staying and having to make room for all the unexpected guests (and gets more and more unexpected guests) while Doc warms up to sharing the farm house with the Muppets. There\u2019s several songs, running gags, and multiple plotlines \u2013 such as the Turkey who was invited by the Swedish Chef diverting the chef\u2019s attention to others, Gonzo and the turkey fighting over Camilla\u2019s affections (which doesn\u2019t really resolve much \u2013 he meets her, then they feud but quickly get stopped, then they all sit together during the carol sing), Fozzie builds a snowman who comes to life and becomes his partner, but the biggest plot involves Miss Piggy, who didn\u2019t show up with the others due to scheduling a photo shoot and shopping, getting lost in a terrible snowstorm while on the way to the farm house.\nThere may not be much plot focus (though I feel it has a lot more plot focus than previous specials starring the cast of The Muppet Show ), but it doesn\u2019t need a real plot. There\u2019s so many memorable scenes and numbers included. Compiling a list of the top ten scenes from this special would be really hard because EVERY scene is very memorable. It\u2019d probably be easier to make a list of the LEAST memorable stuff \u2013 and even a lot of that is memorable to me (let\u2019s see, what\u2019s least memorable\u2026. How about Kermit sending the rats and chickens away from the kitchen and into the Swedish Chef\u2019s bedroom? No, too memorable\u2026. How about Dr. Teeth expressing how proud he is for being one of Fozzie\u2019s weirdo friends? No, that\u2019s too memorable\u2026 How about the way that one background rabbit moves his lips when sing\u2026 No, that\u2019s too memorable\u2026). But the greatest scene in this special must be the carol sing at the end, with a crowd of Muppets singing a medley of great Christmas songs \u2013 Kermit and Piggy sing \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u201d, Fozzie and his mom sing \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u201d, Floyd and Janice sing \u201cThe Holly and the Ivy\u201d, and so on. And this awesome sequence lasts almost ten full minutes.\n\nWhile Fozzie\u2019s mother had made a couple of appearances on The Muppet Show , this is the first time that she had a big part, and would continue to appear in a handful of productions following this. This special was the first time I remember seeing Lips (while my earliest memory of seeing the Muppets is The Great Muppet Caper , at the time my young mind could only remember a few scenes), the character stuck out to me, and as I was used to The Electric Mayhem having five members, I thought it was odd that they suddenly had his wild yellow guy with them (and he seems to show up a LOT in the background, probably more so than other characters). It was also my first exposure to Doc and Sprocket, and would take a number of years before I realized they were on Fraggle Rock (ignoring Doc\u2019s brief line about Fraggles which I didn\u2019t fully understand at the time). Now it may seem like every Muppet is included, but there\u2019s plenty who are not. For a number of years I thought it would have been great if the special had long-unseen characters (like characters who barely made it past the first season of The Muppet Show or hadn\u2019t been seen on Sesame Street since the 1970s) until I realized that this special wasn\u2019t really a celebration of the works of Jim Henson, just a fun special combining the casts of the three main Muppet franchises.\nOne of the big deals of this special is that it\u2019s perhaps the biggest crossover between Henson franchises (almost tied with The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years ). This special has not had an official release or broadcast since Disney bought the Muppets in 2004, but is the lack of release or broadcast due to the heavy use of characters owned by Disney, Henson, and Sesame Workshop? The three companies seem to be good at cooperating when needed, and while Kermit used to have to be cut from a few Henson specials (hopefully Kermit\u2019s re-inclusion in Emmet Otter\u2019s Jug-Band Christmas means he can be re-included in The Christmas Toy soon), a handful of other Henson productions with Disney-owned characters have been released uncut, Sesame Workshop doesn\u2019t seem to have any problems releasing Kermit the Frog segments from Sesame Street, and Disney has released a few Muppet productions with uncut appearances by Sesame Street characters. Hopefully Henson wouldn\u2019t provide issues with the inclusion of Fraggle Rock characters (though Sprocket wasn\u2019t cut from post-2004 releases of The Muppet Christmas Carol ). Enough songs have had to be cut from the video releases \u2013 let\u2019s not have to cut more stuff. But I have a feeling it just hasn\u2019t been released for the last reason the majority of other old Muppet content hasn\u2019t been released \u2013 and I haven\u2019t a clue why. It also would have been great if there was a soundtrack album to this special.\n\nIn terms of crossover, I feel they missed out on a great opportunity with the Fraggle Rock scene. They could have had more characters visit Fraggle Rock, it\u2019d have been great to have had some of the Sesame Street Muppets visit, but instead, we only get Kermit and Robin visiting the place. It\u2019s still a great scene, but it\u2019d have been awesome if a large number of characters met the Fraggles. For years I\u2019ve also thought it\u2019d be great if the Sesame Street humans appeared and interacted with Doc (I also used to wonder if they worried about the fact that Doc was played by a different actor in certain countries \u2013 without wondering the same about Sesame Street characters).\nAnyway, if you can only see one Muppet Christmas production, see A Muppet Family Christmas . If you can only see one Muppet production that\u2019s not The Muppet Show or any of the movies, see this special. If you\u2019ve already seen the special, you know you want to see it again. So here\u2019s to 30 years of one of the best Christmas specials of all-time!\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael wermuth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kermit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim henson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmet otter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "teeth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "floyd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camilla", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "muppet babies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muppets", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fraggle rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sesame street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:58.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fcc51a59e42d2acc897c8f5941525f3b5821df0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pwYVyQ48uVCejPOJkzjOyKtpz3TnGdSBe", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/mu/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/mu/ -
