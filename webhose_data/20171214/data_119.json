blasted the RCCG General Overseer, saying he is not only being a thief but irresponsible and vile.\n\nNigerian gay activist, Bisi Alimi has descended hard on Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God [RCCG], calling the revered man of God a thief \u00bb , irresponsible and a vile man who steals from his congregation.\n\nThe United Kingdom-based gay man was reacting to Pastor Adeboye's statement at the opening of the RCCG Holy Ghost Congress at the Church's headquarters on December 4, 2017, where he said that anyone that buys a car with the money he did not earn lawfully would be riding in a moving coffin.\n\nThe statement was also posted on the verified Twitter handle of the RCCG GO but it did not sit well with Alimi, the first known Nigerian man to come out as gay and he also took to his verified account with the handle Ashiwaju Bisi Alimi@bisialimi to call out the man of God, saying Pastor Adeboye is not only a thief who steals from his members, but an irresponsible man and vile.\n\nThis is what Pastor Adeboye tweeted:\n\"If you buy a car with a money you didn\u2019t earn lawfully you\u2019ll be riding in a moving coffin.\"\n\nReacting to the statement, Alimi slammed Pastor ADeboye with his own series of tweets and called him so many names:\n\n\n\nThis is how he started: \n\"This man is irresponsible and vile. He is the same man that buys private jets with stolen money and lay curses on his congregation if they fail to pay tithe.\"\n\n\"With this tweet, @PastorEAAdeboye assumes that his fraudulent ways of stealing money from his followers is somehow lawful, and hence his private jets are not flying coffins.\"\n\n\"According to @Forbes in March 2009, Pastor Adeboye spent $30 million on a Gulfstream jet amidst widespread criticism. Pastor Adeboye has no job apart from being a pastor. He is a rich pastor in a rich country \u00bb of poor people. See why he is a fraud?\"\n\n\"According to same Forbes, his net worth is valued at between 39 to 65 million Dollars. That is $ and not N. Pastor Adeboye has no job apart from being a pastor; can we let that sink in?\"\n\n\"@PastorEAAdeboye's income thrives on the corruption of the political class and the vulnerability of the poor in his church. This is the same man that asked for N1b donation in his church in a country with almost 40% unemployment rate.\"\n\n\"The moral of my tweets is that Adeboye's tweet was sent without him looking in the mirror and seeing that he is the thief and rogue, he is abusing in his tweet.\"\n\n\"It is either Pastor Adeboye is taking a piss on Nigerians or he doesn\u2019t know he is a clown and I say this with so much respect for him and his fraudulent antics. #pastoradeboye #nigeria #419pastors #nigerianpastors.\"\n\nApart from attacking Pastor Adeboye on Twitter, Alimi also went to his Instagram page where he also painted the man of God as the devil incarnate himself who does not have any moral right to tell Nigerians not to steal.\n\n\"Why don\u2019t we start today with the foolery of @pastor.adeboye?

Even as I write this post, I am currently sipping on some Frog\u2019s Leap Chardonnay . I am pretty obsessed with this shirt from J. Crew since it lists pretty much all my favorite wines, but I also LOVE LOVE LOVE this shirt because it\u2019s pretty much been my holiday hymn since the holiday season started. My stepmom got me these very appropriate socks as an early Christmas present that clearly explain me (she runs a wine bar in NoCal with my dad which makes them even more appropriate!). You also can\u2019t go wrong with a cute wine glass , or a wine glass that can cure any bad day! \nFor the wine lovers amongst your friends or family, these gag gifts would be perfect to gift them this holiday season!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:42.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e9ea8a888924a05a91b2beeada542f64d12b5f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTiIrwHZNMsXNgNoDf1GdQXu52t277xWiwOLYkffEb4BeVkIRP2zMbGzCL7sdTOO.PsqwWbsv.kMRy4Evzl5CZPzJm1oqkcv6OAvxNVK4nZWw--", "site_full": "nosferatus-castillo.deviantart.com", "site": "deviantart.com", "site_section": "http://backend.deviantart.com/rss.xml?q=+sort:time+meta:all&type=deviation", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "DeviantArt: Newest", "title": "I lie to myself (meme) - animatic", "title_full": "I lie to myself (meme) - animatic", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://st.deviantart.net/minish/main/logo/card_black_large.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 264, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e9ea8a888924a05a91b2beeada542f64d12b5f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTiIrwHZNMsXNgNoDf1GdQXu52t277xWiwOLYkffEb4BeVkIRP2zMbGzCL7sdTOO.PsqwWbsv.kMRy4Evzl5CZPzJm1oqkcv6OAvxNVK4nZWw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "I lie to myself (meme) - animatic", "text": "No comments have been added yet.

Even if you are living alone, you will never feel left out at all. At least, you could always have someone to talk to and play with. Humans are emotional being. Hence, it is important for their physical and mental health to have a company. They got to have some friends. They should have a family. Just imagine this. Every time you arrived at your apartment, even for the fact that you are living all by yourself, someone on your front door would greet you. As a human being, it is normal to feel lonely. This unique nature of yours is what makes you special and unique. Of course, some animals, like your pet, could feel the same way too. That is why try to help out each other. Strengthen your relationship. To keep them productive and jolly, you better let your pet visit the animal communication Colorado clinic. If possible, reconsider availing this service. This is important. Animals are living things. That only means that they are quite prone to illness too. Indeed, knowing that they are suffering, leaving the matter aside could be quite disastrous. If you really love something, it will be pretty shameful on your part to just ignore it. That is always provided. Therefore, make sure to always act kindly to your pet. Now, find someone who could support and evaluate their health. Depending on someone who lacks potential could be quite shameful. That actions of yours would only waste your time and even your efforts. You are not worthy of that treatment, though. Not even your pet. You know it. Hence, starting today, look for someone credible. There is no justice on that. Do not get the wrong idea. Nobody else in this world could protect your own interest and investment but you. Therefore, value your decisions. Take a look at the opportunities. Consider every prospect you have met and found. Every one of them holds a secret. Just try visiting their website. In this endeavor, money is not the only thing that is involved. The health of the animal, your efforts, and even your time, all of these would matter. Therefore, start to be more attentive. You could use the net to look or find a prospect. Just an advice, though, before you choose someone, inquire from your fellow owners. There are some blogs online that highly talks about these services. Usually, these blogs are created or hosted by renown animal organization or enthusiasts. You better hear out their advice. Nobody else is capable enough of helping you but those people that are highly involved in this particular field. You cannot just take advice from a novice. Talking with your fellow owners would help. Do not just accept the data that are posted online. Think about of reviewing your alternatives too. These animals serve as your family members. They are not just a nobody. That is why take care and value their presence. Getting their advice and recommendations might help. Speaking of recommendations, only speak with those people who have a very high standard. You should set your bars high. Speaking with less competent people would only produce less competent results. In short, the details you have collected will never have any value or interest.

trip in Vietnam from the North to the South ( Hanoi , Sapa, Ha Long bay, Da Nang, Hoi An , Hue, Saigon, Mekong Delta and Phu Quoc island...), but now we are at our hometown with the snow, the freezing, with windy and rainy... to re-view and remembering our wonderful trip in Vietnam with sunshine, green landscapes and sunny beaches!.\nIt was a long trip crossing Vietnam with many interesting places and meeting lots of friendly Vietnamese peoples but most of them could not speak English, especially the driver in Vietnam, 99% of the drivers could not speak English (some drivers was annoyed when we ask them for a short trip or ask them waiting for us, maybe because they did not understand us), we would like to talk with them to explain but very difficult to understand each other.\nAt the end of the long trip, we stayed on Phu Quoc island for 3 days and we were lucky to meet a very good English speaking driver, he was a funny driver and very patient in waiting, he has a good car with good air-conditioned, very comfortable and very safety.\nWe went around the island with him, we also took a private boat trip with him to go fishing & snorkeling, he introduced to us a very good restaurant with local sea food, he explained to us everything about the island and we were surprised with his knowledge about all over Vietnam, he understands something more than some other tour guides in some places on the mainland of Vietnam.\nHe was very patient in waiting for us when we stay on the beach for swimming and having lunch (more than 2 hours), he drove very safety, he was a funny tour guide with some lovely stories... he was the best driver & tour guide in Vietnam we had ever, ever got, our trip on Phu Quoc island was definitely perfect!\nWe spend our time to post a review for him on TripAdvisor because he told me he had 3 kids need to take care (two daughters and one boy is going to be born in December 2017) and because he gave us a very, very wonderful trip around Phu Quoc island so we would like to help him to connect with some other potential customers on the Internet to help him has more clients and earns some more moneys for his wife and his children, to help his family a better life.\nI am not sure if you could reach this review or not, but if you see this post and want to have his contact information to book a private trip for you in the future, you could send a private message to me in this post or by TripAdvisor message, I will send back to you his detail information as soon as possible whenever I have free time!.\n2

After we left the bus station we stopped 15 mins later to pick up another 20 passengers who did not get a ticket and had to sit on the floor so the police would not see them.\nSo now we were on an overloaded bus that was difficult enough to exit when it had its normal number of passengers.\nI would gladly pay more for a decent bus with staff and management who provided a honest service.\nEdited: 04 December 2017, 14:12", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:44.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55a8158234aa77e95ac96b03b284bb70652b326e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439jmrOt86kXINAI0O.Y8IBKCVA87TltNaUXsF9o9q_Ae3qZtd9yRTd88bO6mLXad5vRlvlPXYEF1MMLMR8le3EYrbNOGRuFPinKq75yuJfSUL0SyaBdU_4r_NBWAEROuvjdOhmqoK1N0hj7RhC5xrssMtdlLOm3nH1bXowSbFCANo-", "site_full": "www.ebay.co.uk", "site": "ebay.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.ebay.co.uk/b/3D-Printers-Supplies/183062/bn_55159913", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "3D Printers &amp; Supplies | eBay", "title": "E3d-V6-Extruder-Head-Bowden-Nozzle-for-Makerbot-RepRap-Remote-", "title_full": "Reviews: E3d-V6-Extruder-Head-Bowden-Nozzle-for-Makerbot-RepRap-Remote-3d-Printer | eBay", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.218, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "55a8158234aa77e95ac96b03b284bb70652b326e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439jmrOt86kXINAI0O.Y8IBKCVA87TltNaUXsF9o9q_Ae3qZtd9yRTd88bO6mLXad5vRlvlPXYEF1MMLMR8le3EYrbNOGRuFPinKq75yuJfSUL0SyaBdU_4r_NBWAEROuvjdOhmqoK1N0hj7RhC5xrssMtdlLOm3nH1bXowSbFCANo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rvkelly", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "good product", "text": "Pros:Has improved quality of 3D prints on Anet A8 printer.Having hot end separate from", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 4.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:44.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f62dca15ad33cf6417d7e16b4537ab67e87fd413", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439i8ojW3DEa.f1fZmvZClc4s.rHXnuMEY_IFgv2U3v5tRbyyL9Vi4jHm2Tph_KJ9kWdL5zzrMMcKXlqJalnupImj.VcqP1b5VkI63V_GCqp1LJuOERnLnW4aLLHyQnGazRuJ9uIIpTrvdFG33mZbDKOCTICsO12rjJxHyiD7TpoE8-", "site_full": "www.ebay.co.uk", "site": "ebay.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.ebay.co.uk/b/3D-Printers-Supplies/183062/bn_55159913", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "3D Printers &amp; Supplies | eBay", "title": "Mk8-0-4mm-Extruder-Sensor-Hotend-Nozzle-Upgrade-Print-Head", "title_full": "Reviews: 3d-Printer-Mk8-0-4mm-Extruder-Sensor-Hotend-Nozzle-Upgrade-Print-Head | eBay", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f62dca15ad33cf6417d7e16b4537ab67e87fd413", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439i8ojW3DEa.f1fZmvZClc4s.rHXnuMEY_IFgv2U3v5tRbyyL9Vi4jHm2Tph_KJ9kWdL5zzrMMcKXlqJalnupImj.VcqP1b5VkI63V_GCqp1LJuOERnLnW4aLLHyQnGazRuJ9uIIpTrvdFG33mZbDKOCTICsO12rjJxHyiD7TpoE8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "4cc3ss50", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "MK8 Extruder", "text": "I'm real happy with the the MK8 extruder works real well, had to change the firmware to match the extruder for the printer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:44.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4343ec2f0ff38e0c2ca6c1d6dca789b1a3083c24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYf9pA8cmVYgIfn4UyoGA5PAxvmb2yS.mNkVewCblobIwgOurbSoHVw0X501nIKULbB6penCoL8lOwhUMt67RiSw_XQVVULAZJclPWMNVRsgQPMzb2YT8.2QQ5mSbeVOGX", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com.my", "site": "tripadvisor.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com.my/ShowForum-g293921-i8432-o80-Vietnam.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Vietnam Forum, Travel Discussion for Vietnam - TripAdvisor", "title": "Are night/sleeper busses really that bad?

In addition to that, it is called as more inexpensive selections that become applicable for houses which aimed to limit carbon footprints and secure environments.

While its other forms deliver warmer places, Wax and Asphaltene Solvent delivers steady air quality for 115 degrees. During other days, energy demands greater deals of work forces, time, and assets.\n\nYet, it has the capacity important in achieving those aims within the duration of 20 minutes which is required to generate electricity. It was known as fresher materials indicated under the 1990 Clean Air Act or Energy Policy Act of 1992 since it used fresher and safer chemicals in comparison to other subjects.

Sadly, I will never truly complete this game. I really have no intention of suffering through the Trial of the Sword. I could only suffer such tedium back when I was a kid who only got 2 or 3 games a year. Of course, knowing that I will never finish that side quest kind of killed any desire I had to finish the rest of the side quests. Why bother when it'll never be 100%?\nThat said, looking forward to the final DLC, whenever that gets released.\nAs much as I've really enjoyed this game, I'm a little worried the massive scope of it will hurt it's replay value. I have about zero interest tracking down all those shrines again, or grinding resources to upgrade armor. The other option is to just beeline to the 4 Beasts and Ganon, but I wonder how a casual gamer like myself would fare with that amount of difficulty (heading into the endgame with hardly any heart containers and shit equipment).\nThere are some guides that break down the trial of the sword and makes it seem very manageable. I don\u2019t mind admitting I was getting frustrated and finally followed a guide for the first 1/3 of it. It was much simpler than I really thought.

Just tonight my friend and I finally tackled one side quest that has had us both scratching our heads for a while now. Hot Gossip is the new Strategy Guide.\nEarly on in the game I was disappointed that so many sidequests only gave Rupees. I had some weird flashbacks to Twilight Princess where I was just wandering around with Rupees, but I never bothered to get the Rupee Armor so it was all useless, and I went through numerous dungeons littered with \"unopened\" Rupee Chests. But in BOTW, between purchasing certain armor sets, keeping my arrows supplied, and other expenses...and then considering that rupees aren't as preposterously abundant in this game as they are in other Zelda games (at least, in proportion to what they expect you to spend)...it's actually really nice.\nTDawg on December 7 NNID: ohnoTom || 3DS: 1762-3198-2019 || Steam || Take My Good Pokemon\nLet's Plays of Japanese Games", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8UqIZlupjIQ3vxcAOEoNug", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xxq7g07kk8ALToubFIpqDNrxSmSG-m7w_ZAyNwHn5qk/edit?usp=sharing", "http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010172221"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:45.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6761d2e8e73d7c9b2f38d73d004455a5797499c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl5Ddq17mMEbVpp25bLYMME80X9yt4UsiKFO7B0SDrtwjX3AIhO0uvMObdpkPIeD8oVmdhONCDLvk59goVzlyjWoxbavdCF5G9VtgoewjdFjVcJeN2g1LHurHefcbRVQBEQ--", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[Zelda: Breath of the Wild] Master Trials DLC out now - The Champions' Ballad late 2017 38", "title_full": "[Zelda: Breath of the Wild] Master Trials DLC out now - The Champions' Ballad late 2017 - Page 38 \u2014 Penny Arcade", "published": "2017-11-11T10:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 22, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/8DDBNVR065TV.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8253, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "28a8b37410abb8958dccbda3e2e5ca26459c5d09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl5Ddq17mMEbVpp25bLYMME80X9yt4UsiKFO7B0SDrtwjX3AIhO0uvMObdpkPIeD8oVmdhONCDLvk59goVzlyjWoxbavdCF5G9VtgoewjdFjVcJeN2g1LHurZCSPaXTiPqh.8ONscmPi0", "ord_in_thread": 20, "author": "Dirty", "published": "2017-12-07T01:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I understand that a lot of people don't mind guides, but leaning on them too much as I play bothers me a lot.

Sadly, I will never truly complete this game. I really have no intention of suffering through the Trial of the Sword. I could only suffer such tedium back when I was a kid who only got 2 or 3 games a year. Of course, knowing that I will never finish that side quest kind of killed any desire I had to finish the rest of the side quests. Why bother when it'll never be 100%?\nThat said, looking forward to the final DLC, whenever that gets released.\nAs much as I've really enjoyed this game, I'm a little worried the massive scope of it will hurt it's replay value. I have about zero interest tracking down all those shrines again, or grinding resources to upgrade armor.

Computer simulation of a drone-aircraft collision. Image credit: Assure. \nThe FAA will use the research results to help develop operational and collision risk mitigation requirements for drones. ASSURE conducted its research with two different types of drones on two types of aircraft through computer modeling and physical validation testing. \nKiran D\u2019Souza , assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Ohio State, led the engine ingestion portion of the first-of-its-kind study. \n\u201cEven small unmanned aircraft systems can do significant damage to engines,\u201d D\u2019Souza said. \nReports of close calls between drones and airliners have surged. The FAA gets more than 100 sightings a month of drones posing potential risks to planes, such as operating too close to airports. The FAA estimates that 2.3 million drones will be bought for recreational use this year, and the number is expected to rise in coming years. \nUnlike the soft mass and tissue of birds, drones typically are made of more rigid materials. The testing showed that the stiffest components of the drone\u2014such as the motor, battery and payload\u2014can cause the most damage to the aircraft body and engine. \nLed by Gerardo Olivares, director of Wichita State University \u2019s National Institute for Aviation Research , the team evaluated the potential impacts of drones weighing 2.7 to 8 pounds on a single-aisle commercial transport jet and a business jet. \nThey examined collisions with the wing leading edge, the windshield, and the vertical and horizontal stabilizers. The windshields generally sustained the least damage and the horizontal stabilizers suffered the most serious damage. The severity levels ranged from no damage to failure of the primary structure and penetration of the drone into the airframe. \nAn expert in gas turbine dynamics, Ohio State\u2019s D\u2019Souza conducted computer simulations to evaluate the potential damage of a drone entering a generic mid-sized business jet engine, including damage to fan blades, the nacelle and the nosecone. \nThe simulations revealed that the greatest damage and risk occurs during takeoff, since the fan is operating at the highest speed at this phase of flight. The location of the drone\u2019s contact on the fan is a key parameter, with the most damage occurring when the impact is near the blade tip. \nAccording to D\u2019Souza, the next step is the development of a representative commercial jet engine model for ingestion simulations, as well as full-scale testing to verify and validate the simulations. The team is planning additional research on engine ingestion in collaboration with engine manufacturers, as well as additional airborne collision studies with helicopters and general aviation aircraft. \nThe researchers concluded that drone manufacturers should adopt \u201cdetect and avoid\u201d or \u201cgeo-fencing\u201d capabilities to reduce the probability of collisions with other aircraft. \nLed by Mississippi State University, ASSURE was established as the FAA UAS Center of Excellence in 2015. It comprises 23 of the world\u2019s leading research institutions and more than 100 leading industry/government partners. ASSURE members are core to three FAA UAS test sites, lead four FAA research centers, and have seven airfields and a 340 UAS fleet.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "d\u2019souza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerardo olivares", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kiran d\u2019souza", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal aviation administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alliance for system safety of uas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wichita state university \u2019s national institute for aviation research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi state university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:46.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "481fde2905c9abeafd20784b5caefb417d36dfdc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9p1_7g663q3rT8WQu_4DvFFcJTBeAstLdYaKnP5u.oZqvuoTX9fv8jWoFCctZoDpc-", "site_full": "www.forumlumix.com", "site": "forumlumix.com", "site_section": "http://www.forumlumix.com/c4-galeries-photos-et-videos", "site_categories": ["cameras_and_camcorders", "tech"], "section_title": "GALERIES PHOTOS ET VIDEOS", "title": "Photos du 07/12/2017", "title_full": "Photos du 07/12/2017", "published": "2017-12-07T07:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://nicolas.fraineau.free.fr/banniere/ForumFzG.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1cec78f6d14709fc3e80cd94b166c5c39438ed00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9p1_7g663q3rT8WQu_4DvFFcJTBeAstLdYaKnP5u.oZqvuoTX9fv8j8B7OV_J6FEGG9x3BJ.pmdw--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T07:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Pam 372\nUne de mes passions PANERAI...\nBonne journ\u00e9e \u00e0 tous.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://servimg.com/view/19470618/812", "https://i62.servimg.com/u/f62/19/47/06/18/p1010112.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:46.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5e5d4466107775dea108b1ede557f096a24440e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSrY3zTBFQr2qgROFi_9LlEtSh.a4kqwvfOjjIxsDVY8Fo8xNHENy3HX7gPK_Ixpka2KfyyZWuBXusyrmyy6rlC6OwLYlTcPw-", "site_full": "itunes.apple.com", "site": "apple.com", "site_section": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios-news/id6009?mt=8", "site_categories": ["tech", "television", "shopping", "mac_support", "entertainment"], "section_title": "News - App Store Downloads on iTunes", "title": "SmartNews: US Breaking News", "title_full": "SmartNews: US Breaking News on the App Store", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/d8/d8/5f/d8d85f25-d8ad-66ea-d75f-f96a97a348f8/source/1200x630bb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 49, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "514a1d4e7c81ad57bb9f71ca2dba1ac2b2f3acc8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSrY3zTBFQr2qgROFi_9LlEtSh.a4kqwvfOjjIxsDVY8Fo8xNHENy3HX7gPK_Ixpka2KfyyZWuBXusyrmyy6rlWdTrwqhtWvOy3PZoaVKB9MCaljP9IbaznEW_WJh5n6Vl6A2WREP0hA--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "jjg in va", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Looking for a replacement for iPhone news and hoped ad-free SmartNews was it.
