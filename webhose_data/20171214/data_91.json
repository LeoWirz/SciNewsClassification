This setback only concerns onsite wastewater treatment systems, also known as septic systems. While the town enforces 150-foot buffers, the state law is expected to range from 50 feet to 100 feet, according to Town Planner Lisa Bryer. \nEnabling legislation was passed in June 2016 and signed by Gov. Gina Raimondo a month later. Rep. Deb Ruggiero, who represents Jamestown and Middletown in the House, voted for the bill. Lawyers with the Department of Environmental Management currently are reviewing a draft of the new regulations. Once finalized and approved by the department\u2019s director, the rules will go into effect statewide. \n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress,\u201d agency spokeswoman Gail Mastrati said of the draft. \nBryer said the state is capable to deal with applications that request relief from the setback. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a biologist on staff,\u201d she said. \u201cThe state has the qualifications to review these types of applications.\u201d \nIn the past, the planning board has relied on the conservation commissioners to review these applications. These volunteer members, however, aren\u2019t professional staff. \n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for them to testify at the zoning board level with any authority,\u201d Bryer said, adding that in extreme cases, the town has used taxpayer money to hire consultants to testify. \nThe 150-foot setback has been on the books since 2003. While the town only gets a few of these variance requests annually, Bryer said the regulation has been instrumental in protecting the town\u2019s water sources, especially in the Jamestown Shores neighborhood. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been effective,\u201d she said. \u201cThis ordinance has gone a long way to protecting the value of our natural resources.\u201d \nWhile Mastrati said the law\u2019s intent is to \u201cimprove wetland protection through new and improved wetland buffer standards,\u201d opponents have insisted the actual goal is to streamline the regulatory process for developers. \nWhen the bill was introduced, the conservation board in town showed unanimous opposition because \u201cfeedback doesn\u2019t seem to get much traction\u201d in Providence, according to Maureen Coleman, chairwoman of the board at the time. \n\u201cThey are taking the authority out of local hands,\u201d board Commissioner George Souza said. \nThe board also was concerned about \u201csome dramatic variance requests\u201d approved by the state. \nWith the debate ongoing on Smith Hill during the 2015 legislative session, the Department of Environmental Management approved a setback for a property on Frigate Street that requested a septic system 51 feet away from the wetlands. \nFollowing that assent, the applicant sought local approval, but after a negative recommendation by the planning commission, he withdrew his application from the zoning board\u2019s agenda since the town had the ability to overrule the state\u2019s decision. \nIf the ordinance is passed Monday, that option no longer exists. Under the new law, if the state doesn\u2019t increase its setback, the Frigate Street septic system could have been built. However, Bryer said, even without Monday\u2019s amendment, the town will be powerless once the state finalizes its rules.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bryer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa bryer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deb ruggiero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gail mastrati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mastrati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maureen coleman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gina raimondo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george souza", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "smith hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of environmental management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jamestown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "providence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middletown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamestown shores", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:39.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "763e25fa3c5767437fea4596d4f7ce4b0072056f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw5vtGrKAr.3R_sI_N9RzBgsnOZ9JumboUL0Kp4OvzKs7M5IFofsmgSmNzDpVwNxzwe8BS.gpLPvhY_IAeVrXx_AEhaoBvJRMcVY36dEmDEGlIbMsNQhl.AwQ--", "site_full": "www.amazon.co.uk", "site": "amazon.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product-reviews/B071VQ7G1D/ref=s9_acsd_ri_bw_c_x_9_r_w?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-4&pf_rd_r=EN3M6ZXK5TAQG2HRP10J&pf_rd_r=EN3M6ZXK5TAQG2HRP10J&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=59c7bca0-a516-473a-9895-61ecfb7b9e85&pf_rd_p=59c7bca0-a516-473a-9895-61ecfb7b9e85&pf_rd_i=2996091031", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: Then She Was Gone", "title": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: Then She Was Gone", "title_full": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: Then She Was Gone", "published": "2017-12-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.34, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d71563344088e7c2a98843bc890e6f80eae2cc6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw5vtGrKAr.3R_sI_N9RzBgsnOZ9JumboUL0Kp4OvzKs7M5IFofsmgSmNzDpVwNxzwe8BS.gpLPvhY_IAeVrXx_AEhaoBvJRMcVY36dEmDEGlLAXyorkbZqvwj5f1cnkSYFHS4C_qSYXCq.eQ2uYZwR1QwxhTD01.mX", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "myra cooke", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "What a wonderful book,how well written,exciting to the very last word.

Follow us onInstagram @noiretvafrica and onFacebook ... www.facebook.com/caspennoire \n\nThe Federal Government has ordered the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, to ensure that the fuel scarcity currently being experienced across the country does not extend beyond this weekend.  The directive was given to the minister on Wednesday during the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. \n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, who is currently on an official visit to Kano State, could not attend the meeting.  The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, made the government\u2019s position known while answering questions from State House correspondents at the end of the meeting.  He said Kachikwu was initially scheduled to join him at the briefing but could not do so because he needed to attend an important meeting as part of efforts aimed at resolving the fuel supply crisis. \n\nMohammed allayed the fears in some quarters that the government might be planning to increase the pump price of Premium Motor Spirit, also known as petrol.  He added that Kachikwu assured members of the council that the country had enough stock of petrol that could last till the end of January 2018. \n\nMohammed said, \u201cOne, the government has no intention at all to increase the pump price of PMS. Two, the minister (Kachikwu) assured the council that we have enough products till the next one month, even till the end of January. \n\n\u201cThirdly, this is the winter period. There is always more demand for refined petroleum products during the winter period in the colder countries, this is what we are experiencing now.  \u201cThe council gave him (Kachikwu) a matching order that this fuel scarcity should not last beyond this weekend and they are going to work very hard to ensure that it is curtailed. He assured council that there is actually no cause for alarm.\u201d \n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on Wednesday did not respond to enquiries as to what it was doing to clear the fuel queues in many states across the country. \nEfforts to get the corporation\u2019s spokesperson, Ndu Ughamadu, to state if the oil firm had met with marketers in order to address the lingering fuel scarcity were not successful, as he neither picked calls to his mobile telephone nor replied a text message sent to him on the matter. \n\nIt was observed that black marketers of PMS had returned to the streets of Abuja and neighbouring states, selling the product in plastic containers at higher prices.  One of our correspondents observed that the black marketers sold a 10-litre worth of petrol for as high as N2,500, in contrast to N1,450 it would have cost at the pump.  Petrol seekers also formed long queues in front of the few filling stations that dispensed the product on Wednesday, as many other outlets did not dispense PMS. \n\nIn Lagos, fuel depots, including that of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation at Ejigbo, recorded low activities as loading dropped, though the queues in filling stations were not as long as the situation was on Tuesday. \n\nDuring a visit to some of the depots on Wednesday, many dealers were stranded as they complained that they had not been able to get PMS after making payments for the product. \nIt was gathered that loading at the NNPC\u2019s Ejigbo depot had dropped by about 50 per cent with about 20 to 30 tankers getting petrol daily, compared to 50 to 60 before now. \n\nThe Executive Secretary, Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association, Mr. Olufemi Adewole, said some of the depots decided to reduce the rate of loading so as to spread it over a longer period. \n\nHe stated, \u201cAsk the NNPC how many of their ships have come in this week, then you will know whether we have received products or not. If the NNPC tells you that they have one ship coming in, the petrol inside the NNPC vessel is eight days plus before it gets to any petrol station. \n\n\u201cIf the NNPC tells you it has products on the vessel, add a minimum of five days before it gets to the depots.\u201d \n\nA top official at one of the depots in Lagos, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no new vessel had come to any jetty in Apapa this week, adding that a vessel belonging to the NNPC was being expected to berth on Thursday or Friday. \n\nHe said, \u201cThe import vessel always brings from 30 to 35 million metric tonnes. There is currently a vessel at Oando SPM that has been discharging petrol to major marketers, including Oando, Total and MRS, since last week.  \u201cThe PPMC has promised us that within the next 48 hours that a vessel will come in.\u201d \n\nMeanwhile, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, Lagos State Chapter, has said its members in the state and parts of Ogun State will no longer withdraw their services next week.  Last week, the association had accused the NNPC of under-supplying its members with petrol, adding that they might be forced to shut their filling stations by December 11 if the situation persisted. \n\nA statement made available on Wednesday, quoted the IPMAN Chairman in Lagos, Alhaji Alanamu Balogun, as announcing the suspension of the plan at the end of a meeting of oil marketers held at the Ejigbo secretariat the day earlier. \n\nBalogun said the suspension followed a strong appeal by the NNPC, which had arranged a meeting with the IPMAN officials for December 14 in Abuja.  He noted that IPMAN yielded to the NNPC\u2019s appeal because of consideration for members of the public who engaged in panic buying of petroleum products since the announcement of the service withdrawal notice. \n\nBalogun said the meeting with NNPC officials would determine whether or not the withdrawal of service would still hold.  \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to be seen by the government and the public as economic saboteurs, because we have a stake in the economic stability of this great country,\u201d he added. \n\nIPMAN faulted the statement by the NNPC\u2019S Group General Manager, Public Affairs Division, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, that there was enough fuel storage at the Ejigbo satellite depot, and that the ex-depot price of petrol remained at N133.38. \n\n\u201cMr. Ughamadu should rather come to Ejigbo and find out the true position of things instead of staying in Abuja and saying what is not correct,\u201d the statement said. \n\nMeanwhile, the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency on Wednesday stated that it had no plan to increase the price of petrol despite the current scarcity of the product. \nThe PPPRA is the agency of the Federal Government that fixes the prices of petroleum products like petrol, kerosene and diesel.  It said in a statement issued in Abuja that it had confidence that the NNPC would handle the current situation at filling stations well as there was enough products in the country. \n\nThe agency said, \u201cThe PPPRA has observed the sudden reappearance of queues and the attendant discomfort felt by the general public and stakeholders across the country. We want to use this medium to assure all Nigerians that there is no need for apprehension or panic buying. \n\n\u201cWe are confident that the NNPC, being a major supplier of petroleum products into the system and the supplier of last resort, can ensure uninterrupted supply of petroleum products into the market and the corporation has given assurances in this regard. \n\n\u201cThe PPPRA, therefore, urges fuel consumers across the country to be calm as there is no plan by the government to review the pump price of Premium Motor Spirit.\u201d \n\nThe agency said it would continue to monitor the supply situation and take every step required to ensure that there was no disruption whatsoever in the system. \n\n\u201cThe PPPRA again wishes to assure all stakeholders and members of the public of uninterrupted products supply and distribution, pursuant to the overall goal of facilitating a vibrant and robust downstream oil and gas sector,\u201d it added. \n\nIn Rivers State, motorists faced a hard time in Port Harcourt and its environs on Wednesday. \nAlso visit our  website:   www.noiretv.com   ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "oando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibe kachikwu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemi osinbajo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alhaji lai mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alhaji alanamu balogun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ndu ughamadu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olufemi adewole", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kachikwu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ejigbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ughamadu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammadu buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balogun", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "verizon fios", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "depot and petroleum products marketers association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "independent petroleum marketers association of nigeria, lagos state chapter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ogun state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nnpc\u2019s group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premium motor spirit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ppmc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigerian national petroleum corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "public affairs division", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nnpc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal executive council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oando spm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "verizon fios channel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petroleum products pricing regulatory agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national petroleum corporation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kano state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kachikwu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ejigbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "port harcourt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abuja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apapa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rivers state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "presidential villa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ndu ughamadu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:39.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "305c815773c30b4e908aa2cef7865dfcaf32e5d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWvW5Uvdb.MqAfGI7mEM6L5aun3HvAeWToKMbWQTGBNfG3nnIVOOzdKUqrYLuFwztKeyDlEd86SnwLOB3wUhNqB5EnTVR48_Eb8E5AlyU1LjIlCQdWkjXc8Wy_GlaG7JnQu5HrH2uqJTwnyTexyCmPSg--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-men-bags/?spm=a2o4k.category-090200000000.0.0.oQh0l7u0026itemperpage=120", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Men Bags -

In today\u2019s column Todd takes us to the northwest area of New Brunswick known as the Madawaska Republic to visit the former police station that's now home to Les Brasseurs du Petit-Sault . \nThe area in northwest New Brunswick encompassing the panhandle, as well as a portion of Quebec and Maine, is the Madawaska Republic. The people who settled and live there are fiercely independent with a huge sense of community. These values have been ingrained in Brasseurs du Petit-Sault since they opened in 2014. \nThe name translates to Brewers of The Little Falls, which was the original name of Edmundston where the brewery resides. The word Madawaska comes from the native Mi'kmaq words \"madawas,\" meaning porcupine and \"kak,\" meaning place. The land of the porcupine can be seen in their logo, one of its many homages to their home. \nThe brewery used community funding from 80 investors to get off the ground, purchasing the former police station at 45 rue de l'\u00c9glise in the heart of Edmundston. The Brasseurs du Petit-Sault brew Belgian-inspired ales and bottle in distinctive retro stubbies that can be found in New Brunswick Liquor stores around the province. Since opening it has won many awards at the Atlantic Canada Beer Awards, actually sweeping the entire Belgian category in 2015, as well as awards from the Canadian Brewing Awards. \nAll beers are named in honour of a person, place or legend from the area. These are always interesting and solidify the stories as they continue to grow their fan base. The legends include such ones as Tante Blanche, who saved the colony during a terrible winter in 1797, and John Baker, who fought for independence of the region in the 1800s. RELATED: Canada's Craft Beer: Looking For Pie in a Glass \nThe wonderfully renovated former police station houses the brewhouse, brewtique, and bottling line as well leased space for other businesses in the heart of the city. You can purchase their beer in growlers or bottles to drink offsite or you can order some food and a beer while you watch brewers at work in the brewery. \nWhen in the area it's worth stopping to enjoy their great beer and the culture of the area. My top picks to drink when available are Canon Franchetti Cappuccino Stout, Colonel John Baker or La Kedgwick.

David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, insisted that any regulatory alignment would cover the whole of the UK and not just Northern Ireland while Mrs May pledged at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions that her Government would protect the \"constitutional integrity\" of the Union.\nBut Tory Brexiteers, said to include Boris Johnson , the Foreign Secretary, and Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, are concerned that any UK-wide regulatory alignment would produce a soft Brexit with the country effectively operating to the rules of the single market and customs union.\nNicola Sturgeon seized on such a prospect, tweeting: \u201cThis could be the moment for opposition and soft Brexit/remain Tories to force a different, less damaging approach - keep the UK in the single market and customs union. But it needs Labour to get its act together. How about it @jeremycorbyn?\u201d\nMr Blackford confirmed talks with other parties were taking place about securing a soft Brexit majority at Westminster that could derail what he regarded as the Tory Government\u2019s drive for a hard withdrawal and keep the UK in the single market and customs union.\n\u201cAt some moment there has got to be a wake-up call and parliamentarians across the chamber have got to consider what the impact of a Brexit without a trade deal is going to mean.\n\u201cI for one am certainly not of the view that we can take it as read that we are coming out of the single market and the customs union. I would venture in light of the economic harm that will be done to the UK\u2026we can ultimately put together a majority view in the House of Commons [for a soft Brexit].\u201d\nThe SNP leader added: \u201cWe need to encourage not just Labour members and the Labour frontbench but other parliamentarians who share that view as well.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jean-claude juncker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruth davidson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicola sturgeon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian blackford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tory brexiteers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arlene foster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david mundell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael gove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boris johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs may", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "snp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of commons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scottish conservative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic unionists", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "westminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "highland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:42.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc49f1bfd4d69b9bbb2c0d7d0f99b63d9f967c9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcaEpr0Q7xVsXplHboW_5hpj364LzxyH7HMS4fOAP8ZJUTZhx7FgtqHetmfpuP6gMy1iU_UgUN2r9uMRXi5YOKVk7qcGn.dEfjnGOIzdns.nLYD3Yxcug0_9Z0RdchvgmW", "site_full": "www.heraldscotland.com", "site": "heraldscotland.com", "site_section": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/", "site_categories": ["media", "climbing", "sports"], "section_title": "Herald Scotland", "title": "'No-deal Brexit' will spark moves for second Scottish independence vote", "title_full": "'No-deal Brexit' will spark moves for second Scottish independence vote | HeraldScotland", "published": "2017-12-06T22:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 20, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7125147/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "11e598de4f3a5d8c140480323badebd6affd5216", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcaEpr0Q7xVsXplHboW_5hpj364LzxyH7HMS4fOAP8ZJUTZhx7FgtqHetmfpuP6gMy1iU_UgUN2r9uMRXi5YOKVk7qcGn.dEfjnGOIzdns.nLYD3Yxcug0_ySxbIdgWolBwwXUH0mUV9Y-", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "Allan Craig", "published": "2017-12-07T10:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Couldnt agree more with Hugh..

Founder and CEO, Organisation\u200b \u200bSolutions\u200b @ DrAlisonEyring WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images As Blue Apron prepared its IPO at the beginning of this year, the future looked bright. The New York-based meal kit company had been growing exponentially since it was founded by Matthew Wadiak, Matt Salzberg, and Ilia Papas in 2012. They, were soon delivering over five million meals a month and former venture capitalist Salzberg, was being feted in the media. Fast forward six months and Wadiak has been removed as CEO, growth has ground to a halt and Blue apron's share price is down by 70 percent. What happened to Blue Apron is something I have seen time and time again during my 25 years of helping CEOs and leaders grow their businesses; leadership gets so wrapped up in executing today's growth that it loses sight of the bigger picture and endangers the company's future growth. Growth leaders need to be ambidextrous . They must be able to execute today's business to a high level while at the same time identifying and developing the capabilities the organization will need for tomorrow's growth. This means both exploiting their present business to drive profits while they explore their future business to drive revenue growth down the line. To do this they need to stay externally focused. Too often leaders get so caught up in the everyday busyness of growth that they take their eye off the big picture. This is a mistake as external focus is one of the strongest drivers of external growth. Growth leaders must constantly think about existential threats, imaging disruption scenarios with their team. They have to keep examining and reexamining their customers needs and future needs, how they competition is meeting them and how they might meet them in the future or how technology, their operating environment or market forces could change them. Here are three ways to stay externally focused: 1. Focus on your customers. Blue Apron's customer base growth stopped growing at the end of 2017. Many subscription-based business models see their numbers peak and then tail off as customer fatigue sets in. Blue Apron offered a package of three meals per week for between $60-75, which is a significant commitment in terms of cost, time and planning for many people over the long-term. In the meantime, new services appeared like Uber Eats and Deliveroo that deliver restaurant meals to your door without asking you to sign up for anything. 2. Be aware of your competition. Blue Apron was first in the US meal kit subscription market but it quickly got crowded with over 150 companies across the US, including Blue Aprons arch-rivals and former classmates Plated, and then Berlin-based HelloFresh opening a New York operation. If a business is easy to start up then the market place can become very crowded very quickly. With free cancellation customers could try a different meal kit service every week. If you want to win in a crowded playing field you need to either have a huge critical mass or stand out. 3. Watch out for curve balls. \nA lot of people, including Blue Apron, were blindsided by Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods - if Amazon brings high-end fresh food directly to your door then it eliminates much of the need for high-end meal kit services and they become just another subscription service. The signs were there, a month previously NYU Professor, Scott Galloway told Recode : \"I can't imagine why they [Amazon] wouldn't buy Whole Foods, for example, just because of the urban locations. They could close them down and just turn them into warehouses and I think they could justify the price.\" In his new TED talk Galloway explained that while he was researching Amazon he searched for organic milk on their site and it came up with nothing, he immediately saw that high-end fresh produce was a gap for Amazon and if they were going to fill it then Wholefoods would be a good fit. And Blue Apron's main competitor saw the risk too. In a 2015 Forbes interview Plated founder Josh Hix said prophetically: \"This isn't about Plated vs. Blue Apron. It's about Plated vs. Whole Foods and a huge food market.\" This holiday season you will have to go to your local Whole Foods store to pick up your $159 organic turkey meal but I'm guessing by next year it will be fulfilled by Amazon. However, as former CFO Brad Dickerson takes over as Blue Apron CEO there are still reasons to stay positive. Meal kits represent only 1 percent of the more than $5 trillion US retail and food services industry so there is still plenty of room to grow.

The people who want to play off a Willis as inconsequentially there to hold the clipboard and carry the ball bag at modest salary need a starter who is so dependable that is what actually happens. I think we found out over time some of Onstad's backups weren't so hot, but he rarely gave you the opportunity to stress it. With the exception of one season -- 2015 I think -- Deric's backup is routinely pressed into action. I would understand if they either looked for a veteran upgrade or searched for a more reliable long term solution. Click to expand... Teams are not going to allocate the money for 2 veteran MLS keepers that are making starter money. They just don\u2019t do it. Usually a starter then a young/cheap backup.

Yeah, it doesn't make a ton of sense. I like his work rate as a utility lunchpail sub but he's overpaid for the role. They did use him once or twice as a d-mid but not often enough to justify that pay rate, plus we will be signing some mids to go with Martinez. I think he could play back but doesn't. We have 3 signed forwards plus in theory Elis plus he's not even usually the first forward after them off the bench.\nI might justify it as a swiss army player if he was really used all over the place including instead of crap bench defenders. But in the playoffs with attrition they ran Anibaba out there. So if we're going specialist -- and I am not horribly against that -- what's his specialty, where does he rank on the depth chart at his cost.\nDitto the talk of Alex coming back. He was not an impactful player in the playoffs and had no production after like mid-July. That he is a player with apparent demand elsewhere should not alter our own calculus. He either has a definite role here or not. That role either merits his salary demands or doesn't. I can either find someone better or not. I'm sure there are Astros players who were strong last spring who disappeared down the stretch, and are probably now fungible. You dance with who gets you there. It doesn't matter if Alex was the '16 MVP or had 10 assists before Gold Cup. This team was hottest at the end of the season and the first three playoff games, and that was not because of Alex.

I don't know what went wrong or why, but he's another talented youngster that doesn't develop in Houston. With Luca, I wouldn't think there is some change in his status that happens this offseason (so it looks like an outright cut), but again - don't know for sure. I don't see how you don't just let him run back to RGV via loan again instead of offering him a deal with RGV directly. It's not like he's making much money at all and you don't exactly fill all your roster spots anyway.\nElis and Cabezas should have been ironed out already. The way you iron it out - you pay the option terms. Either Jordan and Dynamo put together loan deal with too big of a transfer fee b/c they knew it was one and done (b/c they know the FO won't pony up money for a good player and we are going to live and die by one year loan deals forever forward) - or Dynamo ownership is too cheap to pony up a reasonably amount of cash. Elis - you write the check. Cabezas shouldn't have been that much based on his playing time before Houston, but it's not like anyone is kept in the loop on these things.\nHolland - oy vey. I would have brought him back next year if you believe the club option story because he is super cheap and showed some flashes before injury. I think they cut him outright but won't say it for some reason? I thought most first round draft picks sign very similar MLS deals with several years at low salaries part of the deal.

Why commit to that? Beasley is past it. Pass.\nI mean, the defense looked mediocre. Got destroyed by Seattle and some others. 40+ GA for the regular season. Old. Does not scream to me, keep same thing. Says, that worked well enough for one decent season, don't double down.\nI liked Holland's high energy passing thing but I think Martinez does similar things better, and over time Holland proved a little sloppy with possession and shy on defense. I would like to see time put into the RGV-type younger players but if you're 23-25 you either are ready or not. There's a list of people like Lucatero, K. Garcia, Escalante, been in the organization a few years, not done much. Pass. Clear the deck. Keep looking for someone who does impress. Loyalty is for veteran starters who produce. The kids, they are there for an opportunity and if they don't shine when trotted out, churn, on to the next one. Sounds cold but you only find Camerons by iteratively running through draft picks and HGP until one turns up. We can do a better job scouting and teaching but you shouldn't get 4-5 years to find yourself here. RGV is for getting playing time and showing what you have. When you get here, either play or go.\nPart of my concern with the development system is it seems one note and non-responsive to needs. We have needed backs for years. Where are they? Where are some burners who can play wide or up top? What about Pina or the other keepers? Only thing we seem good at making is mediocre, technical, slow-afoot Hispanic midfield players of a type. I am not sure that type is actually a very good MLS template. A Memo or Alex Lopez player has to be willing and able to chase on defense, and a little technical is not very technical. I'd almost rather they put as much energy into players with height, speed, and also technique, players who might have a niche value in MLS.

Hey guys, today I'm gonna be making some berry and oat bars and I'm going to be\nusing some raspberries today. To start I'm going to make my filling and for the\nfilling I'll need some unsalted butter at room temperature.\nAnd to that I'm gonna some light brown sugar and some salt.\nAnd mix that together with your spatula until it gets creamy.\nAlright now that's nice and creamy I'm gonna mix my\ndry ingredients and here I have some flour to that I'm gonna add some baking\nsoda and if you want you can add some cinnamon or any kind of spice of your\nchoice but I'm gonna leave it plain today. And just give that a little whisk together.\nAnd now I'm gonna add this and my oats to my batter.\nAlright so once your batter is done it's gonna have kind of a crumbly texture, and\nthat's what you're looking for. So I'm gonna get my pan now and I'm gonna fill\nup my pan with half of the mixture I'm gonna bake it for about 15 minutes and\nthen I'll add in the filling and crumble on the rest of my dough.\nNow, that my dough is ready I'm going to press it into my pan, and here I have a 9 by 9 inch square pan\nand I've just oiled it lightly and added some parchment paper if you don't have a\n9 by 9 inch square pan you can use a slightly larger or slightly smaller\nsquare pan or you can even use a 9 inch springform pan. And now I'm going to add in half of my dough.\nAnd I'm just gonna press that into my pan.\nWet your hands with some water so just to make sure that the dough doesn't stick.\nAll right so now this is ready for my oven and I have it preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit\nwhich is 180 degrees Celsius and it's gonna bake for about 12 to 15 minutes,\nit's just gonna be slightly colored and then we'll let it cool a little bit,\nwe'll make our filling, and we'll assemble the rest of the dessert.\nAll right so my base is baked for about 15 minutes and now it's been cooling for\nabout 20 minutes you just want it to be warm to the touch or at room temperature\nas long as it's on piping hot because if it's really hot when you put your\nfilling it's gonna seep in and get soggy.\nMy base, it just gained a little bit of\ncolor it doesn't really look completely baked through but that's what you want it to look like.\nAnd now I'm gonna make my raspberry filling and if you want you\ncan use any other kind of berry, blueberries, cranberries, whatever you\nhave on hand and you can use fresh or frozen so I'm going to add this to my\nbowl, and I'm adding in some jam here, I have some apple butter but you can use\nany kind of jam you like whatever you have on hand and whatever you prefer.\nAnd to bind it all together I'm adding in some flour.\nAnd give that a good stir to get everything really well combined.\nAnd now add all of this your cooled crust.\nOnce you have your filling on your crust, just crumble on the rest of the dough that you have.\nAnd just to add a little bit of texture and flavor I'm\ngoing to add on some pistachios, you can also use pecans, almonds, walnuts, whatever you like.\nAnd you can lightly tap down your dough.\nSo once you've assembled this it's gonna go back in the oven at 350 for another\n35 to 45 minutes you want it to be golden brown all over, and once it comes out of\nthe oven you're gonna let it cool down completely in the pan and then you can cut it into squares.\nSo if you like this recipe you can find it on my website\nandreamaronyan.com, I'll leave a link to that in the description box below and you can also find the recipe there as well.\nThank you for watching my video\nplease like and subscribe and I'll see you next Thursday\nFor more infomation >> Berry Oatmeal Bars Recipe - Duration: 4:48. \nHow to Get Out of the Cleaning Business - What Do You Say? - Duration: 7:18. How do I get out of the house cleaning business?\nThat's an excellent question and we're going to talk about that today.\nHi there, I'm Angela Brown and this is Ask A House Cleaner.\nThis is a show where you get to ask a house cleaning question\nand I get to help you find an answer.\nNow if you're looking for a house cleaner where do you go?\nYou go to HouseCleaning360.com\nIt's a perfect 360 view of the perfect home, and this is where you go to find house cleaners,\nand housekeepers, and maids, and professional organizers.\nInterior decorators, and people that can help you with interior and exterior painting, and\na whole slew of other things that service the home.\nHouseCleaning360.com\nAlright, today's question.\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I have a questions for Angela.\nI've been a cleaning lady for a long time.\nI have a good reputation.\nI'm wanting to get out of the business and I keep getting calls.\nPeople still want me to keep cleaning for them, and different clients.\nIt's a good thing but I'm ready to get out the business and I'm looking for something\nthat I can tell them, that I am out of the cleaning business for good and I don't want\nto do it again, without being rude.\nThen, once you're done with the cleaning business entirely and maybe you're not ready to get\nanother job yet, how do you get out of the cleaning business?\nThank you for your show, I love it!\nAngela Brown: This is an excellent question.\nFor as many people as are getting into the house cleaning business, there are as many\npeople getting out of the house cleaning business.\nBelieve it or not every year there are people that age out of the business and the aging\nout could either be they take another job, it could be that they just get too old, or\nthat they get burned out, or that they wear out.\nBy that I mean their shoulders, their knees, their back, different parts of their body\njust give out on them and they are no longer physically able to do the manual labor that\ncomes with house cleaning.\nEvery day there are people getting out of the house cleaning business,\nand we forget that.\nWe think people are only getting into the house cleaning business,\ntherefore we think the market is saturated,\nbut for everybody that gets in there are also people getting out.\nAlright, how do you get out of the house cleaning business?\nThis goes for everybody everywhere.\nYou need to know these things because you may get out of the house cleaning business\nand then later decide to get back in, for a variety of different reasons.\nNow, I know lots of house cleaners that have left the house cleaning business only to return\ntwo years, three years, five years, 10 years later, when their money situation changed\nor their lifestyle situation changed.\nOr they had to go from working a full-time job back to a part-time job, or having the\nflexibility that comes with owning your own business.\nAs you get out of the house cleaning business the very first thing that you want to do is\nyou want to set a deadline.\nOn such and such a date I'm going to be retiring from the house cleaning business.\nIf you're not sure you're retiring, don't use the word retiring unless this is 100%\nyou know you're never coming back.\nYou might say, \"I'm pivoting my business and I'm going in a different direction, so after\nthis particular day I will no longer be cleaning houses.\"\nCustomers may still call you and they may still say things like, \"Oh, you were the best\nhouse cleaner we ever had.\nWe can't live without you.\nWe can't have anyone else.\nIt must be you.\"\nYou have to smile and say, \"Oh, thank you so much.\nI'm such a fan of yours.\nI'm really blessed you allowed me to come to your home and clean.\nYou did a great job providing for my family, thank you so much but I do have to move on.\"\nYou have to be very firm about your moving on and the reasons why.\nBecause if your reasons are not firm, a customer who really appreciates you,\nthey're going to suck you back into the game.\nIf you're getting out of the business for a particular reason you need to be 100% clear\nabout those reasons why.\nIf those reasons merit you leaving forever, then you leave forever,\nand here's what you're going on to.\nThen you have to paint a picture with that customer.\nYou have to say, \"I know.\nI've been cleaning houses for however many years but I decided I'm going to become a\nprofessional artist.\nOn the side, while I was cleaning houses, I started painting, and I started painting\non the evenings and the weekends.\nI had a few gallery crawls, then I had a few art exhibit openings, and now I've just sold\nmy first painting for $2,000,000.\"\nOr whatever it is.\n\"Now I'm focused and I'm moving in this other direction.\nThis is the time where I say goodbye to my house cleaning and I'm moving in this direction.\"\nOkay.\nWell, guess what?\nThey're going to be very supportive of you.\nMaybe you're not an artist, maybe you're pursuing something else.\nMaybe you're starting a different business, who knows what you're doing but they're going\nto be supportive of your new endeavor.\nIf this was a friend, if this was somebody that likes you, if this is somebody that believes\nin you, they're still going to like you and they're still going to believe in you even\nif you move on.\nOkay, so the relationship changed.\nYou're no longer cleaning their house and you probably won't see them as often.\nYou're going to have to decide, are you really friends?\nIf you're really friends that means you're going to have to carve time out of your schedule\nto meet them for lunch, or to hang out with them on occasion, or to grab a cup of coffee,\nbecause yes, you will not see them as frequently as you once did.\nThe reality is pick a date and be firm about it, and be firm about your reasons why.\nAfter this date you no longer clean houses.\nThere is nothing anyone can say that is going to suck you back into the business, because\nyou've got a gallery showing, or whatever it is that you're going to be doing.\nYou have something else going on that is taking a higher precedence for you, or a higher level\nof importance in your life.\nAt this particular moment that's it, bye-bye house cleaning.\nNo more cleaning houses.\nAnd that's your story.\nNow, if people get upset and they get offended you can say, \"Listen, who knows, who knows\nwhere this will head.\nI'd like to keep the doors open.\nIf I ever come back into the cleaning business I would love to give you a call.\"\nI cannot tell you how many times, five, 10, 15 years later, after I've said goodbye to\na customer they'll come back and they'll say, \"Hey!\nAny chance you could still come clean my house?\"\n\"No, no, no, no, no.\nI moved six miles away.\nI am not coming six miles to clean your house when I only work in my neighborhood.\nThank you so much, if I ever move back to that area or if we ever expand into that territory\nagain I will

Doctors told him that more would continue to break off if he didn\u2019t get it fixed. \n\u201cIt definitely took me by surprise,\u201d Green said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know the word for it. I was just shocked. I was very upset. I didn\u2019t think I was going to have my high school season, to be honest. But we found a doctor who said I could swim and have my high school season.\u201d \nGreen finished his freshman swim season before having his surgery in March. Doctors had to drill on the sides of his knee and insert screws to establish blood flow for his bone to grow. \nThe doctors took bone from his hip and partially filled the hole with bone plugs in hopes of having the rest of his bone grow back. Green received good news when a doctor told him at his most recent checkup that the bone was growing back. \nGreen\u2019s next check up is on Thursday, where doctors will check the progress and see if any screws in his knee have migrated. \nGreen, who has been swimming competitively since he was 6 years old, wasn\u2019t sure if the surgery would work, which put his entire swimming career in jeopardy. Fortunately for Green, he spent eight weeks on crutches, but was allowed back in the water just two weeks after the surgery. \nGreen eventually transitioned to a custom-fit unloader knee brace to help shift the weight from the healing portion of his leg. He participated in physical therapy once a week at the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital for about four months. \nAlthough he could get back in the water, Green wasn\u2019t allowed to kick for six months. He put a pull buoy between his legs to prevent himself from kicking, which put a lot of strain on his upper body muscles. \nGreen had to push off with one leg for his flip-turns and did only upper body lifts in the weight room. He couldn\u2019t even carry weights around because he couldn\u2019t have any more than the weight of his back pack weighing down on him. Green spent almost an entire year not kicking his legs in the water. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just a long process, and it\u2019s still not over,\u201d Green said. \u201cThey said it\u2019s going to take up to two years to completely heal all the way because I guess bone grows back really slowly.\u201d \nGreen still is dealing with a lot of pain, but said he is happy he still gets to compete this year. He swims the 200- and 500-yard freestyle events for the Bull Frogs and is also hoping to get on relay teams this year. \nGreen is not yet able to do any impact activity like running, but his doctor informed him that moving his leg around in the pool can actually be good for his recovery. \nGreen is back to regular swimming workouts and competitions for his sophomore season. He isn\u2019t all the way back to where he was, but is slowly working on getting there. North coach Logan Schaefer said they both have been working on focusing on the things Green is able to do and do the best they can. \n\u201cI think once we start to move and progress overall to getting back to full swimming, I think those things that we could do are going to be some strengths as we build back into more of the kicking and those types of things that we couldn\u2019t do a whole lot of recently,\u201d Schaefer said. \nGreen already is getting close to the times he swam last season, which is a good sign of how his recovery is going.

If booking through Cheap Caribbean, you can not choose your seat, so you will deal with it when you check in at the airport. There is also no baggage allowance. $50 per bag, per person. When paying thousands of dollars for a trip, pay the extra few dollars for a flight with a real airline, so that someone is accountable and you have access to basic info, such as flight status. These \"Preferred Flights\" or \"Exclusive Vacation Flights\" are NOT operated by the airlines listed. Apple Vacations simply rents the plane from those airlines. The flight crew is not the listed airline either. Who are the pilots? Apple Vacation employees? No way of knowing. The airline listed will have no information on the flight. Beware! Again... Pay the few extra dollars and choose a flight operated by the listed airline. Or, book your vacation package with one of the airlines, or directly through the resort/hotel. Most of them offer similar packages with the actual airlines operating the planes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:44.132+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6644b7fa91e6659ece9143ca785fa1a934d1e027", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQff9Glnpk_0QaFn9N7049Or65yvLSinVyXsU1gISd3FdqXqkFDC0qXlCKNYsCNhDHcfOZ3eYZ0MZpLLM.6GR25", "site_full": "betinuganda.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://betinuganda.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "TODAY FREE TICKET \u2013 BETINUGANDA", "title": "TODAY FREE TICKET", "title_full": "TODAY FREE TICKET", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6644b7fa91e6659ece9143ca785fa1a934d1e027", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQff9Glnpk_0QaFn9N7049Or65yvLSinVyXsU1gISd3FdqXqkFDC0qXlCKNYsCNhDHcfOZ3eYZ0MZpLLM.6GR25", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "betinuganda", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "TODAY FREE TICKET", "text": "FREE TODAY\nEFA Copenhagen vs Sheriff 1X \u2013 UEFA Dynamo vs Partizan Over 1.5 Goals \u2013 UEFA Real Sociedad vs Zenith Over 1.5 Goals \u2013 UEFA H.Beer Sheva vs Plzen Over 1.5 Goals \u2013 SPAIN Cordoba vs Villanovense Under 3.5 Goals \u2013 ALGERIA Alger vs Harrach Under 3.5 Goals \u2013 EUROPA Crvena vs koln 1x \u2013 UEFA Rijeka vs AC Milan Over 1.5 Goals PAY TO PAYPAL ACCOUNT\n\nEMAIL: SUBSCRIBE FOR NONE UGANDAN WITH PAYPAL HERE AT $3 ONLY AND GET TICKETS HERE FROM OUR STORE \nCONTACT US HERE Tel:+256778928821 \nEmail:nkivestment@gmail.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "uefa dynamo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "efa copenhagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ac milan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uefa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zenith", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "spain cordoba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rijeka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "algeria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:44.181+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "259d847783a3ee0f15a35662218142d0eea64685", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9T3k..iGbIpFLtQ3uaOQzfbMoMcfOfBnRL1_FOdcm7jcNeyKJI0CxxyCi_uDm7HgcZsXAl.xc1tDxkXDtrGMkkXbn5gx1k60Ld0BetWbWPHA--", "site_full": "www.jamestownpress.com", "site": "jamestownpress.com", "site_section": "http://www.jamestownpress.com/atom.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "@ Jamestown Press", "title": "William A. \u201cBill\u201d Clarke", "title_full": "William A. \u201cBill\u201d Clarke", "published": "2017-12-07T09:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.jamestownpress.com/sites/www.jamestownpress.com/files/images/2017-12-07/15p1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "259d847783a3ee0f15a35662218142d0eea64685", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9T3k..iGbIpFLtQ3uaOQzfbMoMcfOfBnRL1_FOdcm7jcNeyKJI0CxxyCi_uDm7HgcZsXAl.xc1tDxkXDtrGMkkXbn5gx1k60Ld0BetWbWPHA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "William A. \u201cBill\u201d Clarke", "text": "Print William A. \u201cBill\u201d Clarke \nWilliam A. \u201cBill\u201d Clarke, 100, of Fairfax, Va. and formerly of Jamestown, R.I., passed away peacefully Dec. 1, 2017, with his family at his side. \nHe was the beloved husband of the late Ruth Clarke; devoted father of Sharon Clarke, William Clarke III and the late Thomas Clarke; and brother of Russell Clarke, Richard Clarke, Winnifred Russell, Ida Dalrymple, and Penelope Clarke.

Ogogo and Emeagwai are Akinlabi\u2019s girlfriend and friend respectively.\n\nPUNCH Metro learnt that a team of five policemen, including Abua, had flagged down Ogogo at a checkpoint along Igbuzo Market.\n\nOne of the policemen, identified as Nwokolo, was said to have demanded money from Akinlabi and the driver told him that he did not have N200 to give him.\n\nNwokolo reportedly said he would take one of the N1,000 notes Jerry had on him.\n\nAs Akinlabi drove off from the checkpoint, Abua reportedly shot at the car and bullets pierced the back of the vehicle, hitting Ogogo, who sat at the back seat.\n\nThe bullet also grazed the back of Emeagwai, who was at the passenger\u2019s seat.\n\nAkinlabi told our correspondent that four cops, including the team leader, one ASP Akhabue, were detained by the police, while Abua evaded arrest.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn Sunday, November 17, 2017, I was driving to the Igbuzor Market and on getting to a checkpoint, I met the policemen. We knew one another some months ago when I had an issue concerning a property at the station. I sounded the horn to greet them, but they did not respond.\n\n\u201cOne of them used his gun to hit the boot and I reversed. He said I wanted to beat the checkpoint. I told him that I assumed that they knew me very well and apologised. He demanded money. I wanted to give him N100 or N200, but it was N1,000 notes I had on me and I explained to him.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Am I too small to collect N1,000?\u2019 When I declined to give him N1,000, he asked me to pull over, which I did. As the argument over N1,000 got heated, I entered my car and drove off. What I heard next was three gunshots aimed at my car.\n\n\u201cA bullet pierced into the car, hit my girlfriend\u2019s body, came out and hit my friend in the back.\u201d\n\nThe 22-year-old indigene of Oyo State said he took the victims to a general hospital in Igbuzo, from where Ogogo was referred to the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba.\n\nHe said he called a senior police officer at Asaba who notified the state Commissioner of Police of the incident.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe CP and the DPO of the Igbozo Police Station came to the FMC and deposited N100,000, but I have spent much more than that. Meanwhile, the policeman who shot at us had gone to drop the gun at the station and fled. The other four policemen were detained at the command headquarters. My friend and I wrote our statements there.\u201d\n\nAkinlabi explained that a police officer asked him to drop his car key to aid investigation. He added that he handed over the car key, but activated the steering lock because he suspected foul play.\n\nHe said he met with the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Zone 5, Benin, Edo State, who assigned a policeman to take his statement, adding that the policeman came down to the police command, Asaba, the following day.\n\n\u201cAs I was returning from Zone 5 on Monday, I received a call from the Investigating Police Officer at the police headquarters in Asaba and he asked for the steering key.

The raid was conducted a day after President Rodrigo Duterte ordered that the war against drugs will be back to the Philippine National Police (PNP). \n\n\n\nAccording to Ozamiz City Police Director Chief Inspector Jovie Espenido, who supervised the series of raids, the seized \u2018shabu\u2019 are old stock hidden by the Parojinog family. He added that the illegal drugs are planned to be sold, now that Mayor Reynaldo Parojinog Sr. is dead, and his children, Vice Mayor Nova Parojinog, and Reynaldo Jr. are both in jail.\n\nEspenido said the first raid was conducted in Misamis Occidental on Tuesday. The arrested suspects were identified as Melden Rabanes, a first cousin of Vice Mayor Parojinog, Butch Merino, the vice mayor\u2019s former driver, and a certain Rosielyn Walohan. Confiscated from them are packs of alleged shabu, amounting to around P32 million.\n\nIn the follow-up operation on Wednesday, December 4, police raided the houses of a certain Michelle Gumapac, and Melodina and Gaudencio Malingin, Butch Merino\u2019s parents. Confiscated from them are airsoft rifle, a steel vault owned by Vice Mayor Parojinog, and 10 kilos of suspected shabu, with an estimated street value of P80 million.\n\nIt can be recalled that Mayor Reynaldo Parojinog Sr. his wife Susan, Misamis Occidental Board member Octavio Parojinog Jr.,and 13 others were killed in an anti-drug operation in their compound led by Espenido last July 30. This was after President Duterte mentioned the Parojinogs in his list of so-called narcopoliticians. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Vice Mayor Parojinog and Reynaldo Jr. are currently detained at the police headquarters in Camp Crame in Quezon City.
