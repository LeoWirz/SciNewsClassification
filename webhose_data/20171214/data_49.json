The proposal came from none other than Rafizi himself, who was at the forefront of highlighting issues plaguing the National Feedlot Corporation (NFC) \u2013 a government project which was awarded to Shahrizat's family \u2013 during the earlier part of this decade. Rafizi said that should Shahrizat ( photo ) succeed him as the Pandan MP, it would help to soothe \u201cold wounds.\u201d \"I would like to invite her to contest in Pandan to heal old wounds. Not only will that 'immature boy' who dug up the NFC scandal no longer be around, but the Wanita Umno chief can snatch the seat (from the opposition). \n\n\"It will soothe old wounds because she will still be in politics, while I will be resting for at least five to 10 years,\" he said in a statement today. The NFC scandal broke in 2011 following an auditor-general\u2019s report concluding that the project was a flop and squandered the RM250 million government soft loan it was granted. Following this, the spotlight fell on Shahrizat's family, because the company was run by her husband and aided by her children. The contract was awarded at a time when Shahrizat was still a cabinet member. Eventually, her husband, Mohamad Salleh Ismail, was charged with misappropriating RM49.7 million that was meant for the NFC project. The sum was used to purchase luxury properties, in what was commonly described as the \"cows and condos\" affair. Salleh was later  acquitted . By 2012, Shahrizat  stepped down  as cabinet minister, and was not fielded in the 2013 general election. It is uncertain if Shahrizat will be dropped as a BN candidate for two elections in a row, despite holding an extremely powerful position in Umno. \nAs for Rafizi, he currently facing the prospect of jail after being  charged  for leaking bank documents related to the NFC affair. He has already been  found guilty  in an unrelated case and sentenced to 18 months in jail. However, he is still free pending appeal.- Mkini ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rafizi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shahrizat abdul jalil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafizi ramli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "- mkini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamad salleh ismail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salleh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shahrizat", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wanita umno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national feedlot corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pandan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wanita umno", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:08.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d7b6759e1962896cdd16e5512373e3f0d3ba60d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWDz7nM3f4TwV4iRCU3qXHF6whpEj6G7Uza1PlGZgrE4L2sA1MvSp.xDQLlb0UHaO0jrI_izfiWt1xsE0o058o7JmDyDOPYl_XruklgcoqBPsqXqUm9JbFX_mbDDRLFnNlKVCqLynrUMPJfVdoUHIQunWcv5r6hkoD", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-outdoor-grills/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "BBQ &amp; Outdoor Dining - Buy BBQ &amp; Outdoor Dining at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Coleman FlipLid 6 Personal Cooler Outdoor Picnic Camping Hiking Coolers (Blue)", "title_full": "Coleman FlipLid 6 Personal Cooler Outdoor Picnic Camping Hiking Coolers (Blue) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2016-08-22T17:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.624, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d805c845aee0a056974d497d66314f44ca2c2425", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWDz7nM3f4TwV4iRCU3qXHF6whpEj6G7Uza1PlGZgrE4L2sA1MvSp.xDQLlb0UHaO0jrI_izfiWt1xsE0o058o7JmDyDOPYl_XruklgcoqBPsqXqUm9JbFX_mbDDRLFnNlKVCqLynrUMPJfVdoUHIQun.X9clq2lf39DH46kpR3zY-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Mohd R.", "published": "2017-11-30T09:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "Five Stars", "text": "good item value for money", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:08.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10a5a3fe0ecd877a07aaa1b698630f4ca19f2236", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ze7iYzhB4pfeTMEnNGNjvueYEu5c41P.xrYvTowai_OlOia6MRS4HTvoChJf15Lm2x7k9nDT98abLgbnJXMbkRTEuxZXyjtdByUVXsghtRw--", "site_full": "www.fosterruns.com", "site": "fosterruns.com", "site_section": "http://www.fosterruns.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Foster Runs", "title": "Ups and downs betwixt first and second breakfast", "title_full": "Ups and downs betwixt first and second breakfast", "published": "2017-12-06T16:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10a5a3fe0ecd877a07aaa1b698630f4ca19f2236", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ze7iYzhB4pfeTMEnNGNjvueYEu5c41P.xrYvTowai_OlOia6MRS4HTvoChJf15Lm2x7k9nDT98abLgbnJXMbkRTEuxZXyjtdByUVXsghtRw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "david", "published": "2017-12-06T16:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ups and downs betwixt first and second breakfast", "text": "Observations of an occasional runner Posted on by david Ups and downs betwixt first and second breakfast \nMy hearty breakfast this morning consisted of porridge with banana & yoghurt and a glass of orange juice followed (after a short break) by two eggs on toast with fried tomatoes, a large piece of coffee & walnut cake and two cups of tea\u2026 now three. Yummy! \nThe short break involved a particularly enjoyable run on the Downs with Daren. \nIt\u2019s fair to say that the very first words usually spoken, when we meet in the car park next to Jack & Jill windmills after a typical few months\u2019 absence, usually involves a question: \u2018Shall we go for coffee instead?, asked from the warmth of one or other car. Today, as my car window whirred quietly down and the chilly wind blowing in made me wonder if coffee really might be the better idea, Daren smugly lifted a Small Batch cup to his lips :-)) \nThe chilly wind encouraged us not to hang around & discuss whether or not we were going to run. This was a good thing as we quickly realised that we were on better form than either of us expected. After a short uphill section we coasted easily down to Pyecombe, already deep in conversation. After Pyecombe the gradient is against us all the way to the top of Wolstonbury Hill, but the conversation carried us all the way up, almost without effort. \nIt was a flat grey day and not so very cold for December provided that we were out of the wind. We thus paused only very briefly at the top before coasting comfortably down the other side and into the middle of a deep valley. The route then goes directly up the other side and is steep enough that steps have thoughtfully been cut\u2026 and effort is definitely required to climb them! \nWe then continued to do really well all the way along through Clayton until we reached the Tank Tracks, which cover 420 vertical feet from bottom to top, in half a horizontal mile. This is always our nemesis, but it\u2019s fair to say that I really struggled with the climb today and that, but for Daren, I would have stopped to walk. In fact, even as we neared the very top, I was feeling the pressure building to walk, like the children in the marshmallow experiment who succumbed to temptation moments before they would otherwise have earned themselves a second marshmallow. Even our engaging conversation petered out! \nI\u2019ve never before needed to sit down at the top, but today I could hardly stand. Only the biting wind drew me back to my feet to finish the 6.4 mile run in a respectable 73 minutes. This is actually much closer to the times we were running a couple of years ago and a full 11 minutes faster than the last time we ran the circuit! :-)) \nAs with my run with Nick three weeks ago, I now need to recover ahead of a two-hour yoga session this evening\u2026 time to do some work before lunch and a mid-afternoon nap, methinks!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david ups", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clayton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jack & jill", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pyecombe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wolstonbury hill", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:08.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "92d44167e41af368f9a5599ae763cb91a7334c7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRv_FeSKK7QtkvYo44Xv5qCugjO1hybSDImPr8z_2McIW93QXL2hGfE1Ww5QNssy28PBrxq.SqN0GzP7VmSahaNhz_17gCswC6XucsxC6IX9A--", "site_full": "southcoastsun.co.za", "site": "southcoastsun.co.za", "site_section": "http://southcoastsun.co.za/rss-output", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "South Coast Sun", "title": "Jam-packed December line-up planned for fun, summer holiday", "title_full": "Jam-packed December line-up planned for fun, summer holiday", "published": "2017-12-07T09:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://southcoastsun.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2017/12/e49sct2-Custom.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "92d44167e41af368f9a5599ae763cb91a7334c7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRv_FeSKK7QtkvYo44Xv5qCugjO1hybSDImPr8z_2McIW93QXL2hGfE1Ww5QNssy28PBrxq.SqN0GzP7VmSahaNhz_17gCswC6XucsxC6IX9A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Earl Baillache", "published": "2017-12-07T09:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Jam-packed December line-up planned for fun, summer holiday", "text": "Entertainment Jam-packed December line-up planned for fun, summer holiday Renowned for its picturesque beaches, warm community and laid-back lifestyle, Amanzimtoti is gearing up for a bumper festive season. 4 hours ago It\u2019s all systems go for a bumper festive season in Amanzimtoti, thanks to the hard work of SCT members, beach security and sponsors to provide plenty of sizzling fun in the sun for residents and holidaymakers this December. \nSapphire Coast Tourism (SCT) members have been hard at work to provide plenty of sizzling fun in the sun for residents and holidaymakers this summer. \u201cDecember is always a really busy month for the jewel of KZN,\u201d said SCT chairman, Romy Wentzel. \n\u201cOur incredible beaches, world-class dive sites, cultural spots, nature reserves and quality food and drink venues keep the tourists coming year after year.

Their striking metal is manifested on seven albums including their latest most fierce and sophisticated release \u00bbBeyond The Stars\u00ab which is a conceptual album. The concept is about Extraterrestrial civilizations who descended on Earth in order to rise the spiritual awareness of mankind and interfere in the process of humanity\u2019s evolution. \n\u00bbBeyond The Stars\u00ab is the seventh album from the band. It pushes further the boundaries of the band and opens a new chapter in their musical opus. All members of the band have recorded the album simultaneously, resulting in an organic sound that is consistently embedded into modern production. Metalsteel is combining raw aggression with melodic arrangements. This forms a homogenous mixture of striking metal with progressive elements and guitar and vocal harmonies. \u00bbBeyond The Stars\u00ab combines simplicity and technical perfection with the recording method rarely used these days and superb production. \nIn their career, they have played numerous shows in Europe and also performed with James Rivera (Helstar, Distant Thunder, Malice).

They have also written and recorded the official anthem for the MetalDays Festival in 2015. \nTrack List for \u00bbBeyond The Stars\u00ab: 01. Lama Rabi Alardi Dini Endavur Esa Kunis Alim 02.

Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight.\nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign.\n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\"\nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed.\n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\"\nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\"\nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice.\n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said.\nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006.\nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\"\nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\"\nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable.\nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\"\nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker.\nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe.\nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" \u2014 women who have come forward on sexual harassment.\nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations.\nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them.\nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan.\nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003.\nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "franken", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeann tweeden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruben kihuen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy klobuchar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota state fair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-nev.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:10.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9902a85b005e63a6e961959b43f327b7c25cf1f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.APoC0YWiRzi9C4R047VTVObEuT9O2uRnmSMf0_uELTorxFuL8iSlQ2Fkt1RdesHMHFJQ8CCFOHt3_40Zn3LkqasFZ5qPgnAmyFuzD7hrR4w--", "site_full": "weingut-weiberle.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://weingut-weiberle.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Durchs Jahr mit Weingut Weiberle", "title": "R\u00fcckblick Wengerter-Advent 2017", "title_full": "R\u00fcckblick Wengerter-Advent 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9902a85b005e63a6e961959b43f327b7c25cf1f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.APoC0YWiRzi9C4R047VTVObEuT9O2uRnmSMf0_uELTorxFuL8iSlQ2Fkt1RdesHMHFJQ8CCFOHt3_40Zn3LkqasFZ5qPgnAmyFuzD7hrR4w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Weingut Weiberle (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "R\u00fcckblick Wengerter-Advent 2017", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:10.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f703a846f8cf2fb804b7e696871c50687429b40", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdv._bE.Rm0vQ5LwUn_WhXMbKxDDxxn1jLc09y9iTj2mUv2581EN5KRjBLWBWmI8WRBQaAXs14J4.GwJLCHp8ijXZ_KAaqycmYogCewfP4bzm11zCJKJpu", "site_full": "www.citehr.com", "site": "citehr.com", "site_section": "https://www.citehr.com/recent.php", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Cite.Community (Human Resource)", "title": "EPF - Pension Contribution cannot be withdrawn if the duration is less than 10 years?", "title_full": "EPF - Pension Contribution cannot be withdrawn if the duration is less than 10 years? - CiteHR", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.citehr.com/citehr-og.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5740, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13481d174075f1e9134c0b3ca35c1d04746fa283", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdv._bE.Rm0vQ5LwUn_WhXMbKxDDxxn1jLc09y9iTj2mUv2581EN5KRjBLWBWmI8WRBQaAXs14J4.GwJLCHp8ijXZ_KAaqycmYogCewfP4b_xvNrIqft09JuWKKQbBu_0-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Kindly lodge online grievance in the EPFO portal.

It is swelling with extensive capacities to grow as a nation and contribute to the growth of the global economy. It is without a doubt that the UK provides domestic and international investors alike with countless opportunities to successfully trade and strengthen their financial positions at a crucial time. Equity Market in the UK \nIn the UK, the primary stock exchange is the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Meanwhile, the benchmark blue-chip index in the UK is the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 Index. \nThe LSE is the world\u2019s third largest stock exchange as it is Europe\u2019s largest stock exchange. Almost 2,300 stocks are presently listed on the LSE, bringing its overall market valuation to more than \u20186 trillion. It also boasts itself as one of the world\u2019s first stock exchanges, having been created in 1801. \nThe LSE operates under the supervision of the LSE Group, which had been created in October 2007 from the combination of the LSE and the Borsa Italiana. \nOn the other hand, the FTSE 100 weighs the 100 most actively traded stocks on the LSE as a free-float, market-capitalization-weighted index. It had been created on January 3, 1984 using 1,000 points as its base value. \nThe FTSE 100 operates under the supervision of an LSEG subsidiary, the FTSE Group. It represents roughly 80% of the overall market valuation on the LSE. The FTSE 100 has an overall market valuation of roughly $1.70 trillion as of September. UBS ETF BlombgBarcl US LqCrp1-5Yr USD A is a stock traded on the U.K\u2019s stock exchange. \nReviewing of the components of the FTSE 100 occurs four times a year. To be specific, it occurs on the first Wednesday after the first Friday of March and every succeeding three months thereafter. The components are regularly reviewed to make sure that they meet all conditions for inclusion in the FTSE 100. UBS ETF BlombgBarcl US LqCrp1-5Yr USD A has relatively good liquidity. \nThe FTSE 100 is a competent indicator of the LSE. However, it is a weaker indicator of the UK economy than the FTSE 250, which weighs the 250 most actively traded stocks on the LSE. Such is the case for three reasons: 1) most of the components of the FTSE 100 are international stocks; 2) the FTSE 250 is more extensive than the FTSE 100 in terms of the number of components; and 3) most of the components of the FTSE 250 are domestic stocks. \nThe FTSE 100 had posted its all-time low of 427.50 points in February 1978. Upon recovery, the FTSE 100 had posted its all-time high of 7,103.98 points in April 2015. Meanwhile, in October, it had posted its best intraday high of 7,129 points. Trading in the UK \nThe regular session on the LSE starts at 8:00 a.m. and ends at 4:00 p.m. \nThe UK is consistently materializing its growth prospects. It boasts with meaningful potentials that can truly leverage growth opportunities\u2019 thanks to a healthy corporate environment that is viable for all kinds of investors. Because of this, many investors are flocking European equity markets, particularly that of the UK. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect UBS ETF BlombgBarcl US LqCrp1-5Yr USD A.

With its hard rock meets Stax infused sound, the band delivers a formidable performance. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a song a lot of people know; it\u2019s an old soul classic, but it\u2019s not really one you might expect,\u201d says Shirley \n\u201cOne of the things Jeff Beck had said to me once that I thought was so wonderful,\u201d explains Hart, was \u201cas soon as you get comfortable, and if you stay there, you\u2019re just gonna start dying as an artist. And I feel that one of the gifts that I\u2019ve got with working with Joe is that I\u2019m always uncomfortable- in a good way. \u201c \nShirley adds about the band, \u201dthose guys just played live and it was incredible to be in the studio when that happens.\u201d \n\u201cFor me I\u2019m able to explore the kind of music I have always admired from afar,\u201d reveals Bonamassa. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want to hear me singing Ella Fitzgerald\u2026\u201d he explained as Beth joins in. \u201cI would never do Ella Fitzgerald without being with Joe, the things I get to do with you are things I grew up always wanting to do, but never believed I could.\u201d \nThe gospel flavoured R&B, Saved, originally performed by LaVern Baker, has been covered by Elvis Presley, Brenda Lee, Billy Fury, Elkie Brooks and The Band, amongst others. It is a full throttle, tongue-in-cheek moment, written from the perspective of someone who had lived a fast, loose life but is then \u201csaved\u201d and is now standing on a corner preaching to the passers-by. They take an altogether different mood on Soul on Fire, paying homage to Baker\u2019s first ever solo release. Sitting On Top of The World is a classic, and it has been recorded by some of the world\u2019s most iconic artists. Lullaby of the Leaves, was originally recorded by Ella Fitzgerald, from 1964\u2019s Hello Dolly. \nThe sultry punch of Lucinda Williams\u2019 Joy has a totally irresistible groove. \u201cWe have tracks like that and I love the energy,\u201d Shirley adds. Addicted is taken from the 2007 trip-hop leaning album by the Austrian trio, Waldeck, which Shirley came across whilst on holiday and \u201cshazamed\u201d it. \nBeth Hart & Joe Bonamassa \u2013 Black Coffee (Official Music Video) \nDamn Your Eyes is taken from the Etta James 1988 comeback record, Seven Year Itch. Kansas Joe McCoy\u2019s jazz-blues Why Don\u2019t You Do It Right? made its first impact on Lil Green\u2019s 1941 version, before Peggy Lee covered it a year later. \nThey harness prime Steve Marriot on his take of Ike & Tina Turner\u2019s Black Coffee. The inspiration came from his live version on the BBC\u2019s Old Grey Whistle Test in 1973. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really predicated on the vocals,\u201d Bonamassa explains. \u201cWe can\u2019t cut these tunes without Beth singing and once she starts singing, it\u2019s the glue that inspires us to get the extra 10% out of the playing. If we just cut them and sang later, the magic wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s something the two of us stopped doing many years ago,\u201d agrees Hart. \u201cThere was all this layering, and then it\u2019s time for you to sing. It\u2019s like you\u2019re not even making music any more. There\u2019s nothing like being able to sit there live and see Joe, seeing the drums, seeing the bass, being able to see Kevin. I can feel the vibrations, it changes the whole thing.\u201d \n\u201cKevin really gets that,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt works the best. In the old days, that\u2019s how they did it; bad ass singers and bad ass musicians would have a couple of hours to get a whole record done.\u201d \nOne of the key aspects of the sessions is to push everyone as much as possible. \u201cThey are always out of their comfort zone in the studio; this session especially wasn\u2019t comfortable,\u201d Shirley reveals. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a summer in the grass session, just a couple of chords; this is people digging in. Everyone left feeling totally challenged, and at the end of the day, completely enthusiastic.\u201d \nTrack List 1 Give It Everything You Got 2 Damn Your Eyes 4 Lullaby Of The Leaves 5 Why Don\u2019t You Do Right 6 Saved 7 Sitting On Top Of The World 8 Joy", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "beth hart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe bon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe bonamassa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elkie brooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ella fitzgerald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ike", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonamassa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elvis presley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peggy lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tina turner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas joe mccoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etta james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beth hart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucinda williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brenda lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lavern baker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shirley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve marriot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe bonamassa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff beck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy fury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edgar winter", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "music reviews // pink cream 69 | headstrong grammy nominated beth hart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "black coffee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "old grey whistle test", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waldeck", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:10.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee053ac8071372c43f82b7ebdc329a6ca5857512", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCNLOI102eCJdzmNcrCsCDvhB23.im.cYqiUqLWppJXD3uUdZVp2Tx6JonYhjU8PkSXhQIiQA5FWnfcTTZiaYpo282oi28P7G3k.clrzZzow--", "site_full": "www.olx.ba", "site": "olx.ba", "site_section": "http://www.olx.ba/rss", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "OLX.ba artikli", "title": "Samsung Galaxy S6 EDGE PLUS + 64GB SIVI *NOVO*", "title_full": "Samsung Galaxy S6 EDGE PLUS + 64GB SIVI *NOVO*", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "BA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s6.pik.ba/galerija/2016-05/13/06/slika-684264-57360091006c8-default.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6838, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee053ac8071372c43f82b7ebdc329a6ca5857512", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCNLOI102eCJdzmNcrCsCDvhB23.im.cYqiUqLWppJXD3uUdZVp2Tx6JonYhjU8PkSXhQIiQA5FWnfcTTZiaYpo282oi28P7G3k.clrzZzow--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Samsung Galaxy S6 EDGE PLUS + 64GB SIVI *NOVO*", "text": "-SVE BOJE -GARANCIJA -PLA\u0106ANJE NA RATE -ZAMJENA DA- 063-033-333 Detaljni opis **Prodaju se SAMSUNG GALAXY S6 EDGE PLUS 64GB mobiteli** **NOVI, ZAPAKIRANI, NE KORI\u0160TENI** **BIJELA, CRNA, GOLD/ZLATNA i SIVA BOJA** **ORIGINALNA FULL-FULL OPREMA** **TVORNI\u010cKI OTKLJU\u010cANI NA SVE MRE\u017dE** \nMO\u017dE I RAZNA VRSTA ZAMJENE UZ NA\u0160U ILI VA\u0160U NADOPLATU SVEJEDNO!

DK IB LSD 1-10       114.71 and high of 114.71. What Makes The German Commerce? \nWith Germany being considered by the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the biggest exporter of goods worldwide, it is no longer surprising why the German Stock Exchange is one of the most important stock exchanges that make or break global commerce. Companies like DK IB LSD 1-10 enjoy to be the part of German stock exchange. German Stock Exchange \nThe German Stock Exchange consists of eight stock exchanges located throughout Germany. DK IB LSD 1-10 were included in one of its units as well. The biggest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the FWB Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse, which is owned and operated by Deutsche B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt. These companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange alone represent 80% of the overall market capitalization in Germany. The second largest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Stuttgart Stock Exchange or the B\u00f6rse Stuttgart. Most financial companies are listed here. \nOther major components of the German Stock Exchange include the B\u00f6rse Berlin-Bremen, the B\u00d6AG B\u00f6rsen AG, and the Hamburg Stock Exchange or the Hamburger B\u00f6rse. \nThe B\u00f6rse Berlin-Bremen, which is located in Berlin-Charlottenburg, was established in 2003 from the union of the Berlin Stock Exchange and the B\u00f6rse Bremen. \nMeanwhile, the B\u00d6AG B\u00f6rsen AG, which oversees trade in Hamburg and Hanover, was established in 1999 from the union of the Hamburg Stock Exchange and the Hanover Stock Exchange. Benchmark Index \nThe major index on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is the German Stock Index, commonly known as Deutsche Aktien Xchange 30 (DAX 30), which is the benchmark equity market index in the country. \nDAX 30 tracks the top 30 companies in terms of market capitalization listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Consequently, DAX 30 is a vital indicator of the health of the German economy and investor sentiment as well. Many investors are interested in such DAX companies as DK IB LSD 1-10. \nThe companies tracked by DAX 30 are capped at 10% weight in order to meet its provisions. This also prevents index heavyweight that might result from mergers and acquisitions (M&As). \nDAX 30 has two versions: 1) performance index, which is usually quoted; and 2) price index, which is similar to indices quoted in other countries. \nThe index has a base value of 1,000 since December 1987. DAX 30 indices are calculated using XETRA since June 1999. Since 2006, they are being calculated after every second. \nThe movement on DAX 30 is in 0.50 increments. The margin requirement among most brokers is 2% while the minimum trade size is one index. \nDAX 30 had its longest period of glory days around 2003 to 2007. During that time, it had peaked at \u20ac8,105.69. However, after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, DAX 30 had hit \u20ac3,580. \nBeing able to fully recover from the repercussions of the turmoil in the earlier decade, DAX 30 had recorded its all-time high in September 2013 at \u20ac8,736. \nThe performance index, on the other hand, had hit the 12,000 mark in March 2015. DAX 30 had attained its all-time high a month later at 12,374.73 after reaching an intraday high of 12,390.75. Its all-time low had been posted in November 1974 at 372.30. \nBecause of the world-renowned success of the DAX 30, more and more investors are betting on the German equity market. They pay close attention to DK IB LSD 1-10 shares. Existing investors have long been enjoying meaningful returns.

Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray \u2014 and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer.\nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year?\nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat \u2014 overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment.\nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms \u2014 known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" \u2014 with standard two-dimensional digital mammography.\nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers.\n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most.\nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices.\n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\"\nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM?\nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.)\nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40.\nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram.\nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening.\nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS?\nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2014 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer.\nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts.\nHOW TO DECIDE?\nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer.\nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image.\nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2014 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2014 that overdiagnosis problem.\nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost.\nTHE NEW STUDY\nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year.\nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening.\n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens.", "highlightText": "",

Currently, there are many different types of DAC twinax cables on the market such as SFP+ DAC Cable and QSFP DAC Cable. Terminated with transceiver-style connectors, they are designed to be used in the same ports as a typical SFP+ or QSFP transceiver, with no need for adaptors or converters, replacing two optical modules and a connectorized optical fiber with a twinax copper cable assembly. Here in this post, we will mainly focus on 56G QSFP+ to QSFP+ DAC Twinax Cable. Basics on 56G QSFP+ to QSFP+ DAC Twinax Cable The 56G QSFP+ to QSFP+ DAC twinax cable, as implied in the name, uses QSFP+ MSA and by using the inexpensive copper twinax cable with QSFP+ connectors on both sides, and provides 56 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity between devices with QSFP+ interfaces\uff0cwhich is suitable for very short distances and offers a highly cost-effective way to establish a 56 Gigabit link connectivity. Unlike 40G (10Gx4) QSFP+ DAC twinax cable, a kind of 40gb ethernet cable , the 56G QSFP+ DAC twinax cable is designed for 56G (14Gx4) InfiniBand FDR interconnecting networking applications such as high-performance computing (HPC), enterprise networking including top-of-rack switching and network storage markets. The 56G QSFP+ DAC twinax cable is fully comply with QSFP+ Multi-Source Agreement (MSA) standards SFF-8436 and InfiniBand FDR specifications. And it is developed specifically as a cost-effective and lower-power alternative to 56G QSFP+ optics and 56G QSFP+ active optical fiber cable (QSFP+ AOC). Specification and Features of 56G QSFP+ to QSFP+ DAC Twinax Cable Now, many suppliers can provide 56G QSFP+ DAC twinax cable for customers. The key features and specification for these products are more ore less the same. Here, we take the generic compatible 56G QSFP+ cable DAC from FS for example. Specification Key Features Lower cost than 56G QSFP+ optics and active optical cable (AOC) Maximum aggregate data rate: 56 Gb/s (4 x 14Gb/s) Compliant with Infiniband QDR/DDR/FDR data rates Hot-pluggable QSFP+ 38-PIN footprint Low Insertion Loss and power consumption Operating temperature range: 0 to 70\u00b0C Summary 56G QSFP+ to QSFP+ DAC twinax cables are passive optic cables designed with high performance, low power consumption, long reach interconnect solution supporting 56G Ethernet. For suppliers like FS, their 56G QSFP+ to QSFP+ DAC and other twinax cable offer compatibility with a huge range of vendors, enabling the connectivity customers need within the Top of Rack and End of Row environments.

Duni AB   47.00M   48,837   106.5 and high of 135. Getting To Know The OMXS30 \nSweden is a uniquely powerful economy in Europe just like Germany, France, and other thriving European economies. Its rich equity market is a proof of its excellent corporate governance that every investor is looking for when it comes to foreign investments. They are looking for Duni AB to check its reliability. The Swedish Equity Market \nThe Stockholm Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Stockholm, is the main stock exchange in Sweden situated in Frihamnen, Stockholm. Duni AB is one of the NASDAQ most active participants. It is operated by Nasdaq Nordiq, a 13-year-old subsidiary of Nasdaq, Inc. \nNasdaq Nordiq was established in 2003 for the primary purpose of overseeing the stock exchanges in Nordic countries. Aside from the Nasdaq Stockholm, it also operates the Tallinn Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Baltic; the Riga Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Baltic; the Iceland Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Iceland; the Helsinki Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Helsinki; the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Copenhagen; and the Armenia Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq OMX Armenia. \nThe Nasdaq Stockholm has been present since 1863, making it one of the oldest European stock exchanges. It has only adopted electronic trading on June 1, 1990. Prior to this, floor trading had happened at the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building. \nThe regular session on the Nasdaq Stockholm commences from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. every business day. That is the time for Duni AB to count its gain. \nThe OMX Stockholm 30 Index (OMXS30) is the market-capitalization-weighted index that monitors the 30 most active stocks on the Nasdaq Stockholm. Numerous sectors make up the OMXS30; and the top three largest sectors are Industrials, Financials, and Consumer Services. Being the benchmark index in Sweden, it is a crucial indicator of the Swedish economy. \nThe OMXS30 is rebalanced twice a year, ensuring a strong indication of how well the Swedish equity market is. As such, some components may be dropped to give way to other companies that are more competitive. Several factors such as liquidity, market capitalization, and industry representation play major role in a stock\u2019s inclusion to the OMXS30. By the Numbers \nAs of the end of the first quarter of 2016, the Nasdaq Stockholm has a market capitalization of nearly $1.30 trillion with over 300 stocks listed on it. \nMeanwhile, the OMXS30 holds an all-time low of 98.86 points, which was last seen in November 1987. Sweden is one of the many countries that had suffered from Black Monday, a remarkable global equity market meltdown in history that began with the sinking of stocks on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HK). \nGradually, the Swedish economy was able to overcome all other challenges through the years. In April 2015, the OMXS30 had reached an all-time high of 1,719.93 points. \nThe Nasdaq Stockholm is one of the most valuable and most competitive stock exchanges in Europe. Because of an attractive borrowing environment in European Union (EU) countries such as Sweden, many investors are flocking the Swedish equity market. There is no better way to take advantage of these growth opportunities than to invest in European stocks such as those listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm. And look for Duni AB advantages. \nDuni AB develops, manufactures, sells, and exports products for the serving and packaging of meals in Russia, the Middle East, North Africa, North America, South and Latin America, Asia and Oceania, and internationally. The company has market cap of $5.26 billion. It operates through Table Top, Meal Service, Consumer, New Markets, and Materials & Services divisions. It has a 16.41 P/E ratio. The firm offers napkins, table covers, candles, meal packaging, ready to eat food packaging products, cups and glasses, plates and serving items, cutlery, boxes and bowls, Duniform sealing machines and tray materials, and ecoecho packaging materials, as well as provides Duni Amuse-bouche products.
