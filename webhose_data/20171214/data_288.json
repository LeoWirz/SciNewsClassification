Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall.\nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation.\nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months.\nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters.\nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action.\n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\"\nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\"\nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East.\nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move.\nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\"\nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts.\n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\"\nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians.

Sometimes it's hard to get that festive feeling going, perhaps due to a busy work or school schedule. I know for me, I'm so excited for Christmas but as my family get a real Christmas tree, my environment doesn't always reflect or encourage that feeling until two weeks into advent! Here are some of the ways I am making my house and lead up to Christmas far more festive!\n\n1- Getting a Christmas- themed book and reading it.\n\n\nAn obvious choice this year is Tanya's Christmas. I've found cosying up under a blanket with a hot drink whilst reading this definitely elevates my Christmas spirit! I also plan to make and bake a lot of the things she has put in the book- a very good read if you are stuck for Christmas ideas.  \n2- Add some Christmas decor to your bedroom \n\n\nI got these really cute wall and window stickers from Wilkinsons for a really affordable price and they've added some glitz, glamour and Christmas cheer to my bedroom. I like how they've subtly changed my permanent decoration and are the first things I see when I wake up on an early college morning.  \n3- Decide on some Christmas bakes! \nI got this book back in 2015 and it is the foundation of the Christmas gingerbread goodies that I make for my friends every year! When i feel the need of a spirit lift, I wack it out and plan out all of the deliciousnous  I will be making throughout December! \n\n4- Find a dark corner and fill it with a small Christmas Tree! \nThis is a staple for me now- I always decorate my mini \u00a36 Christmas tree from Sainsburies and wack it on my bedside table. I love the process of decorating it entirely on my own and having it decorated exactly how I want it! It lights up my room and fills the Christmas tree- shaped hole in my heart while I wait for our real one! \n5- Make some Christmas beverages and eat Christmas food! \nA firm favourite in my household are alcoholic snowballs so I was very pleased when I realised my mum had purchased some advocaat in our weekly shop! To make it extra festive, I got these bauble drinks glasses from my local boutique shop so we can enjoy our snowballs and mulled wine in Christmas style! My mum and I are also currently feasting on lots of mini mice pies to help sustain the Christmas cheer! \n6- Wrap Some Presents! \n\nIf I ever need a Christmas pick me up, I always wrap my gifts up to some top Christmas tunes. I love making the gifts look beautiful with ribbons and bows- it's quite a therapeutic process as well as a merry one! \n\nSo that is some of the things I am doing to help lift my Christmas cheer! \nChristmas Film of the Day- Frozen \nHave an amazing day! \nF x   \n\n\n\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tanya", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wilkinsons", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sainsburies", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:45.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1c95c89dcf8c331d367c11bbed18610abe622258", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYNtGt1pOaY6WrUwIiGs2t4p0o1l46XhG5oEe6vTL.RQUsg8dj1It_YT0kbXKRUy9gVvsANz0_hPYtrS84L.4uhlbwFKS.d9_r3bSgtfygkNte_ugJ6O207ma8XP47HyExd.TIjbdP_Uuq0ZJdTqcQx1F.AygXgackXivePiXTZGg-", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.uk", "site": "tripadvisor.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowForum-g150807-i8-o80-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Cancun Forum, Travel Discussion for Cancun, Mexico - TripAdvisor", "title": "Sandos vs Fiesta vs Paradisus vs Iberostar for wedding - Cancun", "title_full": "Sandos vs Fiesta vs Paradisus vs Iberostar for wedding - Cancun Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-01T23:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1071, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d78850c732cc99ad6c8a73ff3a7d3784a25f51bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYNtGt1pOaY6WrUwIiGs2t4p0o1l46XhG5oEe6vTL.RQUsg8dj1It_YT0kbXKRUy9gVvsANz0_hPYtrS84L.4uhlbwFKS.d9_r3bSgtfygkNte_ugJ6O207ma8XP47HyExd.TIjbdP_Uuq0ZJdTqcQx1F.AygXgackbMLjYClLzb.wE5ztigmfdw--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Web Relations C", "published": "2017-12-02T18:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "-:- Message from TripAdvisor staff -:-\nThis post has been removed at the author's request.

Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test", "text": "WASHINGTON A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray \u2014 and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer.\nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year?\nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat \u2014 overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment.\nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms \u2014 known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" \u2014 with standard two-dimensional digital mammography.\nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers.\n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most.\nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices.\n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\"\nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM?\nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.)\nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40.\nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram.\nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening.\nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS?\nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2014 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer.\nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts.\nHOW TO DECIDE?\nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer.\nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image.\nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2014 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2014 that overdiagnosis problem.\nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost.\nTHE NEW STUDY\nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year.\nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening.\n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens.\n___\nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Halszka resided in private collections around the world before it was acquired in 2015 and offered to palaeontologists for study and to prepare its return to Mongolia,\u201d said Pascal Godefroit, from the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels. \n\u201cIllicit fossil trade presents a great challenge to modern palaeontology,\u201d he added. \nDetailed analysis of the fossil was made possible by technological developments at the ESRF. Scientists used a form of X-ray microtomography to reveal a virtual 3D model of parts of the skeleton still partially buried in the rock. \nThe discovery will now be part of a new dinosaur subfamily, the Halszkaraptorinae. \n\u201cWe knew of dinosaurs which eat fish, notably the Spinosaurus, but we did not think they could swim!\u201d Tafforeau said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul tafforeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pascal godefroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea cau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tafforeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "halszka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "afp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "esrf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european synchrotron radiation facility", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal belgian institute of natural sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capellini geological museum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mongolia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grenoble", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bologna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grenoble", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukhaa tolgod", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "halszka", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:46.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5be8eabc94c0dd0060c7d2a27d58803ddd2f6e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2HT48I_PlzDc", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "/swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics", "title_full": "/co/ - /swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 493, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "955088ff6882d089a2fc83b66653dec91df9f6e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2O8Y28vcGd_1BpOVovLKZVc-", "ord_in_thread": 407, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T10:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97331102\n>Pretty the story was trying to teach you that things are more complicated than white=good and black=bad.\nWhich isn't Star Wars.\n>>97331128\n>It couldn't have been done in a larger questline because those would take longer than the game is set to show the consequences, you fucking utter dumbass.\nIt didn't need to be done at all.\n> It wasn't saying you weren't a good person, it was just saying sometimes things don't always go well no matter what you do.\nNo, it tells you that because you were kind, you're actually a terrible person because your kindness led to the beggar getting mugged.\n>And you are still conveniently ignoring it punishes you for the Dark Side option as well.\nOutside of Dark Side points, no it doesn't.

These are just a few of the popular brands girls love to use during makeup live videos. Photo credit: Claudia Garcia \nYoung women often scroll Facebook and run into live makeup tips from across the world. The women create groups within Facebook so only people they choose to share the tips with can join the exclusive group. \n\u201cI love to go live because I love the interaction I have with my viewers,\u201d said Ellie Ayala, a Facebook user with thousands of followers that often goes live. With just one \u201cnotification\u201d push of a button, they know when I\u2019m on, and they can see me right away.\u201d \nGoing live on social media is also helpful because not only does the audience learn from the make-up guru, but she learns from her audience as well. Ayala\u2019s viewers tell her that her makeup is always \u201con point,\u201d gives good advice on how to make your eyes \u201cpop with color\u201d and how to make it last longer. This is very interactive because as Ayala is doing her makeup, she is able to respond to your question about any makeup tips you might have. \nThese types of videos have their ups and downs. By gaining viewers and shares, the \u2018makeup guru\u2019 gets known throughout the platform. If she\u2019s really good at what she does, more people will follow her page. \nBut going live is not always as pretty as it sounds. There are many women who cyber bully the ones doing their makeup just because that woman isn\u2019t perfect at it or they don\u2019t like the look they\u2019re going for. \n\u201cThere is always going to be someone that talks bad about you whether you do good or bad so the thing that I do is ignore those comments. If it gets to the point where the comments are too disrespectful, I just block the girl,\u201d Ayala said. \nAlejandra Garcia is a Texas State University student who loves watching youtube videos in her free time and finds the Facebook videos interesting. \n\u201cI just find them entertaining because its part of my hobbies to do makeup, and watching them is equally satisfying as doing my own makeup,\u201d she said. \nKarina Marquez, a University of Texas at El Paso graduate, who watches Facebook make-up videos, said she does not really do makeup on herself. \n\u201cEven though I don\u2019t apply makeup on a daily basis because I don\u2019t really know how to, I like watching these girls because of the creativity they have,\u201d she said. \nDespite the criticisms, makeup lovers won\u2019t give up the makeup live videos and will continue to make themselves and other girls happy.

He (Cazorla) answered \u2018I have to start again from zero\u2019. \n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad. What Santi has gone through is unbelievable. It\u2019s really, really sad. But unfortunately he has to start again from zero.\u201d \n\u201cIf all goes well he has to wait until he starts to run and after he starts to run it takes six weeks to come back to training. \n\u201cWhen he can start to run again I don\u2019t know.

By some estimates, the toll exceeds 4,000 deaths a week. Not that social isolation is just Japan's problem. Far from it.\nIn fact, more than 42.6 million adults age 45 or older may suffer from chronic loneliness here in the United States, according to a milestone study conducted by AARP.\nClearly, loneliness comes with the territory for many of our oldest citizens. But to say the least, it can be an unhealthy way to live.\n\u201cThere is robust evidence that social isolation and loneliness significantly increase risk for premature mortality, and the magnitude of the risk exceeds that of many leading health indicators,\u201d said Julianne Holt-Lunstad, Ph.D., professor of psychology at Brigham Young University.\nHolt-Lunst presented the findings of her study on the topic during a recent American Psychological Association meeting.\n\u201cWith an increasing aging population, the effect on public health is only anticipated to increase,\u201d she added.\nIt would seem obvious that one way to combat loneliness and social isolation in old age is immersion into an environment where living can be shared with others. Fortunately, one such solution exists. It is called senior living.\nYet to judge by many of the marketing materials the senior living field produces, that benefit doesn't seem to be much of a selling point. Instead, you're more likely to encounter images of well-manicured grounds, safe environments, modern exercise equipment and tempting meals.\nLook, I get it. Those are all important perks. And in competitive areas, they can help seal the deal.\nBut it seems to me a larger opportunity is often being overlooked here. Companionship is a basic human need. Without it, we wither.\nLet your prospects know they will not be alone. It's a simple message. But in the long run, it may be far more tempting than photos of the kitchen's latest creation.\nJohn O'Connor is editorial director of .

Others went off on rugby club, I did orienteering. Others joined the CCF, I joined bridge club. I preferred fencing to basketball, and long distance running to the 100 yards.\n\nAll of this is of no consequence.\n\nThe importance of today is the connection with bees. You see, I was part of bee-keeping club at school. Now, don't judge me. Yes, my school had a bee keeping club. The link to my school is here . I do not know if they still have a bee-keeping club. I suspect not, not now that they have ditched the school song.\n\n\nFrom this I have always had a great affection for bees. And one  of my ambitions in life is to have some bee-hives. I don't like honey, but I think you can give that away and everyone will be happy.\n\nWhen I went to Chavagnes, I found it difficult to remember boys names, and there was this boy called Amboise. In French, as you know, Amboise is Ambrose, whose feast day it is today.\n\nBut how was I to remember his name??!\n\n\nWell the key was that he had (and still has) a profusion of muddy blond hair atop his head.

ADVERTISEMENT\n\u201cKung sasabihin ng gobyerno na huhulihin sila, mass arrest sila, that\u2019s a violation of JASIG dahil \u2018yan ay pinagkasunduan ng dalawang panig,\u201d Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate said in a press conference with other progressive legislators.\nThe JASIG is an agreement signed by the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front (NDF), CPP\u2019s political wing, in February 1995. It guarantees safety and immunity to negotiators, consultants and other personnel joining the peace talks.\n\u201cHindi pwede na sabihin lang ni (Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque) na may proclamation na and that\u2019s it. As a lawyer, alam natin na kailangan ang agreements, sundin dapat ang nakasaad doon,\u201d Zarate said.\nZarate said that until Malaca\u00f1ang issues a formal termination of the JASIG, the leaders could not be arrested.\nAlso, the termination will only take effect 30 days after its date of issuance.\nAbout 32 political prisoners were released before the peace talks were halted.

In Surakarta, a shelter for children with HIV/AIDS run by Lentera Surakarta Foundation had to relocate several times in one year due to the rejection from the local community. \nOur research that we conducted in 2016 in Jakarta and Surakarta shows that stigma and discrimination are two main factors that stops children with HIV/AIDS from receiving their basic rights. \nIndonesia's central and local governments have enacted a number of regulations to ensure these rights are met. But implementation have floundered. \nMeanwhile, the number of people with HIV/AIDS, including children, , has been increasing. As of December 2016, Indonesia's Ministry of Health has counted more than 5,000 Indonesian citizens aged between 0-19 years old suffer from HIV/AIDS. \nSupport for children who live with HIV/AIDS \nThere are a number of community organisations in Indonesia that specifically advocate for children who live with HIV/AIDS. \nLentera Anak Pelangi has accompanied 96 children in Jakarta. This institution provides health and psychosocial support, case management, as well as advocacy. They believe that the best place for children to grow is with their families , so they can live and be taken care of in a community of caregivers. \nIn Central Java, Lentera Surakarta Foundation , founded by Puger Mulyono, has a shelter to accommodate a dozen children. The children in this house are not only from Solo, but also from another districts, like Batam and even Papua. \nFollowing the rejection from the locals about living among children with HIV/AIDS that were staying in Lentera Surakarta's shelter, the Surakarta administration is building a new shelter house at a location in the city. \nThis shelter is expected to provide children with HIV/AIDS a permanent space that meets their health requirements. This shelter house children with HIV/AIDS who rejected by their families. \nBesides managing shelters, Lentera Surakarta also looks after 101 children with HIV/AIDS who live with their family in Central Java and East Java. \nDuty bearers commitments and challenges \nThe government has actually shown its commitment to fulfil the rights of children with HIV/AIDS by issuing regulations that impact various sectors. \nBeyond regulations about HIV/AIDS, rights protection of children with HIV/AIDS has also been reinforced through the Health Law (Article 137), Social Security , Child Protection Law (Article 2 and Article 67C), Law on Education System (Article 4, 5, 6, dan 12), Law on Social Welfare and a 2010 ministerial decree about the Guidelines for Children's Social Welfare. \nThe government is also working on a HIV/AIDS National Prevention Strategy in the education sector. The draft is currently being reviewed by government institutions, such as the Ministry of Education and Culture, the National AIDS Commission, and other institutions. \nUnfortunately, the government's commitment has not translated to policy implementation. Some classic problems in terms of coordination between different institution and budget allocation still occur. Furthermore, not all government sectors work in sync to protect basic rights of children with HIV/AIDS. \nIt's informative to learn that when the government takes firm actions against perpetrators of discrimination against children with HIV/AIDS, such as replacing headmasters and giving warnings to the discrimination act perpetrators in the case of public school in West Jakarta this year, it doesn't necessarily bring positive changes to the child's life. \nThe child who were involved in the case still could not access formal education after his expulsion. In other words, law enforcement might deter discriminative practices, but it does not ensure the rights of the child are fulfilled. \nStigma in the community \nThis shows that there are structural problems in the protection of children with HIV/AIDS in the form of stigma. The government and the civil society acknowledge that stigma against children with HIV/AIDS creates an obstacle to effectively protect their rights. \nIn general, people understand that HIV/AIDS is an infectious disease. However, this knowledge has not been followed by an understanding that the HIV/AIDS transmission is not that simple compared to the transmission of another infectious disease such as tuberculosis . \nAdditionally, people have have no understanding on how to live side-by-side children with HIV/AIDS. People also still associate the children with HIV/AIDS with the actions of their parents which they consider as negative. \nEncouraging the role of communities \nThere should be efforts to ensure that all elements of the society, not just the government, support the protection of rights of children with HIV/AIDS. Even though it is undeniable that the government still needs to improve the managerial and budget allocation capabilities. \nThe government should provide a complete and accurate information about HIV/AIDS to reduce and eventually eliminate the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS. Communities need to be involved as much as possible. \nCommunities need to be involved in ensuring children with HIV/AIDS receive their basic rights. They should be encourage to show solidarity with children with HIV AIDS.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "de", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "atin prabandari", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "putri rakhmadhani nur rimbawati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irfan ardhani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puger mulyono", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "di dinarto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "guidelines for children's social welfare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of education and culture", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lentera surakarta foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social welfare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national aids commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national prevention strategy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lentera anak pelangi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lentera surakarta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west jakarta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakarta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east java", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "batam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surakarta", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:49.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5be8eabc94c0dd0060c7d2a27d58803ddd2f6e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2HT48I_PlzDc", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "/swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics", "title_full": "/co/ - /swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 493, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b82cc60b45e20251d697d526403915d8ecc0c11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2O8Y28vcGd_1uG5_66rDo6o-", "ord_in_thread": 414, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T10:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97331348\nThe prequels never had a scene where the pit droid head that Anakin fixed for Watto ended up killing him.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:49.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c67612e8de6dcb01662d4894afc6f0cbc514816a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTKamlU1txLV3ixgQ9dj3V9iWqWoOlI_Dc_sxO0fpLs0pIcf2mg0gJl0hkwxfbBrFcHZivvX6iTQqONufcDZZTOV6xAKSrZ0gcL7Bf3.x6W77ft587xd8aZDRDz1gL4rMN8CwWTPUUQdb322SMhuC8u", "site_full": "bdnews24.com", "site": "bdnews24.com", "site_section": "http://bdnews24.com/?widgetName=rssfeed&widgetId=1150&getXmlFeed=true#", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "bdnews24.com - Home", "title": "Australia celebrates \u2018day for love\u2019 as it allows same-sex marriage", "title_full": "Australia celebrates \u2018day for love\u2019 as it allows same-sex marriage", "published": "2017-12-07T16:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 2276, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 203, "comments": 0, "shares": 203}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c67612e8de6dcb01662d4894afc6f0cbc514816a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTKamlU1txLV3ixgQ9dj3V9iWqWoOlI_Dc_sxO0fpLs0pIcf2mg0gJl0hkwxfbBrFcHZivvX6iTQqONufcDZZTOV6xAKSrZ0gcL7Bf3.x6W77ft587xd8aZDRDz1gL4rMN8CwWTPUUQdb322SMhuC8u", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T16:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Australia celebrates \u2018day for love\u2019 as it allows same-sex marriage", "text": "Australia celebrates \u2018day for love\u2019 as it allows same-sex marriage >> Reuters Published: 2017-12-07 14:50:51.0 BdST Updated: 2017-12-07 16:12:50.0 BdST Same-sex marriage campaigners pose for pictures during an equality rally outside Parliament House in Canberra December 7, 2017. AAP via Reuters Members celebrate before the passing of the Marriage Amendment Bill in the House of Representatives at Parliament House in Canberra Dec 7, 2017. AAP via Reuters Previous Next Australia became the 26th nation to legalise same-sex marriage on Thursday, prompting cheers and singing from a packed parliament public gallery in a country where some states ruled homosexual acts to be illegal until just 20 years ago. \nLawmakers, who had cast aside a conservative push to allow religious objectors to refuse service to same-sex couples, waved rainbow flags and embraced on the floor of the chamber, after the overwhelming vote in favour of the bill. \nFewer than five of 150 MPs voted against it. \n\"What a day. What a day for love, for equality, for respect,\" said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \"It is time for more marriages.\" \nThe law, which will also recognise same-sex marriages solemnised in foreign countries, takes effect from Saturday. Because a month's notice is required for the state to recognise a marriage, the first legal same-sex unions will be in January. \nFive-time Olympic gold-medal winner, the swimmer Ian Thorpe, who came out in 2014, said the law reflected contemporary Australia and would support people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual queer or intersex (LGBTQI). \n\"It will give each of us the sense of what modern Australia is, and is, in fact, the way that most of us see this country as being, and will allow LGBTQI people in our nation to know that fairness is one of our values,\" he told reporters in Canberra. \nAustralians had overwhelmingly endorsed legalising same-sex marriage in a postal survey. Members celebrate before the passing of the Marriage Amendment Bill in the House of Representatives at Parliament House in Canberra Dec 7, 2017. AAP via Reuters \"What a moment for the country,\" said Christine Forster, a Sydney councillor and the sister of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, standing among throngs of rainbow-clad campaigners for a \"Yes\" vote, outside parliament with her female partner.\nShe said she planned to go to her brother's house to celebrate. \nAbbott, who is still a member of parliament, was one of the most prominent \"no\" campaigners. He left the chamber before the vote. \nThe bill cleared the upper house last month. \nDuring the debate in the lower house on Monday, a politician proposed to his same-sex partner. \nBoth Turnbull's Liberal-National coalition government and the main opposition Labor Party had said they wanted to pass it by Dec. 7. \nBut despite the support of the main parties, religious organisations and conservative lawmakers had voiced strong opposition and proposed dozens of amendments. \nDuring the debate, they pressed for broad protections for religious objectors, among them florists and bankers, to refuse service to same-sex couples. \nBut their efforts were rejected. \n\"These amendments, rather, are a shield for people and organisations that hold to a traditional view of marriage.

are urging western and central Africa to step up the fight against HIV, saying millions of people, especially children, are at risk from complacency and underfunding. \nA six-day conference in Africa has thrown a stark light on the problems in a region whose two dozen nations extend from Mauritania in the north to Gabon in the south, and include some of the poorest countries in the world. \nCoalition Plus, an alliance of AIDS groups, said AIDS-related deaths in western and central Africa are running at 5.1 percent, more than twice the 2.1 percent in the rest of the continent. \nThe region accounts for just six percent of the global population, but has at least 16 percent of the total of the world's adults\u2014categorised as people aged over 15\u2014who live with HIV. \nThe share rises even more dramatically, to 25 percent, in the category of infected children aged from birth up to 14 years. \nEven though the HIV pandemic is more than four decades old, nearly 80 percent of the estimated 540,000 infected children in West and Central Africa are not getting life-saving antiretroviral therapy, the UN's children's agency UNICEF and AIDS programme UNAIDS said on Tuesday. \n\"HIV and AIDS pose direct threats to the lives of 820,000 children and adolescents,\" they said in a report issued at the ICASA conference which ends on Saturday. \"Yet we know what works.\" \n'Scandalous' rise in youth mortality \nIn 2016, an estimated 60,000 children were newly infected with HIV in West and Central Africa, it said. \nAmong adolescents aged 15-19, AIDS-related deaths are on the rise. Among the 10-19 age group, 16,000 people died last year, a rise of 35 percent over 2010. \n\"The rise in youth mortality is a scandal,\" Marie-Pierre Poirier, UNICEF's director for West and Central Africa, told AFP. \n\"Most of these teenagers are unaware of their HIV status,\" she said. \n\"Everyone is responsible. Support from international donors is insufficient for the region's needs. And governments must give priority to the fight against AIDS, even if they have limited resources,\" she said. \nThe situation is not entirely bleak\u2014the region slashed mother-to-child transmission of HIV by a third from 2010 and 2016\u2014nor is it the same everywhere. \n1.3 million awaiting treatment \nAdult HIV prevalence ranges from less than 0.4 percent in Niger to 6.2 percent in Equatorial Guinea, the figures show. Nearly half of all infected children in the region are in Nigeria. \nBut the major problems are common, say experts. \nOne is the lack of so-called point-of-care HIV tests, so that a patient can be diagnosed and immediately treated\u2014a major step in prevention. \nAnother is availability of antiretroviral drugs, which suppress the virus but do not eliminate it. \nThe cost of AIDS therapy has plummeted since the first triple-therapy drug regimen became available in 1996, and access to the lifeline\u2014taken in a simple once-a-day pill\u2014is spreading across parts of Africa. \nIn West and Central Africa, though, 1.3 million people who know they have HIV are still awaiting treatment. \nStigma and discrimination, as well as homophobia, are factors that help the virus to spread underground. \n\"We have to shift up gears, to that of 'emergency response,' we have to mobilise all of society\u2014government, civil society, families,\" said Poirier.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marie-pierre poirier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poirier", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "icasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unaids", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unicef", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mauritania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equatorial guinea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:50.070+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb1fc6f975010a8c6f46715cb20bbabb4da27dfc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTKamlU1txLV8qJKONKPCikQIRNe53.wiVFgvucxSFy3HHPk0SKddrhsCF23AjKgGQ3xnFEYAa.RIdXN3EyKhpoJLI5t1.LZlwPGvZnXqebzjZGTRAUchirt_dJiNOSRyLFZ8M16dzDxt9R0OpWWHCMkv9IrL028E8-", "site_full": "bdnews24.com", "site": "bdnews24.com", "site_section": "http://bdnews24.com/?widgetName=rssfeed&widgetId=1150&getXmlFeed=true#", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "bdnews24.com - Home", "title": "Dhaka student Momin murder: HC upholds death for two, life imprisonment for six others", "title_full": "Dhaka student Momin murder: HC upholds death for two, life imprisonment for six others", "published": "2017-12-07T16:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 2276, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 179, "comments": 0, "shares": 179}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cb1fc6f975010a8c6f46715cb20bbabb4da27dfc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTKamlU1txLV8qJKONKPCikQIRNe53.wiVFgvucxSFy3HHPk0SKddrhsCF23AjKgGQ3xnFEYAa.RIdXN3EyKhpoJLI5t1.LZlwPGvZnXqebzjZGTRAUchirt_dJiNOSRyLFZ8M16dzDxt9R0OpWWHCMkv9IrL028E8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T16:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "Dhaka student Momin murder: HC upholds death for two, life imprisonment for six others", "text": "Dhaka student Momin murder: HC upholds death for two, life imprisonment for six others Staff Correspondent, bdnews24.com Published: 2017-12-07 14:16:04.0 BdST Updated: 2017-12-07 16:04:09.0 BdST File Pphoto Previous Next The High Court has upheld the trial court\u2019s death sentences for two people and life imprison for six others in the murder of student Kamrul Islam Momin in Dhaka. \nA High Court bench of Justice Bhabani Prasad Singha and Justice Mustafa Zaman Islam announced its decision on the death reference and appeals on Thursday. \nIn 2005, Dhaka Commerce College student Momin was killed in front of his home in the capital\u2019s Kafrul area. \nIn 2011, the trial court sentenced three people to death and jailed six others for life. \nThe prime suspect and death row convict, former police inspector AKM Rafiqul Islam, died in prison in December 2015. The case was well-known for the efforts made by police to \u2018save\u2019 Rafiq. \nThe High Court verdict excluded Islam, who was the OC of Dhaka\u2019s Motijheel police in 2005, due to his death and upheld sentences for the others. \nOf the suspects, Sakhawat Hossain Jewel and Tarek alias Zia are sentenced to death. Habibur Rahman Taj, Zafor Ahmed, Monir Howladar, Babu, Asiful Haq Jony and Sharif Uddin received life in prison. Kamrul Islam Momin (File Photo) Taj and Babu, who are both in prison, had appealed the trial court\u2019s decision at the High Court. The remaining six are absconding, said Assistant Attorney General Bashir Ahmed.\nMomin\u2019s older brother Shamsul Islam Shumon told the media he was satisfied with the decision. \n\u201cWe have received justice. We were often deceived by the police administration. They were trying to influence the case in many ways. We have yet to receive any help from them. Most of the convicts are still at large.\u201d \n\u201cTaj\u2019s gang is still active,\u201d said Shumon. \u201cWe have repeatedly gone to the police station to call for arrests, but they haven\u2019t even issued warrants.\u201d \nThe Supreme Court will uphold the decision if it is appealed, he says. \nMomin was killed in a feud over property boundaries in front of his home in north Ibrahimpur on Sept 13, 2005. That day his father filed a case against OC Rafiq and 25 others. \nOn May 13, 2007 the Police Criminal Investigation Division (CID) filed a chargesheet excluding Rafiq from the list of suspects. \nAn objection was filed with the court and the case was given to the Detective Branch. On Mar 2, 2008 the DB submitted a report that also excluded Rafiq. \nThe judicial branch then took over the investigation and, on Oct 30, 2008 filed a report accusing OC Rafiq and eight others. \nThe chargesheet was accepted on Nov 11 that same year. The trial began with the indictment of the nine suspects on Oct 5, 2009. \nThe case was later handed over to another court. On Jan 2, 2011 Rafiq was indicted again. The verdict was declared on Jul 20, 2011. \nThe case was then sent to the High Court the death references and appeals. The High Court began hearing the case on Nov 12, 2016.

The petition will show the truth of the case and the falseness of the investigation report. We will go to a higher court if necessary.\u201d \nThe court accepted her plea and set Jan 9 to file the petition objecting the police\u2019s report, \nA right-wing activist and staunch government critic, Mazhar was found on a bus in Jessore while travelling from Khulna to Dhaka, 18 hours after he went missing from the capital on Jun 3. \nHis family alleged in a police complaint, which was later recorded as a case, that he was abducted after he left home early that morning. \nThe final probe report submitted by the investigation officer says the case filed by Farida Akhter is baseless and covers up the actual situation. \nThe dramatic disappearance and discovery of the 70-year-old columnist sparked debate in the political quarter and on social media. \nSocial media was abuzz with criticism against Mazhar after police produced a woman, identified as Archana Rani, in court on Jul 10. \nArchana was allegedly traced as part of the law enforcers\u2019 investigation into the man\u2019s disappearance. \nArchana identified herself as a follower of Farhad Mazhar and then told court that he left home on the day of his disappearance to send her money. \n\"The information provided by the woman has matched the police investigation into the Farhad Mazhar incident,\" Detective Branch Assistant Commissioner Hafiz Al Asad, who was in charge of the investigation, told bdnews24.com. \nEarlier, Dhaka Metropolitan Police chief Md Asaduzzaman Mia said detectives were suspicious of the account provided by Farhad Mazhar. \nLaw enforcers have been expressing suspicion about the authenticity of his abduction claim since they discovered him on the bus. \nSecurity footage of him loitering in the New Market area in Khulna on the afternoon of his disappearance further fuelled police's suspicion, said the DMP chief. \nThe account he provided to court is inconsistent with the evidence of the day gathered from CCTV footage, call records and other findings, he had said.

The art exhibitions and panel discussion were previously planned prior to President Donald J. Trump\u2019s decision to repeal the Dream Act. \nTrump announced he\u2019d overturn former President Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program . As Congress is currently responsible to make a final decision in the following six months\u2014on the future of 800,000 DACA recipients \u2014immigrants and non-immigrants started to speak-up to defend young immigrants\u2019 right through a variety of mediums. \n\u201cWe are not in the position to give out advice about DACA, or sort of imagine on what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said director of the Stanlee & Gerald Rubin Center of Visual Arts, Kerry Doyle. \n\u201cWe are going to talk about it from a human perspective, as what\u2019s the experience of an undocumented person who is brought here as a minor, how do we make that visible, and how to relate to that.\u201d \nThe panel discussion was held inside the art installment Under the Same Sky\u2026 We Dream by painter and sculptor Erika Harrsch. The exhibition is an interpretation of the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act \u2014better known as DREAM Act\u2014the bill purposed to Congress in 2001, but never reached approval. \n\u201cFor me the fact of being undocumented is something that is incredibly sensitive, and I wanted to touch that and recreate this piece,\u201d Harrsch said. \nPainter and sculptor Erika Harrsch, is an immigrant from Mexico City residing in New York City. Harrsch arrived to the U.S. 16 years ago via an O-1 Visa , a work permit provided to those involved in sports, arts and science. After experiencing the possibility of deportation due to a malpractice from a lawyer, she decided to turn her art into an activist perspective. \nHarrsch said: \u201cAll these legislations, all these documents, all the legal aspects that for some is almost incomprehensible, so many people do not even understand that.\u201d \nPanel attendees were seated inside a photography exhibition in conjunction with Harrsch\u2019s installation. \nThe New American Dreamers is a series of photographs by filmmaker Johnson and photojournalist Kerry Sherck, consisted of Dreamers from the Santa Fe area with descriptions of their stories. \nSherck has been a photojournalist for 10 years, and has documented the lives of immigrant laborers. Johnson is a documentary filmmaker born in Bolivia, who was brought to the U.S. when she was 12 years old. Both partnered with the Santa Fe Dreamers Project , a non-profit organization that has served over a 1,000 Dreamers in the past three years. \n\u201cIn a lot of ways Dreamers are more American than I am\u2014since they were brought here as children\u2014but because of the color of my skin, and the place where my parents were born, I have always had privileges that cannot be accessible to Dreamers,\u201d Johnson said. Some of the photographs not displayed at the Rubin Center were placed at the U.S. Senate floor for the past weeks, in order to be part of the narrative in legislation to defend the DACA. \nU.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., has also been sharing the stories in the photographs as part of his argument to support DACA. One of the photographs placed in the Senate is about a 22-year-old Dreamer named Roxana. Sherck said Roxana was reluctant to participate ever since the beginning of the project. \n\u201cAs soon as we found out about that, we called her and said if she was okay with that, that it was time to start fighting,\u201d said Sherck about Roxana. \n\u201cShe felt really strong about coming out at this time and sharing her story, so that was really amazing to see.\u201d \nThe concluding panelist was Director of Community Affairs Claudia Yoli, a 25-year-old Dreamer from Venezuela who has been living in the U.S. for 18 years, and currently works as the for the office of Democrat State Sen. Jose Rodriguez. \nYoli supports a variety of organizations, such as: Battleground Texas , Texas Freedom Network , West Fund , Education Not Deportation , and Border Dreamers Alliance . Yoli initially planned to study Engineering at Emerson College in Brooklyn, NY, but due to her limits as an immigrant that is not eligible for Financial Aid , she could not afford it. \nAfter her experiences as an immigrant, she decided to study Political Science and Communications at the University of Texas at El Paso. UTEP is well known for having an 80 percent of Hispanic/Latino students and six-point-eight percent Non-Resident students . \n\u201cI want to be able to cast a ballot and share that experience with my other U.S. citizen friends because we are immigrants, we are American in a meaningful way, and we are part of the American future,\u201d Yoli said. \nAt the conclusion of the presentation, photographers Johnson and Sherck provided postcards with their photo series of Dreams in order for the audience to send it to legislators and consider to support immigrants\u2019 rights. Audience members also got the opportunity to interact with Harrsch\u2019s art exhibition. Yoli\u2019s future project is attending to Washington D.C. among with 50 Dreamers, through the help from the Border Network for Human Rights , in order to talk to legislators in late October.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sherck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben ray lujan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sylvia johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald j. trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erika harrsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roxana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harrsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerry doyle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerry sherck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claudia yoli", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stanlee & gerald rubin center of visual arts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deferred action for childhood arrivals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emerson college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rubin center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "border dreamers alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "battleground texas , texas freedom network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utep", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "border network for human rights", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa fe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "political science and communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democrat state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa fe dreamers project", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "el paso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolivia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-n.m.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa fe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:51.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d66b500854a52ed1dc0c33755f3b6fade8919dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvVKogmDZTTGsfnyFBiU5HO.v8.OfU_CjXF.jusdQnGnsYb.sGfOLjsvfXQ.MM13NA-", "site_full": "mereja.com", "site": "mereja.com", "site_section": "http://mereja.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=2", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ethiopian News &amp; Opinion \u2022 Ethiopian News Forum", "title": "Eritrea No improvement for Detained Patriarch", "title_full": "Eritrea No improvement for Detained Patriarch \u2022 Ethiopian News Forum", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "641aa889e0ab32f927a7c1e7737ac92d0c4abd5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvVKogmDZTTGsfnyFBiU5HO.v8.OfU_CjXF.jusdQnGnsYb.sGfOLjsbewScnEde3Kp2kW4jUQvgw--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Awash", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Idiot.
