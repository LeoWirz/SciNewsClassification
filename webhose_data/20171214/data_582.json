Kathleen McKiernan Credit: Matt West IT\u2019S COMPLICATED: Sebastien Martin, left, and Arthur Delarue, demonstrate the MIT Operations Research Center algorithm being used to change school start and end times. Staff Photo by Matt West comments City students are expected to know today their new bell start and end times for next year after a team of MIT researchers using 100 computers worked overnight to find the best solution for the Hub\u2019s 125 schools.\n\u201cThis is a problem nobody thought we could solve and we\u2019re going to solve it this evening,\u201d Superintendent Tommy Chang said after a School Committee meeting. \u201cThis is something nobody thought was possible and they literally have run these scenarios ... It is a very complex algorithm.\u201d\nMIT researchers began running an algorithm last night with 100 computers operating in parallel to create 100 solutions in an hour and a half.\nThe move came after the school board voted on a new bell time policy. Boston Public School officials did not release time changes for specific schools ahead of the vote.\nPrincipals and staff will be notified today and letters are expected to go out to families this afternoon.\nThe new policy aims to increase the number of high school kids starting after 8 a.m., increase the number of elementary school students dismissed before 4 p.m. and assign schools with higher numbers of medically fragile students or students with autism to bell times reflective of their needs and reinvest money from the changes back into classrooms. It will be reviewed every five years.\nSchools officials say they have had to strike a balance and make compromises especially when it comes to after-school activities to reach the best solution for a majority of kids.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a perfect situation,\u201d School Committee member Regina Robinson acknowledged. \u201cWe will not be able to please everyone ... This is to benefit our students.\u201d\nThe school system has long grappled with its bell times and highly expensive transportation costs. At the same time, more research points to benefits for high schoolers starting after 8:30 a.m. The district\u2019s 125 schools start variously at 7:30 a.m., 8:30 a.m. or 9:30 a.m. with most high schools beginning early.\n\u201cIt has tangible effects on young people\u2019s lives,\u201d Chang said. \u201cMost important, it has an effect on student performance.\u201d\nRight now, only 19 percent of secondary students start after 8 a.m. But school officials aim to raise that by 80 percent.\nLess than 70 percent of elementary students are dismissed before 4 p.m., which could rise to 75 percent after the algorithm is used.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kathleen mckiernan", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "matt west", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "chang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tommy chang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sebastien martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "regina robinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arthur delarue", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "school committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston public school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit operations research center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:39.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d0a22d629b9d283d90d739c642c9de0934d8f28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFEoFP0QO28OnjEntiYOUhnr6mMFrEC4ebQdBRr1GtTgjjutVo66rjMceFOmMLujPG2RtQjZtg6omQWeKEzvnLTg--", "site_full": "community.babycenter.com", "site": "babycenter.com", "site_section": "https://community.babycenter.com/sitemap/posts/d20171205.xml", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "", "title": "AF is due today...humor me, ladies!", "title_full": "AF is due today...humor me, ladies! - BabyCenter", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.014, "main_image": "https://imageserve.babycenter.com/19/000/375/GKRJqDVs5bif15CvgsBEiNFmKdxc4qAD_sm.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 891, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "183ad697d26b304f99c5480213aba481516d2af8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFEoFP0QO28OnjEntiYOUhnr6mMFrEC4ebQdBRr1GtTgjjutVo66rjMceFOmMLujPG2RtQjZtg6ols2TAZ2Ot4OkXJfMICFwjp", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Sbuhler", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Maybe their test isn\u2019t as sensitive?

(AP Photo/Rich Barnes) comments BOSTON \u2014 Tired of drivers speeding through a school zone, a Boston physical education teacher turned to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for help.\nThe Boston Globe reports Sam Balto placed laminated cutouts of the player's face on pedestrian crossing signs outside an elementary school in the city's Roxbury neighborhood Wednesday.\nBalto says he watched drivers speed through the 20-mph zone for months. The teacher used a speed radar monitor and posted the results on Twitter, clocking drivers between 30 and 56 mph.\nCrosswalk posts were recently placed in the street near the school, but Balto says drivers would hit them and knock them over.\nHe placed the Brady images on the posts with the hope that people would slow down. And Balto says it \"absolutely\" worked.\n___\nInformation from: The Boston Globe, http://www.bostonglobe.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://embed.sendtonews.com/player3/embedcode.js?fk=KG5SCeOG&cid=4407&offsetx=0&offsety=0&floatwidth=400&floatposition=bottom-right"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom brady", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sam balto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry hughes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nate solder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press credit", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ap photo/rich barnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffalo bills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston globe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england patriots", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england patriots", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roxbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orchard park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:42.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a312126c1546e02add521bcff1a04f17e3d64a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlL9ivM2pG0DBAYq0tQ.ZBM0OFvzwQy7X8lIo8wwXFsYcrOnJzOMe.o69DqBGs3yJX0vmBZYQ.Q3LzgWFhGMoZ7h4zvWWsTXvCLAgaMO4jSvg--", "site_full": "respect-discussion.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://respect-discussion.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Respect", "title": "The USA doesn't quite understand International Law: Pentagon: US Troops to Remain in Syria", "title_full": "The USA doesn't quite understand International Law: Pentagon: US Troops to Remain in Syria", "published": "2017-12-07T10:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4a312126c1546e02add521bcff1a04f17e3d64a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlL9ivM2pG0DBAYq0tQ.ZBM0OFvzwQy7X8lIo8wwXFsYcrOnJzOMe.o69DqBGs3yJX0vmBZYQ.Q3LzgWFhGMoZ7h4zvWWsTXvCLAgaMO4jSvg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ashraqat K (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "The USA doesn't quite understand International Law: Pentagon: US Troops to Remain in Syria", "text": "Pentagon: US Troops to Remain in Syria Deployment Will Continue \u2018As Long as Necessary\u2019 Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon announced on Tuesday that the US intends, as a matter of policy, to keep ground troops in Syria \u201cas long as necessary,\u201d irrespective of the fact that ISIS, the group they were initially deployed to fight, has almost no territory left in the country. Pahon says US troops are going to stay to \u201c support our partners and prevent the return of terrorist groups ,\u201d both goals which, one must note, are absolutely open-ended, and unlikely to ever be declared \u201caccomplished.\u201d Though the Pentagon had long been very public about the fact that their deployment to Iraq was a permanent one, the war in Syria is different, in no small part because the Syrian government never authorized US troops to deploy there, and isn\u2019t supporting the idea of them staying. Instead of making it lawful, US officials are playing up the idea that a \u201cnew ISIS\u201d could emerge at any moment, rising as if magic from the desert sands, and the US wants to have troops deployed in such areas just in case.

Several large systems began offering health plans under the Affordable Care Act, only to end up losing money and getting out of the business. Aetna and UnitedHealth appear to be trying to develop their own in-house network of doctors to try to change how care is delivered. UnitedHealth, which already operates a large pharmacy-benefit manager and a variety of health care services through its Optum unit, is among the most diversified and most successful insurers. \nAdvertisement \nContinue reading the main story The acquisition of DaVita Medical Group, which includes such high profile organizations as HealthCare Partners and the Everett Clinic, is the latest move by UnitedHealth to expand into the realm of delivering medical care as a way of reducing costs. The company already operates medical practices in Southern California and elsewhere, and it owns nearly 250 MedExpress urgent-care clinics. The company says the clinics offer much of the same care available at a hospital emergency room but at a significantly lower cost. Last January, UnitedHealth also acquired a chain of surgery centers , a move the company said could lower the expense of having an outpatient surgery by more than 50 percent. The company expects to perform roughly 1 million surgeries and other procedures this year. Insurers are also increasingly experimenting with different methods of paying for care and attempting to provide better oversight of potentially expensive chronic conditions like diabetes or heart failure. To date, Aetna and Cigna have favored joint ventures with large health groups. While these new partnerships promise to change how people get care, by marshaling better information about patients and steering them to less expensive and more convenient places, whether an urgent-care clinic or drugstore, delivering on that promise may prove challenging . DaVita, which bought HealthCare Partners five years ago as a way to become a major player in the care of people with chronic conditions, found itself struggling to make money on its medical group. In describing the group\u2019s most recent quarterly financial results, DaVita\u2019s chief executive, Kent J. Thiry, said they were \u201cextremely disappointing.\u201d The sale, which is expected to close next year, return DaVita to its core kidney dialysis business, although Mr. Thiry said in a statement that the company expected \u201cto pursue other investments in health care services outside of kidney care.\u201d DaVita has been under scrutiny for its relationship with a charity, the American Kidney Fund, that helps pay the cost of private insurance for patients receiving dialysis treatment. Consumers could also see their choice of doctor or pharmacy sharply limited under these arrangements as insurers attempt to steer patients into the groups over which they have the most control. Both Aetna and UnitedHealth insist their goal is to develop a new model of care that will be available to people outside their respective health plans, and Optum says it now works with more than 80 health plans. Even if insurers succeed in lowering medical costs as a result of the new ventures, economists and other experts warn that shareholders, not consumers, could benefit unless the lower costs yield lower prices for coverage. There must be sufficient competition among insurers for consumers to benefit, Professor Garthwaite said. \u201cYou need three, four or five insurance companies trying to pull that strategy off,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really hard to do.\u201d \nFollow Reed Abelson on Twitter: @reedabelson . \nContinue reading the main story Filed Under: Health Tagged With: health Speak Your Mind You must be logged in to post a comment.

We've got the lowdown... By Chloe Kerr and Helen Thomas 7th December 2017, 9:22 am Updated: 7th December 2017, 9:30 am IT\u2019S THE moment everyone dreads at the Christmas party, finding yourself accidentally under the mistletoe with a strangers and hearing the words, \u201cOh go on, kiss. Its tradition.\u201d \nMistletoe is a Christmas staple, but what is it and why do people kiss underneath it? We\u2019ve got the history behind the tradition\u2026 Getty Images It\u2019s traditional to kiss under the mistletoe at Christmas What is the story behind it? \nMistletoe\u2019s mystical properties stem back to the Celts and Norse people who believed there was something mystical about the plant as the sprigs stayed green in winter even when the tree has lost its leaves. \nIt was also believed to bring luck in Medieval times. \nOne Norse tale explains its links to romance, love and kissing. \nBalder, son of the goddess Frigga, was killed by an evil spirit with an arrow made of mistletoe. Getty Images 3 It is traditional to kiss under the mistletoe \nFrigga was so distraught that her tears turned to white berries, coating the plant and symbolising her love for him. \nFrigga was overjoyed by the white berries so she blessed the plant and promised a kiss to all who passed beneath it from that day onward. \nThis turned into a tradition in ancient times when visitors would kiss the hand of a host under the mistletoe when they arrived as a way of honouring the Norse legend. \nSince then, the tradition has evolved to the custom we all know and in England, kissing under the mistletoe was first referred to in late 18th century England. What is mistletoe? \nDespite all the romantic connotations, mistletoe is actually a tree-killing parasite plant. \nThe plant can only thrive if its seeds are carried to a host tree by birds that have eaten the mistletoe berries. \nThe plant feeds off the host tree by stealing all the water and soil minerals which is why the mistletoe retains its vibrant green colour all through winter. PA:Press Association Mistletoe is traditional all over the world What colour are mistletoe berries? \nMost species of mistletoe have waxy white berries. \nThere are approximately 1300 species of the plant, and some of them have red, pink or transparent berries.

Del Rio News-Herald | 0 comments \nThey are caught in its trap and cannot escape.

About 200,000 people were under evacuation orders.

Coking coal dropped 1.1 percent to 1,363.50 yuan per tonne.\nIron ore for delivery to China\u2019s Qingdao port fell 1.3 percent to $71.77 a tonne on Tuesday, after hitting a nearly three-month high the day before, according to Metal Bulletin.\n\u201cTraders continue to snap up any available cargoes, with particular interest in high grade iron ore,\u201d ANZ analysts said in a note.\n\u201cInvestors in China were a little bit more circumspect, with losses in the base metals sector curbing their enthusiasm for the steelmaking raw material.\u201d\nSource: Reuters (Reporting by Manolo Serapio Jr.; Editing by Joseph Radford and Subhranshu Sahu)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph radford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manolo serapio jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "subhranshu sahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard lu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "shanghai futures exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalian commodity exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marex spectron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qingdao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:44.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03b1bdf412424b13bed6cd8aa6e4b0279a69127e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU46RXCtAcM6LmPbP9kyp1oRXX_68B7p.U7UIA4ox8vawz9IpL66KZJ1Zb2woXjrgogZW_Aintt0beYZs_4lcG.tp_7ptD434orQEYRyyuGuY_Q--", "site_full": "lonestarboars.com", "site": "lonestarboars.com", "site_section": "http://lonestarboars.com/forums/6-8spc.58/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "6.8SPC | Lone Star Boars", "title": "6.8 SPC II vs 6.5 Grendel for hog hunting", "title_full": "6.8 SPC II vs 6.5 Grendel for hog hunting | Lone Star Boars", "published": "2017-06-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f5277c5d842c97f6379899126d5fbe5cb213573", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU46RXCtAcM6LmPbP9kyp1oRXX_68B7p.U7UIA4ox8vawz9IpL66KZJ1Zb2woXjrgogZW_Aintt0beYZs_4lcG.tp_7ptD434orQQ0G_LixuZ8Q--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Richard Teague", "published": "2017-12-01T19:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I came on the Grendel scene a year ago and factory ammo is easy to get now, both mine are tackdrivers.

Baumann, PCAOB Chief Auditor. \n\nStaff guidance  issued Monday by the PCAOB describes key considerations related to the new auditor\u2019s reporting model. The PCAOB\u2019s new auditor\u2019s reporting model is described in  Auditing Standard No. 3101 ,  The Auditor\u2019s Report on an Audit of Financial Statements When the Auditor Expresses an Unqualified Opinion , and related amendments. The standard is effective for audits of fiscal years ending on or after Dec. 15, 2017, except for changes related to critical audit matters. Changes were made to clarify the auditor\u2019s role and responsibilities, provide additional information about the auditor and make the auditor\u2019s report easier to read. \u201cIn a matter of weeks, audit reports will be better organized, provide investors the tenure information they have asked for, and include an express statement about the auditor beyond just what is implied by the title of the report,\u201d PCAOB Chairman James Doty said Monday at the AICPA Conference on Current SEC and PCAOB Developments in Washington. Auditor communication of critical audit matters is permissible on a voluntary basis but will not be required until audits of fiscal years ending on or after June 30, 2019, for audits of large accelerated filers, or Dec. 15, 2020, for audits of all other companies that are required to comply with the standard. The new standard\u2019s requirements include: That the first section of the report consists of the opinion on the financial statements, immediately followed by the section describing the basis for the opinion. That the auditor\u2019s report be addressed to the shareholders and the board of directors, or equivalents for companies not organized as corporations. A statement in the auditor\u2019s report containing the year the auditor began serving consecutively as the company\u2019s auditor.
