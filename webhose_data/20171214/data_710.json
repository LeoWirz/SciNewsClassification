There are infinite capabilities and opportunities in the field of Healthcare IT over the world. With the fastest transformations taking place in developed countries such as United States and the Big 5 in Europe. Outsourcing of IT to countries where cheaper solutions may be obtained has been greatly exploited by companies in developed countries. Countries such as India, China, Indonesia and Singapore have been IT outsourcing hubs for other nations since the capital required to be spent in developing IT solutions in these regions is only a fraction of what may be demanded in developed countries. Skilled intelligent resources are available at very low labor costs due to a significant currency exchange hence; outsourcing has become one of the largest opportunities that has increased the economy of several nations in past few years. Major areas where healthcare IT may be employed includes biomedical research and development such as pharmaceutical research, genetics and proteomics, life science IT, biotechnology, biosimulation and disease research among others.

Recognition, despite divergences \nOn May 14, 1948, David Ben Gurion founds the Jewish state of Israel, after the British mandate ends in Palestine. The administration of US president Harry S. Truman recognizes the state 11 minutes after it is proclaimed. \nHowever, relations are troubled in the first few years of the new state. \nThe administrations of both Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower realize that too close a rapprochement with Israel risks harming US relations with the Arab world. \nWashington thus voices strong opposition to the Israeli campaign against Egypt in 1956, launched in coordination with France and Britain and known as the Suez Crisis. Under US pressure, Israel withdraws from the Sinai. Solid support for Israel \nDuring the June 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Israel occupies the Sinai, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. \nThe Six-Day War is a turning point for the US, which becomes Israel\u00b4s main backer. \nIn October 1967, president Lyndon B. Johnson decides to order large-scale deliveries of arms to Israel. \nOn several occasions Washington attempts to match its role as Israel\u00b4s main backer with that of mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Years of mediation \nIn September 1978, president Jimmy Carter brings together Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat at Camp David, the US president\u00b4s country retreat. The subsequent Camp David Accords pave the way for a peace treaty signed the year after by Egypt and Israel. \nOn September 13, 1993 president Bill Clinton orchestrates the historic handshake in Washington between Israel\u00b4s prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, after they sign a five-year transitional agreement on Palestinian self-government in Gaza and the West Bank. \nIn 2000, Clinton blames Arafat for the failure of peace negotiations at Camp David from July 11-25. Obama: tensions, but aid \nAfter they respectively take office in 2009, relations between US president Barack Obama and right-wing Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu come under deep strain. \nIn June Obama calls on Israel to stop settlement building in the occupied territories and expresses his commitment to a Palestinian state alongside Israel. \nIn March 2010, Israel\u00b4s authorization of the construction of 1,600 houses in a settled neighborhood in east Jerusalem, during a visit by US Vice President Joe Biden, sours relations. \nIn March 2015, Netanyahu defies Obama, secretly arranging to address a joint meeting of the Republican-controlled US Congress where he openly tries to scupper the agreement between Iran and world powers on Tehran\u00b4s nuclear program. Obama refuses to meet him during his stay in Washington. \nIn September 2016, however, the two leaders sign a deal on $38 billion in military assistance for the 2019-2028 period, the most generous military aid in US history. \nIn December, relations degenerate again after the United States -- for the first time since 1979 -- refrains from vetoing a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israel\u00b4s settlement building. \u00b4Unbreakable\u00b4 bond with Israel \nOn January 20, 2017, Netanyahu says he wants relations with the United States to be \"stronger than ever\" with Donald Trump as president. \nOn February 15, Trump warmly welcomes Netanyahu to the White House and hails the \"unbreakable\" bond between their countries. \nTrump backs away from Washington\u00b4s quest for a two-state solution to the conflict, saying he would back a single state if it led to peace. \nOn May 15, David Friedman, the controversial new US ambassador to Israel who has been a strong supporter of Israeli settlement building in the West Bank, arrives. \nOn May 22, Trump becomes the first sitting US president to visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem. A day later Netanyahu announces that Israel will receive an extra $75 million in US military aid.

Proteins including nucleic acids, enzymes, and others are some of the popularly used biosensors to understand the glucose levels in a patient. The global glucose biosensors market is experiencing a growth spurt due to increasing number of diabetic patients across the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that about 347 million people are diagnosed with high blood sugar levels across the globe. In light of this statistic, the organization also states that diabetes is expected to be the leading cause of death by the end of 2030. Needless to say that the increasing prevalence of diabetes in the world is likely to be the primary growth driver for the global glucose biosensors market in the near future.Report Overview and TOC: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/glucose-biosensors-mar... The research report by Transparency Market Research presents a detailed explanation about the global glucose biosensors market. It explains the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats impacting the segments of the global market with the help of a SWOT analysis. Additionally, the report also includes unbiased opinions of market leaders to help readers gain a fresh perspective toward the changing market dynamics. Global Glucose Biosensors Market: Key TrendsThe growing need and an urgency amongst diabetics for better disease management is expected augment the demand for glucose biosensors. The two types of glucose biosensors available in the global market are amprometric glucose biosensors and fluorescence glucose biosensors. Of these, the demand for the former is expected to show steady demand in the global market due to its wide availability. Amprometric glucose biosensors oxidize glucose which leads to production of hydrogen peroxide. This is then identified by electrode, which aids the understanding of glucose concentration in the bloodstream.Request brochure: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... However, tremendous innovation in the fluorescence technique is expected to bolster the growth of the fluorescent glucose biosensors segment as well. The demand for these biosensors is expected to show a gradual rise as they are known to measure the glucose concentration with utmost accuracy. Furthermore, the life of probe of fluorescence biosensors is higher than amprometric biosensor, which is expected to play an instrumental role in the helping this supporting this segment. Global Glucose Biosensors Market: Regional OutlookGeographically, the global glucose biosensors market is segmented into Asia Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Latin America. Of these, North America is estimated to lead the global glucose biosensors market. The better and quicker adoption of technology in the region along with advantage of innovation are expected to keep North America at forefront of the global market. Analysts expect that North America glucose biosensors market will also be supported to growing prevalence of diabetes in the region.For Specific and Customized requirements@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... Europe is also estimated to be a key contributor in the global market due to an ever-growing pool of geriatrics. The European Commission stated that 17.8% of the European population was over the age of 65 years in 2012. The uptake of glucose biosensors is expected to remain high across Europe as the region experience rise in the number of geriatrics. Asia Pacific too is estimated to present lucrative opportunities to the global market. Key Players Mentioned in this Report are:Some of the leading companies operating in the glucose biosensors market are Abbott Point Of Care, Inc., Lifesensors, Inc., Animas Corporation, Medtronic Diabetes, AgaMatrix, Inc., Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc., Nova Biomedical Corp., LifeScan, Inc., M-Biotech Limited, and F.

According to Mustard Oil Producers Association of India, mustard stock with Farmers & Processors as on 30th Nov\u201917 was at 13 lakh tonnes. Mills across the country crushed 475,000 tn of the oilseed in November, up nearly 6% on month. \nAs per rabi sowing report from the government, the acreage of mustard, another major rabi crop, was at 56 lakh ha, down from 61 lakh ha a year ago. Rajasthan is the largest mustard growing state but the sowing pace is slower than last year at 20.3 lakh ha Vs 27.3 lakh ha. The lower mustard acreage can be attributed to poor rains in Rajasthan that led to low soil moisture and hampered sowing. \n\nFor Quick Trial \u2013 8962000225 \u2714   or mail us here: info@ways2capital.com or visit  http://www.ways2capital.com \u2706 - 0731-6554125 | Toll Free - 1800-3010-2007 Give a Missed Call for Free Trial - 09699997717 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mills", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "farmers & processors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mustard oil producers association of india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rajasthan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:07.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "98a6e044727b4aba78f94d33185237a23b021a42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W4nbrq3y4JXqyN8nSgyDr04WvGt3BYhiUu81KES0ocLs_kgYv1XVG2RWEgRuXknW4yuCYpvoPYCYQ--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/lsu-recruiting/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "LSU Recruiting | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Harold Joiner | Page 2", "title_full": "Harold Joiner | Page 2 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T04:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bddbebe175879653f00bab83a663977c0fbc0102", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W4nbrq3y4JXqyN8nSgyDr04WvGt3BYhiUu81KES0ocLs_kgYv1XVG2RWEgRuXknW4ytj10Kw1Gxcg--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "tzimme4", "published": "2017-12-07T04:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "LINK This post was edited on 12/6 at 8:53 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQZXyEwU8AAgVN9.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:07.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "98a6e044727b4aba78f94d33185237a23b021a42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W4nbrq3y4JXqyN8nSgyDr04WvGt3BYhiUu81KES0ocLs_kgYv1XVG2RWEgRuXknW4yuCYpvoPYCYQ--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/lsu-recruiting/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "LSU Recruiting | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Harold Joiner | Page 2", "title_full": "Harold Joiner | Page 2 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T04:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a28c79f000142392d124dfe33081782f5875ee5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W4nbrq3y4JXqyN8nSgyDr04WvGt3BYhiUu81KES0ocLs_kgYv1XVG2RWEgRuXknW4wpHTszU5szLw--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Lsupimp", "published": "2017-12-07T05:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hershel & Dickerson\nLike neither .

Let\u2019s both put the kettle on and sit together to talk and get to know each other. While reflecting over our cup of tea we will dive into discussions at our Digital Table together. From discussions on Global Tea Hut subscriptions to what\u2019s going on in the world, from blog post reflections to debating where tea begins and spirituality ends, this series is all about conversation and connection. So get cozy, let\u2019s curl up and sip at our digital table together. \nAs I turn on the kettle for our talk, I feel like we need to reflect on the holistic healing of tea. Sipping my tea the last week has been very healing, not only for my mind but my body. As we approached the end of October I found my body was sick from a sinus cold (or sinus-chest-cold of doom as I liked to refer to it). Modern medicine such as \u201cbig brand\u201d cold daytime or nighttime has always left me feeling groggy and unable to do regular everyday tasks. But worst off my gut health goes down with it, possibly leading me further into this care for my colitis. This time around I opted for a holistic healing with thousands of years of history to back it up: tea and herbs. Over 5,000 years of history of tea as medicine \nHave you heard of Lu Yu? This writer (no, Tea Scholar) changed how I view tea forever. In his book Cha-Ching \u2013 which is The Classic of Tea \u2013 he documented all things related to tea in the Tang Dynasty. Literally, all the small things we take for granted (like water) are in this book. But the bigger part is the note about additives to this boiled brew, things such as orange peel, ginger, and flowers. In 2010 realizing what Lu Yu adding these ingredients meant, he had just made tea blends. And that made a lightbulb go off \u2013 so-called \u201cblends\u201d are NOT new. Lu Yu documented the first tea blend, and expressed his dislike of it, but also acknowledged the \u201clong-rooted practice.\u201d \nThis Tea Sage even makes a note (ahem, credit) of Sheng Nong, the first Emperor of China and Herbal medicinal god. This God-Emperor-Person experimented with steeping different leaves and made note of their effects. His biggest discovery was the tea plant, also known as Camellia Sinensis, which he found cured him of a poison he got from some leaf he had steeped. True tea is made from this plant and all others are called Tisanes or Herbal Infusions. Skeptics of Tea Medicine \nIn the tea professional community, it is seen as a touchy subject to talk about holistic healing as it relates to tea. The reactions when the subject is brought up quickly go to skeptical: \u201c Who did the study?\u201d, \u201cWhat were the steeping methods?\u201d, \u201cHow hot was the water?\u201d, \u201cThey must have used too much tea or too hot of water.\u201d The reactions go on (and on\u2026 and on); it shocks me that some even try to not answer customer questions relating to health. Have you experienced that when shopping for tea, too? I hope not dear friend. \nBut if you have please keep in mind that not everyone though is like that. I have one friend who is seen as the go-to for tea health information. Michelle Peirce Hamilton is a lovely woman who took her own health into her hands and sought out a Holistic Medicine certification. If you talk to her, she lights up the room with her passion not only for tea but health. Tea is a Holistic Medicine \nMichelle had a talk at a Tea Guild of Canada meeting a few years ago on health. Her well-sourced research silenced many skeptics with proven fact that tea IS a holistic treatment. From findings from The 5th International Scientific Symposium on Tea and Health , she presented these facts for us to take to heart. Some of the findings are: \nDrinking any amount of tea (green, black or oolong) can help reduce the chance of a stroke 5 cups of green tea a day can contribute to preventing some types of cancer Tea is proven to help with mood and problem-solving. \n\nEven with science to back it up, there is no better proof than how it makes us feel as we drink it. Take another sip of your tea. Do you feel the calmness wash over you? That my friend is the L-theanine of the tea. It is the anti-stress component which relaxes your body when the tea is sipped telling your body all is okay (even if it\u2019s not). And you may also feel more alert or able to concentrate better on our conversation and our tea. \nAs it affects the body and makes us feel better, is there really the need for debating if tea is holistic? I don\u2019t think there is, after all, one of the definitions of medicine is \u201c healing substances or drugs collectively.\u201d With that wording then t ea is truly medicine for the mind, body, and soul. But dear friend, what do you think?

The development was just the latest in a series that spotlighted the longstanding defense relationship between Russia and Indonesia as well as Moscow\u2019s ongoing efforts to deepen ties with Southeast Asian states in spite the lingering challenges in doing so. \nRussia and Indonesia have long had a defense relationship, and Moscow today still remains Jakarta\u2019s largest military supplier. Both sides have also been mulling several deals as well as broader advances in defense cooperation recently, looking at not just purchases but also more ambitious areas like technology transfers and joint development and production despite challenges therein (See: \u201cIndonesia, Russia Ink Defense Protocol Amid Fighter Jet Deal\u201d). \nOf late, as we have seen with a few other Southeast Asian states as well, some of the recent interactions in bilateral ties have been given an even higher profile by Moscow because of wider regional strategic considerations. Russia under Vladimir Putin ambitious abroad and increasingly isolated from the West has been looking to boost its presence in the Asia-Pacific, including in Southeast Asia, over the past few years, and Indonesia has unsurprisingly been a part of this conversation. \nAs an example, just last week, two Russian Pacific Fleet ships Admiral Panteleyev, a large anti-submarine ship, and Boris Butoma, a large sea tanker were on a two-day unofficial visit to Indonesia in a voyage that did not receive much international media coverage. During the visit, the two countries held joint drills and Russian sailors interacted with Indonesian personnel in several friendly sports matches and participated in a sightseeing tour. \nThat was just the latest voyage by the two ships which have been making several stops in the region, including in Brunei for the Golden Jubilee celebration of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah\u2019s accession to the throne reported as the first visit in more than a quarter-century a stop in the Philippines where there was a turnover of Russian weapons and Philippine officials, and in Thailand where a series of commemorative activities were being held as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) marks its 50th anniversary this year. \nThis week, in yet another defense interaction that put the spotlight on the Russia-Indonesia bilateral defense relationship, the Russian defense ministry confirmed on December 5 that two T-95MS strategic bombers and two Il-76MD aircraft had made a flight from Amur region to Biak airfield in course of what it described as an \u201cinternational visit.\u201d \nDuring the flight, the Tu-95MS carried out an in-flight refuelling by the Il-78 tankers over the Pacific Ocean, the Russian defense ministry said in a statement.

West ukros are still shelling Donezk and Lugansk, just not at the previous level\n-There was a attempt of government take over in LNR, which resulted in expulsion of previous head Igor Plotnizkiy. situation is still shady but stable with locals now being in control. Apparently there was a few shady fucks that were involved in another attempt back in 2016 and now wanted for treason\n-Looks like its game over for the Poroshenkos regime in Kiev. You guys remember Michail Saakashvili? The ex-President of Georgia that was on CIAs payroll during the war of 2008? For which he is wanted for war crimes in his own country?\nthe same guy who was appointed as a Governor of Ukrainian Odesssa last year? the same guy who was later stripped of his ukro citizenship by the same person who appointed him? Jesus what a mess.

There were about 100 Japanese killed. The Japanese squadron leader was Mitsuo Fuchida. \n\u201cWe hate, and are hated in return, and then we hate more, and we have all seen where that can lead,\u201d said Fuchida years later. But, he said, \u201cWe love, and we are likely to be loved in return, which begins the cycle of love.\u201d \nIn the late 1940s, Fuchida heard some Japanese POWs returning from U.S. detainee camps, talking about an American teenager who visited them. She brought them soap, toothpaste, and asked what else she could do for them. The prisoners didn\u2019t trust her. Finally they asked why she had been so kind to them, her enemies. She told them that her parents had been Christian missionaries in Japan and the Philippines. \nThey had been murdered, beheaded, by Japanese soldiers who thought they were spies. The girl\u2019s life began to be consumed by hate for the Japanese, until she was able to reconnect with what her parents had taught: Love of enemies and forgiveness. She gave \u201caid and comfort\u201d to the enemy to honor her parents and because she was a Christian. \nMitsuo Fuchida was deeply moved by this story. Eventually, Fuchida became a Christian out of a need to heal the hate in his own life. \u201cI have participated in the cycle of hate for much of my life,\u201d said Fuchida. \u201cFor the rest of my life I want to begin the cycle of love as often and in as many places as possible.\u201d \nFuchida traveled extensively in the United States. Every time a Pearl Harbor survivor approached him Fuchida bowed slightly and said \u201cGomenasai\u201d [I\u2019m sorry], then reached out and took their hand. \nTo whom do you need to apologize before the Christ Child arrives? \nBreathe in.

A Product Owner in the Scrum Framework is the single person who is responsible for the success of a Product and for maximizing the value of that Product. In the Scrum Framework, a few of the Product Owners' responsibilities are described, such as Product Backlog management, maximizing value and stakeholder management. Besides these responsibilities, the Product Owner role also has a lot to do with product management! So, a Product Owner is a sort of Agile Product Manager. \nThe Product Owner role is totally different from traditional roles that are know in most organizations. Some people think that the Product Owner is a kind of 'Agile project manager' or that the Product Owner is sort of a 'business analyst'. This is not true! The Product Owner is really the owner of the Product. He or she is the single person that is responsible and accountable for the success of the Product. The focus of a Product Owner is therefore not on 'doing projects', but on delivering, maintaining and marketing the Product! \nIn this post, we'll cover 10 tips about Agile Product Management. Also check out my other blogs with tips for the Product Owner (see the links at the end of this blogpost). I hope you enjoy them! \n10 Tips for Agile Product management: \n1. Act as a Product Leader, not as an 'Agile projectmanager' A project manager is responsible for managing scope, exceptions, 'resources' and reporting (amongst many other things of course). As a Product Owner, your job is not to manage 'resources' or 'tasks'. Your job is to maximize the value for your product! To create those features that deliver the most value for the products' users! In order to maximize the value of your product, you don't have to manage stuff like tasks, what people do on a daily basis, what the progress of the team is in a Sprint. All this can be managed by the team itself. So stop micro-managing the team and start maximizing the value of your product, in collaboration with users, clients and stakeholders! \n2. Explain to your stakeholders why you're working Agile Agile isn't a hype, nor is it something you 'do'. It's a mindset. It's a set of values and principles which guide you. Scrum is a framework. It's a framework used in complex environments to develop and maintain complex products. The way of working, the values and principles you want to embrace are quite different from traditional ways of working. This also goes for the culture and governance of the organization. Stakeholders need to their way of thinking and behavior as well, so you'll need to invest time (together with your Scrum Master or Agile Coach) in coaching your stakeholders and explaining Agile to them. \n3. Be 'product oriented' instead of 'project oriented' A project (in it's definition) is something that ends. A project is a temporary organization which is created in order to deliver a specific scope, within a certain time period and budget. A Product Owner however should focus on delivering a Product. And guess what? Product Development doesn't end as long as the Product lives! Also, we measure project success in different ways than measuring product success. A project is typically successful when the upfront agreed scope was delivered on time and within budget. A product however is successful when it's being adopted, used and valued by the products' users. \n4. Improve your time-to-learn (instead of time-to-market) A lot of people and organizations are focussed on reducing the 'time-to-market'. of course, this is valuable, because you're able to deliver stuff to your customers more quickly. As a Product Owner, you want to maximize value for your customers, so delivering faster and more often sounds good right? Sure it does! There is one catch though... You can't determine value upfront... What? That's right! You can't determine value upfront! Whether or not something is valuable, is determined by your customers and users. Based upon their usage of the product and the feedback provided by them, you'll learn what valuable is and what isn't. So you should only improve your time-to-market, you should focus on improving your time-to-learn! Time-to-learn doesn't only mean going to market, but it also includes the gathering of feedback from the customers and users. Time-to-learn is therefore more interesting, since it also includes the feedback loop from the customers/users, there where time-to-market doesn't include the feedback loop. \n5. Take responsibility for the success of the Product As a Product Owner, you're responsible for the ultimate success of the product. I see a lot of Product Owners who are 'responsible' for parts of a system, or who are 'proxy Product Owners' that are managing the Product Backlog on behalf of someone else (who isn't available). Also see my blog on tips for starting Product Owners to read more about the Product Owners' maturity levels. \n6. Stop 'waterfalling' in Sprints, start delivering value for customers/users We see a lot of Product Owners that are doing Scrum within a project. I also see a lot of Product Owners who are slicing systems in system layers (like front-end, back-end, middleware, hardware, etc.). This won't help you in maximizing value. For example, a complete architecture doesn't contain any value for a user. An end-to-end slice of a feature however, does have value for a user! So don't deliver a system layer in a Sprint, deliver an end-to-end feature! Another example I see often, is teams that create the design in one Sprint, they develop in the next Sprint, they test in the Sprint after and finally deliver to a user in the fourth Sprint. This means you're not delivering any value for users until the fourth Sprint! Try to make the Product Backlog Items smaller, so you can deliver an end-to-end feature in one Sprint! \n7. Understand that more analysis doesn't (necessarily) make the Product better A lot of teams are used to working in projects. Projects are excellent ways of working in complicated environments, however, not so much in complex environments (see the Cynnefin model). In complex environments, you need an empirical approach, such as the Scrum Framework. In complicated environments, problems have a typical cause and effect. Therefore, doing more analysis upfront will result in a better solution at the end. However, in complex environments, problems may have multiple causes and multiple effects. This means that the best approach is not to analyse more. The best approach in complex environments is to take a step (act), than observe what happens (sense) and than react to the new data gathered (respond). So dear Product Owners, please embrace that the world isn't predictable, but start doing more experiments, tests, releases and gather feedback from the marketplace! \n8. Market research, sales and marketing are part of your responsibilities A lot of Product Owners are only responsible for a system, or part of a system. However, this doesn't embrace the idea of a Product Owner being an actual owner of a Product. Of a Product Owner being an entrepreneur (which is the 'highest' level of Product Owner maturity). An entrepreneurial Product Owner, someone who is ultimately responsible for the success of the Product, is also responsible for market research, sales, marketing, etc. etc. \n9. Focus on increasing value (outcome) instead of increasing velocity (output) Many, many, many Product Owners are focussed on increasing the velocity of their team(s). Please stop doing this! Measuring the Velocity of a team is based upon a relative estimation technique. This means that story points are a relative value. It's extremely easy for teams to double their velocity and if you ask them to do this, they will actually double their velocity in seconds! They will just double or triple al their estimates!!! So don't compare teams based on velocity, nor focus so much on improving velocity! Start focussing on value! Measure the value that's delivered by the team, measure the impact of new deliveries on your Products' KPI's, measure customer/user satisfaction, etc, etc.! \n10. Be a dolphin, not a submarine! Our final tip on Agile Product Management is to stay in the water surface (like a dolphin). A dolphin only goes under water for a short period of time and then comes up to the surface again, said differently, a dolphin remains visible. In complex environments and in complex product development, you need to get feedback from customers and users early and often. A lot of Product Owners however are tempted to stay under water for too long (like a submarine). They have the idea that if we spend 'a little more time' on the Product, we can make it 'perfect' for our customers and users. Don't do this! It won't help you to spend more time on the Product, but it will help you to release early and often, to deliver to your customers and users and to get their feedback. This approach will help you much more in maximizing the value for your Product. \nSo, these are the 10 tips for Product Owners on the topic of Agile Product Management! I hope you enjoyed them and that they'll help you in becoming a better Product Owner! \nAlso check out these other tips for Product Owners! Holy Guacamoly!

Chromatography is referred to as a technique that is used for the purification of biomolecules in which the components that are to be separated are distributed between two phases. Among these two phases, one is stationary phase and other is a mobile phase. All types of chromatography systems work on the same principle i.e., separation of sample mixture into stationary phase (solid or liquid supported on solid) and mobile phase (liquid or gas). Over the years chromatography technique and its instrument are being used in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development of pure drug molecule. The instruments that are utilized in the chromatography have benefitted the researches due to their ability to separate, analyze and purify a molecule in an efficient and effective manner. These chromatography instrumentation techniques are used in various application areas such as pharmaceutical, biotechnology, food production, diagnostics, genetic engineering, drug discovery and water analysis.

Members of the media are lined up outside the Senate office of Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, in Washington. \nBy ANDREW TAYLORAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Minnesota Democrat Al Franken, facing fresh allegations of sexual misconduct and vanishing support from fellow Democrats, appears to be on the brink of resigning from the Senate. \nFranken scheduled an announcement for Thursday, though his office tweeted Wednesday evening that he had not made \"a final decision\" on resigning. \nBut a majority of the Senate's Democrats called on the two-term lawmaker to quit after a woman emerged Wednesday morning saying he forcibly tried to kiss her in 2006. Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" - women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Juliet Linderman in Washington and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report.

Aranda had a 5'9 safety playing this year so it's not like its unheard of. Jackson isn't your typical LSU safety either but Aranda isn't your typical DC, LMAO.\nThis class should round out to be a typical LSU class. Let me ask you guys something. Greedy is a great corner right? But LSU would always prefer a Patrick Peterson right, but could LSU still create a dominant defense with a few Greedy type corners and the same with their DL guys?\nOf course we would be fine. Well LSU might have a bunch of Greedy type of talents this year but then you add the 2017 guys, the guys we finish with, and the 2019 class and you still have a dominant team. Then I f they can gel, mature, fill the right voids, then you can build a championship team with blue chippers in the right spots but the right blue chippers mixed in with solid 2-5 year players.\nIt's about the team and how they all come together, not necessarily their ranking. LSU has and can get the talent a team needs in the right spots to be dominant. Would we all prefer a team full of Patrick Petersons, hell yeah, but you can't always get a team full of those guys so you do your homework, study the kid, bring them to camp, and get a feel for their resolve as a human being, then go get them.\nI also think that if many of the lower tier guys don't sign in the early period, this will give the ok for LSU to continue recruiting better players, if they have better out there to get. If they say they are committed, then sign, if you don't sign, how committed are you?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:08.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2c8fceb2544ec4dade07a926e0995f0b10cc9f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W4nbrq3y4JXqyN8nSgyDr0496buQdVlTAH2kAAGBI4e0Q9V6fEwpCtTpc7N0fIgmljo1HBbr_000blLDRk8rkL173uhKSBC1R3UUktAJmCu2qlpIbMX64f01Fv4Qd3HCArCw_cxdbJNgu4Ce377GZ9t", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/lsu-recruiting/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "LSU Recruiting | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "After the doom and gloom With this class it can turn out to be special | Page 2", "title_full": "After the doom and gloom With this class it can turn out to be special | Page 2 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T05:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f891a7b50d2ab822217b882f0c741745eec17bab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W4nbrq3y4JXqyN8nSgyDr0496buQdVlTAH2kAAGBI4e0Q9V6fEwpCtTpc7N0fIgmljo1HBbr_000blLDRk8rkL173uhKSBC1R3UUktAJmCu2qlpIbMX64f01Fv4Qd3HCArCw_cxdbJNghAClOwxdCN3aVOKJf_2Zlc-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "ctiger69", "published": "2017-12-07T06:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: :\nWho are all these 5 star players besides Surtain.
