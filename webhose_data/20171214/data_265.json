Photo courtesy of Elana Rivkin. \nFor the past four years, the fabric of my college experience has been interwoven with the momentum of the Good 5 Cent Cigar. \nEvery semester when I built my schedule I knew I needed my classes to end on Wednesday before 6 p.m. so I could be in the office for production, and I needed to keep Tuesday and Thursday nights open for deadlines and meetings. I set aside time each week to write my stories instead of getting a real job and I gave up enjoying campus events as an attendee because I was covering them. I never stopped looking for story ideas, and I diligently questioned most everything about the University of Rhode Island. \nThroughout my tenure at URI, I never took off my reporter hat. And maybe I never will, but officially, this is my last issue as the Editor-in-Chief of the Cigar. \nIt\u2019ll be strange, slipping into the new normal that doesn\u2019t revolve around URI\u2019s various happenings and angry letters to the editor, but it\u2019s the first step of many in finding my own momentum as an adult. \nThis past semester has been the Cigar\u2019s most dramatic and tumultuous one yet. I\u2019ve never seen so many people walking around with copies of the paper, nor have I ever seen this many people react so publicly and strongly to what we\u2019ve published. \nI also think that in journalism, when people are constantly criticizing you (or threatening to sue you, or hiding your newspapers or saying they want to start their own newspaper), you might just be doing something right. \nAlmost every issue we ran this semester had something to do with sexual assault within it\u2019s pages. From Kelsey Santmyer\u2019s column in September to Julia Moro\u2019s column last week, we\u2019ve covered rallies, printed university responses, ran letters to the editor and investigated countless leads. I didn\u2019t plan for the course of the Cigar this semester, we just followed the news. In a world where there\u2019s a new sexual assault claim every week, it\u2019s not surprising that this issue has made front page headlines on our own campus. \nYes, front page headlines, because stories highlighting sexual assault demand our continued attention if we ever want to prevent sexual violence on this campus. \nI didn\u2019t choose to run Santmyer or Moro\u2019s columns on the cover to undermine Greek Life\u2019s philanthropic accomplishments or to dissuade people from being a part of Greek Life. I chose to run them on the cover because it\u2019s about getting people\u2019s attention and starting a conversation. \nIt\u2019s about creating momentum to hold the institutions within our University accountable, and making sure that they uphold their promises to foster a safe learning environment for all students. \nAs I wrote a few weeks ago, we\u2019re just the platform. It comes down to you\u2013faculty, staff, students, community members, administrators\u2013to carry on the momentum to create real change. We can\u2019t stop talking about sexual assault. Rather, we should be unapologetically vocal about supporting and believing survivors, educating people about prevention and strengthening policies surrounding how this university handles sexual assault. \nURI should always be looking to see how well sexual assault policies work for its students, and it\u2019s better to show that you\u2019re working on fixing the problem than pretending everything is fine. Because if I\u2019ve learned anything over the past few weeks, it\u2019s that everything is not fine, and URI needs to do better to serve its student sexual assault survivors. \nNext week I\u2019m handing the Cigar over to my staff\u2019s capable hands, and even though my life won\u2019t revolve around the Cigar next semester, I still plan to contribute and work on stories I didn\u2019t have time to pursue. I couldn\u2019t give up journalism that easily if I tried\u2013perhaps the momentum is a little harder to break than I expected. \nA student\u2019s college experience shouldn\u2019t be intertwined with the momentum that comes with a sexual assault.

The first piece of advice I see when someone wants to pay off their debt is to cut back on expenses. Eating out seems to be the main offender.\nI decided to take a different approach. Every time I wanted to order take out, I took the amount of what my order would be and placed it into my savings. In the past couple of months I've saved a little under $200. This included everything from fancy burger places to dollar pizza. Even little things like going to the store across the street to buy a can of soda. Watching my savings grow has been really motivating me to cook at home more and stay away from junk food. I used to eat takeout at least twice a week and now I'm down to once or twice a month because of it.\nEdit: So I'm getting a lot of mixed feedback here and some are very valid. Note that this is not something that works for everyone as everyone is under different circumstances but I do find that this works for a lot of people. This isn't a catch all by any means. For those of you calling it stupid, while thats your personal opinion, remember that different techniques work for different people. If eating takeout is more beneficial to you then that's great. This post is for those that want to save money but eat out regularly. Personally, I think its helpful to see things on paper.\nAdditionally I never said to stop eating out entirely. I understand the necessities of enjoying one's self for their mental and emotional well being. I will eat out every now and then especially if it's a special occasion.

Seed formation is the reproduction process in seed plants, the spermatophytes including angiosperm and gymnosperm plants. Seeds are the products of reproduction of ripened ovule, after the fertilization by pollen and some growth within mother plant. The embryo is developed from zygote and seed coat from ovule\u2019s integuments. Global Seeds Market is the important development in reproduction and success of angiosperm and gymnosperm plants, relative to the more primitive plant\u2019s liverworts, ferns, and mosses, which doesn\u2019t have seeds and use water dependent propagation by themselves.\nThe major factors which are driving the Global seed market growth are product innovations and agricultural modernization. Furthermore, an introduction of enhanced hybrid seed varieties, growing usage of hybrid seeds, diversification of diets, increase in concern on plant health, growth initiatives were taken by the government are the few factors which are driving the growth of the seeds market.

If you are worried about your credit info being breached but didn\u2019t freeze all three agencies, do that now.", "text": "Why this is important: With the recent Equifax breach, plenty of people have put freezes on their credit reports (for good reason). But if you only froze one, someone can now still take out a loan on your name if they have the rest of your info.\nWhat changed: Until recently, Fannie Mae required all three credit reports to actually report for them to buy a loan from a bank. The change now allows for your report to be frozen with one credit reporting agency, but the other two must be unfrozen.\nWhy this matters: Your local bank might sell the mortgages they originate to Fannie Mae. Many small and even moderately sized banks have investors they sell mortgages to. Fannie Mae is one of the largest investors here. The loan must be originated and underwritten to Fannie Mae\u2019s standards for them to purchase it. This means that Fannie Mae\u2019s guidelines impact your local banks\u2019 guidelines if they sell to them. This change means that other banks will now be allowing this same thing. So if you\u2019re worried about your credit but didn\u2019t freeze it with all three agencies, do that now.\nEdit: source\u2014I\u2019m a technical writer at a bank and am rewriting our internal procedures on what we accept based on the above as I type this.\nEdit 2: I\u2019m not suggesting Fannie Mae originates loans. The thing is that their decisions as an investor will impact how banks do business. Fannie Mae says they\u2019ll take loans that are riskier? Banks that sell to Fannie Mae will start originating those riskier loans because they know they can sell them. This is about Fannie Mae (being a large investor) saying they\u2019ll take loans with one frozen score, so some banks will start accepting that too and not require that it be unfrozen. All I was saying was, if you were concerned but thought freezing one or two was good enough, that\u2019s not necessarily the case.\n submitted by /u/poopsmitherson\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:46.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e78615e8e950346b3389894e76acdd6d00689ca7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZReu23CaNDe2NbEdxzQ1vv8TybxE_j7jUKS6hoDsuRFxxHZRtiI54fNVWppvPsWpFVYqWgQtZDzwlkOWKNdK0lL8uxTRjM3kWasS.GgjXkTod.8LuwrcaCw", "site_full": "www.japantimes.co.jp", "site": "japantimes.co.jp", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/japantimes", "site_categories": ["media", "travel", "japan"], "section_title": "The Japan Times: All Stories", "title": "Wrapping up the year with food, music, good times", "title_full": "Wrapping up the year with food, music, good times", "published": "2017-12-07T09:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "JP", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/p2-spotlight-hotels-a-20171208-870x580.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14570, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e78615e8e950346b3389894e76acdd6d00689ca7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZReu23CaNDe2NbEdxzQ1vv8TybxE_j7jUKS6hoDsuRFxxHZRtiI54fNVWppvPsWpFVYqWgQtZDzwlkOWKNdK0lL8uxTRjM3kWasS.GgjXkTod.8LuwrcaCw", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "Wrapping up the year with food, music, good times", "text": "Sorry, but your browser needs Javascript to use this site.

The first piece of advice I see when someone wants to pay off their debt is to cut back on expenses. Eating out seems to be the main offender.\nI decided to take a different approach. Every time I wanted to order take out, I took the amount of what my order would be and placed it into my savings. In the past couple of months I've saved a little under $200. This included everything from fancy burger places to dollar pizza. Even little things like going to the store across the street to buy a can of soda. Watching my savings grow has been really motivating me to cook at home more and stay away from junk food. I used to eat takeout at least twice a week and now I'm down to once or twice a month because of it.\nEdit: So I'm getting a lot of mixed feedback here and some are very valid. Note that this is not something that works for everyone as everyone is under different circumstances but I do find that this works for a lot of people. This isn't a catch all by any means. For those of you calling it stupid, while thats your personal opinion, remember that different techniques work for different people. If eating takeout is more beneficial to you then that's great. This post is for those that want to save money but eat out regularly. Personally, I think its helpful to see things on paper.\nAdditionally I never said to stop eating out entirely. I understand the necessities of enjoying one's self for their mental and emotional well being. I will eat out every now and then especially if it's a special occasion. I'm talking about those of us who eat out multiple times a week.\nThere are benefits to each, its just a matter of picking what's most important and sensible for you.\nTo those that are saying that they don't want to eat boring/bland food learn how to use spices and herbs properly.\n submitted by /u/SlugsLoveBeer\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:47.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "311e38aeb54baeda94efbff385f86e2c79277d43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9xvkZ.HdOFxRC3M2jloPMfHazAe0IU6NNW50txcwhr4dpPKIbiX9E.cwVw1yWN_q24opxL9wTVsBjiGto1YlgZXLrzYHv_9_A-", "site_full": "www.zipleaf.us", "site": "zipleaf.us", "site_section": "http://www.zipleaf.us/RSS", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Popular Businesses Listed In ZipLeaf", "title": "Stanley Garage Door & Gate Repair Haverhill - Haverhill , Massachusetts, United States", "title_full": "Stanley Garage Door & Gate Repair Haverhill - Haverhill , Massachusetts, United States", "published": "2017-12-07T06:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "311e38aeb54baeda94efbff385f86e2c79277d43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9xvkZ.HdOFxRC3M2jloPMfHazAe0IU6NNW50txcwhr4dpPKIbiX9E.cwVw1yWN_q24opxL9wTVsBjiGto1YlgZXLrzYHv_9_A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T06:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Stanley Garage Door & Gate Repair Haverhill - Haverhill , Massachusetts, United States", "text": "About Stanley Garage Door & Gate Repair Haverhill Established November 1999 Call Stanley Garage Door and Gate Repair Haverhill to get you garage door and gate repair job done right the first time.

Also the padded loungers on the balcony hopefully come with those rooms?\nAny more advice on the rooms would be great!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:47.146+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03958bb93b1d596b18c66e497072c06322fee4a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSEa1pAlyIppGEc3OC4WTJ6eARkNwdDGAIvd1dxrreE_0TK7vidKheBDPbmpUlbvqSxt2RwEuZhObXowXJKP7dzKP70TrFqJ_uoqSJ9o_f2mPbDwFvPRzkmXRjh5s6Q.BzMXDVGNX5XAFX2i4du31fl4xfXHfb.d_aqenEyzu.yfF5Si_rdQXUlv_CyrT90XwVDRDwbo.z1j1lozPDu1QHLxqZcJNtzWZc-", "site_full": "social.technet.microsoft.com", "site": "microsoft.com", "site_section": "http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=windowsserver&category=windowsserver", "site_categories": ["windows", "computer_certification", "tech"], "section_title": "Technet forums - Windows Server ", "title": "Windows 10 KMS is licensing Education, Enterprise, and Profectional", "title_full": "Windows 10 KMS is licensing Education, Enterprise, and Profectional", "published": "2017-12-07T02:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f35e48ce22230a20163c186599ab5e0c03dd5a0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSEa1pAlyIppGEc3OC4WTJ6eARkNwdDGAIvd1dxrreE_0TK7vidKheBDPbmpUlbvqSxt2RwEuZhObXowXJKP7dzKP70TrFqJ_uoqSJ9o_f2mPbDwFvPRzkmXRjh5s6Q.BzMXDVGNX5XAFX2i4du31fl4xfXHfb.d_aqenEyzu.yfF5Si_rdQXUlv_CyrT90XwVDRDwbo.z1j1lozPDu1QHLbNNMDY9TSGZ56a2SEtvn8bGYmInmmpszMNHmwVajzOLGQnfGIfAMAQ--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "William%20Liang", "published": "2017-12-07T19:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi,\nAccording to my knowledge, there is no such command to achieve your needs.
