For instance, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia is an attractive location for snorkeling and scuba diving, where the participants are taken to the middle of the ocean, away from the shore, and are allowed to dive into the water. However, instances of distress, where it is necessary to seek help, may arise during these activities. In these situations, marine signaling devices are used. \nDrivers of Marine Signaling Devices Market: According to the report, one of the major drivers for this market is increase in demand for naval vessels. At present, many nations are re-strategizing their defense postures based on the uncertainties in APAC, the Middle East, and Russia. As a result, an emerging trend is the new wave of defense globalization, which is driving many nations to focus on sea-based defense and maritime security surrounding the global trade as well as national economic resources. This will have a positive impact on the market, as an increase in the demand for naval vessels will lead to the increase in the use of safety measures such as marine signaling devices. \nFor more Details of Global Marine Signaling Devices Market Report visit: https://www.marketreportsworld.com/10440235 \nGrowth Restraints of Marine Signaling Devices Market: Further, the report states that one of the major factors hindering the growth of this market is collapse of shipbuilding industry in China. The global shipbuilding industry faced a rather sluggish period in 2016. The demand for new vessels declined by 85% in 2016 over the 2015 levels. The global shipping industry declined in 2016 owing to the instability in the Chinese economy and the plunge in commodity prices. The decline in China\u2019s economic growth rate since 2015 has affected freight providers. Further, the decline in oil prices since 2014 has affected marine operations in terms of imports and exports. This slowdown in the industry will have a negative impact on the demand for marine signaling devices. \nImportant Points mentioned in Table of Contents: PART 01: Marine Signaling Devices Market Outline: Executive Summary, Research Methodology PART 02: Market Landscape: Ecosystem, Characteristics and Segmentation Analysis PART 03: Market Sizing: Definition, Size and Forecast 2017-2021 PART 04: Five Forces Analysis: Market opportunity and Comparison and Scope PART 05: Regional Landscape: Marine Signaling Devices Market size and forecast 2016-2021 PART 06: Vendor Landscape: Drivers, Trends Challenges and Decision Framework PART 07: Major Exhibits: Market share, Key leading countries, investments, production system and Parent market.

It wasn\u2019t funded,\u201d Notarianni said, later noting he supports making that pension contribution. \u201cWe had the money, it was there to do that and it never happened. I didn\u2019t know that was the case.\u201d \nCommissioner Laureen Cummings said she learned Wednesday morning that no contribution had yet been made, but said that\u2019s likely because she \u201cmisconstrued\u201d prior conversations with county officials on the issue. \n\u201cI thought we made a $500,000 investment (in the pension fund),\u201d Cummings said. \u201cI knew we were cutting that ($1 million) amount. I thought it was by $500,000.\u201d \nCommissioner Patrick O\u2019Malley, who said he was aware the pension contribution had not been made, said the county is able to forgo the contribution because of the strength of pension fund\u2019s investments. \nAs a result of a strong stock market, the fund\u2019s assets grew from about $159 million to $172.44 million since the beginning of the year, officials said. \nIn a written response to a series of questions posed by The Times-Tribune, officials said conversations concerning not making the pension contribution took place during \u201cbudget deliberations,\u201d of which there were many. \n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to specifically remember who was in the room at the time, due to the number of meetings and other commitments,\u201d according to the response, attributed to the county\u2019s executive management team, comprised of General Counsel Donald Frederickson, Chief of Staff Andy Wallace, Chief Financial Officer Tom Durkin and Communication Director Joseph D\u2019Arienzo. \nPrimarily, Wallace, Durkin, Budget Director Kevin Mitchell and the three commissioners are invited to attend budget discussions, and \u201cGenerally, one or more Commissioners attend,\u201d the written response reads. \nThe pension allocation for 2017 will remain in the county general fund unless its authorized for disbursement prior to Dec. 31, officials wrote. \nContact the writer: \n@jhorvathTT on Twitter We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

Council members accepted that, when it comes to the issue of the name of the university, it could not reconcile some of the differences and it was unlikely to emerge with a decision immunised from significant consequences,\" the university said in a statement on Wednesday.\nA path to reimagine itself \nThe university said it had been pursuing a path to reimagine itself as part of its transformation drive. However, this would be incomplete as long as the university still shared a name with Cecil John Rhodes.\n\"It would not be prudent to rename the university and invest significant financial and other resources in a major international rebranding project with limited, if any, guarantee that the identity and reputation that have drawn learners and leading scholars from South Africa, the African continent and across the globe to our university would, at the very least, remain recognisable,\" it said.\nThe university said it had recently obtained permission from the families of struggle stalwarts Charlotte Maxeke and Robert Sobukwe, and Enoch Sontonga - who composed Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika - to use their names to rename some buildings.\n\"Rhodes University has been, and remains, committed to the redress of the wrongs of the past and to build an even stronger institution that every African, including all the residents of Makana local municipality, can be proud of,\" the university said.\nFinancial sustainability \nSome of the other main concerns that the university said should be considered before changing the name was grappling with the university's financial sustainability, staff remuneration, employment equity, and Student Financial Aid.\n\"There are many academically-capable young people who, through no fault of their own, cannot afford to access a quality higher education. Every year our university invests about R38m to assist academically-deserving students who are in financial need,\" the university said.\nOther issues include the upliftment of the local community, maintaining infrastructure, and addressing institutional culture.\nSource: News24 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "enoch sontonga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cecil john rhodes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert sobukwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nkosi sikelel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte maxeke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rhodes university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhodes university council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "makana", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:48.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d20e3ea9ef2d39277e241d53ec1eabc8644bf082", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBZ6STOIoEHVc4GGJxgbla6i0xb.YqHyMLv.3hF9QCpXeH.5k3mX2HXMVNVI8sve73.Ou0ixsQSRZkaHYHv6AqSk-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money", "title": "Lightning Network clearly shows centralizing \"hub and spoke\" emergent topology as predicted... even on testnet where there is no real capital at play to cause further centralization", "title_full": "Lightning Network clearly shows centralizing \"hub and spoke\" emergent topology as predicted... even on testnet where there is no real capital at play to cause further centralization : btc", "published": "2017-12-07T12:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 23, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4134da0aa53d3f3945a4f81196c4af8caf3a737a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBZ6STOIoEHVc4GGJxgbla6i0xb.YqHyMLv.3hF9QCpXeH.5k3mX2HXMVNVI8sve73.Ou0ixsQSRZ5tRm19.GYYYi9kHSV_J6fn.JBH44hzaGfOf33ARrJ.s-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "CatatonicAdenosine", "published": "2017-12-07T13:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yes, the investment advice sounds sensible\u2014more so than my own decisions!

Itai Dzamara's disappearance cannot be treated as not being important.\"\nPatson said in the event that Mngangagwa chose to ignore the family's demands and request, he shall engage all progressive Zimbabweans within a week and protest in various ways in a civil, peaceful and resolute manner as provided for within the Constitution.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "itai dzamara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "itai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mugabe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dube", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmerson mnangagwa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mugabe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mnangagwa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dzamara", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "defence forces", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mngangagwa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe republic police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glen view", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:48.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "65edfd3671154284b0d8f449d2ea42dec48610c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WKkp_lCSYcRAt3jjCVe0Y7KNUSzlLE95_NNt0sN2nBkSF6KlFzw81anxnIaVCdwXCtxmrOK5ptEoxQHfxtnrwKenyyLVYukm_Xr8dVY1C_5BFT06c7M.vQ", "site_full": "knowledgebylanes.co.za", "site": "knowledgebylanes.co.za", "site_section": "http://knowledgebylanes.co.za", "site_categories": ["media", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Knowledge Bylanes South Africa", "title": "Zimbabwe:Mnangagwa Not Amused As Military Misspells Country's Name", "title_full": "Zimbabwe:Mnangagwa Not Amused As Military Misspells Country's Name", "published": "2017-12-07T09:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "65edfd3671154284b0d8f449d2ea42dec48610c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WKkp_lCSYcRAt3jjCVe0Y7KNUSzlLE95_NNt0sN2nBkSF6KlFzw81anxnIaVCdwXCtxmrOK5ptEoxQHfxtnrwKenyyLVYukm_Xr8dVY1C_5BFT06c7M.vQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Web Desk", "published": "2017-12-07T09:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "Zimbabwe:Mnangagwa Not Amused As Military Misspells Country's Name", "text": "ZIMBABWE'S military Generals cowered in shame Wednesday after they were called out on embarrassing spelling error on the plaque commemorating the renaming the King George VI (KG6) army barracks in Harare Wednesday.\nThe error was noticed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa as he unveiled a plaque renaming the barracks after the late Zanla commander and liberation icon Josiah Magama Tongogara.\nThose who engraved the plaque spelt the country's name as 'Zimbawe' and also omitted 'the' in the citation.\nMnangagwa, who was reading the citation loudly, abruptly stopped after noticing the errors.\nThe citation read, 'The renaming of barracks was officially commissioned by his Excellency of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Head of State and Commander of-in-Chief of (the) 'Zimbawe' Defence Forces, Cde E.D Mnangangwa on 06 December 2017'.\n\"What is this?\" asked the evidently surprised president. \"Pane mistakeka apa, (there's a spelling error here).\"\nHe looked around but none of the Generals in attendance uttered a word.\nThose present included Defence Forces Commander General Constantino Chiwenga, army commander Lt General Valerio Phillip Sibanda, Air vice Marshal Sheba Shumbayaonda (Air Force), Zimbabwe Republic Police Commissioner General Augustine Chihuri, Zimbabwe Prison and Correctional Services Paradzai Zimondi and acting Central Intelligent Organisation director Aron Nhipira.\n\"Panoda kugadziriswa apa (this needs to be corrected),\" Mnangagwa told them.\nTongogara's wife, Angeline, and his children were also present along with rank and file military personnel.\nAsked to comment later, army spokesperson Col Overson Mugwisi only said; \"I'm rushing to another function with the HE Mnangagwa but action will be taken.\"\nMeanwhile, addressing the gathering, Mnangagwa said renaming of King George VI to Josiah Magama Tongogara barracks helped exorcise \"the ghost of colonialism\".\n\"We rid ourselves of the colonial mentality.

Three years later, in another box, he uncovered more bones of the same foot and some bones from the opposite legs.\nClarke realised that he had discovered bones from both feet and lower legs of one Australopithecus individual and that it had come from a very deep place in the Sterkfontein caves - 40km north west of Johannesburg.\nMore on This \"We estimated it to be more than three million years,\" he said.\nHe then realised that the whole skeleton must still be in the cave.\n\"I said: 'Wouldn't it be marvellous if we could find it?'\"\nAnd so the task began.\nThe cave was deep underground and it was dark.\n\"The chances of finding it were very, very remote. I gave the cast to two of my assistants and said they should go into the cave with the piece and see where this piece could fit in.\"\nRemarkably, after one-and-a-half days of searching, his assistant Stephen Motsumi, had some news for him.\nClarke rushed to the site and when he arrived, Motsumi asked him: \"You know that bone that you asked us for? Well, we think we found it.\"\nClarke gasped: \"What?\"\nDigging stopped temporarily \nHe went down into the cave, in the dark, and Motsumi was shining the torch and pointed to the right place.\n\"We got there, I tried to fit it on, I turned it around and eventually it clicked and fitted perfectly. And then I found that the other foot fitted on the other side.\"\nClarke said it was dramatic because researchers had expected to find a whole skeleton lying there, but it was in very hard concrete.\nThey continued to chisel away and uncovered the lower leg, right up to the thighs, and that was it.\n\"We said this is incredible. How can there be no more of this skeleton? We became very disappointed.\"\nThe only explanation Clarke and his team had for the missing bones was that they had collapsed to a lower level.\n\"We chiselled through that stone and one day Stephen's chisel uncovered some bone. It turned out to be part of the back of the skull and, at that stage, we thought we had found the skull and the rest of the skeleton and we should announce it to the world.\"\nAnd so they did in a South African journal and that opened the floodgates.\nThe announcement sparked a lot of interest and the digging temporarily stopped as throngs of people demanded to see the discovery.\n'Like us' \nAnother reason the process took long was because the team was excavating in the position that the skeleton was in so as to not damage the bones.\nClarke, who had been described as a paleosurgeon, said surgeons take an oath that they would not harm their patients.\n\"If I am a surgeon, then my patient is the fossil on which I am working and I pledge to do no harm to it and I refused to be pushed. Even though people were harassing me, asking me why it took so long, I turned a deaf ear and continued slowly.\"\nClark and his team found that Little Foot had legs longer than her arms which meant she was \"like us\", he said. He added that evidence showed she walked upright.\nClarke was visibly elated that the day had finally come and so were his assistants, Andrew Moyagabo Phaswana and Abel Kgama Molepolle, who also worked with him on the project.\nPhaswana said: \"I am very happy because I learnt many things each and every day from Ron. I am happy because now I can tell the new generation what is going on with Little Foot because of Ron.\"\nMolepolle added: \"I am very happy working with Professor Ron Clarke for many years. More than 15 years. He has shown me how to clean the fossil and how to make a cast, so I am very happy.\"\nSource: News24 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clarke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew moyagabo phaswana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan hughes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phillip tobias", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen motsumi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron clarke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motsumi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abel kgama molepolle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "little foot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phillip thobias", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "molepolle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phaswana", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of witwatersrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evolutionary studies institute", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sterkfontein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:49.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a08f4b0066f5e72a448b9dc58ab946508616d80b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WKkp_lCSYcRAt3jjCVe0Y79YLlwxZpHtIRpSgD_7Hhm44spTeYd2SUnFI_tYO5mYI3J.bO6ZWLeGcsOjkxKNta9ywUg8TlRVIJtfU7zLM6z69BRDFK1OP.", "site_full": "knowledgebylanes.co.za", "site": "knowledgebylanes.co.za", "site_section": "http://knowledgebylanes.co.za", "site_categories": ["media", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Knowledge Bylanes South Africa", "title": "Uganda/Zambia:Striker Shaban Destroys Zambia in Cosafa U20 Opener", "title_full": "Uganda/Zambia:Striker Shaban Destroys Zambia in Cosafa U20 Opener", "published": "2017-12-07T08:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a08f4b0066f5e72a448b9dc58ab946508616d80b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WKkp_lCSYcRAt3jjCVe0Y79YLlwxZpHtIRpSgD_7Hhm44spTeYd2SUnFI_tYO5mYI3J.bO6ZWLeGcsOjkxKNta9ywUg8TlRVIJtfU7zLM6z69BRDFK1OP.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Web Desk", "published": "2017-12-07T08:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Uganda/Zambia:Striker Shaban Destroys Zambia in Cosafa U20 Opener", "text": "Photo: Cosafa Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (Cosafa) logo \nBy The Independent Kitwe, Zambia \u2014 Zambia 0 - 2 Uganda\nStriker Muhammad Shaban scored a brace of goals as East African guest nation Uganda stunned holders and hosts Zambia with a 2-0 victory in their Group A opener at the 2017 Mopani Copper Mines COSAFA Under-20 Championships in Kitwe on Wednesday.\nUganda's Hippos were deserved winners over the African champions, who have a new-look side this year as they build towards the defence of their title in the 2019 African Youth Championships.\nThe Young Chipolopolo certainly had their chances, but were undone by Shaban's double-strike in the second half at the Arthur Davies Stadium.\nZambia came close to the opener when Captain Prince Mumba saw his shot cannon back off the woodwork, before Lameck Banda was denied by a fine stop from Uganda keeper Keni Saidi. The East Africans were ahead six minutes into the second period when Shaban netted from a tight angle after turning home Steven Mukyala's cross to stun the sizeable home crowd.\nAnd the Kampala City Council forward doubled his side's lead three minutes later with another neat finish.\nZambia had goalkeeper Daniel Sikanyika to thank as he denied Stephen Mukwala as Uganda pushed for a third, while the visitors also had a goal disallowed in what was an accomplished performance from them that will elevate them to one of the tournament favourites.\nIn the other fixture in Group A, Malawi edged Swaziland in a five-goal thriller with a 3-2 victory as Patrick Phiri bagged a brace of goals. Highly-rated Peter Banda put the Young Flames ahead as he drilled the ball into the back of the net, before he then blasted the ball over and saw another fine effort saved by Swaziland goalkeeper Mlamuli Lukhele.\nSwaziland were brighter at the start of the second period and equalised through Nuno Tsabedze.\nPhiri put Malawi ahead three minutes later, but Swaziland were level again before the hour-mark when Order Mamba converted a penalty.\nBut the Young Flames had the last laugh as Phiri headed home after Banda's free-kick had come back off the crossbar.\nNorth African guests Egypt got their tournament off to a winning start in a hard-fought 1-0 success over Mozambique.

It happened under my watch. There is no way that, if you are a leader and something happens, and then you suddenly want to walk away from it,\" he said.\nSelebano told the hearing that the deaths took place because of the negligent conduct of the department that he headed.\nThe former health head, who referred to the move as a \"revenue enhancement programme\" denied that he knew that the rushed and ill-conceived move would result in fatalities.\n\"If I had known that there would be mortalities - I wouldn't have guessed that - if I had known, then really that would have been unthinkable, that I would have gone on,\" he said.\nIt was again revealed that he, along with other senior officials, had more than one warning about the dire consequences of moving mentally ill patients from Life Esidimeni to NGOs. Warnings came in the form of legal action, media coverage, family and civil organisation complaints.\nFurthermore, an extensive report costing R400 000, compiled by the Health Advanced Institute (HAI), revealed that the service offered at Life Esidimeni was good value for money and the institution was financially efficient. The report was paid for by the department.\nCollective decision makers \nFormer deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke said Selebano should have taken steps to avoid all harm, even if he couldn't have foreseen the tragedy.\n\"The warnings came, but one wishes they could wind back the time and act differently. I am not defending it or saying we acted in the right manner, but the warnings were clear... although they never said there would be fatalities,\" he said.\nThe warnings came before he signed the contract which terminated the contract between Life Esidimeni and the department in September 2015.\nSelebano stuck to his guns, saying that the decision to end the contract with Life Esidimeni was made by a collective group after extensive meetings between 2014 and 2015.\nHe named former MEC, Qedani Mahlangu, directors, chief directors, chief executive officers (CEOs), deputy director generals, head of mental health Makgabo Manamela and himself as the collective decision makers.\nSelebano reluctantly testified after being cornered that the mental healthcare unit - headed by Manamela - authored the letter that he signed to terminate the contract.\nHe said he was told that the contract had been there since 1977, was operational in the whole country, and was one of the supply chain reasons behind the termination, which he mentioned on Tuesday.\nIt emerged previously that although Selebano said the department made the decision because they were cash-strapped and needed to relieve financial pressure, they were able to buy Life Esidimeni.\nMoseneke said the department could have put it out to tender instead of terminating at the expense of the vulnerable.\nSelebano continues his testimony on Thursday.\nSource: News24 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dikgang moseneke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manamela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "makgabo manamela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "selebano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barney selebano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qedani mahlangu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moseneke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gauteng health department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "life esidimeni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "health advanced institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parktown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gauteng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:49.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6b359050a1c7a9bcd6d41661811595f223da0ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTl96VBwqvpyHTnVEYIJsu9TTTMrlIlN0utfmBfSQfoSWDMmfMgnTwT", "site_full": "www.xossip.com", "site": "xossip.com", "site_section": "https://www.xossip.com/forumdisplay.php?f=69", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Requests - Xossip", "title": "Want full set of this..& if avalable the thread also..", "title_full": "Want full set of this..& if avalable the thread also.. - Xossip", "published": "2017-12-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4254, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "889561c1a798319ac758b826fd7ed9a37daf3466", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTl96VBwqvpyHTnVEYIJsu9TTTMrlIlN0utfmBfSQfoSf3tGozlntDTth.M3qNg7Fcwjkrz9.UN5Q--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "waand_ati", "published": "2017-12-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "yaar... ye bohot lamba thread hai 695 pages ka 10-20 pics ka ek saath catlog nahi mil sakta kya agar kisi ke paas collection ho to plzzz upload karo", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:49.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f7ab46ee6af0e91d24d6fe5c04b2feef5d1c5f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOS_5hBLgIvVGUdhaGBxc0WT8rNwVZABrf_i3bQw3keY37fYQsALNo7VfkeTvKTPe3YfMI3BVc9CsSqC8UnyoKnBw59mCNzjVVbXqF10DRKfw--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g1-i10702-Air_Travel.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Air Travel Forum - TripAdvisor", "title": "Justfly.com, is just a scam!!

Subscribe 24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter! Back to Article news The Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, has urged the Muhammadu Buhari administration to stop blaming former President Goodluck Jonathan and focus on the electoral promises. Amaechi advised his colleagues in the president's cabinet to shun the blaming game and get to work. The former governor of Rivers state said it is time for officials to concentrate on delivering good policies to the citizens rather than dragging the former president for Nigeria\u2019s woes. \u201cI agree with those who said we should stop criticising the last government and that we should do our own,\u201d Amaechi told The Nation newspaper. \u201cWe need to leverage on what we know. People are shouting intermodal transport; I went to the new airport in Singapore and I didn\u2019t find one person at the airport. \u201cAs you walk in, technology takes over,\u201d Amaechi said. The politician also called for a renewed interest in Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure with special emphasis on information and communications technology. \nAmaechi and President Buhari with aides (Signal) ALSO READ : Buhari blames Jonathan for current economic crisis \u201cThey also said in the next few years, they would introduce driverless cars. We should also think outside the box about how to improve our transport sector and think less about how sun and moon affect the sector or building more bus stops. \u201cWe should see how much investment we can put in the area of ICT. Intelligence transportation should not be ignored ,\u201d he added. The blame game Ex-President Goodluck Jonathan has been severally blamed for the current situation Nigeria and her citizenry have found themselves under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari . From the incumbent President to the information minister, Lai Mohammed to Finance minister and even minister for Agriculture , the past administration had always been given as the reason for the failures in the country and all ministries. Members of the ruling party, APC, have also towed the line heaping blames on the past administration and its head honcho, Dr Goodluck Jonathan. |", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amaechi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jonathan amaechi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "buhar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jonathan amaechi minister", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "buhari", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lai mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammadu buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rotimi amaechi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammadu buhari naij amaechi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goodluck jonathan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ict", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the nation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minister of transport", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:49.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fdcbfa53a74c1bc34401985ad89a6b6dc6ac5445", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8vUdzJk69cXLbt6Og5ndAlgtfCJTNxg62rYaDUD89A9b0MkFR8J2RIv8KMf_EO4sc-", "site_full": "www.akfiles.com", "site": "akfiles.com", "site_section": "http://www.akfiles.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=2", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "General Discussion - The AK Files Forums", "title": "Heads Up Mosin Nagant Rifle Giveaway!!!!", "title_full": "Heads Up Mosin Nagant Rifle Giveaway!!!! - The AK Files Forums", "published": "2017-11-22T04:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 73634, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b33760c668c5e464540ce772ebff073a5e2790c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8vUdzJk69cXLbt6Og5ndAlgtfCJTNxg62rYaDUD89A9b0MkFR8J2RI7aai2zDiMfZR32l87kCPnV1WDnNNYyWu", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "Scharfshutzek98", "published": "2017-12-06T09:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The Russians didn't invent Realtree camo?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:49.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4339312ca3309af4e91da1ab3adfc791d514a76a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBakXDQPWBY4oZNH1WF3lAOi0FS9c_WU.oy_NilnldbvuX_DdxGmMjXnyH.KahzaUuHqzj13jQOqoSKxlahatqifPEK51Q0ZvMw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money", "title": "The last time there were this many trolls in here, BCH was \"dead\" at $300.
