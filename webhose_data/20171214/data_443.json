The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.

Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports The Maple Leafs hosted the Calgary Flames tonight, and in a brilliant bit of trolling the Leafs honoured the Grey Cup winning Toronto Argos ahead of the game. The CFL Champions defeated the Calgary Stampeders in Ottawa last week, and it\u2019s not their fault the first home game they\u2019ve had since the Grey Cup was against the Flames, it\u2019s just delicious irony. Oh, right there was a game as well. Here are the goals: The first goal was scored by the Flames on the powerplay. Matt Martin was in the box for holding, and Mark Giordano takes a wrist shot from the blueline while all the Leafs are crowded around the net. The second goal of the game came at the end of the second period, for the Maple Leafs. Giordano tries to clear the puck out but there\u2019s no Flame along the boards. The puck rolls right to Rielly who fires a wristshot past Olympic gold medalist Mike Smith . Here are my thoughts on the game. William Nylander is good. Like, super good at this hockey thing. william nylander just broke matt stajan's ankles lmao pic.twitter.com/SCvJolOfVD \u2014 dylan fremlin (@DylanFremlin) December 7, 2017 Leo Komarov isn\u2019t? This is his last season on a contract and if the plan was to trade him...well someone will still want him for his reputation and grittiness, but the return won\u2019t be as high. Someone said tonight that \u2018the puck dies on his stick\u2019 and while that\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration, he wasn\u2019t on top of the game and led to a few clearing attempts by the Flames to get the puck out of their own zone. The Penalty Kill needs some work. Yes, it\u2019s been good at times, but on ACC ice it\u2019s almost last in the league. Zach Hyman couldn\u2019t clear the puck out and looked to be scrambling around his position between the two point men. The shot that went in for the first goal wasn\u2019t even super hard, just a wrister from the blue line that made it in. There were one of two good chances for the Flames that didn\u2019t go in, so it wasn\u2019t super tonight. Polak is supposed to clear the net and stuff right? Isn\u2019t that what he\u2019s good at? Spreadsheet nerds, mathletes, they just don't get it. This is why you keep Roman Polak in the lineup. He keeps opponents far, far away from Frederik Andersen. pic.twitter.com/CA9QKhQPLY \u2014 Jeff Veillette (@JeffVeillette) December 7, 2017 Matthew Tkachuk was a shitweasel on the London Knights and continues to be a shitweasel on the Flames. You know else could use some fine tuning? The power play. They just couldn\u2019t seem to get the puck far away from any Flames in the offensive zone. It was a lot more condensed than the Flames were, the point men are closer in and the other three are circling the net, giving the Flames PK more room to operate effectively. Katya has a question: \u201cWho the hell is Garnet Hathaway? And why is he all over this game?\u201d Garnet Hathaway is an NCAA free agent who signed with the Flames in 2014. He\u2019s in his fourth pro season and has been called up for a few games each yeah but mostly plays in the AHL. That Gaudreau penalty was weird. He did throw it inadvertently in the way of Matthews and it is technically interference, but....I dunno, it\u2019s odd. Hey Matt Stajan! Mitchell Marner and James van Riemsdyk are a good pair and involved in some close calls and nice chances. Marner will score again someday and it will be glorious. Matt Tkachuk is a shitweasal and dropkicked Frederik Andersen right at the end of the second period. Maybe, I dunno, Matt Martin should do something about the opposing team running the goalie, eh? The net was knocked off when the Flames think they scored, so it was really nice to see the Flames be sad their goal didn\u2019t count. \u2014 Flintor (@TheFlintor) December 7, 2017 Johnny Gaudreau messed up, he gets called for holding with 37 seconds left. To me, that\u2019s a bad penalty to take. Lucky for him the Leafs power play was ineffective tonight, going 0 for 4 on the night. Nothing would happen in overtime, aside from a close call as a Matthews tip in goes wide, and in the shootout Matthews and Nylander would score for the Leafs, and of course Tkachuk scored for the Flames. A 2-1 win for the Leafs! Hurrah! Who wants some charts? Shooting wise the Leafs would keep all their attempts to the slot and nice and close to the net. The Flames were everywhere, I don\u2019t think there was anywhere they weren\u2019t allowed to shoot from. 5V5 The game was mostly in the hands of the Flames, especially at even strength. It\u2019s fun to switch back and forth from all situations to even strength. The game was a win for the Leafs, but there\u2019s some work to be done, as there always is. Play Nylander more with Matthews. Play the bottom sixers less. The Maple Leafs don\u2019t play again until Saturday night when they visit the Pittsburgh Penguins , and then fly right back home to host the Edmonton Oilers on Sunday night.

Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. \nThat brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight.

If we are really interested in wildlife, the best outcome in the long term is achieved by livestock grazing in an extensive manner. \n\u201cIt is also important to note that there is a code of practice around controlled burning which the ICSA fully advocates,\u201d the president added. \nOn the issue of hedge cutting, Kent said: \u201cIn practice, farmers are trying to get it all done in three months from September to early December. Advertisement \n\u201cHowever, as we have seen this year, a lot of that period is beset with heavy rainfall and poor ground conditions. Moreover neatly-trimmed hedges are a critical piece of road safety infrastructure. \n\u201cThe ICSA believes that roadside hedges in particular should be dealt with in August. If we could at least get the roadside hedge cutting out of the way in August, it makes it more feasible to get the internal hedges done in September and October,\u201d Kent stressed. \nIt must also be noted that in GLAS some 7,500 farmers have planted 1,200km of new hedgerows and another 3,300km has been rejuvenated by coppicing and hedge laying. \n\u201cThis demonstrates that farmers are keen to maintain diverse landscapes where relatively small fields are divided by hedges. But if we make the maintenance of hedges too challenging by unduly harsh limitations on hedge cutting, then we are creating a perverse disincentive to any more hedgerow planting and a more bland, open countryside fenced only by wire,\u201d the president concluded. \nAccording to the ICSA, the organisation strongly commended the bill to the committee insisting we have to be pragmatic about the problems that are impacting severely on farmers and on road users right now.

PAUL, Minn. (AP) \" The president of Minnesota Public Radio told employees the decision to dismiss Garrison Keillor resulted from \"multiple allegations\" covering an extended period of time, but an attorney for the former \"The Prairie Home Companion\" host disputed that characterization and said the humorist wants MPR to \"set the record straight.\" \nMPR President Jon McTaggart held an off-the-record meeting with employees Wednesday, a week after the organization cut ties with Keillor. Reporters from Minnesota Public Radio News did not attend because the meeting was declared off-the-record, but compiled an account from employees who did attend. \nMPR News reports McTaggart said he alone made the decision to break with Keillor, who retired as \"Prairie Home\" host last year. Keillor told the Star Tribune he touched a woman's bare back as he tried to console her, and that he apologized. MPR has not given details of the allegations. \nIn response to the MPR News report, Keillor attorney Eric Nilsson issued a statement early Thursday. \n\"We are aware of allegations against Mr. Keillor by only one individual,\" Nilsson said. \"We trust that Mr. McTaggart will set the record straight in this respect to avoid any misperceptions on that point.\" \nNilsson says Keillor wants a swift resolution of the matter and \"with it expects a full restoration of his reputation.\" \n\"The Prairie Home Companion\" continues with Keillor's hand-picked successor, mandolinist Chris Thile.

They came in a patched cocktail of materials whose composite flavors ranged from roughened and raw (python print, gabardine, and linen) to sleekly striped (more python, white mock-croc, and red suede on black leather). This second recipe ran through the collection, served in full skirts and mid-heel strapped sandals. A pretty, mixed-up dress in patches of unaligned stripe and slashed sections of gingham reflected Ninous\u2019s exposure to Sidib\u00e9. A light, long, desert-dirt red crepe dress with one shoulder strap secured by shining grommet reflected her childhood passion for the now-relocated motorsport scramble from Europe to Africa. Diversions worth exploring included a suit in fine-check nylon of full skirt and a pratique blazer in the same material abutted with a black nylon hood, as well as a black cable-knit sweater racily encircled by a slanted ruffle of black leather.

Pushers of what is really boutique\r\nmulticulturalism, like to wallow in the ethnic\r\ntrivia of alien cultures - classic examples of\r\nmasochistic self-hatred. When things get\r\ndesperate, patriots will need to hunt down these\r\ndangerous quislings. In the overpopulated and\r\ndepleted Australia that globalism is building, the\r\nhungry hordes will fight to the death over scraps\r\nof garbage. Millions will starve, and millions\r\nmore will die from infectious diseases.\r\nMulticulturalism will feed nobody.\r\n\r\nAussies will pay a high price for globalist white elephant infrastructure projects\r\n\r\nGlobalism prescribes privatization and\r\nglobalization thereby increasing inequality and\r\npoverty and reducing health and educational\r\nlevels. It also gives sermons on the need to\r\nreduce inequality and poverty and improve health\r\nand educational levels. Aussies must ask\r\nthemselves whether they want their politics and\r\ntherefore their governments run by globalist\r\nJewish billionaires. They must ask whether they\r\nwant the imported scab labour that will give\r\nAustralia her next crop of ethnic gangsters. Every\r\ndirty multicultural rainbow has a pot of financial\r\nplague immigration lice swarming at its end. A\r\nmulticultural omelette made from imported ethnic\r\ngangsters is not a tasty dish. Imported ethnic\r\nmisery loves company.\r\n\r\nPlease don't make me pay for any more white elephant infrastructure projects\r\n\r\nThe mass immigration driven property market Ponzi\r\nscheme is largely to blame for increasing money\r\nsupply - inflation. The corrosive effect of\r\ninflation forces people to become speculators, an\r\nendeavour at which some will succeed and most will\r\nfail. Since the criminal imposition of globalist\r\nplague immigration, the Australian nation state\r\ndesperately needs a concept of treason as a\r\nfoundation of its national integrity. We must act\r\nupon it for our own protection. Stupidly, Aussies\r\nlet a globalist circus of political clowns and\r\ncelebrity freaks, con, befuddle and frighten them.\r\nHow can this sideshow be acceptable? When will the\r\nmadness end? The time to pay attention to\r\nimportant issues is right now.\r\n\r\nIt's time to pry open the secret file of globalist atrocities\r\n\r\nThere is a stream of propaganda from people in\r\npositions of authority to the effect that pandemic\r\nimmigration is wonderful, it is essential, and\r\nwithout it our economy would collapse. None of it\r\nis true. It is a deliberate inversion of reality.\r\nAlarming findings in CSIRO's \"Future Dilemmas\"\r\nreport of 2002-2003 revealed that our immigration\r\nlevels were irresponsible and unsustainable. The\r\nHoward government tried to hide that report, but a\r\nFour Corners program forced it into the open. You\r\ncan see reasonably readily from the available\r\ninformation that there is bad news, and more bad\r\nnews. The bad news is that plague immigration is\r\ndestroying our country, and the more bad news is\r\nthat wealthy parasites are happy about it.\r\n\r\nThe fecundity of the breeding ethnic locust\r\n\r\nIn nature, populations grow until famine,\r\npredators, disease or other forces cause collapse.\r\nPeople should try to control the populations in\r\neach part of the world to provide sustainable\r\nliving for all. It's time to use the brain, not\r\nthe penis. A misanthrope doesn't care about people\r\nor that the value of human life cheapens as\r\npopulation grows. Only misanthropes support a\r\nferal immigration policy that promotes\r\noverpopulation and human suffering in the name of\r\nprofits for wealthy parasites. Many globalist\r\nmedia drones and greed-crazed politicians feel\r\nthat importing impoverished people from third\r\nworld nations is a generous and ethical thing to\r\ndo, a way to share the magnificent poverty of\r\nAustralia's poor with the third world.\r\n\r\nSpinning your wheels with unpayable debt\r\n\r\nThe multiculturalists pretend that there will be a\r\nuniversal positive impact from the fusion of the\r\nbest from different cultures. They leave out that\r\nmore often there is a negative impact from the\r\nfusion of the worst elements in various cultures.\r\nThe worst greenhouse gas emissions blast from the\r\nfat arses of bloated globalist plutocrats, so\r\ndon't let them lecture you about your carbon-using\r\nways. Those rich lice are the plague immigration\r\nspin doctors of multicultural poisoning. We have\r\nto stabilize the population eventually - right? At\r\n25 million maybe, or 35 million or 100 million\r\nmiseries. Eventually - but it won't be voluntary,\r\nit will occur when we are forced to, when we are\r\njust absolutely incapable of further growth.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of plague immigration and multiculturalism tend to be appalling hypocrites\r\n\r\nAs the only country on Earth, Australia could\r\neasily be self sufficient, and have a high\r\nstandard of living and quality of life. Instead,\r\nkey industries have gone, massive foreign debt,\r\npoverty and social violence run wild. Australians\r\nare wrestling with household debt made worse by\r\nrapid population growth. Brute-force immigration\r\nis a federal issue, but we're all paying for it at\r\nthe local level and mortgaging our children's\r\nfuture. Land grabs, re-zoning scams and property\r\nracketeering without restraint express the nature,\r\nextent and morality of the destructive \"free\"\r\nmarket globalist filth that blew in with the\r\nstench of mass immigration and imported scab\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nThe entire corrupt plague immigration scam smells of imported human waste\r\n\r\nThose parasites who profit from unsustainable\r\ngrowth will use their considerable resources to\r\nconvince politicians that the community should pay\r\nthe costs of that growth. A corrupt formula that\r\nincreases public misery and strife. The polyglot\r\ncuckoos claim that tomorrow belongs to them. Their\r\nmulticultural \"tomorrow\" will be a dismal one.\r\nLet's see what the imported third world scab\r\nlabour can do with their \"tomorrow\" of ethnic\r\nresentment. Australians need a\r\nCounter-Proliferation strategy to prevent\r\nAsian-style \"Stack and Pack\" slums of mass\r\ndestruction spreading through their suburbs. But\r\nthat might be unfair to speculators, bloodsucker\r\nlandlords and property pimps.\r\n\r\nMulticulturalism is muddled-culturalism for retarded infants\r\n\r\nKeeping the intensely stupid Aussie sheeple\r\nsubordinate to plague immigration Ponzi schemes\r\nand globalist claptrap, is the supreme moral\r\nchallenge facing our sociopathic, greed-crazed\r\npoliticians. The irony of terminal growth-mania. A\r\nBureau of Statistics report found unemployment\r\namong \"skilled\" immigrants is 30% higher than the\r\nnorm. A Sydney University migration expert,\r\nDimitria Groutsis, concluded: \"This highlights the\r\nfact that the skilled migration program is not\r\nworking.\" It is psychotic to believe you will be\r\nmaterially rewarded by tapping into your inner\r\nmoral strength or by believing that you are truly\r\nexceptional (i.e. multicultural) in some way.\r\nMulticulturalism and globalism feed on this kind\r\nof gay psychosis.\r\n\r\nUndermining globalism's crude indoctrination platform\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to see children homosexualized\r\nfor a globalist \"rainbow\" society, then you need\r\nto treat multicultural indoctrination as the crime\r\nthat it is. Globalism, Stalinism and\r\nmulticulturalism are cut from the same\r\ntotalitarian cloth. The problem of the public good\r\nis easily overcome in favor of the corporate\r\ninterests by attacking the heart and the soul of\r\nAustralian nationhood. Australia is not equipped\r\nto deal with refugees. Most refugees have PTSD\r\n(Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). Poorly managed\r\nPTSD in people from violent backgrounds is a time\r\nbomb. At what point does charity for immigrants\r\nbecome criminal negligence?\r\n\r\nThe terrible results of globalist (Jewish-Zionist-Stalinist) brainwashing\r\n\r\nAustralia does not belong to globalism, although\r\nyou might get that impression from listening to\r\nthe traitors and quislings who parade their insane\r\nmulticultural claptrap before us. Aussies deeply\r\nresent these globalist nostrums. Soon enough,\r\nAustralians will see the result of creating a\r\nglobalist Australia where only the wealthy have\r\neffective citizenship - even if they have no\r\nfeeling for this country, and use it for a\r\nlavatory, a quarry or a rubbish tip. Aussies\r\ncannot see how much wealth has been withheld from\r\nthem. The average person has never experienced or\r\nseen the excessive wealth and luxury in which the\r\nrichest parasites wallow. The rapacious rich\r\nseemingly exist in another dimension.\r\n\r\nCanada's gloomy weather and \"gay multicultural Asian society\" sucks the soul out of those zombies and they don't even realize it\r\n\r\nMany working Aussies can't afford to buy a house,\r\nand rent paying Aussies don't want to subsidize\r\nproperty speculators any more. What is not well\r\nknown is that globalist policy dictates home\r\nownership be made unaffordable so people have to\r\nrent. Australia's native animals are being hounded\r\nto extinction, losing their habitats to urban\r\nexpansion, and our cities are being turned into\r\nhideous glass and concrete human zoos. Anyone who\r\nraises the issue of overpopulation is attacked by\r\nstooges. You will never see Aussies rioting for\r\nthird world austerity, yet plague immigration\r\nlocks more Aussies into austerity and poverty\r\nevery year. Can anyone believe that Aussies voted\r\nfor a third world standard of living?\r\n\r\nPlague immigration: The real cause of ethnic gang crime\r\n\r\nThank Kelvin Thomson for highlighting that\r\nAustralia lacks a population policy, and for\r\nproposing a detailed and well considered plan. Few\r\npoliticians have the guts to address this matter.\r\nWe hear it bleated so often, that it now tastes\r\nand smells like vomit - that third world\r\nimmigrants invade Australia to \"contribute\" to our\r\nwell-being. God help us, if this is how twisted\r\nthings have become. This is immigrationist vomit:\r\n\"We are immensely lucky - a Westminster style\r\nrobust democracy, reliable and affordable\r\nutilities - all on the edge of a monster size\r\nquarry and quality farm.\" (They really mean we\r\nmust accept more immigrants...)\r\n\r\nOur spineless politicians are pushovers for globalist propaganda\r\n\r\nAustralia is becoming just another globalist part\r\nof the putrid universal sewer of multicultural\r\nsubhuman waste. The evidence is in, and\r\nmulticulturalism is a fraud and a failure, but our\r\ninsane quislings still lumber ahead, stubborn and\r\noblivious. In submission, Aussies accepted their\r\nfate and their globalist chains, signing up for\r\neternal bondage to a plague immigration Ponzi\r\nscheme. Crazy suicidal lemmings. Coprophilic\r\nworms. Masochistic slaves. Spineless jellyfish.\r\nJust pathetic. Globalism alleviates world\r\npoverty!!?? You must be joking! It does the exact\r\nopposite. It concentrates wealth in the hands of\r\nthe few, immiserates the rest and destroys the\r\nplanet's ecosystems at the same time.\r\n\r\nStirring up big trouble with unsustainable plague immigration\r\n\r\nWhen our globalist lackeys insist on plague\r\nimmigration into Australia, urban consolidation\r\nand trouble become inevitable. These corrupt\r\narrangements must be brought to an end and the\r\npower of the cult of toxic immigration must be\r\nbroken. Family dependants form a huge part of the\r\nfraudulent \"skilled immigrant\" category as\r\n\"secondary\" applicants - 56% of the influx. No\r\nmore than one in four of Australia's plague of\r\nimmigrants can be \"resolving skills shortages\" in\r\nany way at all. Globalist authoritarianism is not\r\nreally the sort of world peace we would want.\r\nSeeing Australia overrun by imported ethnic hordes\r\nmay appeal to Jewish billionaires and putrid\r\nproperty developers, but it's not so wonderful for\r\nus.\r\n\r\nColliding with neo-fascist globalist \"reform\"\r\n\r\nWhy did the labour movement heavies allow\r\nunion-busting plague immigration into Australia?\r\nWas their love of imported scab labour too\r\noverwhelming? These drones just sat on their hands\r\nwhile the working class bodies just piled up\r\naround them. To listen to quislings and globalist\r\nstooges continually drone that diversity is the\r\nbest thing about Australia, is to hear the awful\r\nsound of betrayal. We are serfs in a kingdom of\r\nmulticultural madness and gay globalist hysteria.\r\nIn the globalist Open Borders future, the\r\ninvisible governing class will operate as it does\r\ntoday, patronised and informed of its obligations\r\nby the higher elites without those elites ever\r\ncomprising a structured global government\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nCitizens horrified by the Asian-style \"Stack and Pack\" suburban blight\r\n\r\nJohn Howard didn't keep it secret that he liked\r\nhigh house prices - he was pretty open about it.\r\nIndeed, he boasted about how his policies kept\r\nprices high. The awful truth is both Liberal and\r\nLabor conspired to make housing unaffordable.\r\nThere will always be morons who claim that\r\nAustralia can sustain a population of 300 million\r\nor more. Any drooling retard can just pluck a\r\nrandom number out of its arse, and claim that\r\nAustralia actually \"needs\" catastrophic\r\noverpopulation. The public's complaint is not that\r\npoliticians are failing to talk about mass\r\nimmigration. The complaint is that politicians are\r\nfailing to take effective action in the national\r\ninterest. It's time to bring mass immigration back\r\nunder control.\r\n\r\nWhen the nation is run as a mass immigration boosted casino or Ponzi scheme\r\n\r\nCorporate state zombies implemented the plague\r\nimmigration that displaced Aussie workers. The\r\nenforced multicultural society imposed longer work\r\nhours, less pay, less space for Australians, huge\r\nrents and household debt. The entire globalist\r\nbullshit cannot be swallowed whole, so the media\r\ndrones, tame \"economists\" and globalist\r\npoliticians feed it to the Aussie lemmings in\r\nbite-sized toxic morsels. Thoughtful discussion is\r\nflushed down the multicultural sewer. Writing on\r\nhis blog, Canberra Times economist Peter Martin\r\ncalled negative gearing, when combined with the\r\n1999 changes which halved capital gains tax, as \"a\r\nrort crying out for reform.\"\r\n\r\nPlague immigration guarantees the Ponzi scheme creation and destruction of a debt-bubble economy\r\n\r\n\"Sustainable development\" is not as sustainable as\r\nits name implies. Like \"multiculturalism\" or\r\n\"diversity\" - it's a weasel concept foisted on the\r\nsheeple. It's all about land-grabs, Asian-style\r\n\"Stack and Pack\" slums, and obedience. Everything\r\nin Australia now pulses to the rhythm of unearned\r\nprofits and plague immigration Ponzi schemes.\r\nNational cohesion is in tatters, but politicians\r\nplan to escape with their loot before Australia\r\nexplodes or implodes. Globalism says that the only\r\nvirtue the toiling masses have is willingness to\r\nwork harder, longer and cheaper. What other\r\nmeaning can it have when Aussies are held up to\r\nridicule if they refuse to accept third world\r\nstandards in the workplace?\r\n\r\nWe are witnessing truly evil globalist greed at work\r\n\r\nMost of us Aussies are not bloodsucker landlords\r\nwho inherited blocks of flats and can lounge back\r\ncounting unearned rent. We only have our labour to\r\nsell. Plague immigration does not help us climb up\r\nthe greasy pole of opportunity. Expose the dirty\r\nroots of plague immigration and reveal the moral\r\nsmugness, and arrogant notions of those corrupt\r\nglobalists who seek to own us. Would people\r\nsupport their own exploitation if they understood\r\nthe types of filth that benefits? Now that\r\nAustralia has been rendered bankrupt by plague\r\nimmigration, the whole bloody multicultural\r\nedifice is crumbling. When the illusion of\r\nprosperity through diversity and imported scab\r\nlabour evaporated, harsh reality became visible.\r\n\r\nStupid Aussie taxpayers fund imported ethnic fertility with the neo-fascist baby-bonus\r\n\r\nGlobalists would like to teach citizens how to\r\ntoil long hours for less money, and how to lose\r\ncultural and material control over their own\r\ncountries. Using a plague immigration recipe for\r\noverpopulation, you too can cook your nation's\r\ngoose. Australia's pathetic panacea for economic\r\ncollapse is to open the door to (supposedly)\r\nwealthy Asian and Indian immigrants to push up the\r\nprice of property, which stimulates house owners\r\nto consume the rising market price of their\r\nproperty. Most of our multicultural drones\r\nrepresent a financially secure and\r\ninternationalist class of determined parasites -\r\nchaos merchants peddling Hell on Earth. Not all of\r\nthem are Jewish, although the most frenzied and\r\nhysterical ones usually are.\r\n\r\nThe unaffordable road to globalist Hell is paved with bulk immigration, cultural diversity and multiculturalism\r\n\r\nThat we cannot stop a sustained plague immigration\r\nassault by elected globalist stooges indicates a\r\nmonumental failure of intellect, research and due\r\ndiligence by our professionals. This Ponzi scheme\r\nis not in any way sustainable or democratic.\r\nObjection to mass immigration is not due to\r\n\"belief in racial superiority\" or to \"racial\r\nhate\", it is a perfectly normal defensive reaction\r\nof the local working and tenant classes who want\r\nto survive and thrive and not be discarded. The\r\nbig ask about population increase is, \"what's in\r\nit for most Australians?\". It's clear the answer\r\nis \"less and less\". For too long governments have\r\nforce fed the greedy wealthy with a greater\r\npopulation than the environment can decently\r\nsustain.\r\n\r\nIf you cut your finger on globalism - you will die in imported filth, violence, poverty and homelessness\r\n\r\nNo country has an infinite capacity to absorb\r\nimported ethnic scab labour, especially those\r\nwhose ethnic and cultural backgrounds differ\r\nsubstantially from those of the host population.\r\nBut our quisling elites have abandoned sanity. No\r\nnation can prosper without an industrial base and\r\nAussies gave theirs away to the third world. Not\r\nsatisfied with that, the degenerate inner city\r\npolitical elite demand that Aussies give away\r\ntheir nation as atonement for an \"evil\" past. The\r\nglobalist machine has no power to destroy the\r\ntruth, but it can obscure. The lemmings are always\r\nrunning from the truth, making the job of national\r\ndeconstruction and invasion easier. The war for\r\nAustralia's remaining assets rages.\r\n\r\nTackling massively over-breeding imported scab labour\r\n\r\nIt's not as if some of us don't know what slimy\r\npoliticians are doing with their bipartisan social\r\nengineering schemes, and their plague immigration\r\ntravesty. It is no accident that this issue has\r\nbeen \"thrown into chaos\" by globalist change\r\nagents. Plague immigration of scab labour is not a\r\nvictimless crime. The silent victims are displaced\r\nAussie workers. Many are disadvantaged, such as\r\nthose with disabilities. Economist drones speak of\r\nthe need to control wages. Whose wages? Their own?\r\nSo you want to grow our population? Soon enough we\r\nwill be drinking parasite-infested and toxic\r\nsewage effluent. It will spew from hospitals,\r\nindustry, homes and abattoirs, to then be\r\nindirectly or directly inserted into public\r\ndrinking water.\r\n\r\nStalinist governments don't fix \"Stack and Pack\" slums - they build them\r\n\r\nThe giant real estate Ponzi scheme driven by\r\nplague immigration, continues to receive huge\r\npublic subsidies. The globalist religion of\r\neternal growth insists on rewarding the winners,\r\nand crippling the losers that it creates. The\r\ndarkness of the coming third world future is\r\ndisguised as a gay and vibrant multicultural fairy\r\ntale trip to sugar candy mountain where the\r\nostrich posture prevents the useful idiots\r\nperceiving the increasing environmental and social\r\nviolence. Beneath the gay bubbly headlines that\r\ncelebrate the globalist takeover of Australia,\r\nthere's something else going on here - a massive\r\nredistribution of income and wealth from the\r\nproductive to the unproductive and bloated.\r\n\r\nThe Devil's gospel of Australian multiculturalism\r\n\r\nAs Australia gets transformed into a third world\r\npesthole, it makes sense to fill it with third\r\nworld locusts who like slithering in the filth of\r\nthird world pestholes. Throughout history, when an\r\noccupying power has wanted to destabilize and\r\ndestroy a nation, it has settled a foreign people\r\nin its midst. Multiculturalism is simply a tool to\r\ndivide and conquer. A convenient excuse used to\r\ndisrupt the nation. Reality for most workers, is\r\nwhatever refuses to go away after all the pandemic\r\nimmigration boosted real estate Ponzi schemes have\r\ncollapsed and the frenzied globalist politicians,\r\nparasite landlords, and property speculators have\r\nfled for the hills.\r\n\r\nHow submissive gay cultures welcome invasion by alien rape-cultures\r\n\r\nThe lazy wait-and-see attitude is fatal in regard\r\nto plague immigration, and those who hesitate are\r\ndoomed to be replaced by cheap imported scab\r\nlabour. You need to develop a fierce desire to\r\nsave yourself, your freedoms, and your nation.\r\nSatan spawned more multicultural hate zombies and\r\nmore gay cock-gobblers than we can possibly\r\ndefeat, without first arming and training\r\nourselves to push back the wave of plague\r\nimmigration. Yes, my poor little Aussie jellyfish\r\n- you must fight! Our globalist media drones sit\r\nbefore the cameras looking like idiots and talking\r\nlike idiots, but don't let that fool you, they\r\nreally are idiots. They lie as necessary to\r\nprotect the globalist political-economic ideology,\r\nand their shonky careers.\r\n\r\nEscaping the Asian-style \"Stack and Pack\" slum twilight zone\r\n\r\nGlimpse the true nature of implanted stupidity by\r\nasking yourself, \"How big is my stupidity?\" Can\r\nyou grasp the size of your stupidity? No, it is\r\ninfinite. Can you find any intelligence? No.\r\nAnything that you find has been implanted by\r\nglobalism. The brute-force immigration issue, of\r\ncourse, puts the pro-immigration \"Greens\" in an\r\nirreconcilable ideological position - which is why\r\nthey religiously ignore it! Julia Gillard \"feels\r\nour pain\" about plague immigration although she\r\nused different words.

At this stage the real estate agent asked for the mortgage certificate and asked for the size of our deposit (10% - could be higher on the basis of how much money we'd like to spend on the house before moving in). Today we were told that they accepted an offer of 247 from someone with a more sizeable deposit. Originally posted by Firat \u201d Look at it from the vendor's point of view.\nOne person has put in a series of low-ball offers, and is reliant on a high LtV mortgage.\nThe other person has put in a higher offer, and is less likely to have mortgage issues.\nWhich would YOU sell to?\n\u201c Our budget in our head was 240. But now I am coming to realise that houses that are out for 240 are likely to be sold for around 250 which is over our budget. Does that mean we need to revisit our budget and maybe limit our search for houses that are on the market for 230? (which means we can't afford the house we want and it is very disappointing \u201d If you can't afford the house you want, you can't afford the house you want. So you need to decide what you're willing to compromise on. Have you never watched a single episode of Phil & Kirsty...?\n\u201c Secondly, a friend of mine said that she never sends mortgage certificates to agents and never answers questions about the deposit. She tells them her mortgage is in place and they need to take her word for it or the deal is off. \u201d Riiight.\n\u201c She says that as soon as they see you can afford more they start pushing you for a higher price. \u201d Ignore your friend, she's an idiot.\nRemember - the EA doesn't decide what offer to accept. The vendor does that. The EA is employed by the vendor - they might advise the vendor, and they certainly have a duty of care to their customer to ensure that the offer is actually based on really being able to afford it. Without checking your finances, how can they do that?\nLet's look at your scenario above...\n1. \u00a3245k, eventually, and the EA says \"This buyer won't confirm anything about their finances\"\n2. \u00a3247k, \"This buyer has proved their finances, and has a healthy deposit, so needs a relatively low LtV mortgage\"\nWhich would you go with...?\nIf you're lying to the EA about your offer, and saying \"I can't afford more\" - when you can - then the EA may well raise an eyebrow and pass that on to the vendor. Why wouldn't they?\nIf, otoh, you're absolutely upfront, and say \"Yes, I could afford more - but that's irrelevant, because I don't think this house is worth more, so won't pay more\", then there's zero leverage there. But be prepared to walk away...\nBut that's all academic, because you can't afford more.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:04.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2f5976f49913808cabe5dae2cc17b80d6b6dbbb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzoku3wJWSHdydSz9_RpwQFwvTtICTOvrkIeNPMZCKsFakIddqMpRpSnTaTUMYKyhjN5CVmg5q02sJwJ2N9jcknW5XTWp7S_12bs1fDi8kPYw--", "site_full": "frasesfamosasdepeliculas.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://frasesfamosasdepeliculas.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Frases de Pel\u0102culas", "title": "Escena La Princesa Prometida", "title_full": "Escena La Princesa Prometida", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2f5976f49913808cabe5dae2cc17b80d6b6dbbb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzoku3wJWSHdydSz9_RpwQFwvTtICTOvrkIeNPMZCKsFakIddqMpRpSnTaTUMYKyhjN5CVmg5q02sJwJ2N9jcknW5XTWp7S_12bs1fDi8kPYw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Afmesa (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "Escena La Princesa Prometida", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "escena la princesa prometida", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:04.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27573792a20d5f42ff4ebe0f1892afb4043bd305", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT1dtmPHssAtoupL5w0al17Lb.Y9ZtSnYJ694lheOlae8Vl13bUuvnz_89XbUlooiKVRkwek8RyqL_.8f1gAafpBUB6A3tw6MAqSBZylky20puGKXwglwh8g9lNw7T3YrQ-", "site_full": "www.rappler.com", "site": "rappler.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.rappler.com/rappler/entertainment", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Rappler: Entertainment", "title": "Ryan Reynolds to play Pikachu in upcoming live-action movie", "title_full": "Ryan Reynolds to play Pikachu in upcoming live-action movie", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.rappler.com/E5FBEF6C2B234030B4408E0979221052/img/530CB4B33A434570A82EE5AD929B354C/20171207-ryan-reynolds-001.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1586, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1975, "comments": 0, "shares": 1975}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "27573792a20d5f42ff4ebe0f1892afb4043bd305", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT1dtmPHssAtoupL5w0al17Lb.Y9ZtSnYJ694lheOlae8Vl13bUuvnz_89XbUlooiKVRkwek8RyqL_.8f1gAafpBUB6A3tw6MAqSBZylky20puGKXwglwh8g9lNw7T3YrQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rappler.com", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ryan Reynolds to play Pikachu in upcoming live-action movie", "text": "Ryan Reynolds to play Pikachu in upcoming live-action movie Ryan Reynolds is 'Detective Pikachu!'

Maybe with a little warning indicating that there could be a possible typo.\nI think the correct term for these is \"fuzzy matches\" as opposed to exact matches.\nThis would be a very useful and

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer.

(AP) \" The Latest on Southern California wildfires (all times local): \n10:30 p.m. \nA surge from the biggest of the wildfires burning in Southern California has forced several thousand more people to evacuate in a community of artists and resorts. \nVentura County sheriff's Sgt. Eric Buschow says flames have been creeping closer and slowly surrounding the town of Ojai (OH'hi), and on Tuesday night increasing winds brought them close enough to expand evacuation orders there. \nFlames, now about 4 miles away, were visible from the city's downtown for the first time on Tuesday night, and ash was raining down. \nParts of Ojai were already under evacuation orders, and the entire valley surrounding it had been under a voluntary evacuation advisory since the fire broke out on Monday. \nThe new evacuations meant most of the town of about 7,000 people was under mandatory orders. \nNearly 30,000 people are under evacuation orders for the fire. \n___ \n7:50 p.m. \nThe largest and most destructive wildfire in Southern California has grown to 140 square miles and fire officials say the worst may be yet to come. \nThe 90,000-acre fire burning in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles has swept through ridges and canyons to the sea and Santa Ana winds that drove it are expected to return with a vengeance overnight. \nState fire director Ken Pimlott says winds that eased in the afternoon could return with gusts up to 80 mph Thursday that would make it impossible to fight the fire. \nDozens of homes have burned since the blaze erupted Monday. Nearly 1,800 firefighters and a fleet of aircraft are fighting the flames but the blaze is only 5 percent contained and an estimated 12,000 buildings are in danger. \n___ \n6:20 p.m. \nA wildfire in a wealthy western area of Los Angeles has reached the estate and winery owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. \nRoxanne Langer at Moraga Vineyards in Bel Air says a temperature-controlled wine storage shed burned after the fire erupted before dawn Wednesday but it's unclear how much wine was lost. \nShe says firefighters stepped in to douse the flames with the aid of helicopters and that other storage sheds, the winery itself and the estate's unoccupied house are not damaged. \nThe winery has been evacuated. \nMurdoch bought the property for about $30 million in 2013. \nLanger says it appears the 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines suffered only slight damage and the grapes already had been harvested. \nIn a Facebook statement, Murdoch says some neighbors suffered heavy losses and his thoughts and prayers are with them. \n___ \n3:45 p.m. \nFirefighters have stopped the spread of a wildfire that has destroyed homes near the world-famous Getty museum in Los Angeles. \nDeputy Fire Chief Charles Butler says firefighters and aircraft stopped the growth of the 475-acre (192-hectare) blaze in the Bel Air neighborhood. \nThere are currently few visible flames and crews are concentrating on the southwest corner of the fire. \nButler says four homes have been destroyed and 11 damaged since the blaze erupted before dawn Wednesday in an area that includes many hilltop mansions. \nAbout 700 homes, an apartment building and a school have been ordered evacuated. \nNortheast winds driving the flames eased by afternoon but are expected to return in full force Wednesday night. Firefighters are struggling to ring the blaze before that happens. \n___ \n3:15 p.m. \nCalifornia's top firefighter says the state is in for the worst Santa Ana wind conditions it's ever seen. \nKen Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, says the wind wildfire threat to Southern California for Thursday is purple. The has color has never been used before, means there is extreme danger and that fires that erupt will burn uncontrollably. \nBelow that is red, meaning high danger of fires that burn rapidly and intensely and are difficult to control. \nPimlott says the winds could hit 80 mph (129 kph) and make it impossible to fight Southern California wildfires that have destroyed at least 200 homes and buildings. \nFive wind-driven flames continue to threaten homes in Ventura and Los Angeles. Some 200,000 people are under evacuation orders. \n___ \n1:25 p.m. \nThe University of California, Los Angeles, has canceled classes for the rest of the day due to difficult traffic problems stemming from a wildfire. \nThe university's website says many students, faculty and staff have been unable to reach the campus Wednesday, so classes from noon onward are canceled. \nThe athletics department says a night men's basketball game and all other team workouts and practices are canceled. \nThe fire erupted before dawn in the Sepulveda Pass, just up Interstate 405 from UCLA. The fire has destroyed some homes as it spread into the Bel Air area. \n___ \n10 a.m. \nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti says at least four and possibly six homes have been destroyed by a wildfire in the city's Bel Air area. \nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday in Sepulveda Pass, a major commuter route between the west side of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north. \nThe fire burned up hillsides on the east side of the pass into expensive neighborhoods that are now under evacuation orders. \nThe mayor says the fire is now 150 acres with zero containment. \nSome 500 firefighters are battling the fire along with water-dropping helicopters and airplanes laying down streams of fire retardant. \nThe dangerous Santa Ana winds that have fanned fires across Southern California this week have diminished over the new LA fire but conditions are very dry, with just 9 percent relative humidity. \n___ \n9:15 a.m. \nPresident Donald Trump says his thoughts and prayers \"are with everyone\" in the path of California's latest wildfires. \nTrump in a tweet is also encouraging everyone \"to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials\" and thanking first responders for their \"incredible work!\" \nWind-driven fires have raced through California communities for the second time in two months, leaving hundreds of homes feared lost and uprooting tens of thousands of people. \nThe most damaging fire is in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, where more than 100 square miles (259 sq. kilometers) and numerous homes have burned. \nDeadly fires tore through Northern California earlier this year. \n___ \n8:03 a.m. \nThe biggest and most destructive of several wildfires burning in Southern California has scorched more than 101 square miles. \nState fire authorities say the fire burning in Ventura County about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles is also considered a threat to 12,000 structures Wednesday. \nDozens of homes have burned since the fire erupted Monday amid fierce Santa Ana winds. \nA new fire burning among ridges and canyons on the west side of Los Angeles has also burned several homes while snarling morning commuter traffic. \n___ \n7:35 a.m. \nTwo homes are burning in a wildfire that has erupted in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles, the latest to hit fire-plagued Southern California. \nThe fire broke out before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Interstate 405 in the Sepulveda Pass and raced up steep slopes into neighborhoods at the top. \nThe Los Angeles Fire Department has deployed hundreds of firefighters and called in helicopters and airplanes. \nEvacuations have been ordered and a wider area has been told to be ready for orders to leave. \nIt's the same region of Los Angeles where hundreds of homes burned in the famous 1961 Bel Air Fire. \n___ \n6:52 a.m. \nMandatory evacuations have been ordered in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles as a dangerous new wildfire burns in Southern California. \nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Sepulveda Pass, which carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains on the city's western side. \nHelicopters are making water drops and more than 200 firefighters are battling flames close to homes. \nIn addition to the mandatory evacuations, Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman Margaret Stewart says a wider area on the east side of the pass has been advised to get ready in case of evacuation orders. \n___ \n5:35 a.m. \nA brush fire has erupted on the west side of Los Angeles along Interstate 405 in Sepulveda Pass. \nFire Department spokesman Margaret Stewart says the fire was reported at 4:52 a.m. Wednesday and is burning uphill, driven by topography rather than winds. \nStewart says 47 firefighters are on the scene, setting up protection for homes at the top of the steep slopes. Two firefighting helicopters have been assigned. \nSepulveda Pass carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains between the western neighborhoods of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north. \n___ \n12:40 a.m. \nThe same vicious winds that made three Southern California wildfires so destructive are also making the firefight itself more difficult. \nThe water-dropping planes and helicopters essential to fighting massive fires have been mostly grounded because it's too dangerous to fly in the strong gusts. \nCommanders hoped to have them back in the air on Wednesday morning, but all indications are the winds will be whipping then too. \nThe blazes brought evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people, destroyed nearly 200 homes and have remained mostly out control. \nThe largest and most destructive of the blazes, an 85-square-mile wildfire in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, had nearly reached the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday night after starting 30 miles inland a day earlier. \n___ \nThe 5:35 a.m. entry has been corrected to say west side.

vote for provincial, national elections Wednesday Dec 6, 2017 at 9:29 PM Dec 6, 2017 at 10:21 PM Binaj Gurubacharya,   \nKATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) \" Millions of people were voting in southern Nepal on Thursday in the final phase of mostly peaceful elections for members of the national and provincial assemblies. \nIt is the first election for members in the seven provincial assemblies established under the constitution that was adopted in 2015 after initially being rejected by ethnic groups in southern Nepal. The assembly members will name the seven states formed under the constitution and will draft provincial laws. \nThursday's voting involves about 12 million people in the southern half of the Himalayan nation, nearly 80 percent of the population. The northern, mountainous region voted on Nov. 26. Counting of all the votes is expected to start Friday and take several days as some of the ballot boxes must be transported from remote villages to counting centers. \nPeople holding their voting cards in their hands lined up before polling stations opened at 7 a.m. in the capital, Kathmandu. \n\"I am here to vote today because it is the first election for provinces with the hope these provincial governments would be able to deliver development to a focused and concentrated areas,\" said Kedar Sharan Raya, 74-year-old retired advocate. \n\"I am voting after many years because there is new hope in the country with the establishment of provinces,\" said Iswor Prasad Shrestha, 70, businessman. \nPolice said voting was peaceful. Police, army soldiers and temporary police officers are guarding polling stations. Vehicles were banned from the streets and voters walked to the polling stations in their neighborhoods. \nNepal's slow path to democracy began in 2006, when protesters forced the king to give up his rule. Two years later, Nepal officially abolished the centuries-old monarchy and decided a federal system would best serve all corners of the one of the poorest nation's in the world. \nBut bickering among political parties delayed until 2015 the implementation of the new constitution, which declared Nepal a republic. \nSecurity was stepped up for the elections, with thousands of police and army soldiers deployed. According to the Home Ministry, more than 400 people were detained in days leading up to the vote. \nSoon after the constitution was implemented in 2015, protests by ethnic groups in southern Nepal turned violent and left some 50 people dead. \nThe ethnic Madhesi group protested for months, saying they did not get enough territory in the province assigned to them.
