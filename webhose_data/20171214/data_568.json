It\u0092s a clown show, or it\u0092s rapidly becoming one. Richard Cordray, the former director of the agency, resigned at the end of November. There\u0092s speculation that he\u0092s mulling a gubernatorial bid in Ohio. Alas, comes the showdown. President Trump tapped Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to run the agency, whereas Cordray had selected Leandra English, his deputy, to take the reins. The fact is the president has the power to appoint a new director, but as Guy noted, liberals saw the CFPB, the temple of of Liz Warren, as so extraordinarily independent that the law doesn\u0092t matter. An interagency war occurred with English signing off emails as acting director, with Mulvaney sending emails of his own instructing staff to disregard English while inviting the rest of the staff up for donuts. It was an attempted coup, folks. And English filed a lawsuit to effectively block Mulvaney from taking over as acting director; a judge ruled in the Trump administration\u0092s favor on that one. Mulvaney is the acting director, though the lawsuit is still ongoing.   townhall.com ...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt vespa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "leandra english", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liz warren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard cordray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mulvaney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mick mulvaney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cordray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cfpb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office of management and budget", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:34.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "38b16f895fbdb52e8374bd51ccdb3c8d310ccc5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZHscshozwllA", "site_full": "news.ycombinator.com", "site": "ycombinator.com", "site_section": "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Hacker News", "title": "The Big Vitamin D Mistake", "title_full": "The Big Vitamin D Mistake | Hacker News", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 140, "participants_count": 103, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2232, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "368ae18473379ea55830928caf61472cfe233ca7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZMfUgpkxtAGfD8CyRSfRh1c-", "ord_in_thread": 136, "author": "tathougies", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "This is similar to my lived experience.

According to a study, family visits account for 43% of long-distance trip during Christmas. For some cat owners, making the trip home is also a way to introduce their new family members and pets to their nearest and dearest. Though non-pet owners may find it quite odd to go on a road trip with a cat, traveling with a feline companion has become increasingly common over the years as a survey reveals that 37% of pet owners take their pets on the road . Traveling with a cat presents a lot of challenges, but there are ways to make the trip smoother. Here\u2019s a guide to prepare for a winter road trip with your cat. \nMedical preparation \nBefore leaving for your winter road trip, take your cat to the vet to make sure that he is up to date on vaccines. You should have a hard copy of those vaccination records as well as your cat\u2019s insurance papers in case of emergencies. Bring those documents with you as your cat may need medical attention sometime during your trip. You should also pack a first aid kit for your cat so you can clean minor scrapes, remove splinters, or wash out foreign matter from your pet\u2019s eyes and ears while you\u2019re on the road. \nEnsure your cat\u2019s comfort \nAn uncomfortable cat is an unhappy cat, and you certainly don\u2019t want to deal with a yowling pet while you\u2019re driving. Keep your cat warm by letting your pet wear a sweater and booties, and don\u2019t forget your pet\u2019s favorite blanket so he can snuggle with it while you\u2019re traveling. Consider bringing a collapsible cat bed so your pet has a comfy place to rest while you\u2019re on your road trip. \nFeed your cat \nJust as you need to make a few stops to get some food, your cat also needs to refuel and rehydrate while you\u2019re traveling. Make sure to have some bottled water, cat food, a food bowl and a water bowl in your car and feed your cat as needed. If your cat is trained to come when called, you can let your pet out during stops, but keep a close watch on your pet so he won\u2019t wander off during pit stops. \nA road trip can be a fun and exciting adventure for you and your pet. Try these tips for a successful road trip with your cat this holiday season.

I found two kittens in my neighborhood and gave them to a coworker and her boyfriend. I'd known both for about six months. The kittens stayed one night before her bf said he didn't want one of them because it was \"too mean.\" A kitten. He was like four inches total. Fast forward two or so months, my coworker mentioned the kitten he kept was hurt. She said she didn't want to show me the picture. She was ashamed. When I saw it, I gasped. He was missing his fucking bottom lip. The bf said his claw got stuck in his lip which was bullshit (the vet said he'd only seen something like on dogs who'd jumped out of trucks on the highway). I eventually was able to convince them to give me the cat back after two weeks of trying to have them let me pay for him to go to vet. They wouldn't take him. When I got him back, his fucking tail was snapped in two with an inch thick hematoma formed where it was broken. He had fractures all over his tiny head, and his jaw was swollen and torn. I tried to file an animal abuse report but because he didn't have a broken leg, the vet I could afford for the thousand dollar procedures didn't want to comment on it, even though he agreed it was animal abuse. Really weird and I still want to press charges. Like, can you imagine? That poor kitten suffered in pain for weeks. His fucking tail was dying by the time I got him. I hope they're both fucking miserable and die horribly.\nAnyways, my family named him Tiger and now he's a cutie who happens to be missing a lip and a tail, with a bumpy head but he's a happy, spastic cat who gets tons of cuddles and lap time now.

This post will focus on the southwest corner, which is home to the capital of WA, Perth as well as the incredible Margaret River region. \nThere is plenty to offer on the southwest corner of Australia\u2026 from pristine beaches that look they should be on the Mediterranean, botanic gardens, wineries and wildlife \u2013 there is absolutely something to suit everyone. A guide to exploring Perth & surrounds Kings Park & Botanic Garden \nKings Park is a 4.06-square-kilometre park and also happens to be one of the world\u2019s largest inner-city parks. It is actually larger than Central Park in New York which is only 3.41 square-kilometres. \nGetting to Kings Park is easy \u2013 either via public transport or you can drive and park in one of the large Visitors can embrace the incredible views of the Swan and Canning Rivers as well as the city. \nIf you\u2019re into walking, there are walking trails that suit most people. Visitors can also enjoy free daily guided walks. \nThere are plenty of spots to relax or have a picnic as well and chairs are scattered around for people to use. Kings Park War Memorial \nWhile you are in the gardens, you will no doubt see the State War Memorial remembering those who died in World War I and World War II. Swan River \n  stunning views over the Swan River, you should definitely check out the Crystal Club Lounge at Crown Towers and enjoy a drink, overlooking the Swan River for sunset. It is the best spot in Perth to enjoy the views. Click here for a review of Crown Towers. The Bell Tower \nYou can\u2019t miss the Bell Tower! It is located down on Riverside drive and the most unique building in Perth. The Bell Tower has 12 bells of St Martin-in-the-Fields which are believed to be around since before the 14th century and recast in the 16th century by Queen Elizabeth I. Elizabeth Quay \nThis is such a cool spot in Perth CBD. There is so much happening here. When we visited there was a beef and beer festival, so it was pretty busy! You can sit and enjoy the water views, get some gelato and vitamin D. Margaret River \nMargaret River is located around a 3.5-hour drive south of Perth. All I can say is that Margaret River really surprised me. It is not just a wine region but has some of the most beautiful coastlines I\u2019ve seen. Click here to read our full review on Margaret River including what to see and do and click here on our tip for where to stay. Rottnest Island \nAn absolutely awesome day trip from Perth and is something that you must do during your trip. For our reasons why and tips on getting to and from the island, click here . Fremantle \nAfter your trip to Rottnest Island, you\u2019ve probably worked up a hunger! So, why not check out the Little Creatures Brewery . The Brewery opened in 2000 and is now a very popular brewery across the country. The venue is great and funky and you can choose to sit indoors or outdoors by the water.

We pay our rent on time,\u201d said Jay Sweet, who was very emotional at times when speaking before Judge Lucinda Sadler. \u201cWe had no idea that the selectmen were not going to renew our lease when we received notice on July 4.\u201dBut Chester Town Attorney Diane M. Gorrow said the question is who owns the property, which in this case is the municipality.\u201cThe selectmen have determined that they no longer wanted to rent out the property,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wanted the farm to be a working farm, they wanted to have more access by other people in the town and having a tenant on the property was not conducive to \u2026 making the most of that property.\u201dThe board has the authority to oversee the property, they decided to no longer rent the site and gave the Sweets time to leave the premises, she added.Sadler, after hearing both sides for roughly 30 minutes, said she would make a decision and inform the two sides via mail, likely within a week.The issue of the Sweets\u2019 eviction has divided the town, with more than 100 people signing a petition to allow the family to stay. Others side with the selectmen, noting the farm is overseen by the board and they have the authority to decide who operates the farm.The historic Chester property was owned by beloved Chester schoolteacher Muriel Church, who set up the Spring Hill Farm Trust in 1996. She donated the farmhouse, barn and 400 acres of land to the town with the understanding it would remain open space and, to the extent possible, a working farm in perpetuity.The trust documents stipulate the town offer the use of the house to Church\u2019s cousins, Anne Sweet and Jane James, or \u201ctheir children and grandchildren, in such terms as they and the Trustees shall agree.\u201dThe Sweets relocated from Kansas to operate the farmstead in 2014. Jay Sweet worked on the property as a teenager most summers and is related to Church through Anne Sweet.Since taking over operations, Sweet said he has made significant improvements to the property, including installing a new kitchen, erecting fences and reclaiming an idle pasture. He maintains it is a working farm, as evident by the fields of crops, tapped maple trees for syrup, dozens of agricultural animals on-site, and the tours offered to the public.The town selectmen in June opted to not renew the Sweets lease anyway. The family was told to leave the property by Aug. 31, but the Sweets had paid the monthly rent of $850 through October.The Sweets have since filed a housing discrimination claim with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. That investigation is still ongoing.Conversations at the town level have involved the Sweets since August 2016, according to Gorrow, who contends Church did not want the farm operating at a net-loss.Cass Buckley, a Chester selectman and Spring Hill trustee, has previously said the property is not a true working farm and the Sweets have been mismanaging it. He pointed to the lack of revenue from the actual farming operations and wanted to explore other options for more community activities there.\u201cIt\u2019s a great resource, so we should do something with it,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cMake it an attractive place for residents to go.\u201dAs many as 124 signatures were gathered on behalf of the Sweet family to stop the eviction proceedings.Sweet offered to present copies of the agreement with the town, as well as those letters of support and his farm management plan. Sadler did not accept the letters or plan because they did not fall under the scope of the eviction.The judge asked if she accepts the eviction, would 90 days be sufficient to leave the premises; Sweet said he would need all 90 days if that was her decision and he has already started making preparations to potentially relocate his animals and his family. Sweet said the family believes they are preserving Church\u2019s vision by operating the property at the highest standards and keeping it as a working farm for the community to enjoy.\u201cThat\u2019s what we were doing,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris garofolo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jay sweet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucinda sadler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buckley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jane james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorrow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sadler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diane m. gorrow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cass buckley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muriel church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angela sweet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne sweet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "spring hill farm trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of housing and urban development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derry district court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spring hill farm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "spring hill farm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spring hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:34.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "508b27c9b7e220d5420829d6627ba2c0451cf58c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ExwAeOOs7Rh5OtRsx9reAY6V7lwoS4XrcmTJfo7A0u.X3FzQENXa94220Obn0jnRn6AAOZfjtHLwFbvIsDFWVV81Y0sA0bQF3OyP9TZZ_XJaPJH_isQ.sVyXWb95K7xKIIXKFvUTQvoBatNF2HcU7aQhMcJ5VnfhX2s0wPyerwWzSvd56lKRxn1KD61q.fVI-", "site_full": "www.theindependent.com", "site": "theindependent.com", "site_section": "http://www.theindependent.com//search/?q=&t=article&l=100&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=sports,sports/*&f=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "www.theindependent.com - RSS Results in sports,sports/* of type article", "title": "Frost earns Home Depot National Coach of the Year", "title_full": "Frost earns Home Depot National Coach of the Year", "published": "2017-12-07T06:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/theindependent.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/90/79092b6e-db0b-11e7-aa23-af367e8a3834/5a28caf1a52d7.image.jpg?resize=945%2C630", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "508b27c9b7e220d5420829d6627ba2c0451cf58c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ExwAeOOs7Rh5OtRsx9reAY6V7lwoS4XrcmTJfo7A0u.X3FzQENXa94220Obn0jnRn6AAOZfjtHLwFbvIsDFWVV81Y0sA0bQF3OyP9TZZ_XJaPJH_isQ.sVyXWb95K7xKIIXKFvUTQvoBatNF2HcU7aQhMcJ5VnfhX2s0wPyerwWzSvd56lKRxn1KD61q.fVI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Staff and wire reports", "published": "2017-12-07T06:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Frost earns Home Depot National Coach of the Year", "text": "Frost earns Home Depot National Coach of the Year By Staff and wire reports Dec 6, 2017 \nScott Frost was named the Home Depot National Coach of the Year after guiding Central Florida to a 12-0 record and an American Atlantic Conference Championship. The Knights were the only undefeated FBS team in 2017. BRENDAN SULLIVAN/THE WORLD-HERALD BRENDAN SULLIVAN/THE WORLD-HERAL Save \nNebraska head coach Scott Frost was announced as the winner of the 2017 Home Depot Coach of the Year Award on Wednesday. \nHe will be presented with the award on Thursday at the Home Depot College Football Awards show in Atlanta, which will air live on ESPN at 6 p.m. (Central). \nFrost was selected as the winner after leading Central Florida to a 12-0 record and an American Athletic Conference championship as the only undefeated FBS team in 2017. He accepted the Nebraska coaching job on Saturday, but will coach the 10th-ranked Knights in the Peach Bowl on Jan. 1 against No. 7 Auburn. \nIn its 24-year history, the 42-year old Frost is the fourth-youngest coach to win the Home Depot Coach of the Year Award. Frost is also one of five coaches to earn the honor in either their first or second year as a collegiate head coach, a group that includes Nebraska\u2019s Frank Solich, the 1999 winner. \nFrost compiled an 18-7 record in two seasons at UCF after inheriting an 0-12 team. According to ESPN, UCF is the only team in FBS history to go from a winless regular season to an undefeated one in a span of just two seasons. \nIn 2017, UCF matched its highest win total in program history while posting the first perfect regular season in the history of the American Athletic Conference. The Knights also achieved the highest in-season ranking in program history (No. 10) and established a school record with a 12-game winning streak. UCF won its 12 games by an average of more than 24 points per game and picked up three victories over teams currently ranked in the AP poll. \nWith Frost calling the plays, UCF boasted one of the nation\u2019s top offenses, as the Knights led the country in scoring (49.4 points per game) and ranked fifth in total offense (540.4 yards per game). Sophomore quarterback McKenzie Milton was honored as the 2017 American Athletic Conference Player of the Year, while a league-record 16 Knights earned All-AAC accolades. \nThe Home Depot Coach of the Year award is the latest in a slew of coaching honors for Frost, the unanimous winner of the 2017 American Athletic Conference Coach of the Year. He is also a 2017 Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year Finalist and was the Region 1 American Football Coaches Association Coach of the Year. Frost is also a semifinalist for the George Munger Award for the second straight season.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite). Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., meets with reporters after House Republicans held a closed-door strategy session as the deadline looms to pass a spending bill to fund the government by week's end, on Capitol Hill... \nBy ALAN FRAMAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Congress seems set to prevent a weekend government shutdown, but lawmakers and President Donald Trump still have longer-range disputes to settle over spending, immigration and other issues before they can declare budget peace. \nWith many on both sides deciding a headline-grabbing federal closure would be a political blunder - at least for now - the House planned to approve legislation Thursday financing federal agencies through Dec. 22. The Senate seemed ready to follow. Without legislation, many agencies would run out of money after midnight Friday and grind to a close. \nThe two-week spending measure is aimed at giving both parties' bargainers more time to reach longer-term budget decisions. To jumpstart that negotiating, Trump and congressional leaders were meeting Thursday to try reaching agreements. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., prompted the two Democrats to skip a bargaining session that was planned then. \nThis time, the White House smoothed the waters by following up with a more peaceable, written statement. It praised Pelosi and Schumer for choosing to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\" \nLater, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension. It also laid out administration budget goals, saying money for the military including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\" \nFor Republicans, a shutdown would put a humiliating bookend on a year in which they've controlled the White House and Congress with little to show for it. They want the public to focus instead on the GOP's prized $1.5 trillion tax bill, which party leaders hope to send Trump by Christmas. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nEven the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have been threatening to oppose the temporary spending measure, predicted passage. \n\"No one wants a shutdown, including Freedom Caucus members,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters. \nThe roughly 30-member caucus has been trying to win promises from leaders of spending curbs and quick passage of a full-year defense budget in exchange for backing the short-term bill. Without support from many of them, Republicans would need votes from Democrats to push the temporary spending measure through the House. \nWhile many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the short-term bill, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there. They know they'd still have leverage on subsequent bills needed to keep the government running. \nRepublicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes for passage. \nDemocrats have been using their leverage to insist on spending boosts for health care, infrastructure and other domestic programs that would match increases Republicans want for defense. \nDemocrats are also seeking an agreement to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children.

What\u2019s known as victim impact testimony is intended to help the judge determining the defendant\u2019s sentence weigh the personal implications a crime has had. \nA preview of that testimony came Wednesday, when Scott\u2019s youngest son spoke to the court so he could return to his high school classes. Clutching a photograph of his father, Miles Scott said he has had trouble sleeping ever since his father\u2019s death. He said he misses watching football games with his dad and can\u2019t fathom not being able to watch with him the game they both loved. \n\u201cI miss my father every day,\u201d Miles Scott said through tears. \u201cI would like you to sentence the defendant to the strongest sentence the laws allows because he murdered my one and only father.\u201d \nSlager, 36, pleaded guilty in May to violating Walter Scott\u2019s civil rights. Federal officials have recommended 10 to nearly 13 years in prison, but his attorneys argue Slager should face far less time. \nSlager pulled Scott over for a broken brake light in April 2015, and Scott, 50, ran during the stop. After deploying his stun gun, Slager fired eight bullets at Scott as he ran away, hitting him five times in the back. \nBefore he hands down Slager\u2019s sentence, U.S. District Judge David Norton must decide whether the April 2015 shooting was second-degree murder or manslaughter. Slager faced murder charges in state court, but a jury in that case deadlocked last year and the state charges were dropped as part of his federal plea deal. \nSlager has said the two men scuffled and he fired in self-defense after Scott grabbed his stun gun. In his closing argument, defense attorney Andy Savage acknowledged the shooting was criminal but reiterated the stance that his client was protecting himself and feared for his own safety. \nDuring closing arguments, prosecutor Jared Fishman disputed that story. \n\u201cWalter Scott never assaulted the defendant. Walter Scott never took the defendant\u2019s Taser,\u201d Fishman said. \nThe attorney portrayed Slager as a calm, calculated officer who hadn\u2019t killed Scott in a moment of passion but did so intentionally \u2014 a hallmark of murder, not manslaughter. \n\u201cHe was not in a frenzy,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cHe was not in the throes of passion.\u201d \nFishman also said Slager had changed his story several times as to what he remembered about the shooting, including flawed state trial testimony about Scott charging him with his own stun gun. Fishman said those statements aren\u2019t backed up by evidence. \n\u201cThis is not memory loss,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cThis is a concerted, deliberate effort to obstruct justice and to cover up for his unjustified shooting.\u201d \nIn an unusual move, attorneys for Slager called the state prosecutor to the stand to question her about their assertions that she and federal prosecutors unfairly teamed up on Slager. \nSolicitor Scarlett Wilson said she had interacted with federal prosecutors but couldn\u2019t recall specific contacts and hadn\u2019t planned prosecutorial decisions with them. \nAlso Wednesday, Scott\u2019s mother, Judy Scott, said she was on the phone with her son when he was pulled over and told him to comply with the officer\u2019s demands \u201cso there wouldn\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d \nKinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Former Russian Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev waits for a hearing at a court in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017. Ulyukayev who is on trial for allegedly taking a $2 million bribe is expected to deliver... \nBy NATALIYA VASILYEVAAssociated Press \nMOSCOW (AP) - Wrapping up one of Russia's most high-profile trials of the year, a former economic development minister charged with bribery on Thursday accused an oil executive of setting him up and apologized for \"turning back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nAlexei Ulyukayev, the highest-ranking Russian official to be arrested since 1993, was detained last year at the headquarters of Russia's largest oil producer, the state-owned Rosneft, after a sting operation by Russia's main intelligence agency. Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared - what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" \nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you're doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nUlyukayev asked for \"people's\" forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \"defending people's interests.\" \nThe court is expected to deliver the verdict next week.

(AP) \u2014 One by one, relatives of the late Walter Scott urged a judge to mete out a significant punishment for Michael Slager, the white former police officer who fatally shot Scott, an unarmed black man, in the back after a 2015 traffic stop. Through tears, Scott's family told Slager they felt sorrow for him and the loss his young children would feel in his absence. In the end, a judge sentenced Slager to 20 years in prison, giving the Scott family the justice they had sought ever since a stranger came to them with the shocking video of Scott being killed. \"I forgive Michael Slager. I forgive you,\" Scott's mother, Judy, said as she turned toward her son's killer. \"I pray for you, that you would repent and let Jesus come in your life.\" Now Playing: \nThe sentencing hearing for the form South Carolina police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black man in 2015 begins Monday. Josh King has the story (@abridgeotland). Media: Veuer Sitting just a few feet away, Slager wiped tears from his eyes and mouthed: \"I'm sorry.\" The punishment wrapped up a case that became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Slager, 36, is one of only a few police officers to go to prison for a fatal shooting, and his sentence is by far the stiffest since the shootings came under extra scrutiny in recent years. Attorneys for the former North Charleston officer said he shot the 50-year-old Scott in self-defense after the two fought and Scott grabbed Slager's stun gun. They said race didn't play a role in the shooting and Slager never had any \"racial animus\" toward minorities.

As the New York Times noted in 2016: \nThe United States government owns 47 percent of all land in the West. In some states, including Oregon, Utah and Nevada, the majority of land is owned by the federal government. Of course, it used to own nearly all of it . \nEast of the Mississippi the federal government owns only 4 percent of land. \nPart of that discrepancy is due to the vagaries of the Western expansion into the sparely populated frontier. Part of it is due to the desires of environmentalists to turn America into a save-the-earth postcard -- take pictures and don\u0092t touch. President Trump, who has unlocked much of America\u0092s resources that were formerly held hostage by greenies and others, has decided to return to the people of Utah control of and decision-making power over the land of Utah, so you no longer need permission from a Beltway bureaucrat to pick up a rock and move it one foot to the left:   americanthinker.com ...

I hope this puts a crimp in Sen Finestein's plans. \nTHERE'S GOLD IN THEM THAR HILLS ---Sponsored by Senator Diane Feinstein, the Desert Wilderness Protection Act and its companion bill known as the California Desert Protection Act created three new national parks and seventy- four new wilderness areas in the desert of California that total 8 million acres (an area the size of Maryland). \nThis closes acreage to development, forces out private owners within the protected area and closes mines and ranches. It also expands the Death Valley and Joshua Tree national monuments and upgrades them to national parks. \nIt seems that the real motivation for passage of this bill lies with the special interest groups that would benefit monetarily. Through a complex series of land exchanges, Catellus Corporation (Owned by none other than Richard Blum DiFI Hubby), a subsidiary of Santa Fe Pacific, will receive land that contains some of the richest gold deposits in the world. 2 posted on 12/07/2017 1:58:09 AM PST by Liz (One side in this conflict has 8 Trillion bullets; the other side doesn\u00c2\u0092t know which bathroom to use) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies ] To: All REFERENCE---DiFi and her hubby know a thing or two about putting their lives ahead of everyone else's using her Govt status to influence to steer business and profits to enrich themselves. \nPerhaps there's the prospect of their lives being inconvenienced maybe by empaneled FBI agents with Grand Jury subpoena power investigating things like how her husband/s investment group managed to obtain several Billion dollars taxpayer-funded govt contracts \nBACKSTORY : Back in Sept 2014, Senate intel head Di/Fi was whining about the CIA looking through her computers and taking documents. Clearly, the CIA had plenty on her----even BEFORE the shocking Chi/Com missile scandal brke involving a Cali state Senator. \nDi/Fi's known aversion to guns did not prevent her from honoring Sen Leland Lee's co-defendant, Raymond Chow---Chow is the key figure in Cali's Demorat state Sen Yee's shocking sub rosa missile deal w/ China (Yee is a notorious grabber of American guns). \nINCONVENIENT FACTOIDS : \n<><>Feinstein heads the Senate Intel Committee; \n<><> Her hubby Richard Blum made million as the lawyer for Chinese interests and from tax-funded govt contracts; \n<><> Did Di use her access to valuable US security data improperly? \n<><> Hubby Richard Blum made millions in China deals in past years.

After they got married my granddad set up shop in Rosslea. Bad timing, the war of independence broke out within the year and that area was a flashpoint.\nA nasty tit for tat cycle of violence culminated, for my grandparents, with the Auxies smashing their door in one winter night and giving them an hour to clear out before they, and all of the other Catholics in the village, were burnt out. My granddad managed to borrow a donkey and cart and set off of the bog to Scotstown with my pregnant grandmother, my baby aunt and a few meagre belongings.\nNot surprisingly this politicised my Granddad and he ended up involved in the civil war. He would never speak about it apart from to say that violence is never the answer. He brought up his family to hold the same values, even in the fiercely republican Scotstown. The fact that he was given the old Protestant schoolhouse to raise his family in because there were no Protestants left to school in Scotstown caused him to reflect on the nature of political violence and what it did to erstwhile neighbours.\nLots of people made sacrifices to preserve or sever the union. Most people didn't have a choice about those sacrifices, they were imposed upon them. The DUP has long had an obstructionist role in Northern Ireland and often a malign influence. Ian Paisley instigated and led the opposition to the civil rights movement, something that directly led to the troubles. He vehemently opposed the Sunningdale agreement for power sharing, again condemning the North to decades more of violence. His rabble rousing inspired a generation of Loyalist paramilitaries who were none too pleased when Paisley later backed away from them. The DUP utterly opposed the peace process and campaigned against the Good Friday agreement.\nIt's hard to make out what the DUP stands for on Brexit - they campaigned for it, they don't want the hard border that will result from it and they don't want to represent the wishes of the majority in Northern Ireland who voted against Brexit. Just for once could they make a positive contribution to life on these islands and stop saying no to all progress on anything.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:37.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0aaf86bf40e526759ea3fa924092a11a31434003", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdhdtyEekhwK.4.bckVevBX0EHrybsPT8Olqm2HHVIRMqawzmo.w145AyNCBxVUmXJ9k9OclEpy1buuS2fxQDMMMrDrnUWoMWiLPtRzOQVdg--", "site_full": "hudsonvalley.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://hudsonvalley.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist hudson valley | for sale search", "title": "CRAFTSMAN 1130 SNOW BLOWER 11 HP ELECTRIC START 30 IN PATH (LAGRANGE) $580", "title_full": "CRAFTSMAN 1130 SNOW BLOWER 11 HP ELECTRIC START 30 IN PATH (LAGRANGE) $580", "published": "2017-12-07T10:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_1kcTdmwHqfD_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0aaf86bf40e526759ea3fa924092a11a31434003", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdhdtyEekhwK.4.bckVevBX0EHrybsPT8Olqm2HHVIRMqawzmo.w145AyNCBxVUmXJ9k9OclEpy1buuS2fxQDMMMrDrnUWoMWiLPtRzOQVdg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "CRAFTSMAN 1130 SNOW BLOWER 11 HP ELECTRIC START 30 IN PATH (LAGRANGE) $580", "text": "QR Code Link to This Post CRAFTSMAN SNOW BLOWER 1130 11 HP ELECTRIC START RUNS GREAT 2 STAGE 30 IN PATH WORKS GREAT 6 FORWARD SPEED 2 REVERES WORKS GREAT JUST HAD OIL CHANGE READY TO GO COME SEE do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 6412989452", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hp electric", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "lagrange", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:37.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21ca33d08c41951e28695b976abaddf7d9836270", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTyzfeOBw4R2D7cU.TkIhFON0ZBABF2vB0kpcilS0AZUfu8Jz2edZz4moqfHAijlQNf8zvbJKWL4J5w4s_ogKaDHV22UvnjesawP1jhOvjNs8mMtkzjJ3z", "site_full": "job-openings.monster.com", "site": "monster.com", "site_section": "http://rss.jobsearch.monster.com/rssquery.ashx?WT.mc_n=RSS2005_jsr&#038;q=Human+Resources&#038;cy=US&#038;baseurl=jobsearch.monster.com", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "Monster Job Search Results", "title": "Medical Biller/Coder", "title_full": "Medical Biller/Coder", "published": "2017-12-07T05:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21ca33d08c41951e28695b976abaddf7d9836270", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTyzfeOBw4R2D7cU.TkIhFON0ZBABF2vB0kpcilS0AZUfu8Jz2edZz4moqfHAijlQNf8zvbJKWL4J5w4s_ogKaDHV22UvnjesawP1jhOvjNs8mMtkzjJ3z", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Medical Biller/Coder", "text": "Billing/Coding Specialist Job Summary \nResponsible for entering and coding patient services into a computer system and generating invoices to be sent to the patient.
