Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "catherine luceyassociat", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:22.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "065bbc5619e3c1035f613fc8d42dd29d6caea4c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8beC.TyhjmMo_.nG5witIP1u0MWhT60t4._.DVe293Yeejcp1lKbqGY1jiLMZduGvgVTXQSRscPmhvT7hxxVE2GOABdoLZ1YdhreKwOG94L4d00rHE0lZQLm_kTrfPbTA-", "site_full": "www.wmcactionnews5.com", "site": "wmcactionnews5.com", "site_section": "http://www.wmctv.com/category/13533/news?clienttype=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WMC Action News 5 - International - Headline", "title": "Turkey's Erdogan heads to Athens for official Greece visit", "title_full": "Turkey's Erdogan heads to Athens for official Greece visit", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.worldnow.com/AP/images/15576307_G.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 44849, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "065bbc5619e3c1035f613fc8d42dd29d6caea4c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8beC.TyhjmMo_.nG5witIP1u0MWhT60t4._.DVe293Yeejcp1lKbqGY1jiLMZduGvgVTXQSRscPmhvT7hxxVE2GOABdoLZ1YdhreKwOG94L4d00rHE0lZQLm_kTrfPbTA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Turkey's Erdogan heads to Athens for official Greece visit", "text": "Turkey's Erdogan heads to Athens for official Greece visit 2017-12-07T08:50:38Z 2017-12-07T08:52:34Z (Kayhan Ozer/Pool Photo via AP, file).

Social Democratic Party, SPD, chairman Martin Schulz addresses the media during a news conference after a board meeting at the party's headquarter in Berlin, Germany, Monday, Dec. 4, 2017. \nBERLIN (AP) - Germany's center-left Social Democrats are discussing Thursday whether to open talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on extending their governing coalition, or at least backing a minority government. \nThe Social Democrats' leadership insisted the party would go into opposition after a disastrous election result in September. It reinforced its refusal to join a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. \nHowever, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear that he doesn't want a new election, and Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz reversed course. \nAt a previously scheduled party congress Thursday, Schulz is seeking members' approval for a resolution approving talks on \"whether and in what form\" the Social Democrats can support a new government. \nHowever, some members - including the party's youth wing - want to specifically rule out another coalition, leaving only a minority government or a new election as options. Merkel has said she is \"very skeptical\" about leading a minority government, which hasn't yet been tried in post-World War II Germany. \nSocial Democrat parliamentary group chief Andrea Nahles said the collapse of Merkel's talks with other parties produced an unexpected new situation. \n\"We can't play the ostrich and stick our heads in the sand,\" she said. \nThe Social Democrats have been part of Germany's government for 15 of the past 19 years - first leading a center-left government under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder from 1998 to 2005, then twice governing in a \"grand coalition\" under Merkel, from 2005 to 2009 and again from 2013 until now. \nThe party suffered historically poor election results after both Merkel coalitions, with support slumping to a post-war low of 20.5 percent in September.

Former Russian Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev waits for a hearing at a court in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017. Ulyukayev who is on trial for allegedly taking a $2 million bribe is expected to deliver... \nBy NATALIYA VASILYEVAAssociated Press \nMOSCOW (AP) - Wrapping up one of Russia's most high-profile trials of the year, a former economic development minister charged with bribery on Thursday accused an oil executive of setting him up and apologized for \"turning back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nAlexei Ulyukayev, the highest-ranking Russian official to be arrested since 1993, was detained last year at the headquarters of Russia's largest oil producer, the state-owned Rosneft, after a sting operation by Russia's main intelligence agency. Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared - what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" \nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you're doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nUlyukayev asked for \"people's\" forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \"defending people's interests.\" \nThe court is expected to deliver the verdict next week.

Palestinians play cards during U.S. President Donald Trump's televised speech in the West Bank City of Nablus, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. Defying dire, worldwide warnings, President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke with decades ... \nJERUSALEM (AP) - The Latest on the fallout from President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital (all times local): \n11:35 a.m. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says President Donald Trump \"bound himself forever\" to the history of Jerusalem by recognizing the city as Israel's capital. \nNetanyahu claimed other states are considering following the U.S. lead and recognizing Jerusalem. He spoke on Thursday at the Foreign Ministry. \nNetanyahu says that \"we are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition.\" \nHe says the \"time has come\" and expressed confidence that others will follow suit and move their embassies to Jerusalem. \nMeanwhile, the Israeli military said it will be deploying additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when mass Palestinian protests are anticipated in response to Trump's move. \nThe army statement on Thursday says it will deploy several battalions to the territory while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" \nPalestinians went on strike across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip on Thursday and protests are expected on Friday after midday prayers. \n___ \n11:25 a.m. \nThe top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas is calling for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nIsmail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip on Thursday and called the U.S. decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries.\" \nHe says the uprising should begin Friday, the Muslim holy day. \nHaniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nHamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \n___ \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.

The model and university student denies any intent to insult. \nTurkish media reported that the tweet, which has since been erased, said: \"I got my period on the morning of the July 15 martyrs' day. I'm marking the day by bleeding as a representation of the martyrs' blood.\" \nThe posting caused uproar on social media. \nA court must accept the indictment before a trial date is set. \nRunner-up Asli Sumen was given the title and represented Turkey at the Miss World competition in China.

Col. Deo Akiiki, deputy spokesman for the Ugandan military, said Thursday that 281 troops will leave Somalia by Dec. 31. \nAkiiki said that under an agreement between the African Union and the U.N. Security Council the number of all African peacekeepers in Somalia will be reduced by 1,000 before the end of 2017. \nUganda has over 6,000 troops deployed in Somalia as part of the multi-national African Union force. Other African countries such as Burundi and Kenya also contribute to the regional force. \nThe Western-backed deployments have helped to push Islamic extremists out of Somalia's capital and other centers, even though the rebels still make frequent bombing attacks targeting public places.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

I will transform the battered into a company of the elite. I will make a strong nation out of the long lost, A showcase exhibit of God \u2019s rule in action, as I rule from Mount Zion, from here to eternity. \u201cAnd you stragglers around Jerusalem, eking out a living in shantytowns: The glory that once was will be again. Jerusalem\u2019s daughter will be the kingdom center.\u201d So why the doomsday hysterics? You still have a king, don\u2019t you? But maybe he\u2019s not doing his job and you\u2019re panicked like a woman in labor. Well, go ahead\u2014twist and scream, Daughter Jerusalem. You are like a woman in childbirth. You\u2019ll soon be out of the city, on your way and camping in the open country. And then you\u2019ll arrive in Babylon. What you lost in Jerusalem will be found in Babylon. God will give you new life again. He\u2019ll redeem you from your enemies. But for right now, they\u2019re ganged up against you, many godless peoples, saying, \u201cKick her when she\u2019s down! Violate her! We want to see Zion grovel in the dirt.\u201d These blasphemers have no idea what God is thinking and doing in this. They don\u2019t know that this is the making of God \u2019s people, that they are wheat being threshed, gold being refined. On your feet, Daughter of Zion! Be threshed of chaff, be refined of dross. I\u2019m remaking you into a people invincible, into God\u2019s juggernaut to crush the godless peoples. You\u2019ll bring their plunder as holy offerings to God , their wealth to the Master of the earth. Yowza. These prophets don\u2019t pussy-foot around, do they? They tell it like it is and like it will be and sometimes, it is hard to read. But here and there, like beautiful bread crumbs, there are phrases, ideas, hope . That was one of the jobs of the prophets, you know \u2014 to be harbingers of hope to God\u2019s people in times of devastation and loss. Yes, they also brought plenty of bad news and the despair that accompanies such news. But woven throughout, there are words of life and of promise. The truth is, we don\u2019t know what God is up to when things are looking bleak. We cannot see the ways in which the painful circumstances of today will be redeemed as gifts tomorrow. And yet that is what happens. . . eventually. We may not live to see that redemption. I frequently need to remind myself that there is a 400+ year gap between the OT prophets and the great good-news-gift of the gospel. There IS a big picture, a very long through line. That\u2019s what we need to grab hold of when times are tough. Look for the seeds. Look for the seeds. Lord, make me a seed-finder, please? Some days, hanging onto hope is tougher than others. But hope is there. It is always there! Advent waiting reminds us of that powerful truth \u2014 so . . . help us to hang on.

As Bitcoin\u2019s value continues to climb, Satoshi Nakamoto could very well become the world\u2019s richest person \u2013 but could they effectively remain anonymous? \nBitcoin has yet a turbulent \u2013 yet profitable \u2013 2017. Between navigating hard forks, regulatory pressure, and parabolic price gains, the digital currency continues to weather the storm \u2013 and sitting silently at its epicenter is its elusive and illusory founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. \nSince releasing the original white paper that first detailed Bitcoin and the Blockchain in 2008, the person behind the moniker (or name) Satoshi Nakamoto has sat on a fortune of some 1,04 million bitcoins \u2013 at the time of writing, that amounts to an untapped fortune of some $15,042,565,200 USD. \nRead: Up to four million Bitcoins could already be gone forever \nTo say Bitcoin has defied all expectation in 2017 is an understatement; fighting off turbulence thanks to the harsh stance of Chinese regulators, the digital currency has continued to push new boundaries in successively shorter lengths of time. And, as Bitcoin\u2019s worth increases, so too does Nakamoto\u2019s. \nShould Bitcoin reach the $100k USD mark in the near future \u2013 and Nakamoto refrains from interfering with their stockpile of 1,04 million Bitcoins \u2013 the anonymous author could approach a net worth of some $100 billion USD; surpassing the estimated net worth of juggernauts such as Jeff Bezos, nevermind that of Mark Zuckerberg nor Bill Gates. With #Bitcoin beyond 14k, the net worth of Satoshi Nakamoto is higher than 14b. Forbes missed him on the world\u2019s billionaires list. pic.twitter.com/GFqP1gVzrZ \n\u2014 CryptoDetective (@chengwei88) December 7, 2017 \nThat would effectively mean that the richest person in the world is an anonymous author whose identity, image, or personality has never been revealed \u2013 and, essentially, the only insurance Nakamoto would effectively have over the disclosure of their identity would be to leave their wealth untouched. \nFor Nakamoto \u2013 so long as he, she, or they are alive \u2013 the game\u2019s objective could be quite simple; wait for as long as need be for Bitcoin to become an accepted means of exchange or unit of account, and then reign as the anonymous holder of the largest bag of money in the proverbial room. \nThat is, however, if purchase histories, investments, or other factors do not reveal Nakamoto\u2019s identity before then. And while no-one has been able to conclusively crack the riddle of just who Nakamoto is, new developments in the future may provide that investigation with new impetus. An identity worth more than money \nNakamoto\u2019s influence isn\u2019t necessarily restricted to his immense wealth in fiat currency. As the holder of the largest Bitcoin portfolio in existence, whoever is indeed Satoshi Nakamoto holds not only the reasons behind Bitcoin\u2019s creation, but further the most (potentially) significant sway over its development. \nUntil today, Nakamoto has reigned as somewhat of a silent guardian over Bitcoin; a force that effectively could bring the digital currency to a crashing halt by initiating a coin dump on a scale that cryptocurrency investors have never seen before. And while that move has never been seen as prudent or necessary, growing pains continue to ache as Bitcoin establishes itself in the mind of institutions and market players as the new gold. \nThat\u2019s especially noteworthy given some of the trials Bitcoin has experienced this year; December 10th and 18th will mark an important occasion as large institutional players begin to offer Futures contracts , and the digital currency\u2019s ability to scale continues to divide its community. \nBitcoin Cash (or BCash, depending which side of the spectrum you\u2019re on) continues to haunt the Bitcoin community; as the number of investors and trading increases, so does the need for the Bitcoin network to scale; and debates have erupted on more than one front this year. \nWhile Bitcoin Cash remains somewhat of a fringe threat in the wake of Bitcoin\u2019s massive surge across the $14k barrier, the premise behind the coin offers a worrying dose of reality as Bitcoin continues to make further strides into mainstream markets. While community consensus paves the way forward (or apart), for how long can Bitcoin remain explicitly aligned with Nakamoto\u2019s vision? How does Bitcoin live up to the original goals of its creators, as a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d- Great report by Paul Coletti on @bbcworldservice https://t.co/AfituaqVYF #Bitcoin #BTC #SatoshiNakamoto #cryptocurrency pic.twitter.com/Rmb3hD7jC6 \n\u2014 Am\u00e9lie Arras (@AmelieArras) December 5, 2017 \nThe only arbiter of that fact may well be Nakamoto themselves, who essentially not only holds the keys to the kingdom, but further the fuse of a time bomb.

But it turns out that fans might not be the only people eager to see the X-Men enter the MCU. Kevin Feige is reportedly eager, too. A new report form Deadline discussing what a combined Disney-Fox powerhouse might look like specifically asked how the Fox film a.ssets might fit within Disney's culture and revealed that, when it comes to the popular X-Men Universe, Marvel Studios president Feige is reportedly eager to get his hands on the property and bring them into the MCU. As the report notes, Fox has several Marvel projects in the pipeline, including Deadpool 2, New Mutants, Dark Phoenix, Gambit, X-Force, as well as Multiple Man. With Feige's track record of success with superhero movies as well as the success of Marvel Studio's partnership with Sony on Spider-Man: Homecoming, Feige would have a huge opportunity to \"cross-pollinate\" the existing Marvel franchise heroes with the vast offerings of the X-Men world. Considering that Feige is responsible four of the 15 top grossing films of all time, it could be very lucrative for Disney. Rumors of the Disney/Fox deal first began circulating in early November and, at the time, negotiations had stalled out. But later reports surfaced that the negotiations were back on with Fox favoring Disney over other potential buyers. The a.ssets Disney is seeking to purchase are valued at as much as $67 billion with Disney's interest in Fox said to be largely influenced by wanting to regain film rights to all of the Marvel Comics characters. The rights to X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Deadpool are all currently held by 20th Century Fox.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kevin feige", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "feige", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "universe marvel studios", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "interview marvel studios", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deadpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "disney-fox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marvel cinematic universe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marvel studios", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marvel studio", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:23.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "47054bf0381c5ec23e897aa3c547c8fa8a66e77b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPZYf21NjBoZB8rWF2n.pzdn.bOzLeerf62rKK49OEG.8ougk5XmocpzS26Rd574P656j5KazA8jOq_I3e1RKWz29rbXqgZag2xlH6QI4e1I7Mss2mk9.ZnY-", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g293933-i9346-Azerbaijan.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Azerbaijan Forum, Travel Discussion for Azerbaijan - TripAdvisor", "title": "Planning to travel in mid Jan 2018 -", "title_full": "Planning to travel in mid Jan 2018 - Baku Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-06T22:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78e5b673dad99f420b21ebe31fa1da9ea0ddaf47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPZYf21NjBoZB8rWF2n.pzdn.bOzLeerf62rKK49OEG.8ougk5XmocpzS26Rd574P656j5KazA8jOq_I3e1RKWz29rbXqgZag2xlH6QI4e1I7IHcm.RfC2DP0hYVPRxom_w--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "R_Haciyev", "published": "2017-12-07T10:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It depends on cuisine.Avoid street food, order national dishes in cafes and restaurants, especially kebabs,dolma,grill and so on.

Photo: No orange-bellied parrots have been seen in Canunda National Park since 2001. (Flickr.com: John Clarke) Winter movements still puzzling \nThe parrots breed in only one location, in the far south-west of Tasmania, and migrate across the Bass Strait every year. \nWhat puzzles researchers and conservationists like Mr Green is where they spend their winters. \n\"Winter has always been the problem. Even when there were bigger numbers, we never found the majority of the population,\" he said. \n\"Going back 20-30 years ago, it was thought that about 30 per cent of the population came into South Australia. \n\"This bird could have been a bird that was migrating southwards back to Tasmania.\" \nWhile there have been no recorded sightings of the birds in Canunda National Park since 2001, Mr Green said it was possible they had been using the area unseen. \n\"It's one if those areas that we do search but you can't search it 100 per cent,\" he said. \n\"And it's a small bird \u2014 it's only slightly larger than a budgie \u2014 so it is really a case of looking for a needle in a haystack.\" \nOnly sixteen wild birds, 13 males and three females, have returned to the breeding grounds in Tasmania so far this season. \nA further 23 birds released from the captive population are helping to bolster numbers. Photo: Captive breeding programs are underway to try to bolster wild populations. (Supplied: Mark Holdsworth and Friends of the OBP) Ranger's report promising \nMr Green said a decision to accept or reject the sighting would be made in the next few days, once he had assessed all details in the report, including the bird's colour, call and behaviour. \n\"It may be the case that we can't rule it out but we can't 100 per cent accept it because \u2026 there may not be quite enough features to say it definitely was one,\" he said. \n\"Hopefully we can. We'll just wait and see. \n\"At this stage the report looks extremely promising.\" \nIf confirmed, the sighting will be added to a national database which is being used to map the birds' habitat at different times of the year. \nBirdlife Australia's Sean Dooley said the sighting highlighted the importance of preserving coastal habitat for the birds to move through. \n\"They're copping a death by a thousand cuts right across the country,\" he said. \n\"They've got so much going against them that every little bit that we protect is just trying to tip the balance towards them. \n\"It might not seem like much but every little bit does help.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john clarke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark holdsworth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean dooley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "port macdonnell", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canunda national park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "millicent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tasmania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bass strait", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:23.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "30b3c246db8ea51eee32d16cf4091ba18493a808", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6m5_DJ5Wv6RdXp9Qi0xfHiKw0L.4vQqDpuU6KK_G12HpG_X2StIQ4MTGx3aYmc8nLcdkk5og.mMh1AejgHMGFzkJM6G4kwLmSCMrNz030SrllI96etBpF.JW24UDR.NU-", "site_full": "www.longroom.com", "site": "longroom.com", "site_section": "https://longroom.com/discussions/feed.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Long Room", "title": "In year of chaos, Trump\u2019s boost to economy can\u2019t be denied", "title_full": "In year of chaos, Trump\u2019s boost to economy can\u2019t be denied", "published": "2017-12-07T11:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/trump9.jpg?quality=90&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1200", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "30b3c246db8ea51eee32d16cf4091ba18493a808", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6m5_DJ5Wv6RdXp9Qi0xfHiKw0L.4vQqDpuU6KK_G12HpG_X2StIQ4MTGx3aYmc8nLcdkk5og.mMh1AejgHMGFzkJM6G4kwLmSCMrNz030SrllI96etBpF.JW24UDR.NU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "stefania", "published": "2017-12-07T11:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "In year of chaos, Trump\u2019s boost to economy can\u2019t be denied", "text": "in General President Trump has an ace in the hole that his opponents are forgetting.

Honda has restructured its under-performing Formula One operations after the split from McLaren, with Yusuke Hasegawa to stand down as head of the Japanese company's F1 project at the end of the year.\nHonda, starting a new partnership with Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso from January, said in a statement on Thursday that Hasegawa's position would be split into two separate functions.\nToyoharu Tanabe, an experienced Formula One veteran who worked as race engineer to Austrian Gerhard Berger at McLaren in the early 1990s, had been appointed as F1 technical director.\nTanabe, who was also chief engineer to Britain 's Jenson Button at BAR and Honda Racing between 2003 and 2007, will run operations at the racetrack and in testing.\nAn operating officer, yet to be named, will take charge of research and development at Sakura in Japan while Hasegawa remains executive chief engineer.\n\"By separating these areas of responsibility, we will evolve our structure so that both the development team and racing/testing team can assume their respective responsibilities more speedily,\" said Honda's brand and communications head Katsuhide Moriyama.\nHonda and McLaren split after the 2017 season that ended last month, bringing down the curtain on three painful years that saw the former world champions suffer their worst ever slump.\nMcLaren, who had a dominant partnership with Honda in the late 1980s and early 1990s, last won a race in 2012 and this year finished ninth of the 10 teams with just 30 points -- 638 fewer than champions Mercedes.\nTheir time together was beset with poor reliability and a lack of performance from a Honda engine struggling to compete with rivals.\nMcLaren, who have Spain 's double world champion Fernando Alonso along with Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne as their drivers, will have Renault power next season. Toro Rosso have New Zealander Brendon Hartley and France's Pierre Gasly.\n\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin; Editing by John O'Brien)\n(This story has not been edited by economictimes.com and is auto\u2013generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.) 0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gerhard berger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hasegawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tanabe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john o'brien", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan baldwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fernando alonso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yusuke hasegawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stoffel vandoorne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pierre gasly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toyoharu tanabe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealander brendon hartley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toro rosso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mclaren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katsuhide moriyama", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "honda", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "renault", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mclaren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sakura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:24.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc2d69f3249982014f877007b328a3d4b0c05335", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOppUG2mIohaTjtjFiCqDo33ej7RAnJJzcCjil8rq8UcsD81eFiqZT52LsmYKjyzl0EcFOE.JJCCXYJWeeIHjWs7", "site_full": "stamplorations.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://stamplorations.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "STAMPlorations\u00e2\u201e\u02d8 Blog", "title": "December Challenge - Theme and Sketch", "title_full": "December Challenge - Theme and Sketch", "published": "2017-12-01T16:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c69e82ba780112fbf12644c65c753e622ef4f2ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOppUG2mIohaTjtjFiCqDo33ej7RAnJJzcCjil8rq8UcsD81eFiqZT52LsmYKjyzl0EcFOE.JJCCXYUDVnrlHZ0Q64_NHcg8mHA-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "nancy littrell", "published": "2017-12-07T04:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I love your artsy watercolored background for your beautifully colored flower pot and flowers.

The book follows the non-linear life of Billy Pilgrim, a young soldier haunted by surviving the bombing of Dresden in World War II, who finds himself unstuck from time and experiencing his life out of order (and, on top of all that, an alien abduction). \nBut in press releases announcing the series, Macmanus said the Slaughterhouse-Five show will not just follow Billy's jumbled-up life but expand upon and explore the world of Vonnegut's novel, padding out the relatively brisk story into the scope of a TV series: \nThere are no lines that Vonnegut ever throws away. But there are certain lines within the book that allude to a much larger world. I'm not just talking about going off into outer space.

The input string can include other text. Write a function that returns either `true` if the brackets in the input string are balanced or `false` if they are not. Balanced means that any opening bracket of a particular type must also have a closing bracket of the same type.\n\nAn empty input string or a string without brackets can also be considered \"balanced\".\n\n# Examples\n\n```js\nhasBalancedBrackets('[][(){}'); // false\nhasBalancedBrackets('({)}'); // false\nhasBalancedBrackets('({[]})'); // true\nhasBalancedBrackets('text ( is allowed ){rwwrwrrww [] ()}'); // true\n```\n\n# Solutions\n\nIn general an optimal approach is to keep a *stack* of open brackets, pushing as we come across them.

If our stack is empty once we reach the end of the string, then our brackets must have been balanced.\n\nHere's a solid solution:\n\n```js\nconst bracketPattern = /[[\\](){}]/g;\nconst bracketPairs = { //keeps track of the possible bracket pairings\n  '[' : ']',\n  '(' : ')',\n  '{' : '}'\n};\nfunction hasBalancedBrackets (inputString) {\n  const inputBrackets = inputString.match(bracketPattern); // returns an array of all the brackets in the input\n  const brackets = [];\n  if (!inputString.length || !inputBrackets.length) {\n    return true; // empty input or no brackets i.e. 'balanced' (throwing an error is fine also)\n  }\n  inputBrackets.forEach(function (bracket) {\n    const lastBracket = brackets[brackets.length - 1];\n    if (bracketPairs[lastBracket] === bracket) { // the current bracket and the last bracket are a pair\n      brackets.pop(); // we found a pair so remove the opening bracket from the array and move on\n    } else {\n      brackets.push(bracket);\n    }\n  });\n  return brackets.length === 0; // if the brackets were balanced then we should not have any brackets in the array\n}\n```\n\nA more optimal solution would cut out early if it comes across a closing bracket that does not match the most recent open bracket. That could look something like:\n\n```js\nconst opens = {};\nconst closes = {};\n([\n  ['{', '}'],\n  ['[', ']'],\n  ['(', ')'],\n]).forEach(([open, close]) => {\n  opens[open] = close;\n  closes[close] = open;\n});\n\nfunction hasBalancedBrackets (str) {\n  const opensStack = [];\n  for (const ch of str) {\n    if (opens.hasOwnProperty(ch)) {\n      opensStack.push(ch);\n    } else if (closes.hasOwnProperty(ch)) {\n      const mostRecentOpen = opensStack.pop();\n      const correspondingClose = opens[mostRecentOpen];\n      if (ch !== correspondingClose) return false;\n    }\n  }\n  return opensStack.length === 0;\n}\n```", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:25.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a40eb76d1ceadc5a7566bade2a83931c0b653e65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTTdSx_PvQrqezCFWWJDMUS9lk0sdIQMfe0tx0eJIwrITmFC4hWuOwZsO1PkMhBU100UE5rCI1jRVIvrGtvm663zG43gzhgDm3AT51sSjHhPCd_pgLIKsG2drxayE7KMoTn2cnSzCPVJL5jUiSGXKnzKXtpXzA1Fw-", "site_full": "blog.us.playstation.com", "site": "playstation.com", "site_section": "http://blog.us.playstation.com/tag/ps-vr-2/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "ps vr \u2013 PlayStation.Blog", "title": "Tis the Season to Play: New December Deals for PS4 Pro and PlayStation Systems", "title_full": "Tis the Season to Play: New December Deals for PS4 Pro and PlayStation VR Systems \u2013 PlayStation.Blog", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.blog.playstation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tistheseason.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 444, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9cdb67959174246b5a6dbc930ab3d739d6682b29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTTdSx_PvQrqezCFWWJDMUS9lk0sdIQMfe0tx0eJIwrITmFC4hWuOwZsO1PkMhBU100UE5rCI1jRVIvrGtvm663zG43gzhgDm3AT51sSjHhPCd_pgLIKsG2drxayE7KMoTn2cnSzCPVJL5jUiSGXKn56Tzf9F.hdYOdPRyH_UeHg0Xlr30Ml5.", "ord_in_thread": 24, "author": "AhmedHosny74", "published": "2017-12-07T07:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Ok\nWhere can I buy this online?\nWhere is the link for online shopping?\nAnd is it restricted to certain countries?

The ability of biochar to improve the fertility of soil and enhance the growth of plants has surfaced as the main factor behind the growth of this market. Currently, synthetic and several other bio-based fertilizers are dominating the agricultural scenario, globally. However, the awareness about the benefits of biochar is spreading gradually among farmers and agriculturists, thereby, creating massive opportunities for further growth of this market in the coming years. The global market for biochar includes both organized and unorganized manufacturers of biochar. Emerging countries, such as Japan, Brazil, China, and Mexico report of a prominent amount of biochar production from the unorganized sector, primarily manufactured by villagers in association with research institutes and various non-governmental support groups. However, the number of the organized players is anticipated to increase substantially in these countries over the next few years, thanks to the escalating demand for organic food, worldwide. Request Sample Copy of the Report @ https://www.tmrresearch.com/sample/sample?flag=B&rep_id=1703 The full potential of biochar is yet to be realized in the agricultural sector and is projected to surface as a particularly important factor in the overall progression of the food sector in the near future. Water treatment is projected to emerge as an important application area of biochar in the years to come, especially in developing economies. Global Biochar Market: Overview Biochar is a time-honored soil amendment practice and also a fine solution to climate change effects. Regions with insufficient supply of chemical fertilizers, organic resources, and water can significantly benefit from this highly porous and fine-grained charcoal. Along with bioenergy, it can displace fossil fuel usage and sequester carbon in well-balanced soil carbon pools to tackle climate change. Biochar has won worldwide appreciation for its unique soil enhancing properties with the widespread prominence of the Amazon\u2019s biochar-rich dark lands. Request TOC of the Report @ https://www.tmrresearch.com/sample/sample?flag=T&rep_id= 1 703 Global Biochar Market: Key Trends With a substantial rise in population size, organic food has drew in a lot of demand, owing to which the biochar market is expected to invite a handsome growth. The credit for this growth could be given to biochar\u2019s propensity for improving plant development and soil fertility. The improving agricultural industry in different nations such as Australia, Germany, Canada, and the U.S. is anticipated to aggravate the demand for biochar. As a result, the global market is predicted to record a healthy growth over the coming years. Large-scale gasification projects receiving support from Europe and North America governments and the increasing performance of organic farming are projected to put the world biochar market is a good position. The rise in meat consumption and growing significance of biochar in livestock farming benefiting with key nutrients are forecasted to set the tone for the market. Read Comprehensive Overview of Report@ https://www.tmrresearch.com/biochar-market The growth in the global biochar market could be impeded on account of technological and financial barriers. Besides this, the ignorance of consumers on the part of biochar\u2019s long-term advantages is foretold to delay the market growth. Howbeit, a considerable expansion of the market is expected to occur as organic food and farming open up new opportunities. Global Biochar Market: Market Potential Biochar possesses a massive potential to reduce the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, in fact, virtually every greenhouse emission. This could be an epic breakthrough in the elimination of climate-warming black carbon. Capable of enduring the test of time for survival, this super charcoal can sequester carbon dioxide many times longer than trees. For producers which operate in areas where labor cost is economical but maintenance expenditure is large, biochar production could be ideal. This is because of the simple and low-priced equipment required to convert soy hay and other wastes into biochar. In a way, the biochar market is deemed to be a great medium to minimize the gap between smart business and smart environmentalism. Global Biochar Market: Regional Outlook The biochar sector is envisaged to be developed at a telling rate on the back of regions such as Europe and North America, registering an elevating rise in the count of small and medium scale manufacturers. A steady progress is foreseen to be witnessed by Australia as the awareness about the advantages and benefits of biochar escalates across the country. Followed by Europe, North America is prognosticated to record a dominant share in the global biochar market. Producers of biochar can also find opportunities in other markets such as Asia Pacific and Rest of the World. Global Biochar Market: Competitive Landscape Players in the biochar market receive support from companies supplying pyrolysis technology and wood pellets and residue. Phoenix Energy, Cool Planet Energy Systems Inc., Pacific Pyrolysis, and 3R ENVIRO TECH Group are some of the top firms involved in the pyrolysis technology business. Wood pellets and residue are primarily provided by timber businesses such as West Fraser, Georgia-Pacific, and Weyerhaeuser. Out of the prominent biochar players in the international market, Biochar Supreme, LLC is prophesied to make the cut. The analysts anticipate the market to own a fragmented character.

Yet they have the audacity to come and advise us to forget and move on.\" \nHe spoke outside a morgue in the capital Nairobi while accompanying families collecting bodies of the police's alleged victims. \nA U.S. Embassy statement Wednesday called Odinga's planned protest event on Dec. 12 \"extra-constitutional\" and urged him to cancel the event. \nOdinga successfully challenged Kenyatta's August re-election but then boycotted a rerun vote in October, demanding electoral reforms. Kenyatta was inaugurated last week. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

I haven't really got enough to be concerned about it yet, I was just doing a test run to see if I could get the hang of it before I acrued an amount worth worrying about.\nActually, BX support just put me in the picture regarding my Electrum problem, turned out it was my fault for not reading the small print. I transferred 0.001 BTC and 0.0005 turned up in my wallet. Turns out the other 0.0005 was BX's fee. 5 bucks does seem a lot for a tranfer fee, but there it is, I learned something which was the object of the exercise.\nOne thing that did come out of this though is that Electrum has terrible customer support. I couldn't find a link despite scouring the web. If I'd been worried about a lot of coins it could have been incredibly stressful. BX's support on the other hand is wonderful.
