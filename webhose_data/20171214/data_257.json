People say I'm ferocious. Wild. Dangerous. They're right. That's why I live on an island alone. The jungle is my home. My personal prison. Until she arrived. The moment her helicopter crashed on my land, everything changed. She's the only survivor ... And I'm keeping her locked up in a pit. It's been too long since I last touched a woman, especially one so beautiful. It makes me hunger for her. I want her ... So I'll keep her ... And I'll make her mine. LOCKED is a full length standalone, complete at 70000 words. No Cliffhanger. Bonus content included. \"A fast pace story full of adventure and heat .\" - Mary's Goodreads Review \"I ADORED Lock. He is all kinds of wild and savage \" - Books N Wine Blog \" Exciting, sexy and fun to read.\" - Lorrie's Goodreads Review \" A beautiful, compassionate story full of forgiveness.\" - Claudia's Goodreads Review \"It was like a modern day Tarzan , and he was one sexy jungle man!\" - Shelli's Goodreads Review \"He was hot. He was alpha. He was hung like a horse. \" - Between The Bookends He nods again and points at the shower. \u201cGo on then.\u201d \u201cWhat? Now?\u201d I say, looking down at myself. I\u2019m still dressed. \u201cI don\u2019t want my clothes to get wet.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cThen take them off.\u201d My lips part, but I have no idea how to respond. All I can do is stare in amazement. Did he actually just tell me to take off my clothes? \u201cWhat?\u201d I repeat, for clarification. \u201cTake \u2019em off.\u201d He\u2019s serious. He\u2019s dead serious, and that stern stare almost makes me want to do it. But no, my morals have to get in the way again. \u201cNo,\u201d I say, folding my arms. \u201cI\u2019m not going nude \u2026\u201d He frowns and shrugs again. \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d He seems genuinely disappointed as he turns back around again. As if he\u2019s upset that I won\u2019t try his makeshift shower even though I want to. I just can\u2019t \u2026 not when he\u2019s watching. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I say. He stops in his tracks and glances over his shoulder, waiting for more. \u201cBut you can\u2019t watch,\u201d I add. His shoulders rise and fall, and he gives me a quick nod. \u201cI\u2019ll be down there.\u201d He points at the small lake. \u201cIf you need me.\u201d \u201cYeah \u2026\u201d Wait, do I need him? No. Maybe. Fuck. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know anything anymore. I peek at the shower, but my eyes still revert to him. And they stay there \u2026 glued \u2026 because he\u2019s untying the rope around his waist. And the banana leaves drop to the ground. My eyes widen. Butt naked and in its full glory. Cheeks squeezed together, thighs muscular and thick. And an enormous dick dangling between his legs. I struggle to keep my tongue inside \u2026 struggle to even breathe properly. Until he glances my way. In shock, I quickly dive behind the wood and grasp my chest. As if that will help me from having a heart attack after being caught staring at a naked man. And what a man he is \u2026 Wow. I still can\u2019t get that image out of my mind, and I don\u2019t even wanna try. All I can do is grin as I start undressing, wishing I wasn\u2019t so easily persuaded to ogle a man because of his dick. But Jesus Christ \u2026 that dick. a Rafflecopter giveaway Clarissa Wild is a New York Times & USA Today Bestselling author, best known for the dark Romance novel Mr. X.

The property, which was owned by 1801 Nagel Road LLC, was sold to Vereit Real Estate, in Phoenix. \nThe sale is the largest transfer of the year in Lorain County. It\u2019s so big, in fact, that it has some questioning whether it was a mistake. \n\u201cWith that $17 million number, we\u2019re almost wondering if accidentally that was several deals rolled into one,\u201d Avon Planning Director Pam Fechter said. \u201cIt seems like a lot to pay for the property.\u201d \nSnodgrass, though, said it was no mistake. \n\u201cIt is for that specific parcel,\u201d Snodgrass said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any other specifics on the transaction itself. The title company came in and brought the papers for $17million.\u201d \nSnodgrass said the company also paid the required $70,756 conveyance fee for the transfer. He admits the price seems high. \n\u201cThe number was a little surprising, but a lot of numbers over in that area have been. We\u2019re seeing $200,000 to $300,000 for just an acre alone. It\u2019s a big number; there might be some other things to it. Certainly, the numbers seem, even for that area, a little bit higher than we\u2019d expect.\u201d \nSnodgrass said the transfer was a sale-lease-back agreement for the 4.5-acre property. \nFechter said the city hasn\u2019t heard of any other plans for the property. The Levin Furniture on the property opened in 2016. \nLast month, the Pittsburgh-based Levin Furniture was sold to Art Van Furniture, based in Michigan. \nContact Scott Mahoney at 329-7146 or smahoney@chroniclet.com.

I want to try to avoid adding another transformer in the chassis. You can create a latching relay with the addition of a single DPDT relay with a main AC rated coil (e.g. 115VAC coil) and another momentary button.\nWIRING:\nYou wire one momentary pushbutton (for \"ON\" operation) in series with the relay coil. When you push the button the relay will operate (let's call this \"ON\"). But when you release the button the relay will return to its original \"OFF\" position. To prevent the return to OFF what you do is wire both DPDT contacts to the AC mains (before either of the momentary buttons). One of these contact pairs is then wired in parallel with the momentary button that you used to turn on the relay. Once the relay contacts close (e.g. when you push the ON button), even if you release the ON momentary button there is still AC power applied to the coil and it will stay on. Forever! So you also need a way to turn it OFF again. This is where the second momentary button (let's call it the \"OFF\" button) comes in. This is inserted into the AC mains before any of the other connections. When you push the OFF button all AC power is removed, the relay returns to its OFF position, and you are back where you started.\nIf you can live with two buttons, one for ON and one for OFF, or even a momentary ON-OFF-ON(2) type button, you can create this type of control. Instead of the button (or switch) taking the stress of making and breaking the current, it is the relay that is doing that job and the button has very little current to switch. This means you can use just about any button that is rated for mains AC voltage.\nAnyway, it's kind of putting lipstick on a pig, but it'll work.\nP.S. This is for switching one pole of the mains that leads to your amplifiers. If you need to switch live and neutral, you will need to use a 3PDT relay.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&itemSeq=245972883&uq=636481469322986091"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd89827978c223793fdcfe18b8f2abc36d36d1ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.l0IjnpbQrU4.WTi3QY11oeC6PLmxr9S_sckagst.yDbYG8Y9I8n2ku_hgMcBc9zuUNojjOCxCa6.5ZXcVM.Q3tZel1TDUrYMG0.yNQr6Bs82pa8FqFk12WssRVS.OOWmEsomOKCPTew--", "site_full": "www.diyaudio.com", "site": "diyaudio.com", "site_section": "http://www.diyaudio.com/forums/power-supplies/", "site_categories": ["sci_fi_and_fantasy", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Power Supplies - diyAudio", "title": "On/Off switch using momentary push button - Page 2", "title_full": "On/Off switch using momentary push button - Page 2 - diyAudio", "published": "2017-12-06T07:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 28466, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad6fd8311437ecd5448f2f7225a16e1643daf74d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.l0IjnpbQrU4.WTi3QY11oeC6PLmxr9S_sckagst.yDbYG8Y9I8n2ku_hgMcBc9zuUNojjOCxCa6.5ZXcVM.Q3tZel1TDUrYMG0.yNQr6Bs82pa8FqFk12WssRVS.OOWnU.I9VEEchFhBKWrBf5Cgz", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "AndrewT", "published": "2017-12-06T03:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I think Digikey data shows the 12V is for the illumination only.\nThe SPDT switch is mechanical.

The 11 plants from seed are happy and healthy and ready to give up another 4 clones each. My attempt to clone and sex the first top cuts and do both at the same time didn't work out. only a couple have rooted and no sexy sexy yet. I attribute this to the cold nights in the flower room, and possibly the chilled floor.Only some smart thinking on the behalf of my helper saved them at all. now they are just shitty clones in the back of the clone area. However the proper attempt at cutting 4 clones per mom plant has been successful and pretty much all of them have rooted. So the mystery of the sex of the plants is still an ongoing concern, so I figure I will plant 4 plants per 4 gallon pot , put them right into flower and take up 3 grow spots with these plants to see what I got, this will be one of each parent. Then I will know what do do on my next clone cutting window in 2 weeks. About the OG plants ( the plants from seed), not much to say yet they are 2 months and a day old and haven't shown sex on their own in veg, and the poor things really want out of the one gallons. I guess the last thing to say is that when taking cuttings from all GB4 plants all of the cuts are really robust and hold up to abuse, keep their green really well even after 2 weeks of shit and abuse. When you actually take good care of them when cloning they clone really quick like under 10 days they had over 5 roots showing in a peat puck.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd89827978c223793fdcfe18b8f2abc36d36d1ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.l0IjnpbQrU4.WTi3QY11oeC6PLmxr9S_sckagst.yDbYG8Y9I8n2ku_hgMcBc9zuUNojjOCxCa6.5ZXcVM.Q3tZel1TDUrYMG0.yNQr6Bs82pa8FqFk12WssRVS.OOWmEsomOKCPTew--", "site_full": "www.diyaudio.com", "site": "diyaudio.com", "site_section": "http://www.diyaudio.com/forums/power-supplies/", "site_categories": ["sci_fi_and_fantasy", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Power Supplies - diyAudio", "title": "On/Off switch using momentary push button - Page 2", "title_full": "On/Off switch using momentary push button - Page 2 - diyAudio", "published": "2017-12-06T07:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 28466, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b95924c5f9f69b4d6b656367beff378621560d47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.l0IjnpbQrU4.WTi3QY11oeC6PLmxr9S_sckagst.yDbYG8Y9I8n2ku_hgMcBc9zuUNojjOCxCa6.5ZXcVM.Q3tZel1TDUrYMG0.yNQr6Bs82pa8FqFk12WssRVS.OOWnU.I9VEEchFnEgglmcwFt5", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Bobsone", "published": "2017-12-07T05:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi\nIf you are thinking about a flipflop option, there are a lot of these switch circuits and boards available online.\nI have made the following circuit to switch an ATX power supply and it works well.

If you suffer from dyslexia then it becomes necessary to find a dyslexia therapist Michigan . Depending on the severity of the problem, the symptoms may vary as well. Its important to get an early diagnosis and treat this illness effectively otherwise it will lead to many other problems in the future.\n\nThere are situations where individuals do not receive the necessary treatment because their illness is not diagnosed in an accurate manner. To ensure that the child gets proper treatment, he needs to undergo certain assessments in order to identify the real cause of this problem and its severity level as well.\n\nDyslexia has a number of varied symptoms and a couple of them include unable to rhyme letters and recognize them correctly. After reaching a certain age, children tend to do these things without any effort but when they struggle as compared to other children of their age, then you should think seriously about it. Further assessments should be made as soon as possible to find the root cause of this problem.\n\nA dyslexic also finds it very hard to copy things whether it is from a book or a writing board. For them, it is a stressful task and they tend to be disorganized with their writing skills. Their writing ability is poor as well as other skills and functional abilities. They tend to be a bit disorientated in doing these tasks.\n\nTheir level of intelligence is sometimes superior as compared to other children of their age but when they speak out or write, they struggle to find the correct words. This makes them less confident about themselves and they tend to hide somewhere in the background because they do not want to be in the lime light anymore. They think their condition will never improve and they won't be able to lead a normal life as others do.\n\nIf these symptoms are not treated and ignored then slowly gradually the child starts to feel embarrassed about himself and loses his confidence. He may not want to go to school anymore and loses interests in everything related to his studies. The reason why a child needs to be assessed is because its important to distinguish whether he is suffering from dyslexia or some other learning disability.\n\nProper treatment plan is only possible when the diagnosis is made at an early age. Full recovery can never be achieved but the severeness of the illness can be minimized provided the child receives full care and attention to deal with this issue in an accurate manner. He may struggles at first but afterwards he would learn how to cope with these issues in a manner that his learning abilities are no longer affected by it.\n\nIt is actually a life long condition and the individual who suffers from it needs to learn how to cope with it in a positive manner. The child's weaknesses can be minimized provided he undergoes proper treatment plan and it is ensured that he will receive proper care even afterwards.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are searching for information about a dyslexia therapist Michigan residents can come to our web pages today.

Appeals Court Judge Edward Greene appears Nov. 28, 2017, on Spectrum News' \"Capital Tonight.\" Comments \nAt least one veteran N.C. jurist expects a ruling other than 4-3 when the state Supreme Court decides a case pitting the Democratic governor against the Republican-led General Assembly. \n\u201cThey\u2019re going to look to try to resolve this so it doesn\u2019t come out 4-3 with party-affiliated votes,\u201d said Edward Greene, an appellate attorney who served for 16 years as a judge on the N.C. Court of Appeals before retiring in 2002. \u201cThey realize that the perception is not a good one to come out that way.\u201d \nGreene offered these comments last week when he appeared alongside this columnist as panelists on Spectrum News\u2019 \u201cCapital Tonight.\u201d The program focused on the upcoming Supreme Court ruling in Cooper v. Berger . \nGov. Roy Cooper wants the seven-member Supreme Court to rule that the legislature, including Senate leader Phil Berger, overstepped its constitutional bounds earlier this year. Legislators enacted a law merging state elections and ethics agencies under a new eight-member board. The bipartisan board would feature four Democrats and four Republicans. Cooper would appoint all eight members from lists provided by the two major political parties. \nUnder prior state law, the State Board of Elections consisted of five members. Three of the five members represented the political party of the sitting governor. Cooper\u2019s lawyers have argued that the new law violates his constitutional power to exercise control over the elections agency. \nThe governor has refused to make any appointments to the new board during the ongoing legal dispute. State elections staffers have operated without board oversight throughout this year. Unless the Supreme Court resolves the dispute soon, North Carolina could enter 2018 without a board constituted to deal with statewide election policy decisions and complaints. \nA three-judge Superior Court panel ruled against Cooper in October, but the governor and his supporters have expressed confidence that the Supreme Court will reverse course. \nSuch confidence could be tied to the fact that the state\u2019s highest court features four registered Democrats and three Republicans. Syndicated columnist Colin Campbell of the Insider State Government News Service recently suggested as much , labeling Cooper\u2019s view of the judiciary \u201cincredibly cynical.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s suggesting that judges will blindly follow their party regardless of what the laws, constitution, and legal precedent say,\u201d Campbell wrote. (Upon publication, Campbell later tweeted , a Cooper spokesman called him to say that the cited section of his column was \u201cinsane.\u201d) \nIf justices split 4-3 on a partisan basis in Cooper v. Berger , it would represent a relatively rare occurrence . The court has issued 4-3 rulings just six times in 51 cases this year. Only two of the cases pitted Democrats against Republicans. In contrast, 42 rulings \u2014 four out of every five \u2014 have been unanimous, and most disagreements have defied pure partisan analysis. \n\u201cThe bottom line is that there are no statistics that show party affiliation makes a difference in the North Carolina Supreme Court,\u201d Greene said on \u201cCapital Tonight.\u201d \nHe also cited his experience with the state\u2019s second-highest court, which had judges affiliated with both major parties. Greene served as a Democrat, winning his last re-election bid in a 1998 contest against Paul \u201cSkip\u201d Stam, who later served as Republican caucus leader in the N.C. House of Representatives and House speaker pro tem. \n\u201cI can attest that I never saw a vote that was taken where I thought that just because someone was a Democrat or just because someone was a Republican they voted a certain way,\u201d Greene said of his years on the bench. \nThis year\u2019s Supreme Court rulings tend to support Greene\u2019s description of appellate court business. \nJustice Michael Morgan\u2019s 2016 election switched the Supreme Court\u2019s partisan makeup from 4-3 favoring Republicans to 4-3 favoring Democrats. Yet just two of the nine splits in court rulings this year featured the four Democrats prevailing over the three Republicans. \nThe Democrat Morgan joined the three Republican justices in the majority for the year\u2019s first 4-3 ruling. All three Republicans have joined the majority in three other 2017 cases that split the court\u2019s Democrats. Seven of the year\u2019s nine split rulings have featured at least one Republican in the majority. \nThe Supreme Court is scheduled to release another batch of opinions Friday. It\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ll have anything to say about Cooper v. Berger . If not, we\u2019ll at least see more clues about the constantly shifting coalitions within the court that help resolve the state\u2019s thorniest legal and constitutional issues. \nMitch Kokai is senior political analyst for the John Locke Foundation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "phil berger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward greene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy cooper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch kokai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cooper", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c. court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state board of elections", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "superior court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north carolina supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "insider state government news service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c. house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john locke foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spectrum news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "n.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:01.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78a85bbf0a98a2626241390f99b1c2ec00512969", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9CU16VJXwrslJOzJxsIVWkVVkoq4BkxT6fe6eQ4mYH74UzunETCMXQuV3mGHvq.AHcRgn31GTjLWOZIh3i1xGZsl5vxWWnQ38lVgMflAoYA53bqVdpJQW9XDO6TgwrVsmgpqlE_GoLgxwZ0wVJH4wznIc1bNC0E6bCSTyID0iK2FxE12xBpPf6", "site_full": "www.hotfreelist.com", "site": "hotfreelist.com", "site_section": "http://www.hotfreelist.com/feed/posts", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "Hot Free List - Free Classified Ads  - Hot Free List - Free Classified Ads", "title": "Top Dot Net Training Institute|Aptech Malviya Nagar in Delhi (Malviya Nagar)", "title_full": "Top Dot Net Training Institute|Aptech Malviya Nagar in Delhi (Malviya Nagar)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 24438, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78a85bbf0a98a2626241390f99b1c2ec00512969", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9CU16VJXwrslJOzJxsIVWkVVkoq4BkxT6fe6eQ4mYH74UzunETCMXQuV3mGHvq.AHcRgn31GTjLWOZIh3i1xGZsl5vxWWnQ38lVgMflAoYA53bqVdpJQW9XDO6TgwrVsmgpqlE_GoLgxwZ0wVJH4wznIc1bNC0E6bCSTyID0iK2FxE12xBpPf6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Top Dot Net Training Institute|Aptech Malviya Nagar in Delhi (Malviya Nagar)", "text": "Top Dot Net Training Institute|Aptech Malviya Nagar in Delhi (Malviya Nagar, Asia,  22  23  22 Reply to : (Use contact form below) \nHaving the knowledge of .NET is very vital for every developer or a tester working in the software industry.

He was also allegedly involved in smuggling migrants.The second Albanian, 23, had close ties to the first suspect and to an Albanian criminal gang that trafficked migrants to the southern city of Foggia, investigators said. His Facebook page showed a picture of him wielding a pistol, according to investigators.A total 100 Islamic extremists have been expelled from Italy this year and 232 since January 1, 2015.

The idea of being in a world or situation that only exists through tech is unique, to say the least, and it's safe to assume that more businesses will use it when it becomes more fleshed out. In fact, it can have a potential role for online marketing companies as well. Before long, they might start to benefit from VR capabilities in different ways.\n\nWhen it comes to the roles of virtual reality for online marketing companies, the ability to create interest must be considered. For example, if you have a food product that hasn't been released yet, it would be advantageous to create interest as early as possible. This is where demos, or samplings, come into play. As reputable firms like fishbat will attest, these help create interest among potential buyers and increase the likelihood of sales.\n\nVirtual reality possesses the ability to inform people, too. It wouldn't be far-fetched for NASA, for instance, to use VR headsets in order to make people feel like they're in a spaceship or on another planet. This type of technology can be used to create the illusion that someone is at a location they aren't really standing in. Who's to say that this feature can't benefit marketing companies in the future?\n\nNew employees will be brought on, meaning that the importance of training will grow. To effectively train those that just started, a marketing company might want to use virtual reality. What this does, among other things, is place the newcomers in question in situations where they can learn skills for real life. They can better understand how to face problems and make decisions. Virtual reality has the ability to make this level of growth happen.\n\nAs you can see, there are quite a few ways that virtual reality can be used by those in the marketing industry. To say that this type of technology matters would be an understatement, especially as it continues to develop over the course of time. There may even come a time when we won't require headsets that we wear over our eyes. Until then, it'll be interesting to see how VR technology develops from this point forward.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nIf you would care for more details about online marketing services, go to fishbat now! \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arthur williams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "online marketing company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:01.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b81e25c5e91b5c50b7fc7ef9769fe215f3b3513", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5sREv7VYv7PmYWYGdCc.V_wuepHWNCZ.hkcc1W2gPm3OVK5UpQsyfcL.h5Uav512hD88c1EdGxrf", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Announcement on the listing of YOYOW currency on CEX.COM", "title_full": "Announcement on the listing of YOYOW currency on CEX.COM", "published": "2017-12-07T10:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8b81e25c5e91b5c50b7fc7ef9769fe215f3b3513", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5sREv7VYv7PmYWYGdCc.V_wuepHWNCZ.hkcc1W2gPm3OVK5UpQsyfcL.h5Uav512hD88c1EdGxrf", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2017-12-07T10:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "Announcement on the listing of YOYOW currency on CEX.COM", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:01.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e85287487662bc41d826a0a58c13259654be974", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQi9gXn_bDGqQCdGLcCv8JSY764qnSx_858yNmemgAoUX_qNV0FwgOsZT7v6KaYAJd1yGya4LVX.wwXGO81tmvD0W2P5O3vOlE1aAgdeV9q7Y4ayQgZ5.hrHtzRfyhnl2g-", "site_full": "www.telecompaper.com", "site": "telecompaper.com", "site_section": "http://www.telecompaper.com/syndication/rssMobile.aspx", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Telecompaper Mobile & Wireless", "title": "Orange Egypt runs karaoke competition with singer Elissa", "title_full": "Orange Egypt runs karaoke competition with singer Elissa", "published": "2017-12-07T10:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.telecompaper.com/images/telecompaper_facebook.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 73639, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e85287487662bc41d826a0a58c13259654be974", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQi9gXn_bDGqQCdGLcCv8JSY764qnSx_858yNmemgAoUX_qNV0FwgOsZT7v6KaYAJd1yGya4LVX.wwXGO81tmvD0W2P5O3vOlE1aAgdeV9q7Y4ayQgZ5.hrHtzRfyhnl2g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Orange Egypt runs karaoke competition with singer Elissa", "text": "Orange Egypt runs karaoke competition with singer Elissa   09:47 CET | News Orange Egypt has announced a cooperation with Lebanese singer Elissa and Arabic film and music production company Rotana.

Dealing with aging parents is something so many of us are dealing with and it\u2019s so easy to feel like you need to handle everything yourself. Here are some tips about when you should start thinking about bringing in some outside help. Four Signs It\u2019s Time to Ask for Outside Help \nLife is a precious and beautiful adventure, but as we age, it can become quite difficult, especially as we become responsible for the ones who were once responsible for us. The cycle of life is phenomenal, and reaching old age is a blessing. Aging gracefully is a duty of care that we owe to ourselves. However, if we are ever fortunate enough to live longer than our flesh and bones can bear, it is those we love most, and those we nurtured, that can make life bearable and bring us comfort. \nUnfortunately, aging adults might fail to appreciate their good fortune in living long enough to be senior citizens. Seniors might be hesitant to express their need for their adult children or loved ones to look after them and to ensure they retire with dignity. Sadly, our aging parents, relatives, and loved ones often wrongfully feel like burdens and might neglect to communicate their general health complications and maintenance issues or needs. \nAs a responsible adult child or relative of a senior, you probably have a busy life. Whether you live close by or far from your aging loved ones, it can be difficult to notice their deteriorating welfare. Senior citizens might not always have a lot to fill their time. They may become very convincing in covering up their listlessness and vulnerability while keeping up a fa\u00e7ade of wellness. Therefore, you should be extra vigilant and attentive to notice some undeniable signs of need. The following are four general signs that your aging parents, relatives, or loved ones might need help beyond what you can provide alone. 1. Piling, Unmanaged Mail, and Bills \nIt can be difficult to notice gradually declining mobility, but the decline can leave behind definite traces in the mailbox department. Fetching, reading, sorting, responding to, and discarding letters and bills can be quite a bothersome chore even for youthful adults. Frail and tired seniors might find the chore too tasking to be worth the effort. Often, they leave such tasks to those who live close to them or those who visit them. If they don\u2019t get regular help, you will notice that their mail is unread and scattered upon visiting or that some bills might be left unpaid, which can bring about further consequences if unattended. 2. Waning Balance or Mysterious Bruising \nAging brings about frailness and imbalance that many seniors refuse to accept or admit. Their bodies are more prone to injuries in cases of falls or physical shock. Falls could more easily result in broken bones, and broken bones can lead to further complications. Solitude and immobility are very potent ingredients for disaster. Watch your parents moving, even if it means asking them to walk with you, just to observe their balance. Additionally, inspect their legs and hands for bumps and bruises. They could lie about the presence of injuries or downplay such injuries. However, this is a red flag that your loved one could potentially face other hazards. It could also mean that they just need a walking aid. Make sure you consult a health professional so that they can help you in figuring out how to deal with such predicaments. It may be a difficult, emotional task, but it will also prevent potential bad news later. 3. Inappropriate or Odd Behaviors \nOld age makes people vulnerable. For some, this might inspire a fight against time. Seniors might attempt retaining their perceived senses of dignity by fending off unsolicited help. In their endeavor to keep up a fa\u00e7ade of wellness and independence, they can neglect their welfare and manners. Neighbors might complain about newfound hostility and inappropriateness. They may suffer from memory issues that could cause them to call at odd hours of the night or multiple times in a row. They might become unresponsive to climatic and weather patterns. They could dress unsuitably for the weather, neglecting basic clothing like shoes, undergarments, or coats. You should train yourself to see past veiled attempts at avoiding their need for assistance. 4. Unclean Living Spaces and Expired Foods \nAdvanced aging might impede your aging relatives or loved ones from cleaning up after themselves. They may be too physically weak to do so or be experiencing mental decline that is inhibitive of daily chores and tasks. They might also find it too difficult to go to stores to do their own shopping for food, and they could possibly try to make their current supplies last for as long as possible. Be aware of if they are eating stale food and keep an eye on the quality of their living supplies. Food could be rotting and causing a terrible stench if they are not able to throw it out easily. The uncleanliness will most likely extend to their clothes and immediate environment, including bathrooms and bedrooms. When the situation gets this bad, you should not ignore it. At some point, if you notice one or more of the above signs, you must admit to yourself that you need to consider reaching out for help in taking care of your relatives or loved ones. Once you notice even one sign, especially if it uncharacteristic of him or her, it is important to maintain continuous observation and check in regularly by whatever means are possible. It\u2019s difficult minding your own business and responsibilities, raising your own family, and taking continuous care of your aging parents. Although trying, this time in life can become a way for you to honor your loved ones by providing them with the best care possible. Tragically, we know they won\u2019t always be around forever, so we must cherish the happy memories while treating them with dignity and unconditional love during the most difficult times. There is a multitude of resources online to find the best facilities, services, and organizations that offer professional help in taking care of senior citizens. Our parents, relatives, and loved ones deserve the best care, especially in the later years of life. Stay strong, do your best, be vigilant and your loved ones will be in good hands. \nCaryl Anne Crowne is a contributing writer and media relations specialist for Senior Helpers of San Gabriel Valley .

The SL was set up by Fox, so Sky can't do anything about it really. This has been an issue ever since Talking Dead started airing in the UK a few years ago. It set off an issue whereby multiple recordings of both programmes would record on the same night due to both TWD & TD being repeated on the same night.

It takes place in an exhibition area and apart from books there are also some scrapbooking items, plays, puzzles and much more.\n\n\nI managed to find 16 books! Yes, I know, too much for my already overfull shelves. Three of them went for Christmas present so that leaves me with 13 books. Today I present six of them, under the genres history non-fiction and biographies. I start with two books of one of the greatest writers all time.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare \n\n\nShakespeare and the Countess by Chris Laoutaris  -  \" In November 1596 William Shakespeare was engulfed by a catastrophe. The force which stormed inot his life and shook it to the core was a woman named Elizabeth Russell. This is the true story of the woman whose battle with Chakespeare and his associates in the Blackfriars of London gave birth to the world's most iconic theatre: the Globe .\"\n\nThe Lodger - Shakespeare on Silver Street by Charles Nicholl - \" In 1612 Shakespeare gave evidence at the Court of Requests in Westminster - it is the only occasion his spoken words are recorded. The case seems routine - a dispute over an unpaid marriage-dowry - but it opens up an unexpected window into the dramatist's famously obscure life-story. --- Charles Nicholl applies a powerful biographical magnifying glass to this fascinating but oddly neglected episode in Shakespeare's life .\"\n\n\nBiographies \n\n\nThe Inheritance, The Story of Knole & The Sackvilles by Robert Sackville-West - \" Knole and the Sackvilles: one house, one family, their destinies intertwined in a story four centuries long .\"\n\nThe Bugatti Queen by Miranda Seymour - \" Born in 1900 in a tiny French village, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Delangle's background offered no clue to her extraordinary future. Paris in its 1920s heyday seduced her into a life of dancing and stripping but the demi-monde of gauze veils and admirers was not enough to contain her ambition .\"\n\nComposers \n\n\nThe Girl in Rose, Haydn's Last Love by Peter Hobday - \" 'She was a beautiful English widow who loved me very much. I would have married her had I been able.' When the great composer Joseph Haydn uttered these words in 1808 he was reminiscing about his triumphant trip to London seventeen years earlier .\"\n\nThe Mysteries of Beethoven's Hair by Russell Martin and Lydia Nibley - \" Young Beethoven's musical gifts astonished the world, but his life seemed destined to be one of great suffering. This remarkable true story not only offers insight into Beethoven's turbulent life, but it also investigates the intriguing events that, for nearly two hundred years after his death, surrounded a lock of his hair. \"\n\nThese books sounds all intriguing to me.

As a result, MAVENCLAD \u00ae is now approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses and to delay the progression of physical disability. Following completion of 2 courses of treatment, no further treatment is required in years 3 and 4. The changes bring the Product Information [1] in line with the latest clinical trial evidence supporting MAVENCLAD \u00ae . MAVENCLAD \u00ae is the first and only oral short-course treatment to provide efficacy across key measures of disease activity in patients with RRMS, including disability progression, annualized relapse rate and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity.\n(Logo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/472778/Merck_Logo.jpg )\n\"Multiple sclerosis is a debilitating disease where new treatments are needed,\" said Professor Bill Carroll , Clinical Professor of Neurology at the University of Western Australia and the Perron Institute, and a consultant neurologist at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital as well as President-elect of the World Federation of Neurology. \"Mavenclad will be a welcomed treatment option for patients with the relapsing-remitting form of MS. As an oral therapy taken in two short courses over a 2-year period, Mavenclad will be convenient for all eligible patients in Australia , including those who may not live close to their treating healthcare professional.\"\n\"We are pleased the Therapeutic Goods Administration has updated the Product Information for Mavenclad in Australia to reflect additional clinical data,\" said Simon Sturge , Chief Operating Officer at the biopharma business of Merck. \"Our next step is to work closely with the Australian government to bring this treatment advance to patients as quickly as possible.\"\nMAVENCLAD \u00ae has been subject to a comprehensive clinical development program in multiple sclerosis (MS), that includes more than 10,000 patient years of data with over 2,700 patients included in the clinical trial programs, [2] and up to 10 years of observation in some patients.\nMAVENCLAD \u00ae is a selective immune reconstitution therapy [3],[4] which simplifies treatment administration, by giving patients just 2 short annual courses of tablets with a maximum of 20 days of treatment over 2 years providing a lasting treatment benefit of at least 4 years. MAVENCLAD \u00ae works by selectively targeting B & T lymphocytes followed by a distinct pattern of lymphocyte reconstitution, without continuous suppression of the immune system. [5]\nThis registration update for MAVENCLAD \u00ae in Australia follows the recent approval of MAVENCLAD \u00ae in Europe and in Canada . MS affects more than 23,000 Australians with most people diagnosed between the ages of 20-40. [6] Merck plans additional filings for regulatory approval in other countries, including the United States .\nMAVENCLAD \u00ae Minimum Product Information: Indications: MAVENCLAD is indicated for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses and to delay the progression of physical disability. Following completion of the 2 treatment courses, no further cladribine treatment is required in years 3 and 4. Re-initiation of therapy after year 4 has not been studied. Contraindications: Patients with hypersensitivity to cladribine or to any of the tablet excipients, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active chronic infections (tuberculosis, hepatitis), immunocompromised patients, including patients receiving immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive therapy, moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min), during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Recommendations to avoid co-administration with potent ENT1, CNT3 and ABCG2 transporter inhibitors. Adverse reactions: Very Common: Lymphopenia (may be severe, Grade 3 or 4). Common: Rash, alopecia, oral herpes, dermatomal herpes zoster, decrease in neutrophil count. Dosage and administration: Haematological and infections screening criteria for starting and continuing therapy have to be met before initiating MAVENCLAD therapy or administering any subsequent treatment course. The recommended cumulative dose of MAVENCLAD is 3.5 mg/kg body weight over 2 years, administered as 1 treatment course of 1.75 mg/kg per year. Each treatment course consists of 2 treatment weeks, one at the beginning of the first month and one at the beginning of the second month of the respective year. Each treatment week consists of 4 or 5 days on which a patient receives 10 mg or 20 mg (one or two tablets) as a single daily dose, depending on body weight. Patients should receive no more than 2 treatment courses over two consecutive years. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. Following completion of the 2 treatment courses, no further cladribine treatment is required in year 3 and year 4. Re-initiation of therapy after year 4 has not been studied.\nBased on approved PI dated 5 December 2017\nAbout MAVENCLAD \u00ae\nMAVENCLAD \u00ae (cladribine tablets) is approved in the European Union for the treatment of highly active relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). MAVENCLAD \u00ae is approved in Canada and Australia for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). MAVENCLAD \u00ae is a short-course oral therapy that selectively targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of relapsing MS (RMS). In August 2017 , the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for cladribine tablets for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in the 28 countries of the European Union (EU) in addition to Norway , Liechtenstein and Iceland . MAVENCLAD \u00ae is currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for the treatment for any use in the United States .\nThe clinical development program for MAVENCLAD \u00ae includes:\nThe CLARITY (Cladribine Tablets Treating MS Orally) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MAVENCLAD \u00ae as a monotherapy in patients with RRMS. The CLARITY extension study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study following on from the CLARITY study, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MAVENCLAD \u00ae over an extended administration for four years. The ORACLE MS (Oral Cladribine in Early MS) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MAVENCLAD \u00ae as a monotherapy in patients at risk of developing MS (patients who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS). The ONWARD (Oral Cladribine Added ON To Interferon beta-1a in Patients With Active Relapsing Disease) study: a Phase II placebo-controlled study designed primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding MAVENCLAD \u00ae treatment to patients with relapsing forms of MS, who have experienced breakthrough disease while on established interferon-beta therapy. PREMIERE (Prospective Observational Long-term Safety Registry of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Have Participated in Cladribine Clinical Studies) study: interim long-term follow-up data from the prospective registry, PREMIERE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MAVENCLAD \u00ae The clinical development program of Cladribine in MS comprises more than 10,000 patient years of data with over 2,700 patients included in the clinical trial program, and more than 10 years of observation in some patients.\nAbout Multiple Sclerosis\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common.\nAll Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

The victims were in a Toyota Corolla, driven by an estate agent, Jerry Akinlabi, when the incident happened. Oghogho and Emeagwai were Akinlabi\u2019s girlfriend and friend, respectively. Punch newspaper reports that a team of five policemen, including Abua, had flagged down Ogogo at a checkpoint along Igbuzo Market. One of the policemen, identified as Nwokolo, was said to have demanded money from Akinlabi and the driver told him that he did not have N200 to give him. Nwokolo reportedly said he would take one of the N1,000 notes Jerry had on him. \nAs Akinlabi drove off from the checkpoint, Abua reportedly shot at the car and bullets pierced the back of the vehicle, hitting Oghogho, who sat at the back seat. The bullet also grazed the back of Emeagwai, who was at the passenger\u2019s seat. Akinlabi told our correspondent that four cops, including the team leader, one ASP Akhabue, were detained by the police, while Abua evaded arrest. He said, \u201cOn Sunday, November 17, 2017, I was driving to the Igbuzor Market and on getting to a checkpoint, I met the policemen. We knew one another some months ago when I had an issue concerning a property at the station. I sounded the horn to greet them, but they did not respond. \n\u201cOne of them used his gun to hit the boot and I reversed. He said I wanted to beat the checkpoint. I told him that I assumed that they knew me very well and apologised. He demanded money. I wanted to give him N100 or N200, but it was N1,000 notes I had on me and I explained to him. \u201cHe said, \u2018Am I too small to collect N1,000?\u2019 When I declined to give him N1,000, he asked me to pull over, which I did. As the argument over N1,000 got heated, I entered my car and drove off. What I heard next was three gunshots aimed at my car. \u201cA bullet pierced into the car, hit my girlfriend\u2019s body, came out and hit my friend in the back.\u201d The 22-year-old indigene of Oyo State said he took the victims to a general hospital in Igbuzo, from where Oghogho was referred to the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba before she died.

Since returning to Salem, she has been a different girl. Even though many fans like the new take-no-prisoners personality, she might go too far. Coping with anger and bitterness, Ciara verbally assaults her own mother. This leaves Hope Brady (Kristian Alfonso) hurt, confused, and devastated. According to She Knows, Days Of Our Lives spoilers tease that Ciara will get into a huge fight with her mother.
