Iraqis will want the US out, as will cooperative Arabs in northern Syria, and their allies in the Gulf State countries. The people on the street in Turkey will want out too. The political fall out might be so great that the US is forced to withdraw from various places around the world. Perhaps this is the intention. Trump at the start of his Presidential Campaign stated that the US could not afford to be the world's policeman. By taking what are considered politically extreme positions, by appearing massively biased towards Israel, by so overtly threatening war with North Korea and Iran, Trump is creating divisions that are encouraging other countries to reject US interference or 'help'. It must be remembered that during the campaign Trump directly stated that he wasn't going to give the Israelis any special treatment (and then he massively backtracked), that the Bush neocons had lied about and caused the war in Iraq saying it was completely unnecessary, and has since stated that countries around the world need to pay their own way in terms of defence spending. His actions are bringing all these issues to a head. The fallout from Trump's recognition of Jerusalem will put a sharper global focus on Israel. People using the Internet can quickly inform themselves about the overall unjust situation with the Palestinians. Creating crises focuses the minds of the ordinary person, such as with Korea. However, in the age of the Internet, the desire of the establishment to shape the narrative is immediately undermined via memes and internet information. The surest way to address injustice these days is simply to draw attention to the matter. People have assumed that Trump is stupid due to his braggadocio attitude and his push against SJW sensibilities (sensibilities that are often not logical positions in the first place) but his campaign talk identified real problems separate from all the prevailing misinformation surrounding them (like the real state of the US economy, and the cause of the Iraq war). He had a much higher level of comprehension on many issues that one would expect from someone who was allegedly stupid. We know that Trump is cunning and can be duplicitous, using ruses and trickery to go from point A to point B. His book, The Art of the Deal has a title very similar to the ancient Chinese text The Art of War, which deals with military strategy. Its most notable quote being \"All warfare is based on deception\". If Trump is wearing his Art of War hat we cannot accept everything he is doing at face value - although the special interest crooks in Washington may have a (strong) measure of control over his actions. There is a high likelihood that what is occurring is part of a larger strategy. Trump likes to play and troll people. Is this the greatest set up the world has ever seen for all the (US-Israeli) geopolitical establishment crooks? Regardless, the outcome here may be the same no matter what the underlying intention.

Nonselective inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC) can protect brain cells during ischemia and stroke. However, which HDAC isoform is involved in this effect is unknown. Some isoforms of histone deacetylases (HDACs) protect brain cells after ischemia, whereas others can promote their death. Most studies consider early periods (1\u201324 h) after stroke, whereas little is known on the involvement of HDACs during recovery after stroke. In this study, cellular and intracellular rearrangement of class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC8) was investigated at late periods after photothrombotic infarction (PTI) of the mouse sensorimotor cortex in intact tissue that surrounds the ischemia core, in the corresponding region of the contralateral hemisphere, and in the hippocampus. Each HDAC isoform had a specific pattern of expression and intracellular distribution in neurons and astrocytes at different periods after the ischemia. We did not observe ischemia-induced changes in the subcellular localization of HDACs under study. Three days after the PTI, the expression of HDAC2 was increased in neurons of the damaged hemisphere. The activity of HDAC2 and HDAC8 was elevated 7 days after the ischemia both in neurons and astrocytes of the studied brain structures; the activity of HDAC8 was also increased 14 days after the ischemia. It is notable that the expression of class I HDACs in the intact hemisphere changes in the same way as their expression in the living tissue of the damaged hemisphere. HDAC1 was found both in the nuclei and cytoplasm of the brain cells; HDAC2 was predominantly localized in the nuclei, and HDAC8 was predominantly observed in the cytoplasm. This in addition to the regulation of gene transcription indicates nontranscriptional activity of HDAC1 and HDAC8 during recovery of the brain tissue after the ischemia. HDAC2 and HDAC8 were identified as potential mediators in an early recovery period after stroke, suggesting that selective inhibitors and activators of HDACs can be considered for therapeutic approaches in this period.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2Ai0fSf", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ipsilateral", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:47.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0321c00d6e8ffc9c67e692df60c53bd7df89e74a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOqV1ymbHnpjFHlTM9rF94BZDUIXX13zeDT5nao2UmXrBw--", "site_full": "ssoforums.com", "site": "ssoforums.com", "site_section": "http://ssoforums.com/board/7/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "The Club House | Star Stable Forums", "title": "~Frosty Bullets Legacy~", "title_full": "~Frosty Bullets Legacy~ | Star Stable Forums", "published": "2017-08-21T01:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://storage.proboards.com/6408743/images/sWkm0ei8J_sAoVczMRzt.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d63d289e9420b2a6a82ba812afb630fcf5a20655", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOqV1ymbHnpjFHlTM9rF94BZDUIXX13zeDSZ0wHGy5_6GizHBwSCDn6U", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T21:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I'm glad you have such a nice, long-lived club.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

(AP) - New Jersey lawmakers are set to vote on legislation that would make it illegal to operate a drone while drunk. \nThe Democrat-led Senate is scheduled to vote on the legislation Thursday. \nThe National Conference on State Legislatures says at least 38 states are considering drone legislation this year, going beyond the Federal Aviation Administration's regulations. \nThe New Jersey bill would make operating a drone under the influence of alcohol a disorderly persons offense, which carries a sentence of up to six months in prison, a $1,000 fine or both. It also would make using a drone to hunt wildlife and endanger people or property a similar offense. \nThe legislation has already cleared a committee in the Democrat-controlled Assembly.

Kevin Kling narrates the show, which features, among other things, a giant Cheeto. Performances take place at The Lab Theater in Minneapolis. \nTheater artist and educator Maria Asp is excited to see \"Cloth,\" a show about the politics of what women wear. The show, created by Exposed Brick Theatre, was informed by numerous interviews with women from a wide variety of backgrounds. Asp says it's a timely and important topic; she points to how victims of sexual assault are often judged by their clothing, or how Muslim women are harassed for wearing a hijab. Performances run Dec. 7 through 10 at the Southern Theater in Minneapolis. \nTeaching artist Heidi Jeub likes the paintings of Sophia Heymans, and really enjoyed her latest exhibition of landscape paintings, called \"Lay of the Land.\" She says the show is both about painting and about psychology, as it explores our relationship to our physical surroundings.

In D.C., shoppers pay 289% more than the national average on gifts.\nTo produce its ranking, Millennial Personal Finance used data from the U.S. Census Bureau cost of living index compiled by real-estate data firm Onboard Analytics. The index was based on the cost of a range of gifts including apparel, accessories, cash, recreation and household furnishings, among other items. \nBut you don\u2019t need to live steps from the White House to be paying more when shopping for gifts than the national average. Alaskans pay nearly double the national average for presents. In eight other states \u2014 Hawaii, New York, Michigan, New Jersey, California, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maryland \u2014 people will fork over upwards of 20% more to buy gifts during the holidays.\nAlso see: These holiday gifts could increase the value of your friend\u2019s home \nIn some cities though, gifts can be even more expensive. Stony Brook, N.Y., is the worst culprit in this regard \u2014 gift shopping there will cost a consumer more than 78 times the national average. Not far behind is East Lansing, Mich., where gifts are nearly 77 times more expensive than the national average. \nAs for the cheapest places to shop, West Virginia and Arkansas are the best at the state-level, with gifts costing 15% less than the national average. And Playa Vista, Calif., a suburb of Los Angeles, is the cheapest metropolitan area on the ranking \u2014 gifts there will be 44% cheaper than the national average.\nDon\u2019t miss: Help your children save for college and pay off student debt \nSo why are some places cheaper than others when it comes to holiday shopping? There\u2019s no one reason. Some point to the Balassa-Samuelson effect, which The Atlantic nicknamed the \u201cnanny effect.\u201d This economic theory suggests that as wages rise in a given location (whether a city, state or country), then prices of goods will also rise.\nReal estate also plays a role \u2014 if rents are more expensive, stores will need to sell more goods or sell them for a higher price to make ends meet. Similarly, if fuel prices are higher in a given place, then transporting items gets more expensive, creating a similar trickle-down effect. That\u2019s likely the case for places like Alaska and Hawaii, which import far more than other states due to their location.\nMore from MarketWatch How to give gifts that truly pay off for friends and family These gifts will improve your life more than a new sweater Read this before you buy someone bitcoin as a gift", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "onboard analytics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. census bureau", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "district of columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balassa-samuelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stony brook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "playa vista", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east lansing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:50.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e80ce477e63c13bf461b456a4417de1383d5e7b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSnJ.Yrq7krp.kIBBhy9VcNOB_l4KeWYScNID9nzJqVvKbEGUu2j735EvCqPbgPQnvjAPr..FunlpOTAxjKP9Mq9nJqLwL1AXIBPjW6gzoQnBTV34GFEwDlLksXCaNlDqRq9xSOsmXIEw--", "site_full": "www.pulse.ng", "site": "pulse.ng", "site_section": "http://pulse.ng/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "pulse.ng - Nigeria's entertainment & lifestyle platform online", "title": "Thelma Okoro: Celebrity stylist says Nigerian industry has great potentials", "title_full": "Thelma Okoro: Celebrity stylist says Nigerian industry has great potentials", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.pulse.ng/img/incoming/crop7696690/5166709482-chorizontal-w1200-h630-q90/Thelma-Okoro1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4252, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e80ce477e63c13bf461b456a4417de1383d5e7b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSnJ.Yrq7krp.kIBBhy9VcNOB_l4KeWYScNID9nzJqVvKbEGUu2j735EvCqPbgPQnvjAPr..FunlpOTAxjKP9Mq9nJqLwL1AXIBPjW6gzoQnBTV34GFEwDlLksXCaNlDqRq9xSOsmXIEw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pulse News Agency Local By NAN", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "Thelma Okoro: Celebrity stylist says Nigerian industry has great potentials", "text": "24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter!

Back to Article news Celebrity stylist and CEO of ONYC Hair brand, Thelma Okoro, has spoken on her journey into the beauty world and how it has progressed over the years. The US based beauty expert, who has worked for the likes of Chanel Cosmetics, and Estee Lauder Cosmetic Company, said that the beauty industry has a lot of potentials that have remained untapped. \u201cONYC Hair is my first Brand. I put in all I have and I\u2019m grateful for it. One obstacle does not equate failure. I was scammed during the initial stage of starting my brand, both financially and from partners overseas that sent me very low-quality products. If I had given up or been selfish enough to send bad products to my new customers, I would not be here right now, \u201d she said. Okoro further cited the challenges she has had to face in the course of setting up an international brand to include language barrier, especially from conversations and negotiations with the Chinese, as well as long hours spent in flight.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thelma okoro", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "okoro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "estee lauder cosmetic company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chanel cosmetics", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:50.001+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15081907, "moreResultsAvailable": 15081807, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512641810001&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 118}
