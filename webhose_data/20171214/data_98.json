(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

The second part after the word \"AND\" is the clincher - which means both parts must be satisfied:\nAND (2) the person is not prohibited by the law of the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred from receiving or possessing firearms\nUnder CA law, an expungement does not restore rights. So the second part is not met in CA by a simple 1203.4 expungement.\nIn other states, for instance Texas - a statutory expungement does not restore rights, but a judicial expungement does. And in some other states, a simple expungement is restorative. And some states like AZ restore rights by statute, but other states (like CA) will not recognize that restoration since it was not done in a court proceeding. There is a lot of nuance.\nThe word 'expungement' then, on the 4473, is sort of a generic placeholder for many types of procedures - the most important thing is the procedure must result \"under the law of the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred\" in the person's rights having been restored, by whatever process is effective in that particular state; \" has had their civil rights... restored \" and \"the person is not prohibited by the law of the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred from receiving or possessing firearms\".\nRunning it together as it applies to CA: \"under the law of the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred...the person has had their civil rights ... taken away and later restored ... AND the person is not prohibited by the law of the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred from receiving or possessing firearms\".\nThe US DOJ keeps a list, state by state, of which procedure restores firearms rights.

Following the success of Taylor Swift 's record-breaker album \" Reputation \", producer BloodPop, also known as Blood Diamonds, has re-worked one of the hit songs off the album, \"...Ready for It?\". It follows the producer's previous remixes such as Lana Del Rey and The Weeknd 's \"Lust for Life\" as well as Haim 's \"Little of Your Love\". The remix of the track is very different from the original version as BloodPop brings a lighter take on it. Despite that, loyal Swifties still love it. The track was originally released on streaming service Tidal only, but fans can now listen to it on YouTube. Fans are also able to purchase the song on iTunes. In other Taylor-related news, the 27-year-old songstress is featured on TIME 's Person of the Year cover as one of 2017 \"The Silence Breakers\". Taylor is given the title after she testified in court in August about being assaulted in a room full of people. The magazine believes that the singer's action has inspired women to speak out about sexual harassment. Back in 2013, a radio DJ named David Mueller grabbed Taylor's rear end during a photo session. After that, she privately reported the incident to the station, leading to David getting fired. He sued the singer for defamation two years later, but tragically lost in the court. In an interview with the magazine, Taylor stated that it was important to report the incident to the radio station because she \"felt like that they needed to know.\" The singer then went on by giving advice to her fans to not \"blame yourself and do not accept the blame others will try to place on you,\" when they report sexual harassment. \"You should not be blamed for waiting 15 minutes or 15 days to report sexual assault or harassment,\" she said. \"Or for the the outcome of what happens to a person after he or she makes the choice to sexually harass or assault you.\" More Taylor Swift News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "taylor swift", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lana del rey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swifties", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloodpop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taylor swift news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:32.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f10942391159d06f406b9c1600ea59795594b2ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU46o__BwFz6P4DKyydaaQK7r.yR.DrdzF_Dho58qe7eZvHQX9xbTMHKCnGDN_oPWVb.LujSevXo0mF5H1ORlM2Ac", "site_full": "lonestarcats.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://lonestarcats.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Lone Star Cats", "title": "Wordless Wednesday", "title_full": "Wordless Wednesday", "published": "2017-12-07T02:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ba6967176261b0418d265a8e05d39c921241fb7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU46o__BwFz6P4DKyydaaQK7r.yR.DrdzF_Dho58qe7eZvHQX9xbTMHKCnGDN_oPWVb.LujSevXo0mKVKTJ8EC09CFNGfEN0mGVc-", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "Lone Star Cats", "published": "2017-12-07T10:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Nice to see you, kitties!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:32.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e71df70037ef7f0d9ad9a2645d57125006bf0788", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439HkiAVBEPtlxKckHbAny94wdmtNxFQSLCH6CQMsJHAAqRgLufsgZKBSJK1qzEFHfDerfMCioPnvApPU0aOzlRq7uCjuEogagwFhyeD2pLtBoTeKDM0th64.WuO.d7_oh6jChKUg8lX2OS1H.fmpPZadlq0mmpRQGBXpQBNuEd0Zm0go_3L1LNKQ--", "site_full": "www.ebay.co.uk", "site": "ebay.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.ebay.co.uk/b/Bath-Screens/147155/bn_1632983", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Bath Screens | eBay", "title": "800x1400mm-180-Pivot-Bath-6mm-Over-Door-Panel-With-Handle", "title_full": "Reviews: 800x1400mm-180-Pivot-Bath-Shower-Screen-6mm-Glass-Over-Door-Panel-With-Handle | eBay", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e71df70037ef7f0d9ad9a2645d57125006bf0788", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439HkiAVBEPtlxKckHbAny94wdmtNxFQSLCH6CQMsJHAAqRgLufsgZKBSJK1qzEFHfDerfMCioPnvApPU0aOzlRq7uCjuEogagwFhyeD2pLtBoTeKDM0th64.WuO.d7_oh6jChKUg8lX2OS1H.fmpPZadlq0mmpRQGBXpQBNuEd0Zm0go_3L1LNKQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "tablestreet", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Excellent product", "text": "So glad we chose this particular 1.

Forgiveness is the only way to dissolve that link and get free.\u201d\nCatherine Ponder\nI never knew how strong I was until I had to forgive someone who didn\u2019t even apologize. To just let go of the pain, the hatred, the hurtful words and say to myself \u201cit\u2019s ok\u201d. It was not easy but after letting go I realized it was the best decision I had ever made.\n\n\u201cThe weak can never forgive, forgiveness is an attribute of the strong.\u201d Mahatma Gandhi\nUnforgiveness is like feeling you need to empty your bowls but you choose to hold on till your tummy hurts. The sad part is that unforgiveness leads to bitterness and anger which you take with you everywhere you go hence hurting and destroying other people and things along the way.\nWe have all heard that bitterness is like drinking poison and expecting the next person to die but what really breeds bitterness is usually unforgiveness.\nThe decision to forgive simply means, I have decided that my happiness and the well being of my heart is much more important. It means I have decided to let go, heal and move on. So forgiveness does so much good to nobody but you.\nMatthew 6:15\nBut if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\nSo many times I have asked myself how many times have I sinned but I still go back to God and ask for forgiveness and he does exactly that. Ok lets quit the spiritual and talk about the number of people I have wronged my entire life.\nI apologized to some but not all, yet still a great number of them forgave me and never held a grudge. So why can\u2019t I just do the same to that person or those people who I believe hurt me so bad and free myself from a prison of my own making.\nA few days ago, my sister quote Nelson Mandela\u2019s words which he said before leaving prison.\n\u201cAs I stand before the door to my freedom, I realize that if I don\u2019t leave my pain, anger and bitterness behind me, I will still be in prison\u201d.\nTo forgive is to set free a prisoner and realize the prisoner was you.\nShe went on to say\n\u201d I wonder how many of us have imprisoned ourselves in the walls of anger and bitterness\u201d.\nThis got me thinking that I really need to free myself and start all over. This doesn\u2019t mean the scars will be gone. They will be clearly evident but we look at them different, as lessons and a reminder of how strong we are.\nImagine holding on to all the pain of all the ex partners or your current partner caused. This means you are constantly in a battle as you are depriving yourself and your heart that feeling of warmth, peace and comfort. In the end you become toxic to not just the people around you but yourself.\nSo if it will take sitting down for a chat with that person who did you wrong to forgive then do it.

Academician Nuriye Gulmen\u2019s freedom is a victory for us after 268 day in hunger strike\u2026 Nuriye Gulmen and Semih Ozakca were put on trial on 1 December. Nuriye Gulmen was released after six and a half months in prison. The court sentenced her to 6 years and 3 months on charges of \u201cmembership of an organisation\u201d by punishing her on the 268th day of hunger. The court took revenge on Nuriye while releasing her. The court delegation, which had acquitted Semih Ozakca, who had been arrested under the same charges, decided to CONDEMN HER TO DEATH with a political decision because Nuriye was the first to launch the action! This trial process is entirely unlawful and the court has taken the decision quickly and has PUNISHED Nuriye without giving her the opportunity to defend herself!

IN THE NEAR FUTURE! Nuriye Gulmen and Semih Ozakca were put on trial on 1 December. Nuriye Gulmen was released after six and a half months in prison. The court sentenced her to 6 years and 3 months on charges of \u201cmembership of an organisation\u201d by punishing her on the 268th day of hunger. The court took revenge on Nuriye while releasing her. The court delegation, which had acquitted Semih Ozakca, who had been arrested under the same charges, decided to CONDEMN HER TO DEATH with a political decision because Nuriye was the first to launch the action! This trial process is entirely unlawful and the court has taken the decision quickly and has PUNISHED Nuriye without giving her the opportunity to defend herself! This was one of the fastest criminal proceedings in the legal system of Turkey. The punishment was obvious from the very first days they were detained! Nuriye was kept in isolation conditions, kept at the hospital for weeks without being allowed a refakatci (person allowed to accompany a sick friend in hospital), and kept under military control. Then, under conditions in which she could not even tell night from day, she was held in the prison section of the hospital basement. She was not brought to court, citing her health condition, but every time the decision was taken to continue imprisonment! Even in the most difficult conditions for Nuriye, she kept resisting and they gave hope to the people with their resistance. Nuriye and Semih resisted every second. While their bodies grew thinner day by day, they embraced the whole world with their warm smiles. At every second of the day wherever we were, our hearts were one with them. There\u2019s no place we did not open a banner, we did not get detained. In the last two months 100 People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Front supporters have been imprisoned. 17 lawyers of Nuriye and Semih were imprisoned and we resisted the police attacks twice a day in front of the Yuksel Monument (in Ankara). But we never expected justice from the courts of fascism, we always turn to the people. Because the instruction has already been given about them, it is a crime to oppose the state of emergency and give hope to the people! As support actions have been carried out in all parts of the world, we COMPELLED THEM TO SURRENDER NURIYE FROM THE GRIP OF TYRANNY. The state of emergency will be crushed under the feet of Nuriye and Semih, and they will be allowed to go back to work! We also greet all our friends who have responded to our calls, lending their shoulders to the resistance from different parts of the world\u2026 The release of Nuriye and Semih is the result of the pushing the AKP fascists into a corner. However, their demands were still rejected, and in the case of Nuriye the court decision is a reprisal preventing a return to work. But the resistance continues, we will work harder for the victory of Nuriye\u2026 They arrested and sentenced them illegally. We do not accept this punishment and unlawfulness, as long as the demands of Nuriye and Semih are not granted WE WILL CONTINUE TO RESIST !

The Induction process exists to help organizations get new employees up to speed and productive as quickly as possible. However, it also exists to give new starters a better understanding of the company and how they will \ufb01t in. The costs of \ufb01nding, hiring, onboarding, and training new employees can prove to be costly, so it makes sense to develop the best possible Induction program to equip new starters with all they need to get going. With so much at stake, this eBook looks at why Induction exists, why it\u2019s broken, and how technology can support the organization. Transforming The Impact Of Induction And Onboarding With Digital \nSolid Induction and onboarding programs are vital for organizations to get right. Research shows that up to 20% of turnover happens within the first 45 days of employment, so it\u2019s essential to engage and impress new starters straight away [1]. How To Transform The Impact Of Induction And Onboarding With Digital This ebook looks at why Induction exists and how technology makes Onboarding a smooth process. \nWe are living in a digital world, where technology has enhanced our lives; we no longer want to wait for the information we require, we expect to be able to go to our devices and find the answers we need at the same time, whilst engaging new starters and giving them the tools they need to be successful from the start. \nThe eBook How To Transform The Impact Of Induction And Onboarding With Digital will show you how to digitally transform your onboarding and the results you get from it by: Equipping New Starters With The Tools They Need To Succeed Straight Away \nInduction is often overlooked and unfortunately, many new hires will look for a new job because of a poor first experience with a new company. A well thought-out Induction program is vital to provide the employee with the confidence and support they require to feel comfortable and competent within the organization. Giving New Starters Relevant Information At Their Point-Of-Need \nIt\u2019s common for new starters to have questions or doubts when starting a new job. Why not address these straight away and replace their apprehension with excitement and readiness from the moment they accept the job offer (\u201cYes\u201d), to when they arrive on Day One (\u201cDesk\u201d)? Leaving A Long-Lasting Positive Impression \nOnboarding and Induction is not just about giving new starters a warm welcome and diving straight into how the organization works. It is also about selling the business to them. After job searching and choosing an organization to work for, the Induction process is a way for the company to reiterate that the new starter has made the right decision. Providing Meaningful Connections Within The Organization \nThere is huge value in bringing people together during Induction but not for content dumping or attempts to transfer knowledge. Spend more time on meaningfully connecting new starters with each other and getting them really excited about joining the company. Using Up-To-Date Resources, That Can Be Updated Immediately \nUsing digital resources allows new starters to learn and digest at their own pace, and offer a permanent bank of information that can be looked over again at any point in the future.

According to the Corriere dello Sport , however, \u201cthe Spaniard isn\u2019t particularly keen\u201d, while Inter \u201cwould absolutely be ready to take a seat at the negotiating table if Henrikh Mkhitaryan was part of the discussions\u201d. Apparently Inter feel M\u00e1rio\u2019s performances have not justified the \u20ac40m (plus potential \u20ac5m in assorted bonuses and add-ons) they spent to lure him away from Sporting in 2016 but they also feel it would be a bit embarrassing to sell him at a significant loss. Therefore they have hit upon the cunning ruse of swapping him for someone else, thereby putting no particular monetary value on the deal whatsoever. Paris Saint-Germain are apparently also interested, with Javier Pastore potentially making the reverse move. \nJonny Evans has some decisions to make. West Bromwich Albion want their 29-year-old centre-back to sign a new contract and stay at the Hawthorns but Manchester City plan to recommence their pursuit of the former Manchester United man in January while a couple of other clubs \u2013 Everton and West Ham , to be precise \u2013 hope to pip Pep should the defender become available. West Brom, meanwhile, are also thinking about their forward line and have sent scouts to Belgrade for the Europa League match between Red Star and Koln, to cast their eyes over Richmond Boakye , who has scored 10 goals in 11 league games this season and has already caught the attention of Chelsea. Manchester City\u2019s winning run ends as makeshift side fall to Shakhtar Read more \nA group of Real Madrid players including Marco Asensio and Isco have a WhatsApp group where they discuss matters football, and according to Diario Gol have been remarking in particular upon Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s selfishness and laziness. \u201cIn this group they complain that Cristiano only runs when it benefits him, that he does not give his all on the field and that he is focused only on his own interests, not those of the team,\u201d they report. Perhaps uncoincidentally, they report elsewhere that the Portuguese star\u2019s position in the squad is \u201cno longer untouchable\u201d and that the club are readying a move for Chelsea\u2019s Eden Hazard , who was phoned by Zinedine Zidane last week for an entirely-coincidental-honest-guv friendly chat. \nCould Celtic finally be ready to sell Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 ? Brighton certainly hope so, and are \u201cconsidering testing the water with an offer of \u00a320m\u201d for the French forward in January, writes the Mail. Meanwhile, the Sun reports that \u201c Arda Turan has been snapped in London as serious doubts remain over his Barcelona future\u201d, though this was not exactly a clandestine mission, the snaps having been uploaded to Twitter by Turan himself. Still, it might mean something. Meanwhile, Sunderland want Bolton\u2019s Gary Madine and in the first drips of what may become a deluge of Everton -based rumour Sam Allardyce apparently wants to sign Steven Nzonzi from Sevilla and, more ambitiously, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund. \nArs\u00e8ne Wenger has ruled out the possibility of allowing significant departures in January, even though players such as Theo Walcott , Olivier Giroud and Jack Wilshere are all liable to be feeling a bit miffed about the number of matches they are not starting and wondering if someone somewhere might show them a little more love. \u201cI want to keep the squad,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe do not want to become weaker. I have to consider the interest of the player but [more important] will be the interests of the club.\u201d Spoilsport.

Morgan Engel-USA TODAY Sports \nJimbo Fisher of course has moved on from Florida State to take over the football program at Texas A&M for boatloads of money. One of the more interesting side stories that played out amid the coach\u2019s uncertain future before announcing the move was a the image of a discarded Christmas tree outside his home in Tallahassee, Fla. \n#FSU coach Jimbo Fisher has put his Christmas tree outside his house to be picked up as garbage pic.twitter.com/N0pgrdL0bN \n\u2014 Wayne McGahee III (@WayneMcGaheeIII) December 1, 2017 \nThe photo not surprisingly went viral in an instant. Instead of the discarded Christmas tree actually being a harbinger of impending news regarding the coach\u2019s impending job switch, Fisher provided a much more sensible reason why his holiday decoration was sitting out on the curb during an appearance Wednesday on \u201cThe Dan Patrick Show.\u201d \n\u201cWell what that was, I had no idea, the guys who come to put my Christmas tree up that week, said they got it out, \u2018Coach it\u2019s broke,\u2019\u201d Fisher said, via SB Nation . \u201cWhat happened was, it was broke, so I put a new one up and he said, \u2018So we\u2019ll get rid of the other one\u2019 so they set it on the curb to be picked up. That was what it was \u2014 there was a new Christmas tree in my house, it\u2019s still in my house in Tallahassee. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t throw it out. I was actually at work, there was a group that comes in that puts the lights and everything across the house, because you\u2019re always on the road recruiting. We had a group, the Espositos, that comes and does it, and they called me and said, \u2018Jimbo this thing\u2019s over 10 years old and it\u2019s broke up.\u2019\u201d \nSo, it was more about the Espositos\u2019 responsible stewardship of the Fisher home\u2019s annual holiday decorating procedures than anything else. Makes sense, just not as amusing as what the wiseacres on social media came up with.

It was filed immediately in the trash can, he said. \nThe ACLU\u2019s letter was in response to a WJAR report that alleged \u201ca lot of police departments\u201d were requiring officers to issue a minimum number of traffic tickets while on patrol. \n\u201cIf your department is one of the agencies alluded to in the news station\u2019s reporting, we urge you to immediately halt any such practice and advise your officers that any order to the contrary is countermanded,\u201d wrote Steven Brown, ACLU executive director, in a letter dated Nov. 20. \nHe continued: \u201cAn encounter between a motorist and a police officer over a traffic violation is never a pleasant one, but it is even less so when the basis for the stop is to meet a quota, not to address a truly legitimate safety need. A quota policy can only generate disrespect for, and cynicism about, law enforcement. \n\u201cIn short, the implementation of traffic ticket quotas is problematic as a matter of policy, but even more so when it involves a police department itself violating the law.\u201d \nWhile Mello does not necessarily support quotas, he said the ACLU\u2019s broad interpretation of them would hamper supervision duties statewide. \n\u201cYou have to set expectations,\u201d Mello said. \u201cThat\u2019s my philosophy on policing. I have expectations of how my officers enforce traffic laws.\u201d \nThe law was passed by the legislature in 2010.

Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test", "text": "By LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Under Geneva Convention, Jerusalem is considered as an occupied territory and so it is illegal to consider it as capital of its occupied, Israel. France \u201cdoes not approve\u201d the U.S\u2019 \u201cregrettable\u201d move in recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, French President Emmanuel Macron said. \nTrump is also directing the State Department to initiate the relocation of the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the occupied city Jerusalem. The move is expected to take a number of years. \n\u201cMy announcement today marks the beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians,\u201d Trump said during a public address from the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House. \n\u201cThere will of course be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement \u2014 but we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a place of greater understanding and cooperation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality.\u201d \n\nThe president\u2019s decision places the U.S. at odds with decades of American policy, as well as the rest of the international community, except Israel. No nation has its embassy in Jerusalem. It is also likely to stymy any effort to restart long-stalled peace Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. \nPalestinians have been seeking East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state during peace talks. It has been occupied by Israel since 1967. West Jerusalem was occupied by Israel late 1948 and is considered as military occupation by Geneva Convention. \nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres stressed the importance of a two-state solution after Trump said the U.S. would support it \u201cif agreed to by both sides.\u201d \nGuterres told reporters at the UN\u2019s New York headquarters that it is only by realizing the vision of two states \u201cliving side-by-side in peace, security and mutual recognition, with Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Palestine, and all final status issues resolved permanently through negotiations\u201d that the aspirations of both parties can be achieved. \nLong-time Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu has dropped his support for the proposal after appearing to publicly endorse it in 2009. \nIn the waning days of former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, then-Secretary of State John Kerry said Palestinians have a shared claim to Jerusalem. Netanyahu condemned Kerry\u2019s speech at the time, calling it \u201cunbalanced.\u201d \nTrump will sign a six-month waiver off-setting the embassy\u2019s relocation on national security grounds in order to avoid cuts to the State Department budget during the transition period, according to an official knowledgeable on the matter. \nSuccessive U.S. presidents of both parties have signed the waiver since the Jerusalem Embassy Act went into law in 1995, perpetually forestalling the building\u2019s legislated move over concerns it could spark a diplomatic crisis and be a death knell for peace talks. \n\u201cSome say they lacked courage, but they made their best judgement based on facts as they understood them at the time,\u201d Trump said referring to past presidents who signed the waiver. \u201cNevertheless the record is in. After more than two decades of waivers we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result.\u201d \nNonetheless, the decision was met with opposition from activists. \n\u201cTrump had the gall to call his upheaval of decades of strategic White House policy a \u2018new approach\u2019,\u201d said Emily Mayer, a national coordinator with IfNotNow, a progressive Jewish-American group that opposes the Israeli occupation. \n\u201cBut this is not a new approach \u2014 it is an act of incitement from the Trump administration against Palestinians and a recipe for disaster. Today\u2019s announcement only entrenches Israel\u2019s military occupation of Palestinian land and drives Israelis and Palestinians farther away from the lasting \u2018peace\u2019 he so callously talked about,\u201d she told Anadolu Agency. \nBut the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the most powerful pro-Israel lobbying group in the U.S., said Trump\u2019s declaration \u201cacknowledges that Jerusalem will continue to be Israel\u2019s capital as part of any conceivable final status agreement. \n\u201cToday\u2019s action by President Trump is an important, historic step for which we are grateful. We urge the president to quickly relocate our embassy to Israel\u2019s capital,\u201d it said in a statement. \nPalestinian leaders have already called for three \u201cdays of rage\u201d to contest Trump\u2019s decision. \nJerusalem is considered holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims, and changes to the contested city\u2019s status quo have been historically met with fierce opposition. \nIsrael\u2019s decision to restrict Muslim access to the al-Aqsa mosque compound in 2015 set off widespread street violence between Palestinians and Israeli security forces. And an Israeli decision to install controversial metal detectors at the mosque\u2019s entrance earlier this year was ultimately reversed after being met with mass protests by Palestinians. \nIn making his announcement, Trump called on all parties to maintain the status quo at Jerusalem\u2019s holy sites, including Haram al-Sharif, or the Aqsa compound. \nVice President Mike Pence will visit the region \u201cin the coming days to reaffirm our commitment to work with partners throughout the Middle East to defeat radicalism that threatens the hopes and dreams of future generations\u201d, Trump said. \nJordan\u2019s government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani said in a written statement that his country reject the decision. \n\u201dThe international legitimacy emphasizes that the status of Jerusalem will be negotiated and agreed upon by agreement,\u201d he said, adding that the U.S. is violating international legitimate decisions with this step.

It celebrates the rededication of the Second Temple of Jerusalem during the second century B.C. following the triumph of a small group of Jewish rebels against the Greek-Syrians, who had defiled the temple by erecting an altar to Zeus and sacrificing pigs within its sacred walls. In order to rededicate the temple, the Jews had to light a menorah that would burn within the temple at all times. However, they only had enough pure olive oil to last for one day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days, leaving time to find a fresh supply of oil.

Comes complete and all matching except the selector. US parts are muzzle brake and pistol grip.
