Washington Wizards \nThe Wizards bounced back from that embarrassing loss in Utah the other night for a win in Portland. It was a nice win for Washington as a solid underdog, made possible by a career night from Bradley Beal. \nBeal scored 51 points on ridiculous outside and midrange shooting. He got to the rim a fair amount too (he did score 51 after all) by isolating big men who switched a screen at the top. \nOtherwise, Washington didn\u2019t get much of anything from the rest. The Wiz only scored 106 as team; you do the math. \nThis has potential to be a back-and-forth duel between Beal and Trevor Booker, if he goes \u2014 more on that below. They will likely guard one another, unless Scott Brooks assigns Otto Porter to Booker. \nWashington jets off to LA for one with the Clippers after this game, then it\u2019s on to Brooklyn before heading home. Phoenix Suns \nTrevor Booker scored 46 the night before Beal got his 51 this week. It was part of Phoenix\u2019s best win of the season, by 14 points in Philly. \nThe Suns were in action the next night in Toronto and that didn\u2019t go as well. Booker was 4-of-15 and his team lost by 13. Toronto is a good team, though. He also left the game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. \nHe couldn\u2019t make it off the court on his own power but the Suns haven\u2019t come out with a statement. I would assume he doesn\u2019t go in this game. \nAt least the Suns are coming back home after a lengthy trip on the East Coast. Phoenix finished 2\u20134, the other win coming against Chicago. NBA Betting Trends: Under is 13-3 in WAS last 16 overall. Under is 8-2 in WAS last 10 road games. WAS are 6-2 ATS in their last 8 Thu. games. Over is 7-1 in PHO last 8 Thu. games. Over is 7-2 in PHO last 9 vs. Eastern Conference. PHO are 2-6 ATS in their last 8 Thu. games. Head to Head: Under is 7-2-1 in the last 10 meetings.
