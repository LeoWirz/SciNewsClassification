I have an item currently for auction and the bidding cycle that is occurring is a bit confusing to me. I'm not exactly sure what I should do.\nIn a moment, I'll post the bidding history (with ebay ids changed), but here are some thoughts/questions before I do that:\n1. Bidder 3 joined eBay on December 5, 2017. Bidder 4 joined eBay on May 5, 2005 and has 100% positive feedback for the last 12 months (with a total of 204 feedback received)\n2. It appears that Bidder 3 asked me to cancel their bid but then placed another bid 3 minutes later.\n3. If Bidder 3 actually does want their bid(s) canceled, it seems fair to me to cancel all the bids that have come after Bidder 4's $45.00 bid - since the increaes in bid amounts was due to the back-and-forth between Bidder 4 and Bidder 3 (who now wants their bid canceled).\n4. Wy would Bidder 4 bid almost $19.00 more than the $26.45 bid?\n5.

Neurovascular guidewires are used to treat aneurysms and cerebral arteriovenous abnormalities conditions by placing stent or coils in intracranial locations. Neurovascular guidewires are inserted into the patient body through a small incision. There are different type of neurovascular guidewires available based on the requirement and for applications such as heart, liver or kidney. The properties of neurovascular guidewires such as stiffness, flexibility, low friction navigation, hydrophilic coating, and torqueability are plays an important role in the use of neurovascular guidewires during treatment.

It is very exciting for all of us. It is a good omen to everybody in the PDP.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the founding fathers, one of those who built this party and he is coming back home. His room was never occupied, so we have opened it for him.\n\n\u201cHe will be part of this convention. He will even make a speech at the convention but he may not be voting at the convention.\u201d\n\nChapter 2 (Part 1) of the party\u2019s constitution deals with admission of members into the party.\n\nOn Procedure for rejoining, Sections 8 and 9 explain, \u201cA person, who desires to rejoin the party after leaving it shall apply to his Ward Secretary for re-admission; and unless given a waiver by the National Working Committee, he willbe placed on probation for a period of not less than one year.\n\n\u201cSubject to the provision of Section 8(b), a member on probation shall have the right to attend all meetings of the party, but shall not be entitled to vote at such meetings, nor shall he be eligible to contest elective office on the platform of the party.\u201d\n\nOne of our correspondents gathered that the party was planning to amend the above sections at the convention.\n\nThe expected amendment will place returnees on six months probation before they could contest any position or be voted for.\n\nAtiku, who was a foundation member of the party, defected to the All Progressives Congress in 2014, claiming that the then opposition party would be his \u201clast bus stop.\u201d\n\nHowever, he left the APC about a week ago, and returned to the PDP on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, Adeyeye has alleged that some agents of the Federal Government were planning to disrupt the party\u2019s national convention.\n\nHe said the former ruling party had what he described as credible information that some overzealous elements in the government were planning to disrupt the convention.\n\nStating that there was nothing to show that President Muhammadu Buhari was part of the plot, the spokesman pleaded with the President to intervene and caution the unnamed aides.\n\nAdeyeye added, \u201cThey have been trying every effort but we are happy that we have no information that it is coming from the very top.\n\n\u201cBut some overzealous elements in the administration are bent on disrupting it. It is very credible information. They are doing everything possible to make sure that this convention is disrupted.\n\n\u201cThey are afraid that if the PDP should hold a successful convention, that their days in government are numbered.\n\n\u201cBy the time we hold this convention and our officers are elected and they take offices next year, there will be a floodgate of people even from the APC to the PDP.\n\n\u201cThis is credible information and that is why we are appealing to President Buhari to please rein in his aides. We have evidence that the President is aware of this.\n\n\u201cIt is happening and we are calling on him to do his own investigation and to call those who are trying to cause this problem to desist because it is capable not only of destroying this democracy but also capable of destroying the country.\u201d\n\nIn another development, the Chairman of the Convention Planning Committee, who is also the Governor of Delta State, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, has summoned all the 37 state chairmen of the party to an emergency meeting.\n\nThe meeting, which will hold in Abuja on Friday, it was gathered, would enable Okowa to discuss the delegates\u2019 list.\n\nThere are rumours that some persons are planning to tamper with the list.\n\nAdeyeye, however, said there was no truth in the allegation, stating that the list would be made available to each aspirant at least 48 hours before the convention.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "atiku abubakar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atiku will speak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammadu buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atiku", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adeyeye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dayo adeyeye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ifeanyi okowa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pdp  the peoples democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "all progressives congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national caretaker committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "convention planning committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pdp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national working committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delta state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abuja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eagle square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:25.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9b18694daaa1bd9e66e665424f0a2cde16086f1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9kf_ixKeaBu_G6s8eqbdCREUkGGnM5JgbrgpvtwmfbQNYihF6FulEjiJfCdAzFFNnuojNP2wuJvSZntMBtyISLrEolKfSDqZg-", "site_full": "www.fixya.com", "site": "fixya.com", "site_section": "http://www.fixya.com/troubleshoot/browse/computers/problems", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Unanswered Computer and Internet Questions &amp; Open Problems - Fixya ", "title": "I accidentally deleted my daughter on Facebook we have both", "title_full": "I accidentally deleted my daughter on Facebook we have both - Fixya", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3514, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b18694daaa1bd9e66e665424f0a2cde16086f1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9kf_ixKeaBu_G6s8eqbdCREUkGGnM5JgbrgpvtwmfbQNYihF6FulEjiJfCdAzFFNnuojNP2wuJvSZntMBtyISLrEolKfSDqZg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jan Latta", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "I accidentally deleted my daughter on Facebook we have both", "text": "I accidentally deleted my daughter on Facebook we have both tried to be friends again but have been unsuccessful.

Ancestors are from Russia , Ukraine . Contents [ show ] \nPozvizd Vladimirovich is the a of Vladimir Svyatoslavich , mentioned only in the annalistic list of Vladimir's sons. Due to the fact that he is listed on this list as the penultimate one, it is concluded that Pozvizd was the younger sons of Vladimir . Nothing more about him is knon. \nA bearer of a name unique to the princely dynasty, which coincides with the name of a pagan deity (Slavic wind god Pozvizda ). He was born not later than 988 , that is, before the adoption of Christianity, as evidenced by his name. \nSome researchers considered him not a son, but a nephew of Vladimir . It is not known who exactly was his mother, and also whether he owned any destiny in Russia. According to the Gustinsky Chronicle, he had possession in Volhynia . The time of death is unknown. \nNA Baumgarten, for unknown reasons, identified Pozvizd with Khrisohir (Zolotoruky), who led the campaign against Russia against Byzantium in 1024 .

Already experiencing the epitome of speed and luxury in air travel, passengers are now able to stay connected aboard their flights via Wi-Fi. \u201cThe Citation X\u2019s Wi-Fi upgrade is just another addition to the vast amenities we provide our clients,\u201d said David Riley, Director of Operations at RAI. \u201cWe know our clients expect the best while on board our jets, and now they can benefit from staying totally connected in the air.\u201d\nThe Citation X, one of the fastest civilian jets available for charter travel, joined RAI\u2019s fleet in May 2017 and received FAA approval in August. RAI\u2019s Citation X already made history when former owner Steve Fossett used it to make the record-breaking flight from San Diego to Charleston, South Carolina in under three hours.\nOn board the Citation X is a Gogo ATG 4000, offering fully wireless mobile broadband service. The speed and reliability of the ATG 4000 is on par with broadband one would find in the home or office.\n\u201cOur clients can now accomplish anything in the air that they would be able to do on the ground. From surfing the web on their tablets, to participating in important virtual meetings, to logging in to their corporate networks on their laptops, our clients don\u2019t have to sacrifice connectivity for speed and comfort,\u201d Riley commented.\nIn addition to the WiFi service, the Citation X will be upgraded with the Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast system (ADS-B) to accommodate the next generation of air traffic modernization. This will fulfill the FAA requirement that aircraft operating in certain airspace must be equipped with ADS-B by January 1, 2020.\nRAI is currently accepting charter flights on the newly upgraded Citation X from over 5,000 airports nationwide.

I was actually very happy with the way my case settled and I think I got a great result, but it came at a high cost both emotionally and financially.\nThere were a couple of items that I thought were unfair and my consulting lawyers said that it would probably be decided in my ex's favor in court. I protested and was furious and the said \"Look, you're in the right here morally and logically. But we don't know how the judge will rule and we feel it'll likely favor your stbx. BUT... it would almost certainly be overturned at appeal because we can cite case law that the judge in the lower court has the discretion to ignore based on what he FEELS IS BEST for the parties and the children.\" So my choice was to acquiesce on something that cost me 50k or spend 75k and 3 years fighting it at appeal.\nIt sounded insane to me but that was what many of my friends who went through the courts said they experienced as well.

The chip is a significant, but stepwise enhancement of its 835 widely used in smartphones and angling for new kinds of sockets including PCs with cellular modems. \nThe SoC sports redesigned CPU and GPU blocks and a new layer of cache to boost performance 25-30 percent and support features such as Ultra HD Premium video encoding. The advance is impressive given the SoC is built in the Samsung 10nm node and fits in the same 12mm 2 package as the 835. \nThe 845 debuts at a precarious time for the chip vendor that dominates a maturing smartphone market. Qualcomm is trying to close an acquisition of NXP to extend its reach into automotive and the Internet of Things. Meanwhile, rival Broadcom launched a hostile takeover bid that could radically alter its structure and culture. \nAnalysts generally praised the chip and were upbeat on Qualcomm\u2019s market position, but expressed uncertainty about its future as a standalone company. \nThe 845 is \u201ca significant upgrade \u2014 to get 25-30 percent performance in the same general process node is huge\u2026they touched every part of the SoC,\u201d said Jim McGregor, principal of Tirias Research. \nQualcomm dominates premium smartphones except for Apple, Huawei and Samsung handsets using in-house chips. Meanwhile its closest rival among merchant suppliers, Mediatek, has been late with its last two parts, he said. \nSeparately, Mediatek announced three of its SoCs will appear early next year in entry-level and mainstream handsets with up to a Gbyte of memory running Android Oreo (Go edition). Mediatek SoCs ran second to Snapdragon which was used in 46 percent of global Android smartphones that shipped in the first three quarters of 2017, according to International Data Corp. Qualcomm showed several demos with working 845 chips. (Images EE Times) \nMcGregor expects Qualcomm will close its bid to buy NXP, but doubts the combined company can escape Broadcom, known for slashing costs and selling off parts of the companies it buys. \u201cFrom a financial perspective it looks almost inevitable,\u201d that shareholders will approve the bid by Broadcom which has seen its stock price soar ahead of Qualcomm over the last five years, McGregor said. \n\u201cThe only thing that might change it is if Qualcomm completes the NXP deal then quickly goes after another company such as Marvell/Cavium,\u201d he added. \n\u201cIt would be a sorry, sorry day for the industry if Broadcom is successful \u2014 it will demoralize employees, there will be a brain drain and Broadcom will end up with an empty shell,\u201d said Jon Peddie, principal of Jon Peddie Research. \nQualcomm is nearly alone in designing custom GPU, DSP and other cores for its mobile SoC. With the exception of Apple that Peddie believes will add a custom DSP to its portfolio soon, others generally use licensed cores, he said. \nThe 845 is \u201cmore than an upgrade, they have re-architected three major components \u2014 all three of which contribute to AI and connected PCs,\" Peddie said. The biggest advance is its support for an Ultra HD Premium video standard that will make 845 handsets \u201cas good if not better than the best TVs,\u201d Peddie said, adding he expects derivatives of the chip will power future TVs.
