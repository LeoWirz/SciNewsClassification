Wearing waders while fly fishing near Redmond, Shewey noticed a rare black swift flying overhead \u2014 a little-known resident of the canyon. Standing near a small island in the middle of the river, Shewey put down his rod and reached into his bag for a large lens and digital SLR camera body. \u201cI immediately dropped them into the water,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cLuckily the lens survived, but the camera body didn\u2019t.\u201d If the perils of an avian photographer seem tame compared to more daring lines of outdoor photography, Shewey, a former Central Oregon resident who has authored or co-authored nearly 20 books, mostly guides and tomes about fly fishing and fly tying, said that\u2019s the point. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely not risking life and limb,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what makes bird photography really approachable for anyone with a long lens.\u201d And a good insurance policy for your camera. \u201cBirds of the Pacific Northwest\u201d was published in March by Portland-based Timber Press. As a part of its Field Guide series, the book joins titles dedicated to the trees, mushrooms and natural history of the Pacific Northwest. Many bird books have been devoted to the West, but few to the region encapsulating Oregon, Washington, Idaho and southern British Columbia. By narrowing the focus, Shewey and co-author Tim Blount, lifelong avian photographers, were able to devote more images and information to each bird. Each species is treated to two photographs and descriptions that touch on the species\u2019 characteristics, appearance, behaviors and habitat. Shewey and Blount spent a year compiling more than 900 photographs of approximately 450 birds found in the region. Shewey snapped about 300 himself, while Blount, who also contributed images, designed the range maps. The two shared research and writing duties to come up with the detailed text. While they licensed some images from Shutter Stock, a stock photography company, Shewey and Blount scoured the internet and their Rolodexes alike for regional bird photographers who could round out their book with professional-grade imagery. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to get a \u2018good\u2019 photo of those birds. It has to be diagnostic so that it shows the field marks, so readers can identify those birds,\u201d Shewey said. \u201cWe had to go beyond good bird photos.\u201d As for Shewey, he shot some of his most memorable contributions during visits to Central Oregon, where the Salem resident lived during the 1990s. While on Black Butte, which is a popular site for black-backed woodpeckers, Shewey heard the distinctive call of the mountain quail \u2014 an elusive bird he didn\u2019t know lived on the butte. Returning before sunrise to a spot where he\u2019d found mountain quail tracks, Shewey concealed himself after situating the eventual sunrise at his back \u2014 an ideal lighting angle \u2014 and waited. None came. It took three outings until a male mountain quail walked into the clearing. He clicked off two shots before it disappeared. \u201cThat was the big \u2018project bird\u2019 for me. It was a monumental effort,\u201d Shewey said. \u201cI got a little bit obsessive by climbing up Black Butte at 4 in the morning.\u201d A collegial community Shewey never considered filling the book with illustrations. Compensating for such work wouldn\u2019t \u201chave been tenable in terms of economics and time,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine the task of painting 400 birds let alone photographing 400 birds.\u201d That Shewey and Blount couldn\u2019t pay contributors was completely fine for hobbyist photographer Jim Hardman, a retired lumber mill manager from Eugene. Shewey had met Hardman while in Central Oregon, which they shared a bird blind \u2014 or a small, camouflaged viewing tent \u2014 from which they photographed songbirds. Hardman, 74, contributed more than 20 images. It\u2019s his first time having his photographs published, in book-form or otherwise. \u201cIt means a great deal to me to have photos published,\u201d said Hardman, who has captured about 450 species in his private collection of more than 13,000 images. Hardman picked up avian photography when he retired in 2010 as a way to stay active. Of the photos that appear in the book, Hardman said photographing the American bittern proved a challenge, even though the tall, slender birds habituate the grassy marshland at the Fern Ridge Reservoir near his home. What makes it a difficult subject is the way the bird\u2019s plumage blends with the tall grass. In order to find them before a contrasting background, Hardman draped himself in a netting that matched the color of the nearby reeds. That his doggedness would not earn a paycheck didn\u2019t bother Hardman. \u201cThere are some photographs floating around on the internet that are excellent,\u201d Hardman said. \u201cI was appreciative of John (Shewey) recognizing my photos as being worthy of being put in print.\u201d Shewey contacted Michelle Lamberson, a British Columbia photographer, after he found her work on her Flickr account. She contributed eight photos, including one of the persnickety, camera-ruining black swift. Lamberson, an educational administrator at the University of British Columbia\u2019s Okanagan campus, has contributed avian photography to scholarly works, birding magazines, and the \u201cBirders Guide to Vancouver and the Lower Mainland,\u201d whose cover bears one of her images. In \u201cBirds of the Pacific Northwest,\u201d Lamberson is most satisfied with her scenery shot of a large flock of dunlins in Boundary Bay. A hobbyist who rarely sells her photography, she said it felt good to give back to birders, whose ranks she joined later in life. \u201cThe birding community is by nature a collegial, sharing community,\u201d Lamberson wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to be able to contribute back to that community and help others understand birds better.\u201d A local\u2019s touch To ensure the originality of \u201cBirds of the Pacific Northwest,\u201d Shewey and Blount cross-referenced a variety of source texts, which included some field guides but largely depended on obscure avian reports and scientific papers that dig deeper than typical bird books. \u201cWe used everything available to us,\u201d Shewey said. \u201cAnd layered on top of that is our own experience in the Pacific Northwest.\u201d Shewey and Blount, who lives in Sherwood, found flaws in the range descriptions of some field guides dedicated to the West or to the entire country. By narrowing the scope, \u201cWe were able use our local knowledge to enhance the range descriptions,\u201d Shewey said. \u201cWe were able to recommend some key locations for people to have a pretty good chance of seeing these birds.\u201d Shewey and Blount had fun creating original, phonetic descriptions of their bird calls, which they studied via online recordings. \u201cWe wanted to have our own interpretation,\u201d he said, acknowledging the challenge. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to convert any call or song into the English language to describe it, you could play the call to 10 people and they would give you 10 different descriptions.\u201d Shewey\u2019s favorite bird call is the red-breasted nuthatch\u2019s. Thin and tinny, it commonly echoes through Central Oregon forests. Shewey declined to do an impression. \u201cThe best description I ever heard was that the red-breasted nuthatch sounds like a mallard duck on helium,\u201d he said. \u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7816, ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john shewey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shewey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "black butte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lamberson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blount", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hardman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim blount", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelle lamberson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eugene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim hardman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "timber press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific northwest", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pacific northwest view", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "redmond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okanagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boundary bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fern ridge reservoir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle deschutes river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sherwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idaho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific northwest", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:22.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9cb54a56ec36bc194450aa48fd07d4e3514bac6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3KOuLOiOhyUutbwicLraYYYAbOt3oTNtbMuwQ1gmXXv9mAdZu23e0HTH0N.wYsLb8grGGwtJcfAOA--", "site_full": "eflt.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://eflt.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bert EFL Teacher", "title": "5C EFL Group 6 20171207", "title_full": "5C EFL Group 6 20171207", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9cb54a56ec36bc194450aa48fd07d4e3514bac6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3KOuLOiOhyUutbwicLraYYYAbOt3oTNtbMuwQ1gmXXv9mAdZu23e0HTH0N.wYsLb8grGGwtJcfAOA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bert EFL Teacher (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "5C EFL Group 6 20171207", "text": "5C EFL Group 6 20171207   Warm-up: RR   practice Homework check: Finished individual work Individual work: AB24/2 check Homework: AB25/3 Read about Gordon and Gertie.

Beyond simple fetches however PycURL exposes most of the functionality of libcurl, including: Speed - libcurl is very fast and PycURL, being a thin wrapper above libcurl, is very fast as well. PycURL was benchmarked to be several times faster than requests . Features including multiple protocol support, SSL, authentication and proxy options. PycURL supports most of libcurl\u2019s callbacks. Multi and share interfaces.

December 7, 2017 share Photo: Carolyn Hall \nPaul Sng\u2019s film Dispossession: the Great Social Housing Swindle lays bare the current state of the housing of the working classes\u201d in Britain. I purposely use the phrase \u2018working classes\u2019 as this as the term used in all Acts of Parliament published before over 60 years until 1949. The housing of the poorest in society has, since the late 19 th century, been treated as variously a campaign against moral degeneracy, poverty, ill health and crime. But as Sng\u2019s film demonstrates \u2013 the need for housing is not limited to these characteristics, as a bulwark against elite fears of social breakdown. Rather, it should be an inalienable right of all people as defined by the United Nations Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. \nThe stories documented by Sng set out the dramatic transformation of the concept of social housing from an egalitarian and philanthropic post-war housing boom (800,000 council houses built under the Attlee Government of 1945-1951) to the speculatively built, profit driven, regeneration of British social housing in the early 21 st Century. This transformation has resulted in huge numbers of people being dispossessed, rehomed in remote parts of London, from the Aylesbury and Heygate Estates residents whom are heard from in the film. This dispossession is not, as it was in the middle of the 20 th Century, driven by a desire to rehouse the poor in better homes provided by the State. But by the desire of cash-strapped local government, often inner city Labour run councils, to create albeit short term revenue from property sell offs and to reduce expenditure. One of the missing elements from Sng\u2019s portrayal is that these local authorities come under significant attack with only a few occasions in the whole 80 minutes in which the focus is shifted back the austerity agenda of central government that is driving the biggest sell of of social housing since Right to Buy. The rationale presented by local authorities and central government is one of a desire to regenerate areas of central London through the sale of land to private development corporations whose sole purpose is to make millions of pounds in property sales. \nThe significant shift in Britain since the 1980 \u201cRight to Buy\u201d Housing Act was however the beginning of the end of social housing in Britain, and all Governments, Labour and Tory, since have been responsible for its continued demise. As the film sets out, in 1980 42% of people lived council housing, in 2017 it is 8% with 1.4 million people on the housing waiting list. By 1996 2.2 million council dwellings had been bought under Right to Buy over 30% of the housing stock, none of which were replaced. \nThe London Labour Borough Councils of Southwark and Lambeth and the (until May 2017) Labour City Council of Glasgow come in for particular criticism from many of the residents and contributors to the film. Both London Boroughs control huge numbers of social homes ( 39,000 in Southwark in 2013 ) with parts of both Boroughs being prime locations. This has led to the flagship redevelopment of Elephant and Castle with the Heygate Estate and the Aylesbury Estate nearby in Walworth being significant case studies in the film. The seemingly far too cosy, or even (in the accusations levelled by some tenants in the film) corrupt, relationships between Southwark\u2019s Labour councillors and developers being in evidence. Lambeth\u2019s attention is, however, focussed on the more salubrious suburban parts of the Borough with the estate of Cressingham Gardens again being key case study for the film. Councillors who appear in the film claim that the only way decent affordable homes can be provided for all people in the Borough is through the sale and demolition of existing social housing and rebuilding. The term \u201caffordable home\u201d refers to owner-occupation and whilst this is not particularly analysed in this film, this is something of a relative concept in London especially where the average house price in June 2017 was over \u00a3480,000. Compared to levels of compensation being offered to some home owners on these estates in the film being given as less than \u00a3200,000. \nThe web of interrelationships between developers, central and local government is given particularly attention by Sng and ultimately this is the message conveyed by Dispossession . The process of decanting of residents, particularly tenants, and the demolitions and redevelopment of their homes amounts to social cleansing. This is an accurate term, as the spokesperson for Architects for Social Housing says in the film, although \u201cgentrification\u201d has been used to describe the process. This, however, is incorrect, as gentrification is gradual; what is now happening in London is social cleansing. \nBut this is not the first time the demolition of \u201cslums\u201d and the building of new dwellings at higher rents meant many previous tenants could not move back into an area. This has been a process in the redevelopment of housing since the first council estate was built at the Boundary in Shoreditch, replacing the notorious Old Nichol Rookery in 1890. As presenter Michael Collins said in the 2011 BBC film The Great Estate: The Rise and Fall of the Council House only 11 of the over 5,000 people evicted from Old Nichol could afford to move back. Dispossession suggests we have reverted to a situation that last existed over 120 years ago. Dispossession covers much of the same ground as The Great Estate , but with a far less optimistic tone. Whilst The Great Estate ends on a low note, the tone of the film, in contrast to Dispossession , is an optimistic look at the council housing projects. Dispossession can be seen as the swan song of social housing, and the demise of the post-war project of housing the people. \nOne of the more striking moments of the film, is the honesty displayed by the Lord Christopher Monckton, who in the 1980s was a key advisor to Margaret Thatcher. Monckton says that \u201conce people became home owners they were far more likely to vote Conservative\u201d than were the social housing tenants. This perhaps gives us a clearer insight, than any of the other (there are admittedly very limited other contributions in the film from politicians and policy makers) as to the real motivations of the powers that be. The attempt by Thatcher in the 1980s to realise Harold Macmillian\u2019s dream of property-owning democracy has ended in rather spectacular failure. The rate of home ownership is now failing and younger generations (Millennials onwards) will struggle to ever own their own home, despite the changing fashion in social mores towards home ownership being the one desirable and viable form of tenure. The market as imposed on housing by Thatcher and continued by all Governments since 1980 has not and cannot work. As Danny Dorling says early in the film \u201cHousing does not work through the market\u2026 as you require an income above the average\u201d to buy, build or own your own home; therefore, social housing is not a luxury we can ill afford but an absolute necessity for any civilised society.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "carolyn hall paul sng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny dorling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret thatcher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harold macmillian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monckton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thatcher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nichol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher monckton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "heygate estates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aylesbury estate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "architects for social housing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london labour borough councils", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heygate estate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "great estate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walworth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cressingham gardens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shoreditch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aylesbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwark", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:23.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a8736a7e9fa17a20e2da93730bb9057fe53edf39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSN40BfT_2buDa3gzwK3_.SgR_79VyOgpMBFwlyXHjNMWeqMxU7qUGjd6qBrLDmY.g5feIRrBupXxX5O04Zm6z5naaRQVW6YO8-", "site_full": "forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com", "site": "kerbalspaceprogram.com", "site_section": "https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/55-suggestions-development-discussion/", "site_categories": ["video_and_computer_games", "science", "adult", "space_astronomy", "hobbies_and_interests", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Suggestions &amp;

Michale Graves, best known for his stint with the first reunion of horror-punk progenitors Misfits from 1995 to 2000, was discussing how he wrote \u201cAll the Troubles,\u201d the song that kicked off the sessions for his introspective acoustic album \u201cBackroads,\u201d released this year. What: Michale Graves, with Chupa Cobra, Poolside Leper Society When: 7 p.m. Friday Where: Domino Room, 51 NW Greenwood Ave., Bend Cost: $20 plus fees View More \u201cI was thinking about my children, and I was playing these chords, and I started to think about that song, (singing) \u2018I\u2019d like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony,\u2019\u201d Graves said while on the road in Fairfax, Minnesota. Graves and his four-piece band bring their Beginning of the End Tour \u2014 complete with classic Misfits songs and makeup \u2014 to the Domino Room on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m like Bono: I\u2019m constantly trying to save the world. So I was thinking about that song, and I started to sing: \u2018I\u2019d like to teach the world a song that makes all your troubles feel like they are gone.\u2019 And I built it off of that. So I think that my compassion for the world and this longing to save my children from any harm or any \u2014 you know, like all parents, like all fathers. I have two daughters and a newborn son, and I want to protect them from all the bad things, whether it\u2019s a cold or World War III.\u201d Fair enough, but U2 \u2014 and Bono especially \u2014 is known for supporting liberal causes, and as anyone who\u2019s followed the Misfits\u2019 \u201990s incarnation and Graves\u2019 subsequent solo career probably knows by now, Graves is an outspoken libertarian. He contributed to the now-defunct ConservativePunk website and has appeared on \u201cThe Howard Stern Show,\u201d \u201cThe Sean Hannity Show\u201d and, quite memorably in 2004, \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d (Graves still laughs about the segment when it comes up). The incongruity was not lost on Graves, who called U2 his \u201cfavorite band ever.\u201d \u201cI guess I could call him a hero of mine,\u201d Graves said. \u201cI like to believe that, regardless of someone like that \u2014 our divisions when it comes to things that we might agree or disagree on \u2014 that a man like that, his heart certainly is in the right place.\u201d This attitude seems to extend to the stage, as well, although once again, Graves doesn\u2019t shy away from speaking his mind. \u201cI\u2019m able to tuck all of that commentary and those themes in there, but in a way where it\u2019s not necessarily in-your-face and preachy,\u201d he said of his live show, before laughing and adding, \u201cwhich I can be, trust me.\u201d The theatric Beginning of the End show, which follows a main character diagnosed as an \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d (the name of the first Misfits reunion album Graves was involved with, in 1997) and also includes roles such as the Gasmask Man and The Lost Skeleton, finds plenty of parallels with the current social and political climate in the U.S. today. This is familiar territory for horror films, stretching back to the much-lauded allegory in \u201cNight of the Living Dead.\u201d In 2012, Graves began working with horror producer Mark Allen Stuart and his Hydraulic Entertainment company, kicking off a career renaissance that has seen Graves release upwards of three albums per year. \u201cOne of the good things about working with somebody like Mark Allen Stewart, who is just the Rain Man of that genre, (is) I can pick his brain, and we talk about the directors and the writers\u2019 intent and the allegories that they were creating in their art,\u201d Graves said. \u201cAnd then what I do is take that allegory and stay true to what they were doing, and try to find something that is current in our times and in my life and then put that into song.\u201d Last year\u2019s \u201cWhen Worlds Collide\u201d is a prime example of this: Each song on the album is named after a horror film. Graves also released an acoustic version of the record titled \u201cBedlam\u201d and an instrumental version, a release pattern he\u2019s repeated for most of his albums since 2012. \u201cBackroads\u201d departs from the usual formula a bit. The roots- and country-influenced songs recall his earlier releases \u201cVagabond\u201d and \u201cWanderer,\u201d which were originally recorded with a full band and then redone acoustically. He took the opposite approach with \u201cBackroads,\u201d and is currently working on the full-band version to be titled \u201cThe World Turned Upside Down.\u201d \u201cWe were really trying to, and I really wanted to put out the ideas first,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThis album came out so naturally and so \u2014 just really from my heart and my soul. We really just wanted to give the straight shot first, and let the songs burrow into the listener that way.\u201d Graves will stick to the horror punk in Bend. He\u2019s been at the forefront of the genre since joining with original Misfits members Jerry Only and Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein at age 19. At the time, Graves was unfamiliar with the Misfits beyond a song or two heard in passing. \u201cI\u2019m an old skate rat, so the days where we would skate to mixtapes, that was my childhood when I heard \u2018Skulls\u2019 and \u2018I Turned into a Martian,\u2019\u201d Graves said. \u201c\u2026 But yeah, I didn\u2019t know the music, and so when it came time for me to audition, I had to go to the record store. I bought \u2018Collection 1\u2019 and \u2018Walk Among Us,\u2019 and eventually all of them. Because once I started to listen to the songs, I knew that it was destiny and all I had to do was hold on and do my best.\u201d After Graves and drummer Dr. Chud left in 2000, Only soldiered on as the only original member until last year, when the band\u2019s first vocalist and primary songwriter Danzig reunited with Only and Doyle for two performances. Another reunion is slated Dec. 30 at The Forum in Los Angeles. Graves said he celebrates the reunion and is \u201cvery, very proud.\u201d He\u2019s also hopeful for a similar reunion with Only and Doyle. \u201cI have great hope that as we approach the anniversary of \u2018American Psycho\u2019 that we as well, that those guys will be able to \u2014 and those guys, I mean Jerry and Doyle and myself \u2014 will be able to, in our own way, put down whatever guns we have pointed at each other, and sit down and move forward and celebrate our great legacy and what we\u2019ve done together.\u201d 18924172 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michale graves", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "domino roo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bono", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danzig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark allen stuart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doyle wolfgang von frankenstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doyle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry only", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark allen stewart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "living dead", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenwood ave.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairfax", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:23.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e0d1f5a0e2de342c169da6442555751decd3106", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl09kn7DYrsQ5kFMbRTk8cP7Shn1rAppowVVgqHNx4iAs9QOKXCuMzTCT_4Yq1BSUH_hMaNqYP_NXJXyjnofqVu85nQxgwHMMvYPNejiCYoxq75sS744XR10-", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[Monster Hunter] World announced for PS4/Xbox one/PC.

The education of women, particularly black women could not have come at a better time; where the idea of progression in society being headed by men is increasingly becoming obsolete and candidly, a lie. Through the years, Globalization has allowed many women and girls the long overdue access to education and other platforms of awareness. This being said, a feminist voice, through feminist writers like Tsitsi Dangarembga, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and many other contributors has risen to further the campaign towards gender equality in every circumstance. The following essay will discuss the advancement of the African feminist project, with particular attention to Adichie\u2019s lecture at TEDx Euston entitled We Should All Be Feminists. \nIn an attempt to understanding African Feminism, it is important that the reader suggests for themselves a \u2018double consciousness \u2019 as disseminated by W.E B Du Bois. This sense involves viewing a situation in the eyes of all identities involved. It has become clear that understanding African feminism is a delicate process of negotiating a number of ideologies that could result in a double edged sword. In some ways African feminism purposefully seeks to be detached from the notions of colonialism, class, race among other things, as a way of explaining the current position of black women in Africa. Nevertheless, the very reason for its promotion is because African women have tried to re\u2010define and re\u2010express the importance of these issues.\nThe idea of African feminism stems from the notion that there exist levels of gender inequalities within different women throughout the world. In this case, African women (in particular, Black women) are in their own right, fighting a different battle from their western white \u2018sisters\u2019. There is a call for more Black women to participate in and influence feminist spaces and discourses. The \u201cBlack experience\u201d aims to identify the issues that surround the modern black African woman who does not have the protection of white privilege, regardless of how educated and/or \u2018successful\u2019 she is. Adichie\u2019s speech seems to speak from that angle. She mentions her financial abilities as those that are equal or better than that of men, yet she is not met with the same treatment as that of her male counterparts; as opposed to Dangarembga, who\u2019s interrogation steers from the insight of a rural/soon to be urbanized Black African girl in her book, Nervous Conditions . Eitherway, this highlights on a serious and arguably the most important issue that perpetuates gender inequality \u2013 Patriarchy.\nPatriarchy, according to Allan Johnson, is the ability to impose one\u2019s will on the behavior of others in spite of their resistance. Gender differences are constructed and legitimized in a patriarchal society. Whatever the particular modes of production it secretes, Patriarchy can first be characterized by the division of humans into sexes, which continues to be expressed by the appropriation and oppression of women and the struggle for power among men. Consequently, African women on the continent and the diaspora become subjected to what is termed \u2018double patriarchy\u2019.\nDouble patriarchy is a system under which sexism, the weapon of patriarchal power and its various manifestations, politically, socially and economically oppress women twice over. Patriarchy not only enslaves the woman, but also subjects the man \u2013 who finds himself having to live up to the pressure to dominate and lead. Adichie continues to elaborate how this demanding notion of masculinity has been assigned a very narrow definition. Man\u2019s need to prove his masculinity leaves him with a fragile ego. \u201cThe more hard-man he is, the weaker his ego\u201d. This continues to highlight the added struggles of being a woman, as if being black was not already a disadvantage. Women are stuck with the disservice of catering to the ego.\nAfrican feminism also promotes the issue of allowing women the freedom of choice when it comes to marriage. A good example of this is Ngugi Wationgo\u2019s I Will Marry When I Want , which highlights that women should not be confined to a crippling idea that marriage is the alpha and omega of their reason for existence. Adichie adeptly reveals society\u2019s assumptions about marriage and how the categories of marriage/singledom have an adverse affect on women more than men. The world today desperately holds on to this belief that the attainment and preservation of a marriage is at the top of every woman\u2019s list of achievements and that if unattached after a certain age, she will be regarded as a freak. For the man, however, his singledom is simply translated as such that he \u201chas not quite come around to making his pick\u201d. Adichie continues to compare the ridiculous luxuries that men have to give up in preparation for marriage to that of \u201ca job, a career goal, and a dream\u201d that women are expected to leave behind. Hilariously so, she follows that with the irony of her unmarried friend, whose desperate attempt to be respected drives her to wearing a wedding ring to conferences.\nAdichie deliberates about the ways in which boys and girls are raised differently. She points this out as the root of the problem; noting that in order for there to be an equal world, it is upon society to raise children to create that equal world.\n\u201cThis is how we raise our girls: we shame them (cover yourself), we police them, we teach them to shrink themselves, we turn them into women who have turned pretense into an art form\u2026We do a great disservice to boys in how we raise them\u2026We stifle the humanity of boys. We define masculinity in a very narrow way. Masculinity is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside this cage.\u201d \nBecause feminism is a movement to aid with the war against sexism and sexist domination and/or oppression, a resistance that includes efforts to end gender discrimination and create equality, it is essentially, to a large extent, a radical movement. Many feminists believe that it is justifiably an angry one too. Adichie freely admits to being angry. However, her feminism \u2013 like her essay, does not stop with anger. \u201cIn addition to being angry, I am also hopeful, because I believe deeply in the ability of human beings to remake them for the better\u201d ,she writes. This is a definitive attribute about We Should All Be Feminists, and what makes it such an appropriate introductory text for those who harbour on little knowledge and/or doubts about the topic of feminism. Throughout the speech Adichie repeatadly chooses compassion and understanding in an effort not to present feminism as an angry agenda against males. She paints feminism as a matter that all of civilization should be concerned with; not just something that spinsters complain about and bestial men disregard.\nIn conclusion, the development of a relevant theoretical model that will complement and enhance activists such as Adichie\u2019s efforts in Africa is much more demanding. It requires that African feminism should move beyond the concept of recognizing and reconciling with the notion of victimhood in the colonial process towards identifying Africa as \u2018participant\u2019 in the different stages of \u2018development\u2019 and not simply as beneficiary. Adichie recognizes that it is not up to women in Africa alone to engage in feminist discourse, but everyone else too. As her speech clearly suggests, the aim is for everyone to create a fresh and fair mindset towards gender equality. African feminism tasks black women to find their own identity \u2013 guided by the similar experiences that they have/had.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tsitsi dangarembga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allan johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ngugi wationgo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dangarembga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "du bois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eitherway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adichie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chimamanda ngozi adichie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:24.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4126fae9a596477d7dd617a8e527e69354466ac4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLv7Ej4RLGCzK6Iy_H6aNT3R4fJWJ7LHMKUU6td0ywTAEw--", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/22813879/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "General Discussion - Overwatch Forums", "title": "torb nerf", "title_full": "torb nerf - Overwatch Forums", "published": "2017-11-05T11:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/overwatch.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93e9764622a7e9dc59cace1459a1ed9e0838b3aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLv7Ej4RLGCzK6Iy_H6aNT3R4fJWJ7LHMKW7zxs.i5BnOcpnDSLhLKek", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Mirrorkat", "published": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "12/06/2017 07:36 PM Posted by ShovelKnight Honestly, they're right, Torb does need a nerf, his turret does to much damage and it has Aim-bot IT CANT MOVE.

One day, the little shrimp decided it was time. \nIn parting from his friends, he simply stated, \u201cI want to go to the sea and then swim all over the world,\u201d and then set out as energetically and confidently as ever. That night, after reaching the sea, the now tired shrimp began looking for a safe place to sleep.

This was the nose hole of a big sea bream. As the little shrimp was getting comfortable, the sea bream began to feel more and more uncomfortable. Suddenly, the sea bream couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and let out a huge explosion of a sneeze. Naturally, the little shrimp was sent flying through the water helpless against the power of the sea bream\u2019s super sneeze.

The Republican-led House passed a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \nThe House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines \u2013 a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. \nOn a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty \u2014 who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting \u2013 said the bill would undermine states' rights, \"hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,\" according to The Associated Press. \nThe NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a \"watershed\" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure \"all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.\" \nIn the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats.

(AP) \u2014 Time-consuming paper transactions slowed business Thursday in North Carolina's largest metro area as a county government began the dayslong process of restoring computer systems locked down by a ransomware attack. Mecklenburg County was using backed-up data to make digital repairs after refusing to pay foreign hackers that froze dozens of county servers earlier this week. In the meantime, services ranging from processing jail inmates to paying tax bills had to be done by hand. Darryl Broome, a contractor who does remodeling and demolition work, went in person to a county office to retrieve land information he normally could look up on his home computer. He had to drive 10 miles and spent about a half-hour looking through paper records. \"It's a bit frustrating because you learn that you really need certain things online,\" he said. \"You get used to doing certain things online, and when you have to slow down, it costs you time and time costs you money.\" The county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government said its separate computer system wasn't affected by the attack. Nor were the computers that handle 911 calls and dispatch for the city and county, said Charlotte Fire Department Deputy Chief Richard Granger. Many county-run services have been delayed. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said Wednesday it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. Meanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, while code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. County manager Dena Diorio said workers were putting a priority on fixing the systems that power transactions for the health department, court system and the department that oversees building codes and environmental services. Cyberattacks on local government are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated. Security experts say Mecklenburg County followed the right steps before and after the cyberattack, including declining to pay the ransom. \"Unfortunately, it's become all too common,\" said Lawrence Abrams, who runs the cyber security site bleepingcomputer.com. \"It's smart not to pay the ransom if you can avoid it. In paying these ransoms, it's obviously encouraging others.\" Counties in Indiana and Alabama are among those that have paid ransoms to regain access to data after a cyberattack since late last year. The Montgomery Advertiser reported that the Montgomery County, Alabama, faced disruptions to some operations even after paying hackers in September. Other public organizations have chosen to restore and not pay. In November 2016, a ransomware attack on San Francisco's transit system resulted in officials shutting down ticketing machines, allowing free rides for much of a weekend. But transit officials didn't pay a ransom. The St. Louis library system said it took days to restore electronic services for patrons and weeks more to fix all of its computers after it refused to pay hackers behind a ransomware attack this year. Ross Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said Mecklenburg County appears to have done a good job of backing up its data if it's able to restore the system without paying the hackers. \"It seems like the county was fairly well-prepared,\" he said. \"Overall, this is not as bad of a story as it could have been.\" Mecklenburg County computers were hit Monday after an employee opened an email attachment containing malicious software, Diorio said. The attack as publicly revealed the next day. Hackers had sought digital currency worth more than $23,000 to unlock the data. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. Without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system using backup data. ___ Drew reported from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Follow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

Millions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. Officials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. Melissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" In what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. The wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. Little flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. Flames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. Across the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. Back in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. Air tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles.

On Wednesday morning, the Deschutes County Commission deliberated on a potential amendment to the county\u2019s code that would affect whether churches are allowed in a portion of the county zoned to protect mule deer and other animals. Conservationists and some county residents are concerned that allowing churches could stress Deschutes County\u2019s shrinking deer populations, but other residents believe the provision violates religious freedoms and could lead to a lawsuit stemming from a federal law. \u201cI think our country was built by people with strong religious faiths,\u201d said Phil Henderson, Deschutes County commissioner, during the deliberation Wednesday. During the deliberation, Deschutes County Planning Manager Peter Gutowsky presented the commissioners with five options, ranging from leaving county code as it is, to striking the word \u201cchurch\u201d from the list of prohibited uses, allowing churches in the wildlife zone even during the winter, when the deer use the range. The three commissioners expressed their desire for churches not to be singled out as a prohibited use. However, Commissioner Tammy Baney added that she wanted to see a compromise that allows small Bible studies and other gatherings in the zone, while providing a backstop against large events during the winter. \u201cI think the desire would not be to allow, without any sort of review to mitigate impacts, large-scale outdoor activities,\u201d Baney said. The amendment stems from a long-running dispute between Deschutes County and John Shepherd, a pastor who operates a church out of his home located in the Metolius winter deer range, where churches are prohibited. Shepherd has held church services and conducted weddings on his 216-acre property outside Sisters since 1999, but was notified he was in violation of county code three years ago. The Land Use Board of Appeals overturned a permit for Shepherd\u2019s church in 2016, on the basis that the county\u2019s code explicitly prohibits churches. Since then, Shepherd has turned his attention to the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, a federal law signed by President Bill Clinton in 2000. Shepherd believes the county\u2019s code represents a clear violation of the law, which is designed to protect houses of worship from discrimination by local governments. The county held a public hearing Nov. 6, where the commission heard testimony both in favor of Shepherd\u2019s position, and on behalf of Deschutes County\u2019s deer population, which has declined since the 1970s. Additionally, 44 people provided written testimony, roughly split between support for religious freedom, and those supporting continued restriction in the county\u2019s winter deer range. Shepherd said after the meeting that he would not file a lawsuit on any amendment that removes churches from the list of prohibited uses, though he\u2019d prefer an outcome that allows outdoor events on his property during the winter. \u201cI\u2019m open to a reasonable compromise,\u201d Shepherd said. Gutowsky said county staff would prepare a draft of an amendment following board\u2019s guidance, which would be reviewed Dec. 18. \u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7818, ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "phil henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tammy baney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shepherd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gutowsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter gutowsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john shepherd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "land use board of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deschutes county commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "deschutes county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:25.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "09fdb31b91ad62c9a5f82e414814cf259abc8b5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTbdNR9bqQ0smjpA0LAjXbE1aNavcYqraN6irMbSzF2voA6YBBzwUdLS0iaVPb.M4iTrb7B3Ec1Q.C27BSXcBvp", "site_full": "blog.gaijinpot.com", "site": "gaijinpot.com", "site_section": "http://www.newsonjapan.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "News On Japan", "title": "We Asked Readers to Describe Japan in Just 2 words", "title_full": "We Asked Readers to Describe Japan in Just 2 words", "published": "2017-12-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 39482, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "09fdb31b91ad62c9a5f82e414814cf259abc8b5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTbdNR9bqQ0smjpA0LAjXbE1aNavcYqraN6irMbSzF2voA6YBBzwUdLS0iaVPb.M4iTrb7B3Ec1Q.C27BSXcBvp", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "blogsonjapan", "published": "2017-12-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "We Asked Readers to Describe Japan in Just 2 words", "text": "Source: Gaijin Pot \nHow would you describe Japan?

Kohli is also the No. 1 batsman in ODIs and T20Is, but trails Steven Smith by 45 points in Tests, leaving him short of emulating Ricky Ponting as the only batsman to hold the top rank across formats at the same time. \nKohli scored 610 runs in five innings in the Test series against Sri Lanka, making a hundred and back-to-back double centuries. The 243 in the third Test in Delhi was Kohli's career-best score, and helped him overtake David Warner, Cheteshwar Pujara, Kane Williamson and Joe Root in the rankings. \nWhile Kohli has 893 points, Smith's lead is considerable in Tests - his tally of 941 last week was the joint fifth-highest in Test history. Smith is presently on 938 points. Ponting held the No. 1 rank simultaneously across formats in 2005-06, and Matthew Hayden is the only other batsman to have been top-ranked across formats. \nFor Sri Lanka, their captain Dinesh Chandimal broke into the top ten for the first time in his career: he moved up eight spots and is presently ninth after making 366 runs in the Test series against India. \nClick here to see the comprehensive list of player rankings.

The harassment dollars are paid out via the Office of Compliance or OOC , which was created through the Congressional Accountability Act or CAA . So Congress used a piece of legislation that was supposed to help eliminate harassment of any kind, to secretly payout Taxpayer Dollars (since signed, non-disclosure papers were a required item to obtain settlement payouts) when the rules of the OOC were broken.. The OOC was established and used as a coverup to hid Congressional foul play. Just follow the Office of Compliance Forms link listed on the OOC homepage...And please, someone tell my why do the harassed need to fill out a request for counseling forms, especially when the harasser's do not? Filling out an incident report form would seem to be the logical item required to start an investigation, not counseling! The counseling may come later if after a factual review uncovers no indication of harassment...Well at least to me. \nI will not go into whether anyone in Politics is guilty or not. This very short blog entry is only concerned with a horrible misuse of Taxpayer funds. I keep hearing Politicians saying this is wrong and they want legislation to stop it, but that's not enough for me. I want all the miscreants who have used public money, for their own benefit, to have to pay it back to the treasury. I also want the OOC totally bereft of the power to dip into treasury funds to benefit overly, compensated Congressmen. \n\n\n                                                                                                   \n\nCheck out this !

The Bend City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to allow homeowners in a 550-home area in southeast Bend to keep repairing their septic systems as the city continues to look for the best way to connect these new homes. City code now requires any property within 300 feet of a sewer line to connect to the sewer instead of repairing a failing septic system. An interim solution is necessary because of how quickly the new southeast interceptor sewer line is being completed, City Manager Eric King said. \u201cThe southeast interceptor is ahead of schedule,\u201d King said. \u201cIt\u2019s moving a lot faster than we expected.\u201d Portions of the sewer line under Murphy Road, King Solomon Lane, Orion Drive, Camelot Place, Reed Market Road and 27th Street have been completed. The final portion, under Neff Road and Purcell Boulevard, is now under construction and is expected to be finished in the spring. The city estimates connecting to the sewer as septic systems fail would cost property owners between $30,000 and $80,000. Currently, connecting to the sewer could also be more expensive for some residents than others. If a property owner who lives 290 feet from the sewer line has his or her septic system fail first, he or she would have to pay for a whole section of pipe connecting back to the main line. Neighbors who live closer would be able to tie into the pipe laid by the first property owner. Instead, the city is considering paying for the connections through such mechanisms as a local improvement tax district, connection charges, sewer surcharges or separate sewer rates in the area. It will take some time for the city to figure out how to pay for those new sewer connections. In the meantime, Wednesday\u2019s decision provides options for three types of homes with failing septic systems: homes directly along the main sewer line, homes within 300 feet and homes more than 300 feet away but included in the 550-home study area. Homes directly along the sewer line and near a stub out in the pipe must connect to the sewer when their septic systems fail. The other two types could continue repairing their septic systems, provided they agree to eventually connect to the sewer and accept whatever financing strategy the city settles on. \u2014\u2009Reporter: 541-633-2160; ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "solomon lane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric king", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "city council", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "reed market road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "purcell boulevard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orion drive", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murphy road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neff road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camelot place", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:26.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3071d524855aae01c6ec236c66683d9a2d7d9666", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KvZtRHOQUvzzuNjKVN5oGdPesY9QyY4mK864ypCX0GTohP0ly3Ur6oVB.EhhrHOXbclZIxEquB0Kx9296naIozOn9r4O74LSigNfQTcnA6w--", "site_full": "www.bendbulletin.com", "site": "bendbulletin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "X-Hop beers on tap at Worthy Brewing; Experimental tasting series returns to Bend brewery", "title_full": "X-Hop beers on tap at Worthy Brewing; Experimental tasting series returns to Bend brewery", "published": "2017-12-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.043, "main_image": "http://www.bendbulletin.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=QGUOcwt36nRaHMvOkvJZ$M$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYu8GeYtgKJNJ$nxX7J_N9bqWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 93497, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3071d524855aae01c6ec236c66683d9a2d7d9666", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KvZtRHOQUvzzuNjKVN5oGdPesY9QyY4mK864ypCX0GTohP0ly3Ur6oVB.EhhrHOXbclZIxEquB0Kx9296naIozOn9r4O74LSigNfQTcnA6w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jon Abernathy", "published": "2017-12-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "X-Hop beers on tap at Worthy Brewing; Experimental tasting series returns to Bend brewery", "text": "View stories and bio Worthy Brewing Co. continues to provide one of the more interesting brewery destinations in the region. Beyond the brewery, pub and beer garden, visitors are treated to the sights of growing hops (in the summer), the greenhouse and Garden Club, and, completed this year, the domed observatory. At its core, however, Worthy is still about the beer, and this year the brewery has been bustling with several notable projects. The brewery showcased a new hop variety, Strata, with the release of the eponymously named Strata IPA early in the year. Worthy has a special connection to the development of this hop, as owner Roger Worthington also owns hop supplier Indie Hops. Indie Hops collaborates with Oregon State University\u2019s hop breeding program to develop new strains of hops. Strata is the first to emerge from this program and make the leap to a commercially grown brewing variety. The strain was developed from Perle, a German aroma hop developed and released in 1978, which typically exhibits earthy and spicy herbal characteristics, such as black pepper and sometimes even mint. Worthy began experimenting with Strata, then known as X-331, late in 2016. It was a hit with the brewers, and after four trial versions, the brewery officially launched StrataSphere IPA in January. The name was shortened to simply Strata IPA, and in September, following this year\u2019s hop harvest, Worthy released it in 22-ounce bottles. The defining aroma characteristic of Strata is tropical fruit \u2014 including notes of pineapple, mango and orange marmalade, with what the brewery describes as an underlying \u201cwhiff of herbal dankness.\u201d Fruit carries into the flavor as well, highlighting pineapple and citrus along with some spicy herbal notes hinting as to the hop\u2019s heritage. The malt base is clean and bready and gets out of the way to highlight the hops. Overall, it has a nice \u201cmoreish\u201d quality to it that I would also describe as appetizing; you take a sip and immediately want more. The 2016 acreage for Strata was limited, with only 9 acres harvested. Indie Hops planted an additional 60 acres, and Worthy plans to release Strata IPA in cans late next year with the increased availability of the hops. More recently, Worthy\u2019s X-Hop experimental tasting series returned, a similar project to a series of beers they offered in the spring. In a comparable manner to how the brewery released Strata, it brews beers utilizing new, experimental hop varieties, and solicits public feedback on each beer. The current release lineup runs through the end of December. The hop varieties are designated by letter and number combinations, such as C7-9-1-499 (the first hop used in the series). At some point, if the popularity and development of that strain matures to general brewing use, it has the potential to be named and cultivated for commercial use. On the other hand, strains that fare poorly in the trials are likely to be abandoned. The X-Hop beers are available on draft at Worthy for two weeks until the next beer is tapped. Its second beer in this experimental series is on tap now, and the third beer will be released Dec. 15. Finally, just before Thanksgiving, Worthy released the latest vintage of its annual imperial stout specialty, Dark Muse, along with 2016 Dark Muse aged in bourbon barrels. Dark Muse is a hefty 10.1 percent alcohol by volume, though it hides the alcohol well behind layers of rich chocolate and sweet toffee. The barrel-aged version aged for 13 months in Woodford Reserve Bourbon barrels, a long contact time that tends to impart highly potent wood and bourbon character. The brewery\u2019s description of the process reads, \u201cWe blended in a small amount of 2017 Muse to balance the intense bourbon aromas and flavors. This vintage picked up a pleasant amount of oak and adds a small amount of dried fruit and hazelnut.\u201d Its time in the barrels allows the beer to gain an additional percent of alcohol by volume, and though boozy, the strength is well concealed. I found it to have a subtle aroma with essence of chocolate, vanilla and bourbon with a hint of maple syrup. In flavor there is a nice expression of the bourbon with elements of charred wood and vanilla, lightening up the body of the base beer with a pleasant alcoholic heat that\u2019s present but mellow. With deep background notes of chocolate this is an excellent dessert beer that would pair equally well with chocolate desserts as with a cheese tray or a mixed-berry cobbler. All of these beers are currently on tap, so if you find yourself visiting for one of the brewery\u2019s other highlights, make sure to take the time to grab a pint. \u2014 Jon Abernathy is a Bend beer blogger and brew aficionado.

The tracks were cleared and services resumed in the early hours of Thursday. \nNo passengers or crew were injured, only the buffaloes. (continues below) \nA local man contemplates a couple of the buffaloes. Local residents were quick to the scene to butcher the animals. (Photo by Chalit Pumruang) \nThe train had left Pak Nam Pho railway station and was about 2 kilometres short of Nakhon Sawan station when it ran into the middle of the herd as it wandered across the line. \nA total of 21 buffaloes were killed, their bodies scattered alongside the tracks. The force of the crash caused four wheels of the train to derail. Ten railway sleepers were damaged. \nThe crash delayed the train for almost four hours as railway workers had to remove many dead buffaloes blocking the line, repair the sleepers and lift the train back on the rails. \nSo far, nobody has admitted ownership of the buffaloes. \nPol Maj Wichaiyut Kesornsit, of Nong Pling police station, said investigators had learned that the animals were from a buffalo farm in the area. However, the farm operator insisted they were not from there. Police were investigating. \nOn Thursday morning, many local residents were at the scene, butchering the carcasses of the dead buffaloes and taking home the meat. \nFour wheels of this passenger train jumped off the tracks when it ran into a herd of buffaloes early Wednesday night, blocking the line. Train services to Nakhon Sawan resumed in the early hours of Thursday. (Photo by Chalit Pumruang) \nCarcasses of some of the buffaloes lie scattered near the tracks.
