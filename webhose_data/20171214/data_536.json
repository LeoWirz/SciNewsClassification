No place is this more obvious than at a dark tie occasion. Is it accurate to say that you are the staunch traditionalist in the wing collar and low-cut waistcoat? The sheep oppressed by fashion? Or, on the other hand the dandy in the velvet jacket? Like whatever else, dress as yourself! Dark tie occasions are constantly fun and never occur as frequently as they should, however when they would you like to look great! Be that as it may, there are obviously a few rules.\n\nRule no.1: don't overdress! The motivation behind dark tie is for every one of the men to appear to be identical and every one of the women to emerge. Be that as it may, there's parts you can at present do to hold your independence!\n\nRule no.2: never wear a wing collar! It was once de rigueur, yet now it's simply chintz. From necessary to simply repulsory. Not even Prince Charles wears a wing collar \u2013 they are saved for white tie occasions.\n\nRule no.3: The 'Dark' in 'Dark tie' signifies 'Midnight blue' or 'Dark'. Wearing midnight blue rather than dark is one of those individual-retainers specified above \u2013 follow Mr.Bond's illustration. Keep in mind however \u2013 lapel facings and ties are as yet dark regardless of whether dinner jacket is midnight blue.\n\nI generally favor grosgrain lapel facings to glossy silk, as it looks less showy \u2013 however that is dependent upon you. In any case the bow tie and side stripe in pants should coordinate. My recommendation is to just wear a cummerbund with notch lapel single-breasted jackets. Topped lapels are about power! Wear these on the off chance that you need to prevailing and expand your character \u2013 yet don't give a cummerbund a chance to act as a burden.\n\nShawl lapels are about nuance and provocativeness \u2013 don't demolish the curves with a tape over your waist. At last, in case you're a waistcoat-wearer and feel stripped without one, at that point the appropriate response is to wear a double-breasted \u2013 again about power.\n\nAs far as shoes, they ought to dependably be sparkling \u2013 ideally patent leather, and of whatever plan you favor: court shoes or oxfords.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "prince charles", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:08.046+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ca26b1d249287df3e09eb5467e825fd01688cde9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W6Fy5i3XVyjBcR7jreoisK80qWX7ZMDmNk8eIK4UkxPv6vYo.GCHDFq9.gJVIu6RREpIs2m5.2tL7yQ78LaW.F8-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What is the most perfect animated movie?", "title_full": "What is the most perfect animated movie? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-07T06:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 196, "participants_count": 169, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f69519ea25ce067d84aac28ac33d647f207bad35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W6Fy5i3XVyjBcR7jreoisK80qWX7ZMDmNk8eIK4UkxPv6vYo.GCHDFq9.gJVIu6RREpIs2m5.2tLjo.o3O1YSP5vRBV21g71jylgVDekLFVU", "ord_in_thread": 179, "author": "Swertbert", "published": "2017-12-07T17:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I don't know about perfect but my son Darren turned me onto this movie called Arkeyrar?

DNCA IN EVOLUT AC 157.74 and high of 157.74.\nWhat Makes The German Commerce?\nWith Germany being considered by the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the biggest exporter of goods worldwide, it is no longer surprising why the German Stock Exchange is one of the most important stock exchanges that make or break global commerce. Companies like DNCA IN EVOLUT AC enjoy to be the part of German stock exchange.\nGerman Stock Exchange The German Stock Exchange consists of eight stock exchanges located throughout Germany. DNCA IN EVOLUT AC were included in one of its units as well. The biggest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the FWB Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse, which is owned and operated by Deutsche B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt. These companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange alone represent 80% of the overall market capitalization in Germany.\nThe second largest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Stuttgart Stock Exchange or the B\u00f6rse Stuttgart. Most financial companies are listed here.\nOther major components of the German Stock Exchange include the B\u00f6rse Berlin-Bremen, the B\u00d6AG B\u00f6rsen AG, and the Hamburg Stock Exchange or the Hamburger B\u00f6rse.\nThe B\u00f6rse Berlin-Bremen, which is located in Berlin-Charlottenburg, was established in 2003 from the union of the Berlin Stock Exchange and the B\u00f6rse Bremen.\nMeanwhile, the B\u00d6AG B\u00f6rsen AG, which oversees trade in Hamburg and Hanover, was established in 1999 from the union of the Hamburg Stock Exchange and the Hanover Stock Exchange.\nBenchmark Index The major index on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is the German Stock Index, commonly known as Deutsche Aktien Xchange 30 (DAX 30), which is the benchmark equity market index in the country.\nDAX 30 tracks the top 30 companies in terms of market capitalization listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Consequently, DAX 30 is a vital indicator of the health of the German economy and investor sentiment as well. Many investors are interested in such DAX companies as DNCA IN EVOLUT AC.\nThe companies tracked by DAX 30 are capped at 10% weight in order to meet its provisions. This also prevents index heavyweight that might result from mergers and acquisitions (M&As).\nDAX 30 has two versions: 1) performance index, which is usually Quote: d; and 2) price index, which is similar to indices Quote: d in other countries.\nThe index has a base value of 1,000 since December 1987. DAX 30 indices are calculated using XETRA since June 1999. Since 2006, they are being calculated after every second.\nThe movement on DAX 30 is in 0.50 increments. The margin requirement among most brokers is 2% while the minimum trade size is one index.\nDAX 30 had its longest period of glory days around 2003 to 2007. During that time, it had peaked at \u20ac8,105.69. However, after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, DAX 30 had hit \u20ac3,580.\nBeing able to fully recover from the repercussions of the turmoil in the earlier decade, DAX 30 had recorded its all-time high in September 2013 at \u20ac8,736.\nThe performance index, on the other hand, had hit the 12,000 mark in March 2015. DAX 30 had attained its all-time high a month later at 12,374.73 after reaching an intraday high of 12,390.75. Its all-time low had been posted in November 1974 at 372.30.\nBecause of the world-renowned success of the DAX 30, more and more investors are betting on the German equity market. They pay close attention to DNCA IN EVOLUT AC shares. Existing investors have long been enjoying meaningful returns.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://quicksense.net/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "winifred garcia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "b\u00f6rse berlin-bremen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dnca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche b\u00f6rse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamburg stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "b\u00f6rse bremen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dnca in evolut ac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "german stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world trade organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fwb frankfurter wertpapierb\u00f6rse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankfurt stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanover stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuttgart stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "b\u00f6ag b\u00f6rsen ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "b\u00f6rse stuttgart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche aktien xchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin-charlottenburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanover", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankfurt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:08.049+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ca26b1d249287df3e09eb5467e825fd01688cde9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W6Fy5i3XVyjBcR7jreoisK80qWX7ZMDmNk8eIK4UkxPv6vYo.GCHDFq9.gJVIu6RREpIs2m5.2tL7yQ78LaW.F8-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What is the most perfect animated movie?", "title_full": "What is the most perfect animated movie? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-07T06:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 196, "participants_count": 169, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a9aebb1de88125d8ba4b797597e46dfb15a1ef70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W6Fy5i3XVyjBcR7jreoisK80qWX7ZMDmNk8eIK4UkxPv6vYo.GCHDFq9.gJVIu6RREpIs2m5.2tLjo.o3O1YSP5vRBV21g71j6fZey0ujCYw", "ord_in_thread": 180, "author": "ComputerMystic", "published": "2017-12-07T17:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Metal Gear Solid 4, i cri evry tim (lel, MGS is a movie /s)\nProbably How to Train Your Dragon.

Picture: John Devlin Published: 08:46 Thursday 07 December 2017 Share this article Have your say \nSchool lessons aimed at tackling LGBT bullying have been backed by a national parent group. \nThe National Parent Forum Scotland (NPFS) has given its support to Time for Inclusive Education (TIE), which is lobbying for new legislation to ensure schools proactively tackle discrimination. \nLast year, the campaign published a report that found 90 per cent of LGBT young people experienced homophobia at school while 27 per cent reported they had attempted suicide due to being bullied. \nForum chairwoman Joanna Murphy said: \u201cThe NPFS believes that an education system that is inclusive and free of prejudice is a right that every single pupil should enjoy and so we are pleased to announce that we are supporting the TIE campaign, which aims to improve the health and wellbeing of young people in our schools. \nREAD MORE: David Davis faces calls to quit as he admits to no Brexit analysis \n\u201cWe owe it to our young people to have an open and frank discussion around these issues in our schools and we hope that this also encourages parents and parent councils to continue this discussion.\u201d \nThe Scottish Government launched a national working group in April to take forward TIE\u2019s proposals, which includes teacher training and LGBT inclusivity in the curriculum. \nNPFS works with national and local government to improve the educational experiences of young people. \nIt joins several organisations in supporting TIE, including Scouts Scotland and the Educational Institute of Scotland. \nTIE co-founder Liam Stevenson said: \u201cAs a parent myself, I know that we can play a crucial role in tackling prejudicial behaviours amongst young people and, throughout our work, we have spoken to many parents who wish to see an end to homophobia, biphobia and transphobia in our schools. \n\u201cIndeed, most parents are surprised that in 2017 an education which is inclusive of diverse relationships, family types and identities is not already in place. \n\u201cThe endorsement of the NPFS further solidifies parental support. We look forward to continuing to work with the NPFS in order to ensure that all schools are LGBT-inclusive.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john devlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joanna murphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liam stevenson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "educational institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npfs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time for inclusive education", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:09.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ddf6c3e61a8a4891de766e6776830eca7fe0b6ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU47vgNwFPWrh3HWWI9GRrbt2G4_MHAGlQsdOFEkuhcSCap6gCk8Yinxq3QzMyB3yTmxjWbm0nt6W1u_e6YMUWulFNOXnTmM5TmqEFM72f01iOg9SoJiPpX54", "site_full": "lethbridgeherald.com", "site": "lethbridgeherald.com", "site_section": "http://lethbridgeherald.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Lethbridge Herald \u2013 News and Sports from around Lethbridge", "title": "Degner paces Eagles to win", "title_full": "Degner paces Eagles to win", "published": "2017-12-07T12:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://lethbridgeherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/logo_lethbridge_herald.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ddf6c3e61a8a4891de766e6776830eca7fe0b6ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU47vgNwFPWrh3HWWI9GRrbt2G4_MHAGlQsdOFEkuhcSCap6gCk8Yinxq3QzMyB3yTmxjWbm0nt6W1u_e6YMUWulFNOXnTmM5TmqEFM72f01iOg9SoJiPpX54", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lethbridge Herald", "published": "2017-12-07T12:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Degner paces Eagles to win", "text": "Degner paces Eagles to win Poll Do you agree with Alberta\u2019s new plan to reduce carbon emissions?

The Magazine's editor-in-chief revealed the selection Wednesday on NBC's \"Today\" show. The Silence Breakers are TIME's Person of the Year 2017 #TIMEPOY https://t.co/mLgNTveY9z pic.twitter.com/GBo9z57RVG \u2014 TIME (@TIME) December 6, 2017 \nThe title honors the individuals who set off a national reckoning over the prevalence of sexual harassment. The cover features a group photo that includes singer Taylor Swift, actress Ashley Judd, and former Uber engineer Susan Fowler. \nThe Silence Breakers emerged after allegations of sexual harassment by producer Harvey Weinstein were reported. As dozens of women accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, more individuals spoke up to expose dozens of other powerful men in Hollywood, journalism, and politics as sexual predators. \nActor Kevin Spacey, comedian Louis CK, CBS' Charlie Rose and NBC's Matt Lauer were among high-profile names accused of sexual harassment. \n\"The galvanizing actions of the women on our cover\u2026along with those of hundreds of others, and of many men as well, have unleashed one of the highest-velocity shifts in our culture since the 1960s,\" Felsenthal said in a statement. \nThe men and women who broke their silence to share their stories of sexual assault and harassment led to online #MeToo campaign, fueling a worldwide discussion on how prevalent sexual harassment is. The hashtag has been used millions of times in at least 85 countries, according to Felsenthal. \nTIME's Person of the Year issue will be on newsstands on Friday.

At first I thought that was hemorrhoids, but there were no other symptoms and the number of warts grew. I got scared, even asked my boyfriend if he was faithful to me. He was offended and I felt ashamed. It was like as if I was trying to switch my fault on him. Well I went to the doctor finally and he said that most probably I had my skin damaged with some underwear made of artificial fiber that I wore on hot days and therefore got some micro wounds. Then some infection got into the skin and caused the warts to appear. He prescribed Podofilox and I started the treatment immediately. This medication is great! Helped me quickly and effectively. My boyfriend understood my problem and was no longer angry with me. And when the treatment course was over and all the genital warts were gone I decided never to wear synthetic underwear any more, only cotton panties. Cotton underwear can also be fashionable and sexy; you just have to look harder. And try out Podofilox if you got into the same trouble as me. Best Cheap Pharmacy - Buy Condylox (Podofilox) Online And Save Up To 60% I have used Podofilox only once and I consider it to be also a great advantage of the medication. Some 2-3 weeks ago I didn't even knew what genital warts are. But then when I got those warts on my penis I was scared and went to my doctor at once. He kind of calmed me down, saying genital warts are a very common sexually transmitted disease that can be easily treated. So I got the prescription, bought Podofilos and then started learning what kind of disease that was. As I learnt from the web the disease was really widely-spread and normally caused no serious consequences.

I have tried many solutions for people with problem skin and some of them do work all right. But the trouble is that acne keeps coming back 4-6 weeks after the treatment is completed. With Benzac AC everything is quite different. With the help of this medication my awful acne cleared completely. And I do not necessarily have to follow a strict diet and avoid direct sunlight. With other meds I had to forget about the majority of tasty things to ensure their effect. Benzac AC is a relief in all senses of the word! Try it out if you have the same problems with your skin and the acne that covers it. Best Drugstore - Buy Benzac Online And Save Up To 55% I have tried Benzac AC first about two months ago and since that time I forgot about problem skin! I have struggled with severe problems like acne, black heads and frequent skin inflammations since I was about thirteen years old. Now I am 27 and I solved the problem only two months ago when a friend of mine advised me this amazing medication. Before that I have tested almost everything on the market, pills, lotions, topicals, etc. but nothing worked well. It was a real psychological problem for me to communicate with other people because of my acne. I thank God now that Benzac AC is available.

son is alive today thanks to a Leeds heart unit has welcomed news that the threatened facility is safe. \nLeeds Congenital Heart Unit has been given an official green light to stay open by national health chiefs, after years of uncertainty. \nAndrea Steel, whose son Ben was diagnosed with a condition by medical teams there when he was ten, said she was \"thrilled to bits\" with the announcement. \n\"It's just fantastic,\" said Mrs Steel, 56. \n\"The unit should never have been under threat in the first place. \n\"The staff are wonderful and do incredible work. I can't thank them enough. \n\"If it hadn't have been for them, Ben wouldn't be here today. It's as simple as that.\" \nAs a youngster, Ben \u2013 now 30 \u2013 was found to have a hereditary condition which causes the muscle wall of the heart to thicken. \nHe still takes medication and has annual check-ups, but is able to lead a virtually normal life. \nWhen the heart unit was first faced with closure, Mrs Steel joined other families in launching a battle to keep it open. \n\"We took a petition around and everyone backed it \u2013 the support was overwhelming,\" she said. \n\"It just shows, you shouldn't argue with people in Yorkshire!\" \nThe decision is also welcomed by the Children's Heart Surgery Fund (CHSF), which supports children and adults across the region born with congenital heart disease. \nFunded by donations, the charity \u2013 which celebrates its 30th anniversary next year \u2013 works alongside the unit. \n\"Finally families have certainty and I'd like to thank all those who campaigned tirelessly to retain Yorkshire's only heart unit,\" said CHSF chief executive officer, Sharon Coyle. \n\"Without the ongoing support of families, patients, communities, MPs, councillors, corporate partners and the great Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire public, we wouldn't be running today. \n\"We must now look to the future. \n\"Our aim is to carry on supporting the heart unit in reaching new standards set out by NHS England.\" \nKeighley MP John Grogan said long-term planning could now be carried out. \n\"This important announcement appears to be the end of a long saga,\" he added. \n\"Doctors, nurses and the families of young patients have fought tirelessly to keep the heart unit open in Leeds. \n\"Now that planning can take place for the long term, it should be easier to recruit and retain the specialist doctors and medical staff that are needed to provide the highest quality care.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mrs steel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharon coyle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john grogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea steel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "keighley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keighley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yorkshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chsf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeds congenital heart unit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north lincolnshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yorkshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:11.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d6fb937704c708c3179e61e107499505873cf5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.N1SdD22c27EldXi258SmEyJAqSE6WOBSJiyShgOG5ANsgY5FGcYTBe4d.oj_9hRPu4uQwlUPeyw6YIrxs7s3yFaJi5ucPXfz9I3zjiF4HMlERN7mZI4CXUpq4tSfCyDBM0q6I8ah78A8CCsEOUDEigXZ_KsgFfRDnJwcM2JCfT6QzF22hG4ZP", "site_full": "www.keighleynews.co.uk", "site": "keighleynews.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.keighleynews.co.uk/news/news_keighley/rss/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Keighley News | Keighley", "title": "Murder inquiry launched following death of former Keighley Cougar Cubs player", "title_full": "Murder inquiry launched following death of former Keighley Cougar Cubs player", "published": "2017-12-07T10:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.keighleynews.co.uk/resources/images/7151355/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d6fb937704c708c3179e61e107499505873cf5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.N1SdD22c27EldXi258SmEyJAqSE6WOBSJiyShgOG5ANsgY5FGcYTBe4d.oj_9hRPu4uQwlUPeyw6YIrxs7s3yFaJi5ucPXfz9I3zjiF4HMlERN7mZI4CXUpq4tSfCyDBM0q6I8ah78A8CCsEOUDEigXZ_KsgFfRDnJwcM2JCfT6QzF22hG4ZP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Murder inquiry launched following death of former Keighley Cougar Cubs player", "text": "0 comments \nTRIBUTES have been paid to a former Keighley Cougar Cubs player who died from injuries sustained outside a nightclub. \nJames Etherington died in hospital ten days after being injured outside Bijou Cocktail Bar and Nightclub, in Chapel Lane, Bingley. \nPolice have launched a murder inquiry. \nMr Etherington, 24, who lived in Bingley, played for the Cougar Cubs \u2013 one of the country's biggest junior rugby league clubs \u2013 in his youth. \nHis uncle, David Etherington, has spoken of the family\u2019s devastation. \nHe said: \u201cHe was an absolute lad\u2019s lad.

Woolf Thursday 7 December 2017 09:41 GMT Click to followThe Independent US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton, were widely ridiculed last month for posing with a sheet of dollar bills at the US Mint Jacquelyn Martin/AP \nThe wealthiest one percent of American households own 40 percent of the country's wealth , according to a new paper by economist Edward N. Woolf. That share is higher than it has been at any point since at least 1962, according to Woolf's data, which comes from the federal Survey of Consumer Finances. \nFrom 2013, the share of wealth owned by the one percent shot up by nearly three percentage points. Wealth owned by the bottom 90 percent, meanwhile, fell over the same period. Today, the top one percent of households own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined. That gap, between the ultra-wealthy and everyone else, has only become wider in the past several decades. \nLet's talk a bit about that wealth gap. Wealth, often described as net worth, describes how much stuff you actually have: It's the value of your assets minus the value of your debts. If you have a $250,000 house but you still owe $200,000 to the bank on it, and you have no other debts or financial assets, that means your net worth is $50,000. US Senate passes tax cuts for America's richest in late-night vote \nIn the United States, the distribution of that wealth is even more skewed toward the top than the distribution of income. For the sake of illustration, let's say that America is a country of 100 people, and all of the wealth in the country - the homes and land and financial assets - is represented by 100 slices of pie. \nThat works out to an average of one slice of pie per person, which is exactly what everyone would get if we lived in a society where wealth was equally distributed. \nBut that's not the society we live in, and indeed that's not the society that most of us want to live in either. People generally agree that if you work harder you're entitled to more of the pie, and that if you don't work at all, well, barring certain circumstances, no pie for you. \nIn 2010, Michael Norton and Dan Ariely surveyed more than 5,500 people to find out how they thought wealth should be distributed in this country: How much of the pie should to go the top 20 percent of Americans, and to the next 20 percent, and so on, all the way down to the bottom of the distribution? \nOn average, respondents said that in an ideal world the top 20 percent of Americans would get nearly one-third of the pie, the second and middle quintiles would get about 20 percent each, and the bottom two quintiles would get 13 and 11 slices, respectively. \nIn an ideal world, in other words, the most productive quintile of society would amass roughly three times the wealth of the least productive. \nNow, let's take a look at how the pie is actually distributed. These figures come from Wolff's working paper, and he expands on them further in his new book A Century of Wealth in America. \nThe top 20 percent of households actually own a whopping 90 percent of the stuff in America - 90 slices of pie! That's exactly 4 1/2 slices per person, nearly triple their \u201cideal\u201d share according to Norton and Ariely's survey respondents. Their average net worth? $3 million. US sees huge surge in number of homeless people sleeping rough \nThat leaves just 10 percent of the pie for the remaining 80 percent of the populace. The next 20 percent of households (average net worth: $273,600) help themselves to eight slices, while the middle 20 percent ($81,700 net worth, on average) split a measly two slices. \nDon't go feeling too sorry for that middle quintile, though - at least they get some pie. The fourth quintile of households gets literally nothing: no pie. But they're still doing better than the bottom 20 percent of households, who are actually in a state of pie debt: Their net worth is underwater, meaning they owe more than they have. Combined, the average net worth of the bottom 40 percent of households is minus-$8,900. \nThese figures, staggering as they are, mask a lot of the variation in the top 20 percent. Let's run those numbers again, breaking out some of the richest households separately. \nThere's the top one percent, gobbling up an astonishing 40 slices of American pie. The next four percent split 27 slices between them, while the next five percent take another 12 slices (a little over two slices per person). The bottom ten percent of the top 20 percent get, on average, one slice of pie each. But don't feel too bad for them: Their net worth is, on average, about $740,800. \nAmong rich nations, the United States stands out for the extent of its wealth inequality. The top one percent in the US own a much larger share of the country's wealth than the one percent elsewhere. The American one percent gobble up twice as much pie (40 percent) as the one percent in France, the UK or Canada, and more than three times as much as the one percent in Finland. \nThis kind of extreme inequality is bad for the economy. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which represents a number of the world's richest countries including the United States, estimates that inequality has knocked nearly five percentage points off the economic growth in those countries between 2000 and 2015. \nIn high-inequality countries, people from poor households typically have less access to quality education. This leads to \u201clarge amounts of wasted potential and lower social mobility,\u201d which directly harms economic growth, according to the OECD.

But the Senate GOP tax plan does precisely the opposite of that, according to the CBO: In the short term the richest households get the biggest tax cuts, while longer term the taxes of the poorest households actually increase. \nEstate tax? Cut. Income tax rate for millionaires? Cut (at least in the Senate bill). Corporate tax rate? Biggest rate cut ever. \nIn the long term that probably means more of the pie for the super-rich and less of it for everyone else. \nThe Washington Post ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "edward n. woolf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan ariely", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ariely", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wolff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael norton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organisation for economic cooperation and development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oecd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woolf", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:11.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5c4ffde487da4356175cbd0e3e2fa29a0a712fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAin1DKyfDnNkjpL9O36avW_s-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/na---mobile-app", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum -

The work should enhance the building\u2019s appearance and the environment around. The area should look nice and clean for people driving through town.\u201d \nFellow Keighley Central councillor Abid Hussain, the current Lord Mayor of Bradford, said he would love to see more people employed at the Livery Rooms. \nHe said: \u201cPeople like to sit in there. We want to see development of existing businesses. I would love to see this building blending in with the other buildings on the street.\u201d \nWetherspoon said a Conservation Area assessment had demonstrated that the dilapidated former nightclub site made a negative contribution to the area. \nThe company added: \u201cThe proposal however seeks to retain, and indeed enhance, the facade, which has hidden significance as the original front of the 19th century building.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wetherspoon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wetherspoon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mayor of bradford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zafar ali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eddie gershon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abid hussain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "keighley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bradford council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "livery rooms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keighley news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keighley central ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keighley central", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "town hall livery stables", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:11.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df39e22cc9296205b7b28d8da1a332182f95b908", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTc2BJPWh5IcGkj86BD5p30Au.sAWQGtUMnJhzOap_M6KaoojPGFnda.BlpusXvo1SbMaVpm1XNOETZM92iHusDyf0ep8FGHKV_3aJa1asFxr2kyUDPPJvg4k58oR._pSo-", "site_full": "www.anandtech.com", "site": "anandtech.com", "site_section": "https://www.anandtech.com/tag/nvidia/39", "site_categories": ["computer_reviews", "tech"], "section_title": "Page 39 - Latest NVIDIA Articles and Reviews", "title": "AMD Makes a Surprise Appearance: Ryzen Mobile with Qualcomm LTE", "title_full": "AMD Makes a Surprise Appearance: Ryzen Mobile with Qualcomm LTE", "published": "2017-12-06T00:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 25, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.anandtech.com/doci/12130/kevinl_678x452.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3377, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d80dc0b7ac41f19d34f902310aa1942aa8e82427", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTc2BJPWh5IcGkj86BD5p30Au.sAWQGtUMnJhzOap_M6KaoojPGFnda.BlpusXvo1SbMaVpm1XNOETZM92iHusDyf0ep8FGHKV_3aJa1asFxr2kyUDPPJvgBLoRmdkHcWpApA4mFcNw3w--", "ord_in_thread": 25, "author": "ddr\u0456ver", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Apple has the fastest cores for consumers currently.
