Emailed advice from Tado, I Quote: , \"don't tighten the adapter or go and buy a 3rd. party adapter\" which of course means additional costs.\nAs for the app on an iPhone it's quite neat but still a work in progress as it lacks \"summer cycling\" to avoid stuck valves but the geo-fencing works well.\nNote that that only 8 zones (ie rooms or spaces in the house) are available which needs bearing in mind if you have a big house but each zone can have up to eight [I've got 3 of these in two of my zones] valves. In such a case one of the valves in the zone acts as a master for the others.\nBottom line, will continue adding these units to all my radiators as it's clearly saving me money ( I have 10 so far).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 4.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:20.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "23ab4fa1216c0ffdbd11af59c73af5ad09f3d47c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw5gIVgxPo5Alt959DQC6fIqLCD3ouHjqqgrPzMi4Nc4n5nhydAfTbvdMKrGuj3CA6DWvMu7rWUYlEVhIiiiAYuN2VnrLv1fiRMRV85G9kRIkzbIoMM7qi.22FlxgujvZoUMvS4HeJp7dWbzSe5wBXvvaPdnFTavdIBvf3DEZ8ZXdZIc_uiX23klMLSxwNRWDzv", "site_full": "www.amazon.co.uk", "site": "amazon.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/tado\u00b0-additional-Smart-Radiator-Thermostat/product-reviews/B01LXPJG23/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?sortBy=recent", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: tado\u00b0 additional Smart Radiator Thermostat - horizontal mounting - intelligent heating control with geofencing via smartphone", "title": "additional - horizontal", "title_full": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: tado\u00b0 additional Smart Radiator Thermostat - horizontal mounting - intelligent heating control with geofencing via smartphone", "published": "2017-11-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "23ab4fa1216c0ffdbd11af59c73af5ad09f3d47c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw5gIVgxPo5Alt959DQC6fIqLCD3ouHjqqgrPzMi4Nc4n5nhydAfTbvdMKrGuj3CA6DWvMu7rWUYlEVhIiiiAYuN2VnrLv1fiRMRV85G9kRIkzbIoMM7qi.22FlxgujvZoUMvS4HeJp7dWbzSe5wBXvvaPdnFTavdIBvf3DEZ8ZXdZIc_uiX23klMLSxwNRWDzv", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lalas", "published": "2017-11-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "additional - horizontal", "text": "I buy the Tado (4 items) to change the in 9 months faulty Devolo radiator valves and Danfoss LC-13.\nGeneral the Tado is a better quality product against the previous Z-Wave models and more easy to put your desire temperature, the setup is easy and geofencing very good much better than Nest.\nBut why 4 stars?

I bought two to add to my existing Tado system to control my bathroom and bedroom separately. They work as I'd hoped they would and it's like having a separate time switch and thermostat in each room.\nThe thermostats are easy to fit and were up and running in five minutes. Initially had a problem where the thermostat wasn't closing the radiator valve properly, meaning the radiators were on full all the time. I contacted Tado and they did some remote control magic which fixed it straight away.\nI now have my bedroom set to heat only first thing in the morning and last thing at night (and also at later times at the weekend), saving heating the room all day when I'm not using it.

The basic system of Internet bridge, smart thermostat and extension kit worked extremely well and was simple to get used to. I also then decided to replace my Drayton Trv4s and to invest in the smart radiator thermostats.\nI have a 4 bedroom bungalow with 2 ensuites and a family bathroom. In total there are 8 radiators and 3 towel rails that I wished to control individually. 7 of the radiators were fitted with Drayton TRV4s and replacing these with Tado's was very easy. It's just a matter of unscrewing the Drayton head and fitting the Tado's. I Didn't need to use any adaptors and the app gives very clear instructions. Managed to fit all 7 in under an hour. The app lets you pair 2 or more radiators so if you alter the temperature on 1 radiator it automatically adjusts both. Very handy.\nIt soon became apparent that I had a problem with three of my Valves. Not the Tado thermostat part but the actual valves themselves were sticking. WD 40 didn't seem to improve things. It's not surprising that the valves were sticking either open or shut as they hand to been moved in years.\nHaving to replace three valves I took the plunge and decided to fit valves on my three towel rails and the one radiator without a TRV. Most homes have one radiator usually in the hall that has no valve. This has been recommended in the past so that should the boiler be on and pumping water and all the radiator valves are shut the water has somewhere to go. You can leave this radiator alone but what this means in practice is that this radiator will always heat up whenever ANY radiator calls for heat. That clearly is a waste.\nI've now got all radiators and towel rails fitted with Tado smart radiator valves.\nI have set up different temperatures and timers for each room. We used our old wireless thermostat to check temperatures and noticed that the theremostats on the radiators were always reading higher than the actual room temperature meaning the room was colder than the app was saying. This is easily corrected by going into the settings on the app and adjusting the temperature offset. This isn't surprising as the Tado stats are obviously on the radiator where it's going to be warmer.\nThe geofencing option works very well. My wife and I both have the Tado app installed on our phones so when we are both out the heating turns itself off or down automatically. And when one of us is home it switches back on.\nI have also managed to set up the Tado's on Apple home which means I can now ask Siri to adjust all the radiators. I believe you can also integrate with Alexa and similar products.\nThe kit isn't cheap but I think within 18 months I will have saved enough on my energy costs to recoup the outlay.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:20.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c6d18096dd1d2d9fb7aacfe3d88d2c8ba82d27aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf6ZqT76N_cyUWWwSDD94wItM0RgQdomlaWpT7_FDn3AqdzPlRUFu._Xq7jF3yWZMsk.04e6dFosXQEPHo06OrAkutauAXMQ46o-", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Hotell-Pearson-Intl-Flygplats.0-aYYZ-0.Reseguide-Filter-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotell Pearson Intl., Toronto | Expedia.se", "title": "Travelodge Hotel Airport", "title_full": "Travelodge Hotel Toronto Airport (Toronto, Kanada) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-11-23T03:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c6d18096dd1d2d9fb7aacfe3d88d2c8ba82d27aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf6ZqT76N_cyUWWwSDD94wItM0RgQdomlaWpT7_FDn3AqdzPlRUFu._Xq7jF3yWZMsk.04e6dFosXQEPHo06OrAkutauAXMQ46o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-23T03:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Travelodge Hotel Airport", "text": "Good room.

Many verticals across the organisation use the information for many purposes like packaging, labelling, promotional material distribution and product web pages. Each department commonly takes a copy of the approved content and tweaks it according to their own need, leading to process inefficiencies and potential product misinformation. There are also many consumers like regulatory bodies, academic research centres, medical professionals and the general public who may require it. The need to ensure greater control over critical product information is what product label management is all about. It is what drives the Structured Content and Product Label Management Market. Companies create massive amounts of content related to the products they are selling in the market. Adding regulatory compliances to the mix makes the material produced grow explosively. Content management systems are a part of the overall Structured Content and Product Label Management Market. Content management systems help an organisation keep track of documents that may be deployed for several years. However, they miss the mark in allowing quick re-use of crucial information and reducing authorization time. Request for Report Sample @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/19582 Structured Content and Product Label Management Market Drivers A desire to deliver standardised content to a diverse audience on different platforms is a major driver of the Structured Content and Product Label Management market. Most content is digitised now and it should work as desired whatever the device screen size, operating system or application the target audience views it on. For technical or medical documentation, there could be legal or contractual requirements which require producing a hard copy or a stand-alone PDF file at the very least. Sometimes, structured content might also be needed to customise for a specific client (branding), or customer (differing information according to tastes, needs, interests and preferences). Maintaining consistency on a global level is the second driver of the Structured Content and Product Label Management market. Product labels are a complex mix of regional requirements which can affect many areas of a business or organisation. Even a small labelling change can have a massive global regulatory impact. This is multi-dimensional, affecting compliance in different departments like manufacturing, business development, marketing and also local labelling guidelines. Every organisation must maintain content consistency and propagate the changes across documents, right from the Core Data Sheet to the localised label. With less traceability in the high volume of content being generated daily, product quality and regulatory compliances can be very easily compromised. Request for Report TOC @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/19582 \nStructured Content and Product Label Management Market Restraints The challenges in the Structured Content and Product Label Management market can broadly be divided into four main ones \u2013 managing frequent content changes, customizing it for different health authorities, global regulatory requirements and last but certainly not the least, cost cutting pressures. Digital structured content is usually written in a word processor but as content moves closer to completion, its format is changed. It is difficult to ascertain where changes have occurred and changes in multiple documents must be ascertained and manually rectified making it an error-prone, time-consuming job. Health authorities require content to be submitted in a form of their requirements. This can include reordering, removing, modifying or even adding certain content. It may need to be prepared for different health authorities with specific formats. In addition to regulatory bodies in one country, content must also be translated into multiple languages. The changes and updates must be reflected properly in each translation which increases the cost by a significant amount. This is a major restraint in the Structured Content and Product Label Management market because there is pressure to drive down R&D costs which are substantial in the medical industry. Each country may have very different product labelling and content norms which are an unavoidable legal expense and companies wishing to enter those markets must comply with them.

Almost each leading player is based outside the region and functions in the region with the help of distribution arrangements. A latest report by Transparency Market Research titled, \u201cDefibrillators Market \u2013 Middle East and Africa Industry Analysis, Size, Volume, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2014 \u2013 2020,\u201dtalks about the dynamic and fast-growing structure of the Middle East and Africa defibrillators market and offers a statistically driven market forecasts. Most of the leading companies in the global defibrillators market are eager to take advantage of the untapped market space in the Middle East and Africa by forming distribution agreements in the region, setting up local subsidiary, or establishing their own distribution network. The key players in the market mentioned are Welch Allyn Inc., Nihon Kohden Corporation, Schiller AG, HeastSine Technologies Inc., Physio-Control Inc., Zoll Medical Corporation, and Phillips Healthcare.The MEA defibrillator is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.60% between the aforementioned forecast period. The overall valuation of the defibrillator market in the Middle East and Africa is estimated to reach the valuation of US$547.8 mn by the fall of 2020 according to the report. \nRead Report overview @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/middle-east-africa-def\u2026 \nVoice Assistance in Regional Language and Other Features to Keep MEA Defibrillator Growth on Track \nThe report mentions that the Middle East and Africa defibrillators market is mainly driven by the increasing number of patients with chronic heart issues, especially the elderly population. The market of defibrillator in the MEA pertains to the sudden occurrence of cardiac arrest, the scenario in which the defibrillator is used. It functions by sending electric shocks \u2013 anywhere between 40 Joules to 400 Joules \u2013 across its surface, which checks cardiac arrhythmia and reinstates normal heartbeat. According to report, growing number of cases of sudden cardiac attacks in the Middle East and Africa are contributing significantly to the defibrillator market. \nThe defibrillator market in the Middle East and Africa is segmented further by major nations in the region such as United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa. In the recent past, the Middle East region was dominated by Saudi Arabia and UAE while the African market was led by South Africa. Overall improvements in the infrastructure of healthcare in these nations combined with rising awareness about the use of defibrillators at the time of cardiac arrests have boosted the demand for defibrillators. Qatar and Saudi Arabia are the fastest developing markets for defibrillators in the Middle East. \nRequest Sample Report@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag\u2026 \nThe growth of the MEA defibrillator market is hampered mainly due to lack of significant customer base that is fluent in English. Due to majority of non-English speaking residents in the MEA region, the international companies in the global defibrillator market have found it hard to enter the MEA defibrillator market. However, these barriers are being presently mitigated with the help of voice assistance in regional languages, guidance for CPR, and other default features. These features in the modern instruments are expected to help the MEA defibrillator market to maintain its growth at a current rate. \nIncreasing Awareness about Treating Cardiac Arrests with AED to Proper Growth of Segment \nThe report mentions that the defibrillator market in the Middle East and Africa was dominated by advanced life support in the product type segmentation. However, it is expected that the automated external defibrillator (AED) segment will showcase the fastest growth rate in the mentioned forecast period. Using the AEDs for the first responder and rising number of incidences where defibrillators and life support is needed are driving the automated external defibrillator segment. \nThe automated external defibrillator segment is expected to develop even fast because of the AEDs by the Public Safety Department of UAE while installing first aid setups in government offices, malls, zoos, and other public areas. \nAbout TMR \nTransparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

While ar-Rayat\ncould mean \u201cflags\u201d but its meaning is not limited to just flags. In \nArabic, Raayaat (plural: raayaah) means \u201cbanners, ensign, or whatever \nstandard used in the military as a (visual) identification\u201d. Originally \n\ufead\u064e\ufe83\u0652\ufef3\u064e\ufe94 (ra\u02beya), is an instance of noun which derived from \ufead\u064e\ufe83\u0652\ufef1 (ra\u02bey, \n\u201csight, perception\u201d), and it's well known historically that the word \n\u201car-Rayat\u201d is for the purpose of (visual) identification.\n\nMoreover,\nthe pronouncement of \ufe97\ufec4\ufee0\ufeca tathlu\u2019u (means: RISING) in Arabic language \nis a verb that is NOT commonly used with noun such as flags. However, it\npoints to something that is rising in the sky like the sun and moon, \nand float in the space or sky without anything to hold or support it.\n\nTherefore\nthis \u201cBlack Standards\u201d is the (visual) identification that happens only\nin the future which will be rising (tathlu'u) in the sky and fight your\nenemy in a way that has never been done by previous ummah.\n\nSo, \nit has been proven clearly that the black banners of ar-Rayatu as-Suud \nare NOT FLAGS but Black Standards, the pride body of MILITARY states, \nTHAT WILL BE RISING AND FLOATING IN THE SKY without anything to hold or \nsupport it, so that when people see them coming, they will have to look \nup at the sky and lift their heads as if they are looking at the sun and\nmoon rising in the sky.

Moreover, growth of ecommerce business to cater the international consumer base. In recent past, major smartphone manufacturers have focused on teaming up with e-tailers, serving as exclusive sales partners for their flagship devices. Players such as Xiaomi, Motorola, and OnePlus have reaped rich dividends from such partnerships in the recent past. Andorid OS is expected to hold the largest flagship smartphone market share over the forecast period Android provide world-class platform to create applications and games for users that can be virtually accessed from anywhere across the globe. This is primarily owing to its open accessibility and all major manufacturers, with the exception of Apple opting for this operating system for their flagship phones. Among the storage types, expandable memory handsets are expected to gain edge over the internal memory limitation. This is owing to the improvement in multi-aspects of the smartphones, which include motion sensing, graphic resolutions, and increasing consumers\u2019 requirement for information storage. However, factors such as fast processing, easy data accessibility, and protection from viruses that can be transmitted through external device, are expected to drive the growth of the flagship smartphone market. In addition, few major companies will continue to provide inbuilt storage spaces to the consumers. Key Players in the Global Flagship Smartphone Market Chief industry participants in the flagship smartphone market include Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Apple Inc., Oppo, OnePlus and Mobitech Creations, Xiaomi, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., LG Electronics Inc., Lenovo Group Limited, ZTE Corporation, TCL Communication Technology Holdings Limited, and Vivo Communication Technology Co. Ltd. Asia Pacific is expected to remain the prominent focus of the players, owing to the largest middle income group and the increasing penetration of mobile phones mainly in China, India, and ASEAN countries.

Maybe that is clearer? The UK handed in the official leave note, only the UK can try to stop that.\nThe EU will have no interest in extending the 2 years, since EU parliament elections are due in May 2019. The UK still being a member then, would completely mess up the elections. Brexit has to happen before that, as agreed. A year later would mean elections with UK voting in 2019 and then again in 2020 when the UK MEPs are gone. Now that is just too much trouble.\nA transition period would make sense. EU suggested that earlier, and the UK government also. Then the UK is officially out, but EU and UK could continue to sort out things with no disruption to business and peoples lives as all would continue as is.\nAs for citizens rights. The majority of the UK citizens in a referendum, a majority of their parliament, their government has informed the EU that they wish not to be EU citizens anymore. Note taken. What do you request? An EU backed British minority coup d'etat in the UK? Ask Russia for help for that. EU will not do it. If you as British and EU citizen are unhappy with what the British government is doing, you can until March 29, 2019 still take them to court - ECJ or ECHR. That is your right to do.

The IMF report comes a day after regulators in Beijing drafted new rules to strengthen bank funding, and follows a number of alerts about a ballooning debt problem in the world\u2019s number-two economy. Near the top of the list in the IMF study on the stability of China\u2019s financial system is the need for banks to increase their capital to ward off risks from mounting debt. China has largely relied on debt-fuelled investment and exports to drive its tremendous economic growth, but the Fund said this model has reached its limits. Part of the problem lies in high growth targets, the IMF said, which incentivise local governments to extend credit and protect failing companies. \u201cWe recommend the authorities to de-emphasise the GDP (growth),\u201d Ratna Sahay, deputy director of the IMF\u2019s Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said during a news conference. China should \u201cincite local governments to strengthen supervision on risks,\u201d she added. Abundant credit allows local governments to hit high growth figures but now each extra dollar of debt is producing diminishing returns. The ballooning debt \u2014 estimated at 234 per cent of gross domestic product by the IMF \u2014 adds financial risk and may weigh on China\u2019s future economic growth. \u201cCredit growth is an important indicator of future financial distress, because lending standards often fall in the rush to make more loans,\u201d IMF experts warned in a blog post. Zombie companies The Fund\u2019s experts carried out stress tests on dozens of banks. China\u2019s big four banks had adequate capital but \u201clarge, medium, and city-commercial banks appear vulnerable,\u201d the IMF said. It added that 27 out of the 33 banks tested \u2014 accounting for three-quarters of China\u2019s banking system assets \u2014 were \u201cundercapitalised relative to at least one of the minimum requirements.\u201d While the country\u2019s banking system meets the requirements of global banking rules known as Basel III, \u201ccurrent circumstances warrant a targeted increase in capital,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis would create a buffer to absorb potential losses that can be expected during the economic transition as credit is tightened and implicit guarantees are removed.\u201d China\u2019s central bank said it disagreed with \u201ca few descriptions and views\u201d in the report. \u201cThe descriptions of the stress testing did not fully reflect the outcomes of the test,\u201d the People\u2019s Bank of China said on its website. The China Banking Regulatory Commission on Wednesday released a draft of fresh rules to tackle related issues. The latest regulations call for new indicators to monitor commercial banks\u2019 liquidity and set related requirements. They will \u201cstrengthen management of liquidity risk for banks and protect the safety and stability of the banking system,\u201d the commission said. In some cases local banks face pressure to lend to politically important companies, as local governments aim to maintain high employment even if that means cash-bleeding enterprises continue to operate. These loss-making firms, often state-owned, have come to be known as zombie companies, and banks and investors fund many of them as if they will not be allowed to fail. \u201cImplicit guarantees and the government\u2019s desire to support growth encourage these firms to invest excessively, raising already-high leverage while weakening performance on profitability and debt service capacity,\u201d the Fund wrote in a recent report.

At the time I didn\u2019t believe I was going to be making my Formula One debut this year or even next year, but I knew there was maybe some opportunity to do a test, simulator driver, all those things that was maybe to prove myself again.\u201d \nDespite being plagued by engine grid penalties plus mechanical issues at the Mexican and Brazilian races, Hartley impressed enough to secure an F1 deal for the 2018 season with Toro Rosso switching to Honda engines. \nHartley\u2019s capabilities developing Porsche\u2019s LMP1 challenger from brand new to WEC champions and Le Mans 24 Hours winners is believed to have been a key influence behind the decision with the New Zealander hoped to help boost Honda\u2019s progress with its power unit.

Once detected the effects on Ireland's beef exports could be catastrophic (that now includes NI beef exports, rebranded after British beef was banned from the EU). The Irish are diligent about food security (it was the Irish, not the British, who discovered horsemeat in burgers) but the difficulty of policing the border has been well rehearsed.\nMake no mistake, a refusal by the British to ensure regulatory non-divergence is an existential threat to parts of the Irish economy. The Irish are not going to back down and be bullied by a country that colonised and raped the country for hundreds of years, not when they have support of the rest of the EU and when the alternative for the UK is crashing without a deal, followed by absolute mayhem (also with terrible, but less severe consequences for Ireland--unless, of course, there is a resumption of violence in NI that spills over the border). Ireland has options that include joining Schengen.\nThe British created the problems and it is up to them to solve them or suffer the consequences of not doing so. I have no doubt whatever that a hard brexit will lead to the break up of the UK and the very quick accession of Scotland to the EU followed by the rUK jettisoning NI as fast as it can.\nBut all you can see is the Irish being played by the EU?

You can start with Day One HERE . \nOK, let\u2019s get started with our fourth day\u2019s guest, Lindsey Feldpausch! \n\nJust Three Things \nChristmas festivities and decorations were always slightly different when I was growing up.\nWe started with Santa as our tree topper, and then we had an angel and then a star. Sometimes my mom made oatmeal scotchies. Other years she made sugar cookies or spritz cookies. Sometimes my dad would make an ice rink in the backyard. Other years he seemed committed to showing us all the classic Christmas movies. Some years we would go to a little chapel in my mom\u2019s hometown to attend an evening candle-light service and other years we turned in early. Some years my parents put gifts under the tree early and other years we could hear them frantically wrapping well into the night on Christmas Eve. Some years we had professional pictures with fake fireplace backgrounds and some years there was no formal documentation of the occasion.\n\nChristmas at my house had two things in common each year.\nPeople got gifts under a tree on December 25th \n \nSure, we had the same ornaments to hang up. You could generally count on my dad to make wise cracks while we were opening gifts and you could also usually predict that my mom would have a steaming cup of coffee in her hand as she watched us tear through the presents with excitement.\nOther than that, we didn\u2019t really have a Christmas tradition unique to our family. Truthfully, now that I have a family of my own, Christmas looks pretty similar.\nI wanted to let you know, that if you\u2019re kind of like me\u2014 it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re a little low on Christmas traditions. Hey, that\u2019s why this series from Karen is so fun\u2014 there are plenty of ideas to try this year! If it doesn\u2019t work out, try something new next year!\nMy parents became Christians when they were 38 years old. I was 13 years old at the time. That\u2019s when they taught me the true meaning of Christmas.\nEver since then, we\u2019ve had 3 things that are always the same around here:\nPeople get gifts under a tree on December 25 th because Jesus came as a baby to rescue us from sin forever. My husband\u2019s family likes to act out the nativity story, complete with bedsheets and rehearsed lines. My parents usually enjoy reading the biblical account. My husband and I like to watch The Nativity Story with our kids. Either way, we praise God for sending his Son. What a wonderful Christmas that was when we learned the true meaning of Christmas.\n\nDay 4 Giveaway \nFor my giveaway I\u2019d like to offer a throwback package that reminds me of one of the many different Christmases we had. One particular year, my dad kept the fireplace filled with long-lasting flames. I sat, read, and wrote by the fire. It was especially quiet that year. My mom played a variety of music (everything from Gladys Knight to Andrea Bocelli to the Muppet Christmas Carol Soundtrack). My heart was full.\nHere are 3 different journals/notepads because I do believe a girl can never have enough things to write on, a pack of thank you cards, and an iTunes giftcard to download something new .\n\n\n\n\nLindsey Feldpausch is a writer, speaker, and graphic designer.

Alex Wong / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 10:54 am \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Strzok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets.
