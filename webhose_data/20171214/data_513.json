Before banging on about my acne I have included a great product (All natural) I now use on my seb derm at the bottom of this post which has worked wonders (Don't worry I have not been paid to promote etc It's just something which has really been amazing and if it helps one person with this issue I'll be happy! This has changed my life on the seb derm front!\nOnto the Acne issues- zzzz;\nI have been on various antibiotics when I was younger (I'm now 29) and like many people have tried everything from some light therapies to creams (prescription and none prescription) and also going down the holistic approach. Examples include different diets, using apple cider vinegar, cutting out sugar and using probiotics and omega 3 supplements with little results. I do not want to take antibiotics for this issue any more even though it has been around 10 years but I want to sort it once and for all (And I believe I can!) for a less harsh more natural approach.\nNeck Acne/ Infection?\nI get a few spots on my face but the area which is most affected is my neck, I normally have a fair few large cystic spots on my neck and shoulders which are very painful to touch, itchy, red and pustular. Not pretty! I'd really like to hear from people who have managed to treat these types of sports and maybe find out a bit more on specifically the type of acne or infection it may be. Frustratingly most dermatologists haven't been very helpful and harsh medication and creams are prescribed with no last affect- This hasn't got to the root and so my search has brought me here. Now at present it isn't crazy bad but I'd like to find out what has worked for other people! The Acne.org products sadly did not work for me.\nHave you managed to clear your neck acne? Are there things in your diet which have helped? Which products do you now use? Any other advice?\nAnxiety/ Stress/ Depression;\nI am a very fortunate person but over the years have had a few up and down periods in life like most people. I believe that some people are prone to acne as a result of stress. Have others found this and if so have there been things which have helped the acne stress balance? I exercise regularly, do yoga and also cycle and still the deep neck acne is present Any tips would be great.\nSeborrheic Dermatitis Conditioning Oil;\nNow before finishing I'd like to share something I've recently manage to control using an oil which has worked wonders! Seborrheic Dermatitis, something that other acne sufferers seem to suffer with is also an irritating skin condition and something which I've tried to control with every product under the sun over the years! I recently found this skin condition oil from Biom8 which has cleared my seb derm and kept it at bay for almost 6 months. It's serious been the best skin product I've ever bought! *Also I have not been paid by the company etc etc I just thought it might help some more people out there like it has me and is definitely worth trying if you suffer from this also!

hailing from states with paid family and sick leave laws have sponsored the Workflex in the 21st Century Act. This proposed law signals the increasing frustration with the complexities of multi-state compliance among business owners. \nRepresentatives Mimi Walters of California, Elise Stefanik of New York, and Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington have pitched a bill that would exempt employers who offer certain amounts of paid time off from complying with state paid leave laws. \nIn its current form, the bill would serve to drastically reduce employee access to paid leave, but would also grant employees alternative work arrangements, known as \u201cworkflex\u201d options. \nThe Workflex in the 21st Century Act, H.R. 4219, was proposed on October 26, 2017 as an amendment to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to \u201cInclude a voluntary option for qualified flexible workplace arrangements.\u201d Fotolia \nUnder the law, employers would be exempt from state paid leave law requirements, but since the bill only reaches employees eligible for employer-provided benefits, employers would still have to comply with state and local leave laws for employees ineligible for the company\u2019s benefits. \nEmployers with a unionized workforce must incorporate the rights of employees to compensable leave and workflex options pursuant to applicable collective bargaining agreements into the plan. \nThe bill provides that plans which meet all of these requirements will also satisfy the requirements of Executive Order 13706, or Paid Sick Leave for federal contractors. However, this law does not, on its face, amend or limit employees\u2019 ability to use unpaid leave in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act. \nEmployers wishing to take advantage of the bill\u2019s preemptive effects must provide a minimum amount of \u201ccompensable leave\u201d for employees based on their years of service. Compensable leave includes any leave permitted to be used for paid time off, sick leave, personal leave, or vacation. Employers are permitted to include up to six paid holidays towards meeting the minimum amounts reflected below. \nThe bill makes clear that employers who wish to allow employees to take leave exceeding these minimum amounts are free to do so under the law. In that vein, employers who provide unlimited compensable leave, as defined above, are deemed to comply with the minimum amount of leave requirement. \nEmployers may frontload the employee\u2019s compensable leave at the beginning of the plan year, or allow the employee to accrue compensable leave proportionally as the calendar year progresses, and is available for the employee to use as the compensable leave accrues. It is unclear whether the employer can impose a waiting period to use compensable leave, or if there are further limits on accrual of leave based on the wording of the bill. Further, the employer has the option to offer both carryover and cash out of unused leave. \nThe number of employees is determined by calculating the total number of monthly employees for each month of the preceding plan year and dividing by 12. To be counted, an employee must be considered an employee for first and last day of the month. \nDefining full time \u201cFull-time\u201d must be \u201creasonably\u201d defined, but the bill does not give further guidelines regarding the definition. All other employees are considered \u201cpart-time,\u201d but the method of determining how part-time employees may accrue compensable leave is not clear based on the bill. \nAn employer may restrict the use of leave during the first 90 days of employment with the employer, and may also limit the use of leave to times when it does not \u201cunduly disrupt the operations of the employer,\u201d and whether to use the leave in full-day or partial-day increments. \nIn addition to paid leave, the bill provides that an employer must offer each employee in the plan, so long as the employee meets eligibility requirements, at least one of the following \u201cworkflex\u201d options, which are not limited in time according to the bill as written: \nBiweekly work schedule: A non-exempt employee may work up to 80 hours in a two-week period. In any one week, the employee may work between 40 - 60 hours. Employees must be compensated at their regular rate, and may only earn overtime for any time worked over the agreed-upon biweekly work schedule, or over 80 hours in the two-week period. It is unclear how this arrangement will interact with the Fair Labor Standards Act or state wage and hour laws. \nCompressed schedule work program: A non-exempt employee may work his or her regular weekly hours spread among fewer days, i.e., a 40-hour week over four days. Employees who choose this option earn overtime in accordance with the FLSA. Moreover, state wage and hour requirements would also apply. \nJob sharing program: An arrangement where the employer approves two or more employees to share one employment position. \nFlexible scheduling: An agreement under which the employee\u2019s regular work schedule is \u201caltered.\u201d This term is not further defined in the bill. \nPredictable scheduling: A system whereby the employer provides a schedule to an employee with reasonable advanced notice and with as few alterations as possible. \nTelework program: An arrangement where the employee is permitted to perform the duties and responsibilities of his or her position from a worksite other than where the employee would otherwise work. Slideshow Start Slideshow 20 companies with the best benefits Not all workplace perks are equal, but there are some that are extremely popular among employees, according to Glassdoor research. \nOptions offered may differ depending on the particular position. Employees eligible for \u201cworkflex\u201d options must be employed for at least 12 months for at least 1,000 hours of service during the 12-month period. An employer may estimate the number of hours worked by the employee. However, the employer may not force an employee to use workflex options. \nIf an employee elects to use a workflex option offered by the employer, a written agreement signed prior to starting the arrangement must set forth the employee\u2019s work schedule with a description of the workflex option. \nEmployees who elect to use a workflex option or compensable leave under the bill must be reinstated to their same or equivalent position, unless the employee has used more than 12 weeks of compensable leave in a 12-month period, or is a key employee as defined under the Family and Medical Leave Act. The bill also notes it is not intended to relieve an employer\u2019s obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nThis bill, should it pass, would offer attractive alternatives to employers who find complying with various state and local paid leave regulations challenging. It would also offer flexible work arrangements to employees that could save employers money and reduce turnover of employees who would otherwise leave a job for family or personal reasons. \nIt would ostensibly preempt paid leave laws that are popping up all over the country, including most recently paid family leave in New York and paid sick leave in various municipalities, including Cook County, Illinois and the state of Washington. However, its overlap with various laws, including ERISA, the FMLA, and the FLSA may necessitate complex legal solutions in order to implement it. \nRetirement plan advisers and employers should continue to track this bill as it moves through the legislative process.

Few Sony products carry the same gravitational pull as the Trinitron with over 280 million tubes sold and name recognition on par with the Walkman. The apreture grill technology used in the Trinitron line gave Sony's products a unique look and made the name Trinitron a synonym for the best quality TV sets and computer monitors around. So with all of this going for the Tiritron CRT why would you choose anything else?In the late 90s and early 2000s JVC or Japan Victor Company produced an outstanding line of CRT TVs called the D series. While they don't have the apreture grill technology used in the Tritron's they have outstanding picture quality and great sound. I recently acquired a JVC AV027D500 and all pictures in this article have been captured off this TV. Let's take a look at whats included with this TV and why it matters for Retro Gaming:* 1X set of Component Inputs * 1X set of S-Video/Composite Inputs* 700 Horizontal Lines of Resolution (800 on 32\" models)* Lightweight* Curved Screen* SCART ModdableComponent is the best you get for analogue on retro retro consoles. The component inputs on this TV are great for plugging in the HD Retrovision cables or a SCART to component adapter. The D series is SCART modable but it's not worth the added cost since component is built in. While not as great as component the S-Video input is still great and is a substantial improvement over composite. Consoles that have cheap and native S-Video support like the Dreamcast and GameCube look great. The curved screen allows for 100% light gun compatibility. The JVC D series is substantially lighter than the equivalent Trinitron. A 27\" Trinitron weighs in at 98lbs while the JVC AV-27D500 weighs in at 78lbs. The biggest draw for the JVC D series is the horizontal resolution. At 700 lines for the 27\" and 800 lines for the 32\" the vertical resolution surpasses most consumer TVs (450 lines) and comes very close to a PVM/BVM. If you've been looking for a cheaper alternative to a PVM/BVM that has all of the features you need in a Retro Gaming TV take a look at the JVC D series.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crt street fight sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jvc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sony trinitron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan victor company", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:14.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "479b3110f76a51f45494606a13862c9a4871cd52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9s7BCK1Px0NkxubFHbtUAq.K1KYPNF.WIuRy6BoaqBT5BsxreLD7lHfy01.H6t89hqbShA0qYz454VXPaII3eea85huh5u_4l7grYgCe_woWIjFN_VEH3", "site_full": "www.acne.org", "site": "acne.org", "site_section": "https://www.acne.org/messageboard/forum/33-backbodyneck-acne/", "site_categories": ["dermatology", "health"], "section_title": "Back/Body/Neck acne - Acne.org Community", "title": "Neck Acne- Help? / Sebhorreic Dermatitis- Sorted! + PIC", "title_full": "Neck Acne- Help? / Sebhorreic Dermatitis- Sorted! + PIC - Back/Body/Neck acne - Acne.org Community", "published": "2017-12-07T03:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.357, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31242, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "627edfe1ea3172331f245ba03c09fec3353c3f15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9s7BCK1Px0NkxubFHbtUAq.K1KYPNF.WIuRy6BoaqBT5BsxreLD7lHfy01.H6t89hqbShA0qYz454VXPaII3eea85huh5u_4l7grYgCe_wsilIgTz8RpZol3pVUXKSd5Bn6BIcewkgQ--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "99f", "published": "2017-12-07T10:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hello my friend\nGlad to hear you feel your sebhorroic dermatitis is sorted..

We would appreciate an update, any update. Let us know if this is in progress, let us know if this is on someone's radar. Seriously, this shouldn't take months to fix. Basic badge notifications take a matter of hours to implement. Google is better than this bug. Google used to care about its users more than this.

This issue has occurred on my iPhone 6s and my iPad Air 2 running on each version of iOS 11+. This issue has only affected the Gmail app, I have not had any other apps that have been unable to clear the badge notification since updating to iOS 11.\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. With the app installed, accounts configured, and the app running in the background, receive a new email 2. The app badge icon displays 1 unread message 3. Open Gmail 4. Open the unread message to mark it as read 5. Minimize the app 6. Observe the badge icon still displays 1 unread message\nThis issue makes the Gmail app useless. One of the key features of a mail client is alerting the user when there is unread mail.

Video: August - Momentum training activists to win seats \nBob Posner, the Electoral Commission's director of political finance and regulation, said: \"Momentum are a high-profile, active campaigning body. \n\"Questions over their compliance with the campaign finance rules at June's General Election risks causing harm to voters' confidence in elections. \n\"There is significant public interest in us investigating Momentum to establish the facts in this matter and whether there have been any offences. \n\"Once complete, the Commission will decide whether any breaches have occurred and, if so, what further action may be appropriate, in line with its enforcement policy.\" \nUnder UK law, non-party campaigners are limited to spending \u00a331,980 in England; \u00a33,540 in Scotland; \u00a32,400 in Wales; and \u00a31,080 in Northern Ireland over the course of a year. \nAccording to Electoral Commission figures, Momentum spent \u00a338,743. \nNon-party campaigners can only spend above these limits if they have the authorisation of the political party they are promoting. \nIf authorised, any spending by the non-party campaigner would then count towards the party's national spending limit. \nSky News understands Labour did not authorise Momentum as a campaign group ahead of the General Election.

Meanwhile, if we see a pullback from this level, bulls will probably try to test the nearest resistance at 1.1836 - 1.1859.\nMore:\nhttps://fbs.com/analytics/articles/eur-usd-v-top-under-moving-averages-5527", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://fbs.com/img/articles/5527/1512562722-7d84b04e93f612d6ba447b8c16a3b6ea_1200x1200_q90v3.png", "https://fbs.com/analytics/articles/eur-usd-v-top-under-moving-averages-5527", "https://fbs.com/img/articles/5527/1512562722-289fb237d9fd77d2d9d78dc1642a18a6_1200x1200_q90v3.png"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:16.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6134745a7ec3b5b76a522f247c141eedc502ac99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gR2qTC3GtwPi.03rHJQCfveVSNppCPKQ_w--", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/1182022/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Moon Guard - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "[A] [H-RP] The League of Lordaeron", "title_full": "[A] [H-RP] The League of Lordaeron - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T17:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6134745a7ec3b5b76a522f247c141eedc502ac99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gR2qTC3GtwPi.03rHJQCfveVSNppCPKQ_w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Demitria", "published": "2017-12-07T17:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "[A] [H-RP] The League of Lordaeron", "text": "Coming to visit soon, I hope you don't mind snoring and barking in our sleep.\nP.S.

Lawmakers, the healthcare industry and other national and local leaders have responded appropriately to initiate new guidelines and regulations around opioid prescribing. But unfortunately, not enough people are discussing the elephant in the room: The real root of our opioid crisis is poor pain control for the 116 million Americans suffering from chronic pain. \nNot addressing coordination of care and interdisciplinary access to pain management has not only been costly for our economy \u2014 it\u2019s estimated that the nation is spending $183.5 billion annually in direct healthcare costs for musculoskeletal conditions \u2014 but also for employers. The costs of unsuccessful pain treatments can add up in the form of absenteeism, presenteeism, poor productivity on the job and higher medical costs. Bloomberg/file photo \nBut thankfully, employers can be part of the solution by offering affordable, evidence-based interventions that can help employees mitigate pain. Here are three important components of an evidence-supported pain management program that benefits administrators should consider when determining a strategy to deal with pain in the workplace. \nEducate your employees about self-care options. Self-care education should be the foundation of any pain management program. At a basic level, a pain management campaign can include flyers, posters, newsletter articles, mailings to the home and on-site staff meetings. Poor understanding of pain and what it means leads to many poor decisions and high costs; accurate and targeted information can make a difference in the choices employees make about pain. Information should help educate employees on when and how to engage with their physician or other medical provider to understand the root causes of their pain, understand medications and the appropriate application of self-care treatments, such as heat vs. ice, and identify physical as well as psychological barriers to movement. Employees should be urged to obtain guidance on posture and body mechanics to learn how to move safely, and learn mental imagery and relaxation techniques. \nFor many employees with pain, self-care options such as mindful movement, relaxation training, exercise, and posture/body mechanics training can be very effective in helping to mitigate pain and prevent re-injury. Employee education and self-care training should always be considered a first line intervention for any pain management strategy. \nGive employees access to conservative therapies. Some employees who suffer from acute and chronic pain conditions can resolve their pain completely or reduce it through first-line conservative interventions such as physical therapy, therapeutic massage, acupuncture and manual therapy, like spinal manipulation. \nReviews of these therapies and their success in managing musculoskeletal pain have been published by the American College of Physicians, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and others. The other good news is that these therapies can be affordable for employees through employer-sponsored coverage offering access in a managed setting. Various health plans and specialty benefits administrators offer low-cost, employer-sponsored plans that cover chiropractic, therapeutic massage, acupuncture and other evidence-based therapies. \nAddress psychological factors around pain and healing. Employees who suffer from severe acute pain or on-going chronic pain may find that fear is a big impediment to healing. Fear and anxiety about moving or reinjuring the body can cause maladaptive coping strategies, such as movement avoidance, catastrophizing and depression. Using cognitive behavioral training (CBT) can help by changing patterns of thinking, beliefs or behavior related to perceptions about pain. Significant results from CBT studies include reductions in pain severity, pain catastrophizing, and depression. CBT also has been shown to reduce absenteeism due to pain-related disability. Pain management programs that include CBT can prove to be a cost-effective way of helping employees return to work as happier, more productive employees. \nBenefits administrators should reach out to their benefits advisers and/or health insurance providers to learn more about their options in providing employee access to non-invasive, non-pharmacologic pain solutions. Armed with data about the high prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in America, the risks associated with opioid use, and the variety of evidence-based non-invasive interventions available, administrators can make an effective case for providing a pain management program at the workplace.

Diokno when, as head of the negotiating panel of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) in the peace talks with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), he declared that the keys to peace are \u201cfood and freedom, jobs and justice.\u201d These words also practically sum up what the basic human rights are all about. \nThese are just what we need in these trying times, when the country is facing a lot of problems and these problems are bound to escalate. \nThe peace talks between the GRP and the NDFP has been terminated. President Duterte egged soldiers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to shoot on sight armed New People\u2019s Army (NPA) guerrillas, ordered the mass arrest of NDFP consultants, and declared that he would run after so-called \u201cleftist front organizations.\u201d In short, President Duterte is ordering an escalation of military operations and the war. \nThe late dictator Ferdinand Marcos did this, in his \u201cnip in the bud\u201d military operations plan and it got the country nowhere near the road to peace. The late President Cory Aquino declared a \u201ctotal war\u201d against the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), NPA and the NDFP, still the armed conflict never abated. Who and what suffered are the people and their rights. \nThe same has been happening again. Already eight Lumad farmers have been shot to death. Fr. Tito Paez, a 72-year-old Catholic priest and staunch defender of human rights, was shot at, Monday December 4, while driving his vehicle in San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija, and died shortly thereafter. Fr.. Tito had just assisted in facilitating the release of Rommel Tucay, a political prisoner who was detained in Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija. \nPresident Duterte once taunted the NDFP by saying that the government has been fighting the NPA for 50 years and is ready to fight it for another 50 years. So clearly, he knows that the escalation of the armed conflict would not lead to peace. It would just result in more sufferings for the people. \nIf President Duterte wants to achieve peace and development, his administration should heed the words of the late Sen. Diokno that the keys to peace are \u201cfood and freedom, jobs and justice.\u201d \nThe same is true for the war on illegal drugs. Reports say that 12,000 people, mostly from the urban poor, have been killed in the government\u2019s war on drugs. Is the country anywhere near solving the problem of the illegal drug trade and use? \nWhen Rodrigo Roa Duterte was campaigning for president, he promised to solve the drug problem in six months by killing all pushers. A year and a half into his term, with 12,000 people killed, there appears to be no dent in the problem of the illegal drug trade. \nAgain, the keys to peace may be the keys to solving the drug problem: \u201cfood and freedom, jobs and justice.\u201d Provide jobs so that the people would have food on the table and would not be tempted to use and sell drugs. Protect the rights of peoples and individuals while ensuring the administration of justice in running after drug syndicates and corrupt officials. \nThe problem with the Duterte administration\u2019s approach to addressing the armed conflict, and the drug problem for that matter, is that it disregards human rights, on the illusion that it would solve the problem quickly. On the contrary, the armed conflict has been ongoing for more than 50 years and the drug problem for a lot longer than that. There is no quick fix solution. \nPresident Duterte has been quoted in news reports saying that human rights complaints in relation to his war on drugs would \u201cfall on deaf ears.\u201d I guess he would be saying the same about human rights complaints in relation to the intensified military campaign against the CPP-NPA-NDFP. \nIt is now up to the Filipino people to be, in the words of the late Sen.
