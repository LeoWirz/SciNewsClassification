The next big conflict with China is likely to be played out in the Indian Ocean and not on the Himalayas, according to acclaimed journalist and author Bertil Lintner. Speaking in a panel discussion at the launch of his new book \"China's India War: Collision Course on the Roof\" here on Wednesday evening, Lintner questioned China's new found maritime interest under its One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative. \"You hear about this OBOR thing - One Belt One Road. They want to revive old trade routes,\" he said. \"Well, they once had land routes, yes, the Silk Road . But a maritime silk route? What's that,\" he wondered. He said that the last time Chinese ships went into the Indian Ocean was in the 15th century when Zheng He, who was a Muslim from Yunnan, sailed with his fleets of junks to India, Southeast Asia and Africa . Stating that Zheng was only an adventurer, Lintner said that after that China lost interest in the oceans. \"China never had a navy. Apart from river patrol boats in the rivers to suppress banditry in their own country, now for the first time China is developing a blue water navy,\" he said. \"They have never been in the Indian Ocean for 600 years... I don't think there is going to be war in the Himalayas. Any conflict with China is going to be in the Indian Ocean.\" In his new book, Lintner rather than India, despite being seen as the provocateur of 1962 Sino-Indian conflict, it was actually China that started planning the war in 1959, much before then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru launched the Forward Policy in the border areas. Questioning Neville Maxwell's book \"India's China War\" that opined that India provoked the war with China, Lintner said that this did not make sense given the realities on the ground. Pointing out that the Forward Policy of India was adopted only in November 1961, the Swedish journalist, known for his expertise on southeast and south Asia, wondered how China was able to mobilise tens of thousands of troops in less than a year, including heavy military equipment, through one of the most difficult terrains in the world. Lintner is of the view that Maxwell must have made a misjudgment in saying that India's border issues with China could have provoked the 1962 war. Stating that in 1962 China was an extremely secretive country, Lintner said that Mao Tse-Tung's (Mao Zedong's) position in the Communist Party of China was extremely shaky after his Great Leap Forward policy in the 1950s to industrialise China turned into a disaster. \"In that kind of situation what kind of country will go to war over a disputed border?\" he questioned. \"Only a country or leader of a country who needs to unite the party, the government and the military behind him to be able to reconsolidate his grip on power.\" As to why it was India that China went to war against, Lintner said that after Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959, it became convenient for Beijing to call New Delhi the enemy coupled with the border dispute. Another reason that Lintner offered was that, with India being the leading voice of the newly independent countries in the 1950s, Mao wanted to be the leader of the Third World. Former Indian Army chief, Gen. J.J. Singh, who was one of the panellists at the book launch, said that it was high time India got under China's skin. \"We must understand the Dragon and its Middle Kingdom,\" he stated. Lt. Gen. S.L. Narasimhan (retd), a member of the National Security Advisory Board, was of the view that with ties between the then USSR and China being very low in the 1960s, Beijing wanted to prove that it was very powerful through the 1962 war. Nitin Gokhale, foounder and Editor-in-Chief of Bharatshakti.in, said that Lintner's book made two very important points: it debunked the theories of Neville Maxwell and Alistair on the causes behind the 1962 war, and that Mao Zedong used the war to purge his rivals and reinstate himself in power. 0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "himal", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "mao tse-tung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zheng he", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jawaharlal nehru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bertil lintner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maxwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalai lama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s.l. narasimhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alistair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lintner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zheng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mao zedong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.j. singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neville maxwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nitin gokhale", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "communist party of china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indian army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national security advisory board", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indian ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "himalayas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silk road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "one belt one road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yunnan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "third world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ussr", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:50.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "52475fc249bc3fc486bf243ef54372f70a29b556", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9NlBtPMlinUh_.2tvXfSLVy1IE8AupQBH3ywviBaio6xRVxcl1iHuhr1OhDOS5rkQ_A--", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html?page=4&sort=newest&pagesize=15&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'html' Questions - Page 4 - Stack Overflow", "title": "- css-grids, max-height on Chrome not working?", "title_full": "html - css-grids, max-height on Chrome not working?

Kaiden asked for play doh and an air plane. Connor asked for a Nexo Knights Lego set. Afterwards Connor wanted to pick out some gifts at Santa Express, which benefits the Vanessa Behan Crisis Center. You fill out a form saying who the child is shopping for and the amount you want to spend, then a volunteer takes your child shopping (in the same store but hidden from sight). The kids get to pick the gifts out themselves. Then they decorate paper bags and the gift goes inside the bag and gets stapled shut until Christmas. Connor loves to go every year and puts a lot of thought into the gifts he picks out for everyone. This year Kaiden was finally old enough to go with him... except he doesn't really have the concept down yet. He found some toy cars on a table and spent his time lining them up. He has some of his dad's OCD and likes his toy cars/trucks to be in a straight line.

With one fell swoop, US President Donald J. Trump declared that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish state of Israel, and that he is putting in place beginning immediately the move of the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Watch President Trump's Speech:  (If you're reading this via email,  click here to watch speech .) \"With today's action I reaffirm my administration's commitment to peace in the region\", Trump said. \"Today we call for calm, moderation and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the voice of hate\". What the president did not say  was whether or not all of Jerusalem would be considered as Israel's capital, which could be a huge sticking point in the near future. The mythical Palestinians claim the Old City area with the Temple Mount as their capital. Still, Trump today did something that no other president in our lifetime can claim, reaffirming dramatically the unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel. Palestinians burned a poster of Trump during a protest in Bethlehem, West Bank, on Tuesday in anticipation of the announcement Appearing in the  White House's  Diplomatic Reception Room  against an elaborate backdrop of Christmas decorations, He also said the United States embassy in Israel would, over time, be moved there from Tel Aviv. Israel is the only country where the United States has an embassy in a city that the host nation does not consider its capital.

Other African countries such as Burundi and Kenya also contribute to the regional force. \nThe Western-backed deployments have helped to push Islamic extremists out of Somalia's capital and other centers, even though the rebels still make frequent bombing attacks targeting public places.

Black representation in the Post-Punk scene", "text": "Via post-punk.com \nBefore post-punk and Goth in the early days of Punk, British film director, DJ and musician Don Letts pretty much ran the scene at The Roxy in London, spinning primarily reggae and ska music to patrons of all colours. with some of the white boys in the scene calling themselves skin and suedeheads before racist\u2019s co opted the terms, which is showcased in the work of The Beat , and The Specials . \nEven before that, there were proto-punk groups, such as Thin Lizzy , and Death , and later during the hardcore scene in DC there is the first band most people think of when it comes to black presentation and Punk: Bad Brains . \nPoly Styrene / X-Ray Spex \n\nOne would be gravely mistaken to think that there is no black representation in the fundamental part of Punk\u2019s history. To illustrate this fact, all one need do is take a look at photographer Michael Putland\u2019s 1980 portrait \u2018Ladies Tea Party\u2019 that features Pauline Black , and Poly Styrene , along with Debbie Harry , Viv Albertine , and Siouxsie Sioux , and Chrissie Hynde . \nBut what about Post-Punk and Goth? Some people assume there is no representation in the scene at all, and that the scene is primarily Caucasian\u2014with some Latin and Asian representation as Goth and Post-Punk have been historically popular in countries such as China, Japan, Mexico, and Chile, for example. \nAndy Anderson / The Cure \n\nCertainly there were black post-punk fans hanging out at clubs such as Danceteria in NYC, or The Batcave in London, and if you were to head over to those cities now, you would likely find representation across several generations of fans. \nPerhaps in the past, if you were to ask some Goth and Post-Punk fans if they have ever heard a black singer be spun at a club they frequent, 20 ago years they might list the song from the Silence of the Lambs\u2019s soundtrack, Goodbye Horses by Q Lazarus , or maybe the theme to T he Neverending Story , where singer Beth Anderson has her duet with Limahl from Kajagoogoo . \nAllan Dias / PiL \n\nNow, in this past decade, we have been lucky to have had two projects that were extremely popular on dancefloors from Berlin to Los Angeles in the music of O Children and Light Asylum. In fact, their songs Ruins, and Dark Allies were so popular that if you were to go out and dance at your local club, these songs may have been the only ones to remain in your memory in the aftermath of party the next day. \nAnd on that note\u2014let\u2019s not forget She Wants Revenge\u2019s Tear You Apart, which became so popular it was lovingly as overplayed as anything by Bauhaus and Joy Division. \nESG \n\nBut surely there is more than just three recent bands? And a couple of songs from the soundtracks from a fantasy film and suspense thriller. \nTo some, it may be easier to look to music that is more New Wave, such as in Simple Minds , Fun Boy Three, Culture Club, and Thompson Twins to find black representation, but is it really so difficult to find it in Goth and Post-Punk? \nBarry Adamson / Magazine \n\nOn January 20th, 2018, the first post-punk single Shot by Both Sides by Magazine turns 40 years old. The track features Barry Adamson on bass.

to acquire Zimbabwe\u2019s largest short term insurer, NicozDiamond, after getting regulatory approval, the company said yesterday. \nState-controlled pensions manager National Social Security Authority (NSSA) has transferred to FML its holdings of 300 263 184 NicozDiamond shares constituting 50.89 percent of the entire issued shares of NicozDiamond. In exchange, FML has issued and allotted 59 813 383 FML shares to NSSA. \nAs a result, NicozDiamond will become a subsidiary of FML. FML has indicated that it will consider delisting the insurer once the transaction is complete. \nFML will command an 80.92 percent controlling stake in NicozDiamond upon completion of the transaction. \nIn August FML shareholders approved a $17.25 million rights issue at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) held in August to raise the amount needed to acquire NicozDiamond , subject to regulatory approvals. \n\u201cShareholders are advised that First Mutual Holdings Limited has received regulatory approval for the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of NicozDiamond insurance Limited,\u201d FML said in a statement. \nNSSA is still in the process of procuring an additional 177 161 256 NicozDiamond shares from a third party to complete the transaction, constituting 30.03 percent of the entire issued shares of NicozDiamond, FML said \n\u201cSubject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, NSSA has irrevocably undertaken to acquire and sell these shares to FML in terms of the circular to FML shareholders issued on 10 August 2017. FML shall issue and allot 35 291 087 FML shares in consideration for this stake,\u201d FML said. \nThe 30.03 percent which NSSA irrevocably undertook to acquire and sell to FML is currently held by Zimre which recently said it no longer has intentions to sell off its shares. \nNSSA, which is pushing the transaction aims to consolidate its insurance portfolio. Its stake in FML will increase to 60.71 percent upon the completion of the transaction. \nFollowing the purchase of shares from NSSA, FML will be required to make a mandatory offer to the remaining 19.08 percent NicozDiamond shareholders in line with Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) listing requirements. \nSubject to regulatory approvals from the Insurance and Pensions Commission (IPEC) and Competitions and Tariff commision, NicozDiamond will be merged with FML\u2019s Tristar insurance company. \n\u201cAs previously communicated, the operations of NicozDiamond and Tristar Insurance Company Limited will be merged through the acquisition of Tristar by Nicozdiamond or through any other appropriate mechanism,\u201d FML added. \u2013 The Source (13 VIEWS)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicozdiamond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nicozdiamond  first mutual holdings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "first mutual", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national social security authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fml", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tristar insurance company limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nssa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicozdiamond insurance limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pensions commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "first mutual holdings limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicozdiamond", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:53.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77ee60444ebbc8a0a042f5667e93489cd7be26e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJULqzuHyJrdEZsKHqWIAopg_4G6QrvaHsoSvbrFIF_1ALGE9swJR7m7bcr.tAtYUdJkmUtwn3WwKB.tT42MR5mNy_dPARTUNb9tSJRTj51ZxBTOhDtT9Qm0.Udk10fC7MgV23Tv4BFQNqXQzx7RpOML", "site_full": "nigerianpilot.com", "site": "nigerianpilot.com", "site_section": "http://nigerianpilot.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigerian Pilot: Nigerian Newspaper", "title": "2 Policemen, NSCDC personal, civilian, under interrogation over alleged abdication in Jigawa", "title_full": "2 Policemen, NSCDC personal, civilian, under interrogation over alleged abdication in Jigawa", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://nigerianpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NigeriaPolice.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "77ee60444ebbc8a0a042f5667e93489cd7be26e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJULqzuHyJrdEZsKHqWIAopg_4G6QrvaHsoSvbrFIF_1ALGE9swJR7m7bcr.tAtYUdJkmUtwn3WwKB.tT42MR5mNy_dPARTUNb9tSJRTj51ZxBTOhDtT9Qm0.Udk10fC7MgV23Tv4BFQNqXQzx7RpOML", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "afodiya", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "2 Policemen, NSCDC personal, civilian, under interrogation over alleged abdication in Jigawa", "text": "2 Policemen, NSCDC personal, civilian, under interrogation over alleged abdication in Jigawa By \nThe Police Command in Jigawa says it is interrogating two policemen, a personal of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and one civilian over alleged abduction of fake money producer. \nThe command\u2019s Spokesman, DSP Abdu Jinjiri, confirmed this to newsmen in Dutse on Thursday. \nJinjiri said that the suspects (names withheld) were arrested in Hadejia Local Government Area of the state after they allegedly abducted the victim, Malam Ahmad Muhammad, also known as \u201cAkrami\u2019\u2019.

Ireland's Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar looks on at a news conference at Government Buildings in Dublin, Ireland December 6, 2017. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne Varadkar has played a key role in negotiations over Britain\u2019s withdrawl from the European Union this week, insisting that a tentative deal struck on the Irish border on Monday must be fulfilled if talks are to move onto the next phase, as London wants. That was in sharp contrast to a week earlier when his deputy prime minister had to resign to avert a government collapse and election before Christmas, an episode that members of Fine Gael feared would damage both the party and its leader. Yet support for Fine Gael rose by five points to 36 percent in the Irish Times/MRBI poll, while fellow centre-right rival Fianna Fail has fallen four points to 25 percent since October. The left-wing Sinn Fein party was unchanged on 19 percent. The most recent survey taken by another polling company, conducted during the government crisis, showed that the two main parties were almost neck and neck.

Ogogo and Emeagwai are Akinlabi\u2019s girlfriend and friend respectively. \nNigerian Pilot learnt that a team of five policemen, including Abua, had flagged down Ogogo at a checkpoint along Igbuzo Market. \nOne of the policemen, identified as Nwokolo, was said to have demanded money from Akinlabi and the driver told him that he did not have N200 to give him. \nNwokolo reportedly said he would take one of the N1,000 notes Jerry had on him. \nAs Akinlabi drove off from the checkpoint, Abua reportedly shot at the car and bullets pierced the back of the vehicle, hitting Ogogo, who sat at the back seat. \nThe bullet also grazed the back of Emeagwai, who was at the passenger\u2019s seat. \nAkinlabi told our correspondent that four cops, including the team leader, one ASP Akhabue, were detained by the police, while Abua evaded arrest. \nHe said, \u201cOn Sunday, November 17, 2017, I was driving to the Igbuzor Market and on getting to a checkpoint, I met the policemen. We knew one another some months ago when I had an issue concerning a property at the station. I sounded the horn to greet them, but they did not respond. READ ALSO Intrigue over appointment of NIPOST PMG may stall N11bn target for 2016 \n\u201cOne of them used his gun to hit the boot and I reversed. He said I wanted to beat the checkpoint. I told him that I assumed that they knew me very well and apologised. He demanded money. I wanted to give him N100 or N200, but it was N1,000 notes I had on me and I explained to him. \n\u201cHe said, \u2018Am I too small to collect N1,000?\u2019 When I declined to give him N1,000, he asked me to pull over, which I did. As the argument over N1,000 got heated, I entered my car and drove off. What I heard next was three gunshots aimed at my car. \n\u201cA bullet pierced into the car, hit my girlfriend\u2019s body, came out and hit my friend in the back.\u201d \nThe 22-year-old indigene of Oyo State said he took the victims to a general hospital in Igbuzo, from where Ogogo was referred to the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba. \nHe said he called a senior police officer at Asaba who notified the state Commissioner of Police of the incident. \nHe said, \u201cThe CP and the DPO of the Igbozo Police Station came to the FMC and deposited N100,000, but I have spent much more than that. Meanwhile, the policeman who shot at us had gone to drop the gun at the station and fled. The other four policemen were detained at the command headquarters. My friend and I wrote our statements there.\u201d \nAkinlabi explained that a police officer asked him to drop his car key to aid investigation. He added that he handed over the car key, but activated the steering lock because he suspected foul play. READ ALSO Kogi Govt. names road after Col. Abu Ali, Boko Haram war hero \nHe said he met with the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Zone 5, Benin, Edo State, who assigned a policeman to take his statement, adding that the policeman came down to the police command, Asaba, the following day. \n\u201cAs I was returning from Zone 5 on Monday, I received a call from the Investigating Police Officer at the police headquarters in Asaba and he asked for the steering key. The IPO and a policeman came down to the hospital and I told them I would have to look for the key when I got home. \n\u201cThe policeman sent from Zone 5 invited my friend to the police headquarters in Asaba to write his statement too. When he got there, he saw some policemen moving the car. He called to ask me if I gave them the key to unlock the steering and I said no. When I called the IPO, he confirmed what my friend said and he told me that there was no cause for alarm.\u201d \nHe said the command returned his car washed, with the bullet holes on the vehicle covered and painted, lamenting that he had not heard from the command and zone 5. \nAkinlabi\u2019s girlfriend, Ogogo, who spoke to Nigerian Pilot from the hospital, said she was on the telephone when the bullet hit her.

I have been going to the FMC to treat the gunshot injury for about three weeks now. The policemen should not go scot-free.\u201d \nHarrison Gwamnishu, the Coordinator of Behind Bars, a rights group, which Akinlabi contacted on the matter, said the group would institute a legal action against the police. \nHe said, \u201cWe want to charge the case to court as a civil matter. It is barbaric. Why did the police wash the bloodstains in the car and covered the bullet holes without the consent of the owner?\u201d \nThe Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Andrew Aniamaka, said the policemen would be brought to book if found culpable after investigation. \nHe said, \u201cThe case is being investigated. However, our utmost concern is that the injured victim gets proper treatment. The Area Commander and the DPO of the division in question are involved in the matter. \n\u201cThe case is being investigated by Zone 5. Where somebody is absent from duty for 21 days without any reason, we declare such a person a deserter. So, there is no anxiety that the policeman is on the run.

Smith is now on 938 points while Kohli is on 893 points. \n\nFormer Australia captain Ricky Ponting is the only batsman to have been at the top in all three formats at the same time - in December-January 2005-06, while his compatriot Matthew Hayden is the other batsman to have topped all three formats. \n\nThough Smith enjoys a substantial lead over Kohli, the competition for second to fifth positions remains intense. Before this Test, only 11 points separated second-ranked Pujara from fifth-ranked Kohli. \n\nFollowing the latest performances, the gap has increased slightly with 28 points now separating second-ranked Kohli from fifth-ranked Williamson. \n\nAmong other Indians, opener Murali Vijay (up three places to 25th) and middle-order batsman Rohit Sharma (up six places to 40th) are the other batsmen to move up. \n\nPujara slipped two places to the fourth spot, while Ravindra jadeja slumped to the third position after losing a place in the bolwers ranking. R Ashwin was steady at the fourth spot. \n\nIn the allrounder list, Jadeja was at the second spot, while Ashwin lost a place to be at the fourth position. \n\nFor Sri Lanka, captain Dinesh Chandimal has gained eight places to take ninth position after finishing the series with 366 runs, the first time he has moved into the top 10. \n\nAll-rounder Angelo Mathews has moved up seven places to 23rd position after scoring 111 in the first innings while Dhananjaya de Silva's match-saving 119 in the second innings has lifted him nine places to 47th position. \n\nIn the ICC Test Team Rankings , India has lost one point but remains well ahead of South Africa at the top of the rankings, while Sri Lanka remains on its pre-series tally of 94 points in sixth place. 0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "virat kohli", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ricky ponting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jadeja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kane williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe root", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pujara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murali vijay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angelo mathews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ravindra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kohli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohit sharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dinesh chandimal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhananjaya de silva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew hayden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david warner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cheteshwar pujara", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "icc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sri lanka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolkata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:54.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f2a12430aac1a56ad73ec5c3863d1b009e6f571", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_8B4ByiR2ebOiY0_mVj_EncoOjGmLQ219eiFXb8LwyYM00Ieaa21JojUbytrr4vtEODiokkGXfcG.yhSfwelqKhFwd4Yj74EmQGewYssxfDw--", "site_full": "www.charlieswonderland.co.uk", "site": "charlieswonderland.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.charlieswonderland.co.uk/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Charlie's Wonderland", "title": "3 lip products you need this Autumn.", "title_full": "3 lip products you need this Autumn.", "published": "2017-10-06T20:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5597b37af6b04fa1a4279a5126515f3c3f913502", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_8B4ByiR2ebOiY0_mVj_EncoOjGmLQ219eiFXb8LwyYM00Ieaa21JojUbytrr4vtEODiokkGXfcG.yhSfwelqKhFwd4Yj74EkUw4JhmqdT6T_0lF9wQisb", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Fashioned by Pluche", "published": "2017-12-01T16:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I've read that so many bloggers already started their Blogmas writing back in August and I'm sitting here like 'oh.... oops'.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

Sorry to yet again ask a newbe question. I hope that I one day can give something back to this forum.\nWhen searching and reading about this subject I have understood that the triumph 8 also brake isn\u2019t show stopper but can it be as bad as mine or is something wrong?\nSome background: I bought the bike (-59 TR6) this summer but haven\u2019t ridden it yet properly. One reason being that\u2019s imported from the UK and still isn\u2019t road legal here in Sweden and the other that I have been rebuilding the engine and transmission. I have also gone over most of the bike and replaced parts where needed.\nOne such part was the front brake that I thought was a bit tired ( barely working). I replaced the brake shoes but apart from that everything else looked fine. After a very short ride this winter (2 kilometres) I noticed that the front brake still wasn\u2019t performing at all. I took the brake apart the other day and found a lot of dust from the brake shoes, a lot more than you would expect from such a short ride. The big clue to the bad performance (and the brake dust) was that I had put the brake shoes on the wrong way. The right part of the shoes were at the right side of the fulcrum and pivot pin but I had them switched. I cleaned everything and put them back the right way. But still the same poor brake performance. I took everything apart again and lined the inside of the drum with adhesive sandpaper to match the shoes with the drum. After carefully \u201cgrinding\u201d away some of the shoes I took everything apart again, cleaned and rebuilt. Loosened the fulcrum, squeezed the lever and tightened the nut. Now there were some improvement but the brake are still so bad that it\u2019s dangerous. If I pull the lever really hard the bike will stop eventually but there\u2019s no \u201cbite\u201d ( the bike is just rolling down a small slope, no engine running) . It just sounds like the shoes are slipping/dragging on the inside. My previous encounters with drum brakes are that even if they are bad, if you pull hard enough they will \u201cbite\u201d. But these aren\u2019t. I can\u2019t even get my front to \u201cbow\u201d when I squeeze the handle all I can. It just slips!? The bike would probably stop faster if I dragged my feet on the ground\nI include some pictures, maybe someone sees the problem. The brake drum to seems ok. One can see that it has been machined/skimmed (is that the right word) in the past but it\u2019s nice and flat. I also had an idea that maybe the pivot and fulcrum pin were for another model and that they are causing the problem but upon inspection they seem to be in good nick and looks like the parts in the parts book. What to do?\n/ Chris\nLast edited by TrophyTR6; 12/07/17 7:14 am .\n #718007 - 12/07/17 8:39 am Re: 8 SLS performance [ Re: TrophyTR6 ] Joined: Dec 2004\nPosts: 8,947 kommando\nkommando\nJoined: Dec 2004\nPosts: 8,947\nScotland If the drum has been skimmed in the past then you need new oversize linings arc'd to the drum or made to your measurements for best performance, using std shoes in a skimmed drum will result in contact only in one section of the shoe and a weak brake.\nFor oversize shoes made to suit the drum and measurement then you can use\nhttp://villiersservices.co.uk/index... r=4&zenid=b7uqd0qk6gcnmu7j6vk5kfhjn2\nor\nhttp:/ / www.saftek.co.uk/ classics.html\nBoth have good reviews, you send them your old shoes and tell them the size of your drum ID and the OD of the shoes with no lining fitted, they then fit modern linings to suit those measurements.\nLast edited by kommando; 12/07/17 8:40 am . #718009 - 12/07/17 9:09 am Re: 8 SLS performance [ Re: TrophyTR6 ] Joined: May 2017\nPosts: 47 TrophyTR6\n TrophyTR6\nJoined: May 2017\nPosts: 47\nGothenburg, Sverige Good info kommando! But when I installed the new shoes the first time it was real snugg and there were not much clearance in the brake arm. Could the drum still be to big? In one of the pictures you can se the small edge left from skimming, its very small. I have had bikes with break drums really beaten up from wear and tear and there would still be some bite in it.

I have tried to show the edge with the arrow in the picture below\n@wak; Cable are new and a good quality one, brake lever are the correct one. Brake fulcrum arm seems to be the correct one when i look in parts book and pictures of other TR6. When you engage the brake at stand still it feels very good and there are a distict feel to it, no flexing or sounds or anything.\n\"Are you centering the brake plate before tightening the spindle nut\". Not sure what you mean by this. I don't loosen the pivot pin only the fulcrum pin when I reassemble. The brake shoes are from LF Harris, really dont know if they are good quality or not. If you google W1410 it seems to be the only ones coming up.\n@tiger100; I really want to keep the bike stock looking, its pretty much restored to original / new.\nLast edited by TrophyTR6; 12/07/17 12:51 pm . #718076 - 12/07/17 8:28 pm Re: 8 SLS performance [ Re: TrophyTR6 ] Joined: Jun 2007\nPosts: 5,527 HawaiianTiger\n HawaiianTiger\n 2007\nPosts: 5,527\nMaui Hawaii I feel your pain. My favorite bikes have these brakes installed from new. Pathetic is the best description. Of all the ones I've worked on or owned, only two had what I consider to be marginally adequate braking.\nOne was a chopper and considerably lighter than a stock bike.\nIt had the original linings from new, rock hard but the bike actually stopped OK.\nThe other had custom made lining from a vintage car racing brake shop. They installed carbon fiber linings. Initially the brake would work very similar to original linings but as they warmed up in use, they became progressively better and better until I could lock the front wheel up.\nSo I feel the solution to the problem is either to install some custom or later brake, or to install linings from a shop that specializes in drum brakes. Also, have the whole wheel chucked up and the drum skimmed, not just the drum. The drum will go oval on you when the wheel is laced up.\nThere are other considerations as well. The levers you have may not be right for your brake. On a brake like this, you want all the leverage you can get. Check the pivot bolt to nipple distance. It should be less than one inch, like 5/8\" or 3/4\". If over one inch there won't be adequate leverage for this brake.\nCheers,\nBill\nLast edited by HawaiianTiger; 12/07/17 8:37 pm .

The first thing that happened to me was that the primary chain broke and had me off in front of hundreds of people. The next was that the front cable broke and landed me in the rear of a car. Well, not landed actually, but I hit his bumper enough to wake him up. He was a good sport and was more interested in the damage to the bike than to his car though. Both hardly noticeable, I was lucky.\nEnough story telling, the point was that these things taught me that riding motorcycles is great fun, but not without some risk, and I'd better shape up and get ahead on maintenance to mitigate the mechanical ones at least. After all these two crashes were due to the state of my vehicle, not my driving.\nSo I promptly changed the cable and riveted on new linings on the brake shoes. And voila!... but no... almost no brakes at all. Upon inspection I saw that the linings hadn't yet bedded in, merely touched the drum at a few spots here and there. So I set forth and sanded down the high spots by hand, one by one, re-installed and tried again. I can't recall how many times I had to do this, but it took a lot of time and effort. It was totally worth the effort though, the brake became very good indeed, I could even lock the front wheel at moderate speeds and have the tire squealing at higher speeds if I pulled the lever really hard. It never became anything like the later brakes but acceptable and pretty safe.\nI'm sure outfits like Vintage Brake, Villiers or Saftek can go a long way in making your brake work well but the final touch may sometimes give them an edge.\nOn my Trident with the conical nave, the brakes are pretty good but when they start to lose bite, I flush through them with the garden hose. I believe accumulated brake dust acts as tiny ball bearings when wedged between the linings and the drum, and flushing them out will restore the bite. BUT! Until the water has dried out your brake will be useless, when the water has evaporated it will GRAB! and have you off if you're unprepared!\nI believe you're on the right path, just keep at it.\n#718120 - 12/08/17 1:09 pm Re: 8 SLS performance [ Re: TrophyTR6 ] Joined: May 2017\nPosts: 47 TrophyTR6\n TrophyTR6\nJoined: May 2017\nPosts: 47\nGothenburg, Sverige Thanks Bill and Roger! appreciate your feedback.

If my efforts getting the brake better with what I have I will definitely look up someone who can advice me on some other brake linings and / or skim the drum again.\n@Roger; Sounds really good you got your brake working properly, I will continue tweaking and hopefully it will get better.\nCheers/ Chris\n#718123 - 12/08/17 1:54 pm Re: 8 SLS performance [ Re: TrophyTR6 ] Joined: Feb 2012\nPosts: 115 DUHC\n DUHC\nJoined: Feb 2012\nPosts: 115\nWiltshire England Luckily I haven't had this problem with new bike brakes, but I certainly have with new brake shoes on the rear of my MGB where the handbrake would not hold the car. Picking up on Roger's point the solution was bedding them in. The new linings have to adjust to the shape of the old drum. Easy enough in a car. I drove it for a few miles with the handbrake partially on, then readjusted brakes. Voila! Good brakes. Could you ride your bike (as much as you can legally) with the brake adjusted so that the shoes were as near as possible touching drum, and then go for a ride, and then re-adjust?\n#718133 - 12/08/17 4:06 pm Re: 8 SLS performance [ Re: DUHC ] Joined: Sep 2008\nPosts: 556 Stein Roger\n Stein Roger\nJoined: Sep 2008\nPosts: 556\nSkudeneshavn Norway The downside to running with the brakes on is that you can overheat, or \"cook\" the linings, which will destroy them. Owners manuals used to specify how to run in, or \"burnish\" the brakes, the information is still easily found on the web. It involves numerous brake and let cool cycles and part of the process is to permanently alter the composition of the brake friction compound. A sort of curing process if you will. It will also mate the surfaces, but that depends on how high the high spots are and so on.\nSanding them is a good DIY way to achieve a good fit. High spots will appear as polished areas against the matte surface of the lining.\nIt's important to let the brakes cool between applications. This is how I did it over 40 years ago, not because I was so smart but it felt right somehow, and later I learned it was.\nDumb luck is better than no luck.\n#718146 - 12/08/17 6:41 pm Re: 8 SLS performance [ Re: TrophyTR6 ] Joined: Jun 2007\nPosts: 5,527 HawaiianTiger\n HawaiianTiger\n 2007\nPosts: 5,527\nMaui Hawaii I wanted to add another item to the list to check.\nA lot has been written here about the conical brake(BSA designed item) fitted to early 70's Triumphs, nicknamed \"Comical' brake by some because of how poor these brakes function.\nI had one in my shop this year and one of the things the owner wanted me to address was the poor performance of the front brake.\nI had it apart, carefully inspected it, replaced the shoes, properly assembled it only to have it perform exactly the same; very poorly.\nLooking at the cable, I saw it was of a rather small diameter and had a brake light switch in line.

I'm currently modifying 58 SLS to a Bendix Duo-Servo type of thing, that'll be interesting. I have a 67 Bonnie here with a decent SLS brake, but it has the wider linings that came in 66 I believe. It has good stopping power but it takes a while to build up. Like there's a built in delay somewhere. I hope cleaning and lubricating will sort it.\nMy former wife had a 3TA with a 7\" brake that simply defied anything I did to it, sometimes these things simply beat me. I can't believe they used the same brake on the 6T.\nBill, my Conicals were always good brakes, provided you kept them in adjustment, changed the brake cable switch for a solid piece, or, as on my current Trident, replaced it with a new beefy cable without it. I ordered mine directly from Venhill. I have extended the brake arms 35mm, but in the light of experience I'd say 25mm/1\" should suffice. It made a big difference anyway. Periodic cleaning with water as mentioned before usually helps a lot.\nRod, I've always wanted to try that but never did. Do you have first hand experience with this? I'm thinking that the thickness of the sand paper would make the lining radius slightly smaller than the drum, or is the difference so small as to be negligible?\nHow about fixing sand paper to the linings to freshen up the drum, have you tried that?\n#718213 - 12/09/17 10:22 am Re: 8 SLS performance [ Re: TrophyTR6 ] Joined: Aug 2001\nPosts: 6,965 triton thrasher\n triton thrasher\nJoined: Aug 2001\nPosts: 6,965\nscotland Wanna see something scary?\nAmateur Loctite enthusiast. #718215 - 12/09/17 11:03 am Re: 8 SLS performance [ Re: triton thrasher ] Joined: May 2017\nPosts: 47 TrophyTR6\n TrophyTR6\nJoined: May 2017\nPosts: 47\nGothenburg, Sverige Originally Posted by HawaiianTiger I wanted to add another item to the list to check.\nA lot has been written here about the conical brake(BSA designed item) fitted to early 70's Triumphs, nicknamed \"Comical' brake by some because of how poor these brakes function.\nI had one in my shop this year and one of the things the owner wanted me to address was the poor performance of the front brake.\nI had it apart, carefully inspected it, replaced the shoes, properly assembled it only to have it perform exactly the same; very poorly.\nLooking at the cable, I saw it was of a rather small diameter and had a brake light switch in line.

This time it got even worse, now I can literally pull the brake lever all I can and then walk with the bike and nothing happens, well you can hear the noise from the brake but nothing more. Its obvious this break is extremely sensitive or have gotten very sensitive over the last 60 years.

That is the question\" I only have it as a PDF so cannot reproduce it here and I dont have the web source noted. I think I got it after a forum search. May have been here or on B50.org\nAnyway it discusses the cutaway of the lining. TT has got all the clues on this, but I wonder if you put the biggest cutaway (relived lining) on the trailing shoe whether this would help? It looks to me like the big cutaway is on the leading edge. This may exacerbate the effect TT is talking about I believe. But, employ the extreme caution about strong servo action mentioned above, however, if testing this.\nLooking at your photos they look like lovely new linings that are made of a bonded composite material. My experience with those is that they are inferior. I even bought expensive Ferodo brand linings which were no better then the mush sold by the local guy. As an improvement on new 'bonded' linings I installed the best set of original linings I could find, even though they were worn. I finally found a local source for 'woven' linings after seeking information here. Woven linings had been recommended as being very useful. I found they transformed the rear brake potential. There's a photo in my rebuild thread http://www.britbike.com/forums/ubbt... ;Main=72865&Number=693695#Post693695 Havent got to the front brake yet as the original linings are working well. But this will be happening soon.\nI know several of the UK-based members used a relining service that seemingly fits woven linings (product name finishes in 'Gold?'). I think Villiers Services that Kommando mentions could be one of those. As Bill says, definitely get rid of any cable with a brake light switch. These add excess sponginess. I now get my cables custom made and they are better than many of the bike shop ones.\nRay\nLast edited by BrizzoBrit; 12/10/17 2:09 am .

Photograph: Niall Carson/PA Google EU warns tech firms: remove extremist content faster or be regulated \nEuropean commission tells Facebook, Google, YouTube, Twitter and others that legislation is being considered if self-regulation continues to fail Thursday 7 December 2017 09.47 GMT Last modified on Thursday 7 December 2017 09.49 GMT View more sharing options Share on Messenger Close \nThe European Commission has warned Facebook , Google, YouTube, Twitter and other internet technology companies that they must do more to stem the spread of extremist content or face legislation. \nGrowing pressure from European governments has meant progress has been made by companies in significantly boosting their resources dedicated to help take down extremist content as quickly as possible. \nBut on Wednesday the EU security commissioner Julian King said: \u201cWe are not there yet. We are two years down the road of this journey: to reach our final destination we now need to speed up our work.\u201d \nThe remarks came at the closing of the third meeting of the EU Internet Forum, which brings together the commission, EU member states, law enforcement and technology companies. \nIf the EU is not satisfied with the further progress on the removal of extremist content by technology companies, which are primarily based in the US, it said it will come forward with legislation next year to force the issue. \nWhile an online hate speech law will already come into effect on 1 January in Germany, the commission said it is keen to avoid a patchwork of national laws on the issue, favouring a self-regulatory approach. \nA group of technology companies pooling resources to combat extremist content called the Global Internet Forum \u2013 a group which includes Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube \u2013 said that progress had been made with Europol. A database of known \u201cterrorist\u201d images and videos now contains more than 40,000 hashes, or digital signatures, allowing quicker detection and removal of the content, with the aim of being within one to two hours of it being uploaded. \n\u201cIt is feasible to reduce the time it takes to remove content to a few hours,\u201d said Dimitris Avramopoulos, EU home affairs commissioner. \u201cThere is a lot of room for improvement, for this cooperation to produce even better results, starting with the reporting from the companies, which must become more regular and more transparent.\u201d \nThe commission wants companies to make greater use of automatic detection technologies and act faster on referrals from member states and Europol. \nThe Counter Extremism Project (CEP), a non-profit organisation, said efforts by the companies were encouraging but did not make a strong case for continued self-regulation. \n\u201cInstead, what the EU Internet Forum should aim to deliver are concrete, industry-wide policies on blocking or rapidly removing illegal content and consistent enforcement of those policies,\u201d said David Ibsen, executive director of the CEP.

Most MSPs offer bottom dollar pay, or at best only average pay and demand a LOT of their employees. For example:\nTime tracking (stressful)\nBillable hrs / week met (stressful)\nEvening work for downtime stuff\nWeekend work for downtown\nOn call\nHealth benefits pricy and/or crap (Kaiser SUCKS)\nOvertime for projects\nAnd all of the above without extra pay.\nBefore you mention comp time, no, comp time for weekend work is NOT a fair trade. Why? Because weekends are more valuable. Most people cannot honestly argue this point. In fact, many MSPs actually charge extra for weekend support and projects, but refuse to pay extra to workers for the same weekend.\nIf you are different, say so, and advertise it. If not, that's your problem. In today's IT market, you will have difficulty finding talent (they get sick of MSPs and the stress) or you won't keep good talent if you work employees as described above.\nThere are TONS of careers for the highly skilled IT/Network admin that require less hours, less stress, and provide better pay and better benefits. There are even some without any On call and without any overtime, evening work, or weekend work that pay 6 digits, have excellent health, and tons of other perks.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:56.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a785741242b1e19e3d848e6fd8c0bea933c18e4b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/umBmlSSxw9wzZ0Bty8rgSfv7f2XozEEDxHdTPxaxtFfFZ_WUePJs1ZpJW0jgkRsVKzqfWlHsMkgmuvQA66goi6uaymu6LQOWyE48QVBSGy_w6hbc8S0mxFFh9zZQ6yXTtdOELOZAsnBr3dR76MqJhArj4BGfGzehZ5f.taXRILpBT4PaShA9w3uln2efwXBraJK__M5hBW68c6yWG.eNzw--", "site_full": "xtragfx.com", "site": "xtragfx.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/xtragfx/YuXJ", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "xtraGFX.com | Creating the Pixels", "title": "CodeCanyon - Santa Runner v1.0 & + Buildbox 2 file + Admob + Leaderboard + Review + Share Button - Android - 19117892", "title_full": "CodeCanyon - Santa Runner v1.0 & + Buildbox 2 file + Admob + Leaderboard + Review + Share Button - Android - 19117892", "published": "2017-12-07T10:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://xtragfx.com/uploads/posts/2017-12/1512636800_6441.cod_canyon___santa_runn_r_v1.0_____buildbox_2_fil____admob___l_ad_rboard___r_vi_w___shar__button___android___19117892.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a785741242b1e19e3d848e6fd8c0bea933c18e4b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/umBmlSSxw9wzZ0Bty8rgSfv7f2XozEEDxHdTPxaxtFfFZ_WUePJs1ZpJW0jgkRsVKzqfWlHsMkgmuvQA66goi6uaymu6LQOWyE48QVBSGy_w6hbc8S0mxFFh9zZQ6yXTtdOELOZAsnBr3dR76MqJhArj4BGfGzehZ5f.taXRILpBT4PaShA9w3uln2efwXBraJK__M5hBW68c6yWG.eNzw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alex_Sounder", "published": "2017-12-07T10:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "CodeCanyon - Santa Runner v1.0 & + Buildbox 2 file + Admob + Leaderboard + Review + Share Button - Android - 19117892", "text": "CodeCanyon - 3D Car Race v1.1 + Leaderboard + Achievement + Admob - 10007626 CodeCanyon - 3D Car Race v1.1 + Leaderboard + Achievement + Admob - 10007626 DEMO This is a Java, Android based...

It seems that there will be plenty of content when the game comes out. We saw the new desert map recently and the new vehicle, now we are getting a new gun, the R45 Revolver. Although there is a revolver in the game, this one is different. \nThe R45 Revolver is different in some way, as compared to the revolver that is already present in the game. For one, you can attach a sight on the gun in order to get a better aim. Other than that all the bullets can be reloaded at once rather than a single bullet at a time. This makes the gun similar to other pistols and greatly reduces the reload time as compared to the other revolver. \nThe gun uses the .45 ACP ammo, which is found in abundance in the game. I am pretty sure that the damage will be lower as compared to the existing revolver that uses the 7.62 rounds but the lower reload speed should compensate for that . We will see how well the weapons perform when the game comes out but you can check it out on the test servers. \nYou can check out the new vehicle and the new R45 Revolver below. \nPlayerunknown\u2019s Battlegrounds has been in early access for a long long time and I have been playing the game ever since. Now the game is supposed to come out in a few days and I am looking forward to the release.
