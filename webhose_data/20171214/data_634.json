Das Projekt unter Federf\u00fchrung der Universit\u00e4t Kassel erarbeitet ein f\u00fcr Cloud-Dienste geeignetes Zertifizierungsverfahren f\u00fcr die Europ\u00e4ische Datenschutz-Zertifizierung. Zu den assoziierten Partnern geh\u00f6ren unter anderem das Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI), die PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft sowie das Unabh\u00e4ngige Landeszentrum f\u00fcr Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein. Der IT- und Marketingdienstleister Consultix bringt seine langj\u00e4hrige Expertise im Bereich Datenschutz und Zertifizierungen in das AUDITOR-Projekt ein. \"Wir wollen das Ansinnen unterst\u00fctzen, eine europaweit einheitliche Zertifizierung unter Einbindung der etablierten Normen zu entwickeln, um Klarheit und Rechtssicherheit bei Cloud-Diensten zu schaffen\", sagt Andres Dickehut, gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrender Gesellschafter der Consultix GmbH. Ein halbes Jahr vor Inkrafttreten der EU-Datenschutz-Grundverordnung (EU-DSGVO) biete der Markt einen \"kaum \u00fcberschaubaren Dschungel an Angeboten und Zertifizierungen\". Die Consultix GmbH bringt in das AUDITOR-Projekt ihre umfassende Expertise als einziges deutsches Unternehmen mit einer Marketing-L\u00f6sung ein, die wiederholt mit dem h\u00f6chsten europ\u00e4ischen Zertifikat f\u00fcr Datensicherheit, EuroPriSe, ausgezeichnet wurde. Mit ProCampaign managen internationale Konzerne \u00fcber 100 Millionen Verbraucherdaten in mehr als 50 L\u00e4ndern. Au\u00dferdem er\u00f6ffnete die Consultix GmbH mit ihrem Schwesterunternehmen ColocationIX GmbH erst k\u00fcrzlich im Bremer Westend ein Hochsicherheits-Rechenzentrum f\u00fcr Private- und Public Cloud-Dienste auf Grundlage der strengsten Rechenzentrumsnormen DIN EN 50600 Klasse 4 sowie TIA-942 Tier 4. \"Datensicherheit ist von jeher unsere Kernexpertise und ein zentrales Thema der EU-Datenschutz-Grundverordnung. Die Aufnahme als assoziierter Partner in das AUDITOR-Projekt best\u00e4tigt unser Know-how, wor\u00fcber wir uns au\u00dferordentlich freuen. Es wird unser Antrieb sein, im Interesse der deutschen und europ\u00e4ischen Wirtschaft ein einheitliches Europa-Zertifikat f\u00fcr Cloud-Dienste zu entwickeln und zu etablieren\", sagt Andres Dickehut.

Here is a first\u2014a 3-D printed plastic object that has a sensor and can connect to WiFi- connected devices on its own. An interesting example is a detergent bottle which can detect when there only a little bit of detergent left and automatically order more on the internet. \nBut how can a lump of plastic, without any electronics, connect to WiFi? University of Washington researchers used backscatter techniques to let the devices exchange information . Backscatter technology usually uses an antenna to reflect radio signals that exchange information. The WiFi router can then decode these reflected signals. This 3-D printed object was able to communicate with a router through its own antenna made from plastic and copper. The 3-D attachment that can be used with a laundry detergent bottle. Image credits: Mark Stone/University of Washington. \nElectrical components were replaced by purely mechanical components, such as springs, gears, and switches, so that they could be easily 3-D printed. The design was heavily inspired by battery-free watches . The design is also complete with a sensor. Motion on the sensor, such as the pouring out of detergent, triggers different gears and springs. The movement causes a conductive switch to send signals to the router. When a certain \u201clow\u201d point is reached, then the device communicates that it needs more detergent. \n\u201cAs you pour detergent out of a Tide bottle, for instance, the speed at which the gears are turning tells you how much soap is flowing out. The interaction between the 3-D printed switch and antenna wirelessly transmits that data,\u201d said senior author and Allen School associate professor Shyam Gollakota. \u201cThen the receiver can track how much detergent you have left and when it dips below a certain amount, it can automatically send a message to your Amazon app to order more.\u201d \nThe 3-D model instructions are being made available to the public, so that anyone with access to a 3-D printer can make these nifty gadgets that can communicate with other objects without wires or electronics. Other designs include a slider that controls music volume, a sensor that sends an alarm to your phone when there is a water leak, and a sensor that can detect low levels of flour or cereal and orders more. They operate with a flow meter, wind meter, or scale. \nThough a device like this isn\u2019t really necessary (you can see for yourself when the detergent is running low), the mechanism is quite interesting and could, perhaps, be used for other applications. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shyam gollakota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elena motivans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark stone/university", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:22.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12394d18acd07b59fcc24535e67406a6914097ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey9UH.qcxnsxdjhzXhXQrtW28yKBv5M.N5QfbvDahkDIbOt8FdelfKj6VEQlois4ksl2uphbwfo8vQ--", "site_full": "forums.wynncraft.com", "site": "wynncraft.com", "site_section": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/forums/nemracts-bar.78/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Nemract's Bar | Wynncraft Forums", "title": "My Warrior Is Dead / Random Semi Rant", "title_full": "My Warrior Is Dead / Random Semi Rant | Wynncraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T15:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/data/avatars/m/54/54483.jpg?1475459546", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "30d60d856f19aa41e40b5463970542841fc53af6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey9UH.qcxnsxdjhzXhXQrtW28yKBv5M.N5QfbvDahkDIbOt8FdelfKj6VEQlois4kskZHKCrZBmVqA--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Dr Zed", "published": "2017-12-06T15:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Or you know, play assassin and get the best of both worlds, but also poor mobility in the early game.

The most problematic parts of it have been those small leaky cysts (almost always on my cheeks and/or chin), with the whole thing exasperated by the fact I'm a life long compulsive picker.\nI've been on Lymecycline and adapalene gel since around March 2015, with a dermatologist doubling my Lymecycline dose from 408mg to 816mg per day earlier this year. These help, but not completely. My dermatologist won't put me on roaccutane because of my mental health (depression & C-PTSD) which is fair enough, but still disheartening. I'm 24 so I'm at an age where most of my friends are getting over their acne, but mine's still grumbling along.\nI'm working on picking/dietary/lifestyle causes; trying to cut down on dairy, carbs, sugar and smoking. I now only wear make up if I'm going out to dinner or the club or something (maybe once a week). My picking habits and skin have improved massively since getting acrylic nails put on, but it's still nowhere near clear and there are still a lot of scars/hyperpigmentation (?) that I'd like to clear.\nI've attached a photo of the section of my face doing the worst atm. The big red spot high up on my cheek was a cyst that I picked (naughty, but I'm trying!) and I feel like there were multiple heads/pockets of pus within it that went quite deep down into my skin. I'll usually have around two of these at any one time; a lot of the marks left on my face are from old cysts. I've seen you give some really good advice to other people on here, so any help or advice you have for me would be hugely appreciated. Thank you\nThanks for replying and sharing.\nDo you have acne anywhere else? What is the extent of your lifestyle modifications (how strict were you on cutting down carbs; what is your smoking history)? Any history of PCOS or in the females in your family? What is acne like in your family? Did you start your period early, normal, or late compared to your friends? What is the timing of your acne (constant, comes and goes [how often?])? When you get a pimple does it look like the one to the bottom-left of the cyst you picked or whtat do they look like?

Using high-resolution manometry (HRM), this study aims to identify positional adaptations of pharyngeal physiology by evaluating swallowing pressure patterns in a series of inverted body positions. Ten healthy adults each underwent swallowing tasks with pharyngeal HRM at six body positions using an inversion table (0\u00b0[upright], 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0[supine], 110\u00b0, 135\u00b0, and 180\u00b0[fully inverted]). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess impact of position on pressure parameters, and pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients translate. Velopharyngeal pressures varied by position ( P  < 0.001), with significantly higher pressures generated with inversion \u226590\u00b0, compared with upright and 45\u00b0. Change in position did not significantly affect common mesopharyngeal pressures or swallowing pressure durations. UES valving mechanisms were preserved during inversion, with subtle variations observed in integral pressures ( P  = 0.011). Pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients changed with position ( P  < 0.01), increasing with inversion > 90\u00b0 compared to upright and 45\u00b0. Mechanisms of deglutition may differ with position and relative direction of gravity, particularly when at > 45\u00b0 inclination. Increased palatal pressure is generated in the upside-down position to achieve nasopharyngeal closure and prevent regurgitation. While other classically measured pressures may not consistently differ with positioning, many individuals exhibit adaptations in pressure gradients when inverted, likely due to a combination of changes in pharyngeal driving force and UES opening mechanisms. Identification of these changes, relative to position, further builds on our understanding of the adaptability of the pharyngeal swallowing system.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2nzWiCa\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hrm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anova", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:22.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12394d18acd07b59fcc24535e67406a6914097ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey9UH.qcxnsxdjhzXhXQrtW28yKBv5M.N5QfbvDahkDIbOt8FdelfKj6VEQlois4ksl2uphbwfo8vQ--", "site_full": "forums.wynncraft.com", "site": "wynncraft.com", "site_section": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/forums/nemracts-bar.78/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Nemract's Bar | Wynncraft Forums", "title": "My Warrior Is Dead / Random Semi Rant", "title_full": "My Warrior Is Dead / Random Semi Rant | Wynncraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T15:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/data/avatars/m/54/54483.jpg?1475459546", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "32b33d550706eb40bee73ba44b707d16ac21fa54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey9UH.qcxnsxdjhzXhXQrtW28yKBv5M.N5QfbvDahkDIbOt8FdelfKj6VEQlois4ksl12myAHKDpqQ--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "orange0404", "published": "2017-12-06T15:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Dr Zed said: \u2191 Or you know, play assassin and get the best of both worlds, but also poor mobility in the early game.

I have tried a number of times to use the service via the app on the phone, and it continually says there are no drivers available. I live near the PEA building on the south ring road, not all that far from the airport, and I would have thought they would pick up. I also tried to book one in town and it again said the service was unavailable. Getting a little p*ssed off with their claim to fame !! You might be a bit on the 'outer limits' unless there's someone already on the south side of the airport. What time of day are you getting blanked? My experience is limited to 3 hires; 2 of them were mid-late evening from airport to other side of town and got a ride pretty much straight away with both drivers being on the west ring road already. The third one was again from the airport but just before lunch and it took 5 attempts to get a driver, eventually picking one up who was just north of the airport.

His father is ill. The East Ranch is in financial trouble. And now it\u2019s on Clayton, the prodigal son, to make sure his family doesn\u2019t lose everything. \nHeadstrong Abby Harper is like a mother to her younger brothers, who she\u2019s helped raise since she was a teenager. Keeping them in line is no small task while she\u2019s also working toward her college degree. And now that one of her brothers has been arrested for stealing cattle at the East Ranch, Abby is at her wit\u2019s end. But there is a silver lining: Clayton East. He believes in second chances, and is willing to give one to her brother this Christmas. Letting beautiful Abby\u2015and the inescapable longing in his heart\u2015off the hook, however, is a whole \u2019nother story. Could it be that the woman of this local hero\u2019s dreams has been back at home all along? \n\nREAD AN EXCERPT: \n\n\n\n\n\nMY REVIEW: \n\n\nThe Christmas Cowboy Hero by Donna Grant \nMy rating: 5 of 5 stars \n\nThe Christmas Cowboy Hero by Donna Grant is a 2017 St. Martin\u2019s Press publication. \n\nThis one\u2019s a winner!! \n\nEx-Navy SEAL AND a Cowboy? Yes, please.\n\nClayton has returned home at his mother\u2019s bidding, due to his father\u2019s sudden illness and the family ranch teetering on bankruptcy, due to a major embezzlement scheme and cattle theft ring. \n\nWhen Abby Harper\u2019s younger brother is caught stealing cattle, as his guardian, she must sort things out. When Clayton realizes Abby is raising her brothers and is a little overwhelmed, his heart melts a little, and he decides to cut her some slack, by generously allowing her brother to work off his debt at his ranch.\n\nAs Abby begins to spend a little time at the ranch, she learns of Clayton\u2019s financial issues and winds up helping him uncover the embezzlement issues, but she also finds herself falling for the tortured cowboy, and Clayton begins to have feelings for the beautiful lady who had to grow up too quickly when she had to step up and become a parent to her brothers at the ripe old age of eighteen. \n\nI loved this story for many reasons. Everyone deserves a second chance, and although Clayton may have been moved more by Abby than her brother\u2019s regret and remorse for the crimes he committed, by having him work off his debt, it helped Brice build character, and he responded to having a stable male presence in his life. \n\nI also love the tortured hero complex and Clayton has all those traits. His time in the military left him hallowed out and the loss of his brother gutted him. You won\u2019t be able to resist this big hearted Texan! \n\nAbby is being taken advantage of by her boss, has her hands full trying to make ends meet, and raise her brothers. I admired her loyalty and responsibility to her brothers, and I\u2019m glad she found a better life for herself and her brothers. \n\nThis may be my favorite contemporary holiday romance, so far, this year! It\u2019s sensual and sexy, but also has a little suspense and mystery, with lots of drama and a heartwarming holiday atmosphere to top it all off. That I\u2019m a little partial towards SEALS and cowboys is also a big added bonus! This is the first book in a new series, and that means more Texans and more cowboys. I can sense my romance novel diet could be coming to an end. So, Merry Christmas to me!! \n\nThis one gets all the stars! \n\n5 stars \n\n\n\n\n  GET YOUR COPY HERE: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Cowboy-Hero-Heart-Texas-ebook/dp/B06Y5L7CL4/ \n\nhttps://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-christmas-cowboy-hero-donna-grant/1125902867 \n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n\n\n\nNew York Times and USA Today bestselling author Donna Grant has been praised for her \"totally addictive\" and \"unique and sensual\" stories.

His problems are just piling one upon the other as his recent release Firangi has not performed very well at the box-office. And on the top of that his director-choreographer friend Farah Khan is also angry with him. \nIt was at the time of the film\u2019s screening that Farah had expressed her displeasure. According to her Kapil should have at least made a call, rather than just sending a Whatsapp invite. \nShe had even taken to Twitter calling him \u2018mannerless\u2019. Read here:Here\u2019s Why Farah Khan Called Firangi Star Kapil Sharma Mannerless! \nAnd now the comedian has reacted on Farah\u2019s remark. SKJ Bollywood News has quoted him saying, \u201dWe had a show on Thursday. In whatever way I thought correct I had invited all my friends from the film industry.\u201d \nHoping that other people from the industry will see the film later, Kapil said, \u201c It was mostly attended by cast crew and our friends and family. I hope my big powerful friends of the film industry will see the film later.\u201d \nRajiev Dhingra, the director of Firangi seems to be very upset with whatever has been happening with his actor-comedian friend. He said, \u201dI don\u2019t understand this negativity surrounding Kapil. Why is he being treated like this? Could it be he has offended important people by just being who he is? Even the reviews for Firangi are pretty harsh. I don\u2019t think we deserve such condemnation.\u201d \nIt was also very recent that Kapil failed to turn up at a media event. Even though he had signed a contract and had also shot for the promos! \nTalking about Kapil Sharma\u2019s film Firangi, it has managed to collect around Rs 8 crores at the box-office.

We studied the effect of cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) preservation on culture results and performance of Xpert MTB/RIF.; Consecutive sputum samples from microscopy smear-positive TB patients were collected. Two-hundred samples were equally split in two aliquots, one aliquot was treated with CPC and stored at ambient temperature for 7 days. The second aliquot was immediately processed. Samples were decontaminated for 20, 15 or 10 min, and subsequently cultured on L\u00f6wenstein-Jensen medium. Furthermore, 50 samples were stored for 7, 14 and 21 days, and 100 CPC-pretreated samples tested by Xpert MTB/RIF.; CPC pretreated samples showed a higher culture yield compared to non-treated sputum samples across all decontamination times: 94% vs. 73% at 10 min (p = 0.01), 94% vs. 64% at 15 min (p = 0.004), and 90% vs. 52% at 20 min (p < 0.001). The quantitative culture grading was consistently higher in CPC treated compared to non-CPC treated samples. The proportion of contaminated cultures was lower in CPC pretreated samples across all decontamination times (range 2-6%) compared to non-CPC treated samples (15-16%). For storage times of CPC treated samples of 7, 14, and 21 days, 84, 86, and 84% of the respective cultures were positive. Of 91 CPC treated samples with a positive culture, 90 were also Xpert MTB/RIF positive.; CPC increases culture yield, decreases the proportion of contamination, and does not alter the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2BQfU8n\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cpc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "non-cpc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:25.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "329f4bdb6c2acc951b994be1e67a3ab8916bdb88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAipe2pr83UBKTAQJXg7kCWpw-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/gmail-app", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "Adding another Gmail account", "title_full": "Adding another Gmail account - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "329f4bdb6c2acc951b994be1e67a3ab8916bdb88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAipe2pr83UBKTAQJXg7kCWpw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Amy Drummond", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Adding another Gmail account", "text": "Hello!\nI have the Gmail app on my phone & would like to add my work Gmail account to it.

Each bolt of lightning illuminated the sky with an iridescent glow that gave clear understanding of the term, electric blue. \n\u201cThis is spectacular,\u201d Lank said. \n\u201cIt is pretty incredible,\u201d Summer agreed. It was the first time they had been seen each other in forty-eight hours, and Lank couldn\u2019t help but see the irony of them being together during a lightning storm. Every time he thought about her lately, he felt like he\u2019d been hit by a bolt out of the blue. \nAnother strike hit a distant mountain with offshoots of light emanating from the bolt like the long, spindly branches of a tall, pine tree. \n\u201cThe lightning is seriously intense,\u201d Lank said, feeling like a kid mesmerized by his first storm. \n\u201cAnd dangerous. One strike to a dry, dead tree can start a fire that would spread for miles and lay waste to everything in its path.\u201d \nLank marveled once again with his new appreciation for nature. \u201cI guess that\u2019s something I\u2019ve never given a thought to. Forest fires are pretty non-existent on the east coast.\u201d \n\u201cAnd pretty common out here. We had one about seven or eight years ago that spread all the way up to the base of the San Juan\u2019s. You could see the haze and smell the smoke even with the doors and windows closed.\u201d \nLank was speechless. He\u2019d never seen such a beautiful storm, and it was hard to reconcile that with the destruction that he knew a forest fire could create. He turned to Summer. \n\u201cWhy do you stay up here? So far from civilization? With bears and mountain lions and lightning that could burn down your house? Why, with everything you\u2019ve gone through over the past couple months, do you stay in this house, on this mountain, alone?\u201d \nSummer looked at Lank and then turned back to the light show. She fiddled with the cross dangling below her throat as she watched the light flash across the sky. When she finally spoke, her voice was low, and her gaze was fixed on the black horizon with its intermittent blue light. \n\u201cOnce, when I was younger, my parents took us to Disney World. It was a dream come true for me. Even Johnny, who acted like it was a stupid trip for his baby sister, had the time of his life. We went to all the parks, rode all the rides, watched the shows, and had our pictures taken with every Disney character imaginable.\u201d \nLank watched her as she spoke. Her red hair hung loose around her shoulders, and the occasional flash of light made her eyes even greener than usual. She was the most beautiful sight he had seen since he\u2019d arrived in Colorado. He watched her lips curve into a smile as she remembered her family trip. \n\u201cOne night, we went to see Fantasmic, the light and water show. Have you seen it?\u201d She turned and looked at Lank who shook his head, too awestruck by her to speak. \n\u201cIt was this amazing show of lights and lasers and water spouts. But as I watched it, all I could think about was that it was made up. It was a technological wonder of grand proportions, but it was a show.\u201d She turned back to Mother Nature\u2019s show outside the window. \u201cThis,\u201d she said as she gestured to the sky, \u201cthis is the real deal. This is a light show of epic proportions that Walt Disney could only dream of portraying with his fancy lights and music.\u201d \nSummer turned to Lank and smiled. \u201cI wake up every morning with a heavenly masterpiece painted across the sky outside my window. I drive to work amid the majesty of the most beautiful mountains in the world. I see God\u2019s version of a magical light show every time we have a storm. If I\u2019m lucky, Black and I can spot a bobcat or a mother bear and cubs up on one of our rides. I walked through Cinderella\u2019s castle, rode the Matterhorn, watched Fantasmic, and met creatures of all kinds in their costumes and wigs, but I never once saw anything that compares to what I have on top of this mountain.\u201d \nWithout thinking, Lank reached up and tucked the stray lock of hair behind her ear. He felt Summer catch her breath at his touch. His hand lingered near her face before he gently touched her cheek and let his finger trail down her face. \n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything as beautiful as what\u2019s standing in front of me at this moment,\u201d Lank said quietly as he lightly caressed her cheek with the back of his fingers. \n\u201cLank, I,\u201d Summer began to speak, but Lank put his finger on her lips. \n\u201cShh,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything. I think you know how I feel, but I don\u2019t think you know how you feel. Not yet.\u201d He felt her shiver and saw the relief in her eyes. It was all he could do not to take her into his arms. \n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m here on business. God help me, I might not sleep a wink waiting for you to decide what you want, but once you can see clearly and choose me for who I am and not what I can do to save you; once you\u2019re no longer the damsel in distress but the strong woman I believe you to be, then I\u2019ll be here.\u201d \nLank leaned down and placed a soft, gentle kiss on her lips before backing away and heading upstairs to the room next door to hers. He had made up his mind, right or wrong. Summer was the only woman who had ever made him feel this way \u2013 focused yet confused, secure yet unsteady, manly yet like a child in need. He was too far gone to turn back now. About Amy Schisler \nAward-winning author, Amy MacWilliams Schisler, grew up in Maryland, not far from Washington, DC.

In order to explore the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of this class of marine natural products, analogues of thiaplidiaquinones A and B and their regioisomers were synthesised, with variation in the number of isoprene units present in their side chains to afford prenyl and farnesyl analogues. The previously reported geranyl series of compounds were found to be the most potent FTase inhibitors closely followed by the novel farnesyl series. The prenyl series exhibited the most potent anti-plasmodial activity but the series was also the most cytotoxic. Overall, the farnesyl series exhibited moderate anti-plasmodial activity with one analogue, 14 also exhibiting low cytotoxicity, identifying it as a scaffold worthy of further exploration.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2ksXarh\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:27.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d5b3b1ced733462fa65c52b94408fa7a4e3a6b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_8B4ByiR2ebJi1nlPqQbRecTdJt4pK0.jSUuDOeLMGDVIPkF9XG4.P2mhj051Y8ffUpgfAsgP1GQ--", "site_full": "www.charlotteobserver.com", "site": "charlotteobserver.com", "site_section": "http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/college/mens-basketball/?widgetName=rssfeed&widgetContentId=8167599&getXmlFeed=true", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "College Basketball News, Videos, Pictures & Scores |", "title": "Abilene Christian edges Air Force 62-58", "title_full": "Abilene Christian edges Air Force 62-58", "published": "2017-12-07T08:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//www.charlotteobserver.com/static/images/charlotteobserver/facebook.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10572, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d5b3b1ced733462fa65c52b94408fa7a4e3a6b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_8B4ByiR2ebJi1nlPqQbRecTdJt4pK0.jSUuDOeLMGDVIPkF9XG4.P2mhj051Y8ffUpgfAsgP1GQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-07T08:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "Abilene Christian edges Air Force 62-58", "text": "Abilene Christian edges Air Force 62-58 The Associated Press December 07, 2017 01:10 AM UPDATED 3 HOURS 13 MINUTES AGO COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. \nJalone Friday and Tevin Foster scored 14 points apiece and Abilene Christian edged Air Force 62-58 on Wednesday night. \nPayten Ricks added 11 points, three rebounds and three assists. \nAbilene Christian jumped to a 12-6 start and led 27-24 at the break.
