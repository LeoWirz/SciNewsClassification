Everyone involved would be grateful. At an almost 70% disapproval rating, he is literally the worst and least popular President we have ever had.\nActually it is a 56% disapproval rating and he literally isn't the worst president we have ever had as he literally hasn't finished being president yet. Your attention to detail and obvious bias does you credit. Try this, besides annoying tweets and a weird accent, what has Trump really done that was terrible? I mean truly awful? There is nothing he has done that other presidents haven't. Wall - Obama and Bush and many others put up border fencing. Travel ban - Obama and Bush put restrictions on travelers from other countries. DACA - Was never meant to be permanent, Obama even said so, democrats refused to compromise with him (like republicans refused to compromise with Obama). For all the hatred and animosity, he really has been sort of benign. Your day to day life hasn't changed one bit I imagine, you just are an angry person. His presidency so far is about average/par for the course. He just pitched a tent in your brain and dominates your life which is actually sad.\nHe's the worst President we have ever had so far. He has publicly told over 1000 documented lies since he took office, appointed a whole range of useless wankers and saboteurs - and that 56% disapproval has got to be the best poll you could cherry pick - most put it in the high sixties.\nHe has also systematically attempted to undo everything Obama did, from environmental regulations to rules intended to regulate puppy mills.\nPUPPY MILLS,. for f**k's sake.\nThe very question \"what has he done wrong\" reads like a joke.\nI don't even want to think about the shape we will be in if we wait until he's \"though being President\" - which could be any day, based on his lifetime performance.\nIt would take all day, and many pages to detail what Trump has done wrong, just in the time he's had the office.\nIf you are cool with this, that's your business, and your right - but don't expect the normal majority to be cool with it, and they aren't.\n1000 documented lies? Lmao! Talk about pulling crap out of your arse!\nEverything you said after that has even less and less credibility!\nPresident Donald J Trump is, and will be considered by everyone eventually, the greatest President we have ever had!\nYou're absolutely correct, it's not 1000 lies. The actual documented lies and misleading statements is 1628. Granted, that's just since he was sworn into office, so 319 days. That doesn't include a lot of juicy previous lies like \"these are good steaks\" or \"get a good education at Trump university\".\nThat's about 5 lies a day, which means we have about 5700 more lies coming if he gets to serve out his term.\nHe is such a prolific serial liar that he has become a decent gauge of the truth, since it's almost always the opposite of what he says and tweets.\nThe entire Democratic party has been lying to your face for the past 50+ years. The Democratic party, under this liberal ideology, has also been screwing up everything they touch for 50+ years.\nTrump never uses a teleprompter and sometimes talks or if his arse, so what? At least what he is actually DOUBT is only great things for America.\nGo ahead and cherry pick who you think is lying and who isn't, but I have a hint for, everyone in Washington is lying almost all day long.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:08.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb1f8a7bc7177968128f12075c58444ef2042a8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED.CzgV4w9cxpAPu3bJnVKiwtNUhx3ZCC2h.1j157tVMcnUNVZw6L.lJhCqvxRsxseqNMGs.4PtowRQtQqrQASBFBYh1jh00oM0YWbZQw6ktbu.ac2s4APj2pkNLOoz8axmCg1u8dzzzjnqjbcPV7HB_o3Q_5kiaQF_T9fdWkXnfkpnPEPk1a_yb5FVhb_.s_hQnddspiHSc3w--", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9828814) You're not the only one who thinks it's odd that Donald Trump would be the one to help open a new Civil Rights museum in Mississippi.

Your attention to detail and obvious bias does you credit. Try this, besides annoying tweets and a weird accent, what has Trump really done that was terrible? I mean truly awful? There is nothing he has done that other presidents haven't. Wall - Obama and Bush and many others put up border fencing. Travel ban - Obama and Bush put restrictions on travelers from other countries. DACA - Was never meant to be permanent, Obama even said so, democrats refused to compromise with him (like republicans refused to compromise with Obama). For all the hatred and animosity, he really has been sort of benign. Your day to day life hasn't changed one bit I imagine, you just are an angry person. His presidency so far is about average/par for the course.

Far from it. It certainly wasn't like the atmosphere at any of the NBA venues in which Dixon played during his professional basketball career. \nAnd yet, it was a truly special moment for one of Baltimore's favorite sons. \nThis was a homecoming, both for the Coppin State men's basketball team and its new coach, who grew up in the city and spent his earliest years only a few minutes from the Physical Education Complex where the Eagles hosted Navy on Wednesday night.

SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"It's crazy,\" Dixon said minutes before the game. \"I haven't been nervous since we started our season. I'm actually a little nervous tonight and I haven't been nervous in a very long time.\" \nThe Eagles looked a little nervous, too. They struggled to find the basket and fell far behind in the first half on the way to a 70-53 loss that dropped their record to 0-9. \nThey clearly are a work in progress and the work has only just begun, but Dixon knew what he was getting into when he accepted the job last April. \nHe spent 21/2 years as a special assistant on Mark Turgeon's staff at Maryland and spent last season coaching the women's team at the University of the District of Columbia. He also spent the last few weeks touring the country with his new team playing revenue games and getting knocked around by superior competition. Still, you could tell that he felt like this was another kind of coaching debut. \n\"It's home,\" he said. \"I'm familiar. Part of what we want to do is help the Baltimore community, the west side of Baltimore, while bringing a great brand of basketball here. And hopefully, people look forward to watching us play.\" \nFans will undoubtedly look forward to watching Dixon coach. He was in constant motion on the sideline, barking out assignments and shouting instructions to his players as they struggled to keep up with the Midshipmen in the first half. Only time will tell whether he was born to do this, but it was easy to see he has the passion for it. \n\"Growing up as a college basketball player and a professional basketball player, coaching has always been in the back of my mind,\" Dixon said. \"As my basketball career came to an end, I really wanted to transition into coaching. It's something I thought I'd be good at. It's something I did as a player, giving instructions and trying to put my teammates in a position to be successful. And just my life experiences. I knew that this was what I wanted to do. I have an amazing opportunity to do that here at Coppin.\" \nOf course, no one said it was going to be easy, and it won't be. The Eagles entered Wednesday night's looking for their first victory after playing their first eight games on the road \u2013 several of them against major conference opponents. \n\"It's a challenge, especially when you've got to play guarantee games,\" Dixon said. \"Our basketball program helps fund the athletic department. That's just part of the deal. It's what we have to do. Our main focus is playing those games early in the year and those games are going to prepare us for our conference season.

PHOTO | FILE | NATION MEDIA GROUP In Summary The man attacked his wife and son after a disagreement. By PIUS MAUNDU More by this Author \nA man was lynched on Wednesday afternoon for attacking his 26-year-old wife and killing their three-month-old son over a disagreement. The 40-year-old man had locked himself up with his newly wedded wife and their son in their house at Ngoluni Market in Makueni County, before attacking his family. ATTACK Mbooni East OCPD Peter Njeru said the man and his wife had been quarrelling and the man chopped off the woman\u2019s right hand. \"He then transferred his anger to his three-month-old son, whom he cut on the forehead, gorging out an eye, before he set their rented house on fire with the intent to end all their lives,\" added Mr Njeru. Members of the public broke into the house through a window to save the family, but the man confronted them with his machete.

It's has been a while since i shared any layouts but i am hoping to do at least one a month until my mojo comes back. \n\nStart off by covering a section of the page with gesso and using a pallet knife, drag the gesso across the page until it spreads thinly at the edges. Let that dry and then  add a few stamps around the page before applying  a stencil mask using modeling paste. Once this has set you can spritz it with Sea Green Brusho Mist Spray and then spray over the top with water to dilute the ink. Dry with a heat tool and then sprinkle Lime Green over the top and add water to spread the color. Allow some of the ink to run down the page before leaving it to settle.\n\n\n\n\n\nDie cut shapes from card stock and adhere to the page.  Next Cut out A rectangle from patterned  paper and apply the stencil over the top with modeling paste. Add Brusho powder over the top and then adhere it to the page. Cut another rectangle and layer it over the top and then add the photo. \nTip: Use 3D Foam tap on the top layers so you can add more bits behind them later. \n\n\nAdd a length of green trim and  groups of paper flowers around the photo. \n\nFinish off by adding foam alphabet stickers. If you don't have any in your stash you can use craft foam and alphabet dies to create a similar effect. \n\nThank you for visiting \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrusho Crystals Brusho Mist sprays ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brusho", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:09.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e980db176a3a4b19cef2e04cef04117a02c3f0df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSYLqllmeQ68sCyM0X524xpfxdcznC51o718Eb6pKHNHoal5Kw6_ODgu.dZnSDrKt3STyn54cj9VvekRxK6B77xc97rEIXGwHI-", "site_full": "my350z.com", "site": "my350z.com", "site_section": "https://my350z.com/forum/brakes-and-suspension-399/", "site_categories": ["vehicles", "auto_parts"], "section_title": "Brakes &amp; Suspension - MY350Z.COM - Nissan 350Z and 370Z Forum Discussion", "title": "Sway bar setups", "title_full": "Sway bar setups - MY350Z.COM - Nissan 350Z and 370Z Forum Discussion", "published": "2017-02-21T05:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf1fa385ca74304ed17e14590f4a07454237098a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSYLqllmeQ68sCyM0X524xpfxdcznC51o718Eb6pKHNHoal5Kw6_ODgu.dZnSDrKt3STyn54cj9VvekRxK6B77xKWQl3yuL8Qy.1kwusHW7RQ--", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "zakmartin", "published": "2017-11-26T22:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "BTT.

This masterly work, dedicated to the Virgin of Rocamadour, gives pride of place to the chorus and clearly shows its line of descent from the French grands motets. On completing it, Poulenc wrote to Pierre Bernac: 'It\u2019s good, because it\u2019s completely authentic'. From the time of his pilgrimage to Rocamadour in 1936, Poulenc's religious output was filtered through his Catholic interpretation of the world and his personal trajectory. The 'Stabat Mater' is no exception to this rule, in that it associates the events and circumstances of his own life with the drama of the Gospels. It identifies the three figures of Christ, the Virgin and the Faithful Disciple with biographical figures: B\u00e9rard, Poulenc, and the latter\u2019s lover Lucien Roubert, whom he was to refer to as \u2018the secret\u2019 of the 'Stabat Mater' and 'Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites'. In December 1959 Leonard Bernstein commissioned a new work from Poulenc for the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. He chose to write the 'Sept R\u00e9pons des T\u00e9n\u00e8bres' (Seven Tenebrae Responses) for treble soloist, a chorus of boys\u2019 and men\u2019s voices and symphony orchestra. The posthumous first performance took place on 11 April 1963 at Philharmonic Hall (now Avery Fisher Hall) under the direction of Thomas Schippers. Poulenc had insisted on these all-male vocal forces, but, 50 years after his death, it is important to allow for more widespread performance of this fascinating score which has too long languished in the shadows.

Laine, USA Today bestselling author, left a lucrative career as a CPA to pursue her love for writing. Outside of her roles as a wife and mother of three, she\u2019s always been a dreamer and as such became an avid reader at a young age. Many years later, she got a crazy idea to write a novel and set out to try to publish it. With over a dozen titles published under various pen names, the rest is history. Her journey has been a blessing, and a dream realized. She looks forward to many more memories to come. \n\nConnect with the Author: Website: www.terrielaine.com Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/TerriELaineBooks Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/TerriELaineAuthor Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/TerriLaineBooks Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/TerriELaineAuthor Goodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14299771.Terri_E_Laine Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Terri-E.-Laine/ \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "terri e. laine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin volk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "usa today", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:10.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "691578710abfc996c9e7793a9a46253621bc842c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9l.zRwH4muRzFiXj35oxFm0Mo4eDpUSlNyCWD9ZTMTQcPR8UlHeXXNlvOXDlE_f4zuHoK5HisyZG8pCBp0OGOohDGv.rYKzM9ip4J5aIzrIP7vb8z3K_SN2eIM_DYrwe5J2jsFaBAcxgWehxU2_Eti8q3fDIrpHlZTTu.YzirNsw--", "site_full": "www.europa-news.biz", "site": "europa-news.biz", "site_section": "http://www.europa-news.biz", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Europa-News", "title": "Kenya opposition leader hits out at US \u2018audacity\u2019 over mock inauguration event", "title_full": "Kenya opposition leader hits out at US \u2018audacity\u2019 over mock inauguration event", "published": "2017-12-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "691578710abfc996c9e7793a9a46253621bc842c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9l.zRwH4muRzFiXj35oxFm0Mo4eDpUSlNyCWD9ZTMTQcPR8UlHeXXNlvOXDlE_f4zuHoK5HisyZG8pCBp0OGOohDGv.rYKzM9ip4J5aIzrIP7vb8z3K_SN2eIM_DYrwe5J2jsFaBAcxgWehxU2_Eti8q3fDIrpHlZTTu.YzirNsw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsineuropa", "published": "2017-12-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "Kenya opposition leader hits out at US \u2018audacity\u2019 over mock inauguration event", "text": "\n\nKenya opposition leader hits out at US \u2018audacity\u2019 over mock inauguration event Belfast Telegraph \nUS urges Kenya\u2019s opposition to pursue electoral reforms within law Xinhua You should wait for real presidency, Raila Daily Nation Full coverage \n\n\n\nSource link : https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/kenya-opposition-leader-hits-out-at-us-audacity-over-mock-inauguration-event-36387034.html \n\nAuthor :\n\nPublish date : 7 December 2017 | 9:32 am\n\nCopyright for syndicated content belongs to the linked Source .

It is the most important product of his creative brain.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n2. \u201cWith ideas it is like with dizzy heights you climb: At first they cause you discomfort and you are anxious to get down, distrustful of your own powers; but soon the remoteness of the turmoil of life and the inspiring influence of the altitude calm your blood; your step gets firm and sure and you begin to look \u2013 for dizzier heights.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n3. \u201cThere is something within me that might be illusion as it is often case with young delighted people, but if I would be fortunate to achieve some of my ideals, it would be on the behalf of the whole of humanity.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n4. \u201cBut instinct is something which transcends knowledge. We have, undoubtedly, certain finer fibers that enable us to perceive truths when logical deduction, or any other willful effort of the brain, is futile.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n5. \u201cGreat moments are born great opportunity.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n6. \u201cWhat we now want is closer contact and better understanding between individuals and communities all over the earth, and the elimination of egoism and pride which is always prone to plunge the world into primeval barbarism and strife\u2026 Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment\u2026\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n7. \u201cWe crave for new sensations but soon become indifferent to them. The wonders of yesterday are today common occurrences.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n8. \u201cBe alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n9. \u201cAll knowledge or form conception is evoked through the medium of the eye, either in response to disturbances directly received on the retina or to their fainter secondary effects and reverberations. Other sense organs can only call forth feelings which have no reality of existence and of which no conception can be formed.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n10. \u201cOur first endeavors are purely instinctive prompting of an imagination vivid and undisciplined. As we grow older reason asserts itself and we become more and more systematic and designing. But those early impulses, though not immediately productive, are of the greatest moment and may shape our very destinies\u2026 But not until I had attained manhood did I realize that I was an inventor.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n11. \u201cThe universal utilization of water power and its long-distance transmission will supply every household with cheap power and will dispense with the necessity of burning fuel. The struggle for existence being lessened, there should be development along ideal rather than material lines.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n12. \u201cPeace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment and merging of races, and we are still far from this blissful realization.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n13. \u201cEvery living being is an engine geared to the wheel-work of the universe. Though seemingly affected only by its immediate surrounding, the sphere of external influence extends to infinite distance.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n14. \u201cThe spread of civilization may be likened to a fire; first, a feeble spark, next a flickering flame, then a mighty blaze, ever increasing in speed and power.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n15. \u201cMy method is different. I do not rush into actual work. When I get an idea I start at once building it up in my imagination. I change the construction, make improvements, and operate the device entirely in my mind.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n16. \u201cIts not the love you make. It\u2019s the love you give.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n17. \u201cEveryone should consider his body as a priceless gift from one whom he loves above all, a marvelous work of art, of indescribable beauty, and mystery beyond human conception, and so delicate that a word, a breath, a look, nay, a thought may injure it.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n18. \u201cMost persons are so absorbed in the contemplation of the outside world that they are wholly oblivious to what is passing on within themselves.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n19. \u201cAll that was great in the past was ridiculed, condemned, combated, suppressed \u2014 only to emerge all the more powerfully, all the more triumphantly from the struggle.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla 20th Nikola Tesla Quote \u2013 \u201cBy an irony of fate, my first employment was as a draughtsman. I hated drawing; it was for me the very worst of annoyances. Fortunately, it was not long before I secured the position I sought, that of chief electrician to the telephone company.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n21. \u201cIf your hate could be turned into electricity, it would light up the whole world.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n22. \u201cElectrical science has revealed to us the true nature of light, has provided us with innumerable appliances and instruments of precision, and has thereby vastly added to the exactness of our knowledge.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n23. \u201cInventors don\u2019t have time for married life.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n24. \u201cI do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n25. \u201cThe experimenter may vary them in many ways, and, if it were nothing else, they afford a pleasing sight.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n26. \u201cThe scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is like that of the planter \u2014 for the future. His duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come, and point the way. He lives and labors and hopes.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n27. \u201cArchimedes was my ideal. I admired the works of artists, but to my mind, they were only shadows and semblances. The inventor, I thought, gives to the world creations which are palpable, which live and work.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n28. \u201cYou may live to see man-made horrors beyond your comprehension.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n29. \u201cIn a time not distant, it will be possible to flash any image formed in thought on a screen and render it visible at any place desired. The perfection of this means of reading thought will create a revolution for the better in all our social relations.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n30. \u201cElectrical science has disclosed to us the more intimate relation existing between widely different forces and phenomena and has thus led us to a more complete comprehension of Nature and its many manifestations to our senses.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n31. \u201cOf all things, I liked books best.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n32. \u201cWhen natural inclination develops into a passionate desire, one advances towards his goal in seven-league boots.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n33. \u201cIf Thomas Edison had a needle to find in a haystack, he would not stop to reason where it was most likely to be, but would proceed at once with the feverish diligence of a bee, to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search\u2026 Just a little theory and calculation would have saved him ninety percent of his labor.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n34. \u201cMost certainly, some planets are not inhabited, but others are, and among these there must exist life under all conditions and phases of development.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n35. \u201cIf you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n36. \u201cSo astounding are the facts in this connection, that it would seem as though the Creator, Himself had electrically designed this planet\u2026\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n37. \u201cI do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success\u2026 such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n38. \u201cThe history of science shows that theories are perishable. With every new truth that is revealed we get a better understanding of Nature and our conceptions and views are modified.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n39. \u201cThe human being is a self-propelled automaton entirely under the control of external influences. Willful and predetermined though they appear, his actions are governed not from within, but from without. He is like a float tossed about by the waves of a turbulent sea.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla 40th Nikola Tesla Quote \u2013 \u201cThe day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n41. \u201cLet the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs; the future, for which I have really worked, is mine.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n42. \u201cInvention is the most important product of man\u2019s creative brain. The ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of human nature to human needs.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n43. \u201cOur virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n44. \u201cThe gift of mental power comes from God, Divine Being, and if we concentrate our minds on that truth, we become in tune with this great power. My Mother had taught me to seek all truth in the Bible.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n45. \u201cThe scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n46. \u201cThere is no memory or retentive faculty based on lasting impression. What we designate as memory is but increased responsiveness to repeated stimuli.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n47. \u201cI don\u2019t care that they stole my idea . . I care that they don\u2019t have any of their own.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n48. \u201cMy brain is only a receiver, in the Universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration. I have not penetrated into the secrets of this core, but I know that it exists.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla \n49. \u201cLife is and will ever remain an equation incapable of solution, but it contains certain known factors.\u201d \u2013 Nikola Tesla What\u2019s your favorite Nikola Tesla Quote?

Four major fires, including one that began late last night. I woke up to see video of it on Facebook : a hillside off of the 405 Freeway, close to The Getty Center, was engulfed in flame. It was a weird and scary scene, orange fire in the darkness, with cars driving by. Fortunately, firefighters had that one mostly under control by late this afternoon. Several people lost their homes, though, in Bel Air, which always seems to get hit during fire season.\n\nThe worst fires are up in Santa Paula, in Ventura County, about 40 miles away, and up above Sylmar at the north end of the Valley. The Santa Paula fire has already burned 80,000 acres.\n\nThese winds are awful and I hope they end soon. I have said before that I absolutely hate wind, more than any other weather condition, and this is a main reason why. And even when there is no fire, wind is just a bad vibe.\n\nSo, we are just hunkering down and waiting for it to be over. We are not getting blasted in the Valley the way folks are in the hills and canyons, and we are thankfully not experiencing fire, but we are close enough to feel it, and see it on the news, and we feel the wind and all the static electricity in the air and we smell the smoke. So, just staying inside mostly. Just a very short walk the last two nights, and certainly no hikes.\n\nTonight I watched yet another Esther Williams movie, \"Dangerous When Wet\" (1953), acquired again from the Libe, which seems to have purchased all of her films just recently. You know the drill by now, the setup for her movies. There was a basic formula, because it was a franchise (waaaay before modern franchises like \"Star Wars\" or \"Harry Potter\" or all the CGI Comic Book movies now in theaters), and the formula always featured two things : Swimming and Romance. And the stories were always light comedy.\n\nThis one had a slightly more serious theme, however. Esther is the eldest child in a health-conscious farm family, where the Dad (William Demarest) monitors the family's nutrition and has his wife and three daughters swimming laps in their nearby pond every day.\n\nOf course, a promoter shows up in town (part of the formula). He is pushing a \"health tonic\" full of vitamins. He discovers the family of health-nut swimmers and comes up with a great idea - to have the whole family, Dad, Mom and all three daughters, swim the English Channel in a contest sponsored in England each year. So from there, the movie takes off. The romantic subtheme involves the Handsome and Suave Fernando Lamas, who was just as Handsome and Suave as Ricardo Montalban, our other recent romantic interest in these movies. And in fact, Fernando Lamas out-Handsomed and out-Suaved Ricardo Montalban, because he actually married Esther Williams many years later, in 1969. But in the movie, he gets second billing to the quest to swim the Channel, which is featured quite dramatically in the last 15 minutes of the movie. \"Dangerous When Wet\" doesn't have the comedic element of the films in which Red Buttons co-stars, nor does it have the exotic pizzaz of Xavier Cugat, who is not in this film, but it does have one element that it has been famous for, a Dream Sequence in which Esther falls asleep and dreams she is swimming the English Channel with the help of Tom and Jerry, the famous cartoon characters. This animated sequence is quite advanced for the time, and it looks fantastic. For the cartoon sequence alone the film gets Two Thumbs Up.\n\nElizabeth, if you are reading, I saw the post from Yasmeen Olya in which she describes her compositional methods. I think the most important thing she said, or intimated, was that she just starts to play, and basically waits for a musical idea to present itself. Like \"here it comes\".\n\nShe also said that she has a notational or chordal structure, or several of them, that she works with to bring ideas to the forefront.\n\nBut I think that the main thing she is demonstrating is that, just by starting to play (i.e. practice, but fully engaged, with feeling) and playing within certain frameworks, you can pull musical inspirations out of the sky, so to speak.

But some are about to find out. \nSkye, a young barista and artist, falls victim to a goblin curse in the forest one winter night, rendering her depressed and silenced, unable to speak of what happened. Her older sister, Livy, is at wit\u2019s end trying to understand what\u2019s wrong with her. Local mechanic Kit would know, but he doesn\u2019t talk of such things: he\u2019s the human liaison for the goblin tribe, a job he keeps secret and never wanted, thrust on him by an ancient family contract. \nUnaware of what\u2019s happened to Skye, Kit starts dating Livy, trying to keep it casual to protect her from the attention of the goblins. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Kit, Skye draws his cousin Grady into the spell through an enchanted kiss in the woods, dooming Grady and Skye both to become goblins and disappear from humankind forever. \nIt\u2019s a midwinter night\u2019s enchantment as Livy, the only one untainted by a spell, sets out to save them on a dangerous magical path of her own. \n \n\nThe Goblins of Bellwater is based on Christina Rossetti\u2019s poem, Goblin Market but taken into a modern setting. I\u2019ve not read the poem but I think The Goblins of Bellwater manages to stand on its own \u2014 you don\u2019t need to know the poem to read the book. \n\nI was drawn in by the premise and the twisty plot. The idea the goblins have a liaison with impunity to steal for them is a really cool idea, made all the more interesting by how much Kit doesn\u2019t want to be involved. I really liked the goblins \u2014 named for the first things they\u2019ve stolen like Redring and Slide (for \u2018Slide to Unlock\u2019 on an iPhone) \u2014 they were so quirky and inhuman. The scenes in the goblins woods are wonderfully atmospheric and well-written \u2014 I could absolutely imagine myself being lured into those dark woods by a trail of shining mushrooms. \n\nUnfortunately, while I definitely enjoyed the setup and earlier sections of the book, I found myself losing interest as we went along. I just didn\u2019t really connect to any of the four main characters \u2014 although I did appreciate the effort the author went to give them each their own interests, such as art or cooking. Maybe because I wasn\u2019t sold on the characters, the romance(s) didn\u2019t particularly work for me either \u2014 although, again, I appreciate we had older-woman-younger-man relationships that weren\u2019t treated as something funny or unusual (they\u2019re not a big difference though if that concerns you, just a couple of years). \nUltimately, this book just wasn\u2019t for me.

Cord Byrd filed a bill Wednesday that allows those who\u2019ve served prison and probation sentences for felonies to seek to have their voting and gun rights restored by petitioning judges. Currently, those convicted of felonies have those civil rights revoked unless the governor offers clemency. This bill would allow people to file petitions in court that argue they deserve to have their rights restored; and it allows state attorney\u2019s offices to oppose the petitions. Judges must determine if the people asking for their rights back have led law-abiding lives since release and if they\u2019re likely to continue to obey the law, if they\u2019re not likely to be a danger to others and if giving back the rights is not contrary to the public\u2019s interest. Judges could not restore individual rights, like voting rights, but would be required to restore all rights, including the right to own and carry firearms. \nByrd, R-Neptune Beach, runs a law firm that is focused on gun rights, and he said he handles petitions for clemency and knows how backlogged that system currently is. The Florida Constitution Revision Commission, which is considering constitutional amendments that would automatically restore voting rights, has said that the current clemency process has a backlog of more than 20,000 cases. \nByrd said that his bill is about trusting judges to decide if people are ready to have their rights back. \u201cWhen their sentence is over and they\u2019ve paid their debt to society, I think they should be afforded the right to have someone consider whether they should have their rights restored. \u2026 This is not to give violent felons the opportunity to get a gun. That\u2019s not going to happen. I can\u2019t imagine a judge granting them their rights.

In 1976, he released \u201eLegalize It\u201c, still one of the most significant albums in the history of reggae. The title track expresses one of Tosh's many political causes, justifying the legalization of marijuana as a remedy for various medical ailments. 'Burial' is one of several tracks that features the talents of the Wailers' stand-out lead guitarist, Al Anderson. Tosh adds his own seasoning to the reggae pot as he incorporates keyboards in 'Whatcha Gonna Do' and synthesizers and sound effects on 'Igziabeher.' 'Ketchy Shuby,' a sing-along about fooling around, features the background vocal talents of Rita Marley, Bunny Wailer, and Judy Mowatt. Tosh's life ended too early, and \u201eLegalize It\u201c is the strongest testament to his legacy. Take a listen, and share the spirit of his genius.

Nope. He\u2019s doing exactly as he promised, regardless of the repercussions, because that\u2019s what he promised the American people, and that\u2019s why they voted for him. \nPerhaps the most poignant example of this occurred on Wednesday, when Trump stood before the world and declared America\u2019s official recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nTrump rightly stated that all he was doing was accepting the obvious, accepting reality. \nStill, it was a courageous move given the hostile opposition to Israel\u2019s sovereignty in Jerusalem. \nBut Trump knows that those screaming most loudly about the decision will ultimately have to back down if they want to keep doing business with America. \nAnd, once again, we see the tremendous benefit of having a business leader, rather than a politician, in the White House.
