I like their sim simulations a lot. they also develop to uad (brainworx).there are drawbacks though: the cpu is intensive, there are cpu spikes, and u need to tweak them reasonably.for instance, u will need to gain stage, eq, add reverb / delay etc, and add some tricks to \"thicker\" them. seems obvious, but for instance S-gear / Guitar rig has \"all in patches / presets\" that might give u better instant results and the \"feel\" of playing in a room. in one phrase, brainwork amp sim ARE NOT a \"one plugin guitar solution\", but they sound great to me.If u are using to sound design, I'd probably chose another amp simulator; but, at the sales prices of this month, they are a complete no-brainer. in sound design, due to the amount of choices, the most \"recommended\" in PA's products would be rockrack, as they have several head and \"amps profiles\", which will give u tons of options. But my favorite pa amp sim would be bass dude.I will also add that if u are planning to use guitar amp sim plugins for sound design, I think you'd be happier with other alternatives such as bluecat's destructor, s-gear, guitar rig, etc etc. I have two old boss boxes \"vf-1 and SE-50\" to just randomly go through presets when I need some ideas.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:41.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "058cbf5f2c5684662f04f5cc28ab45003b9f46a4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6yfh9VRxupYuTzxdovbIeSC9hy_XTfGXqjswU7alhr5ZmPYJaF0m2NaBm82RcXyUtRC3Lb0AbZPRun6weX3CfcesQOz10kQJdA--", "site_full": "community.betfair.com", "site": "betfair.com", "site_section": "http://community.betfair.com/horse_racing", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Horse Racing Forum &gt;

our Stuyvesant High School community to see how we are doing since the terror attack outside our school. We are doing very well, thank you all for asking! But, we are in the process of undergoing a re-education of what the words \"not guilty\" mean.\nAfter Sayfullo Saipov allegedly rammed his terror truck into pedestrians, cyclists and a school bus \u2014 with a crowd of Stuy students on the bridge over West Street bearing witness \u2014 we never thought we'd hear the words \"not guilty\" come out of his mouth. Last week, when news of his plea in court went through our halls, many of us had one reaction.\nHow the hell could he claim to be innocent?\nWe whipped out our phones thinking it must be a mistake and looked it up - maybe he meant not guilty by reason of insanity.\nBut no, Saipov actually is proclaiming innocence, despite expressly stating that he meant to take the lives of eight people who died that day. We saw their blood being hosed off of Chambers Street, as we walked out of school late, after four hours of lockdown.\nAs one girl in our spontaneous hallway conference pointed out, in the world of terror tactics, \"not guilty\" is apparently not a synonym for \"I didn't do it, judge!\"\nRather, it seems to mean something closer to: \"let's make everyone relive that awful day as my deranged cause gets a free publicity platform around the world for years to come.\"\nOr, as one of our social studies teachers explained, the Boston Marathon terrorist's lawyer had him plead \"not guilty\" so she could see what witnesses the prosecution had, and how they were going to make their arguments. This way she could better defend that particular terror dweeb for two years, and get more prepared for the sentencing phase, in his unsuccessful attempt to avoid the death penalty.\nSo now \"not guilty\" also means \"let the taxpayers pick up 26 months of trial fees, so an alleged terrorist can try to figure out ways to avoid just punishment.\"\nSoon enough, every attention-craving loser who wants to feel important will commit a despicable act of terror in cold blood and broad daylight. Then he can plead \"not guilty\" and strut in the limelight of court proceedings for years to come.\nWe need to protect the actual innocents from the phrase \"not guilty.\" Like the 14-year-old girl who had to have surgery after Saipov rammed into her school bus. And, our biology teacher who went to the hospital, sideswiped as he watched Saipov run down people directly in front and in back of him on the bike path.\nOne Stuy student hanging in the hallway with us had a great idea: Move the trial to Alaska and of course allow the media in to cover it, but embargo the reporting until the verdict and sentencing are announced.\nThen, let the articles flow freely for 24 hours, at least until the sentence-hopefully the death penalty-comes down. In other words: Lots of ink about the punishment, less that might glorify the crime.\nShapiro is a junior at Stuyvesant High School.\nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Stuvesant%20kids%20vs.%20Sayfullo%20Saipov%2C%20the%20%27not%20guilty%27%20terror%20loser&url=http://nydn.us/2AgFAOc"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sayfullo saipov", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stuy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saipov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shapiro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stuyvesant high school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "boston marathon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west street", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:42.045+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db6ef0d731d576744c7f3aa6ca09d56bc945a4cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5fRQTzTISYn53r6iRDWS936ADk7w3ppNttLRbr.Fadtdcnc4mlh78p896v4V5Mf3zFZQ6K6FoyDA9zUWZRhaFhBcv3av_t5kBA7_TRcJ2mNQFGQSKJ.es4", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/lsu-sports/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Tiger Rant - LSU Football - Sports Forum | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "The flawed argument to stay in school and get a degree 6", "title_full": "The flawed argument to stay in school and get a degree | Page 6 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T06:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db6ef0d731d576744c7f3aa6ca09d56bc945a4cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5fRQTzTISYn53r6iRDWS936ADk7w3ppNttLRbr.Fadtdcnc4mlh78p896v4V5Mf3zFZQ6K6FoyDA9zUWZRhaFhBcv3av_t5kBA7_TRcJ2mNQFGQSKJ.es4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bulldog95", "published": "2017-12-07T06:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "The flawed argument to stay in school and get a degree 6", "text": "Quote: :\nI know it's just me, but I value getting my degree that much.

rose on Thursday after the U.S. Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note sat higher at around 2.367 percent at 3:33 p.m. ET, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was up at 2.764 percent. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\nSymbol Yield Change %Change US 3-MO --- US 1-YR --- US 2-YR --- US 5-YR --- US 10-YR --- US 30-YR --- Yields moved higher following reports that President Donald Trump is making headway in his infrastructure plans. The president will likely push his legislative agenda forward in January by unveiling a plan to fix and develop infrastructure in the United States.\nTrump campaigned heavily on the need to improve the country's infrastructure, an area in which he may find more support from Democrats. However, with a big tax cut in the pipeline, commentators have questioned whether a Republican Congress will be able to pass a spending plan.\nUnemployment benefit claims dipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 236,000 for the week ended Dec. 2, according to the Labor Department. This marks the third consecutive week of declines and suggests a rapid tightening of the labor market.\nWith the Bureau of Labor Statistics set to release its monthly report on the employment situation Friday, Wall Street will watching to see any changes in the already-low unemployment rate, which sits at 4.1 percent. Investors will also be watching for an increase in the hourly wage, a metric known for its relationship to inflation.\nWhile new economic releases are expected to shake up sentiment Thursday, politics is also expected to keep investors on edge.\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration announced Wednesday that the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and said that the American embassy would be moved there, even though officials recently said the relocation could take \"years\".\nThe announcement was met with condemnation worldwide, from Arabs and Muslims in the Middle East, to the United Nations and European Union; with the latter two institutions both voicing fears about what ramifications the decision would have on the peace-making process between Israel and Palestine.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nMeantime, the overhaul in the U.S. tax system continues to sway market sentiment . The U.S. Senate voted to go to a conference committee with the House on Wednesday, in order to negotiate a plan when it comes to reforming the current system. The Senate voted 51-47 in favor, with Republicans hoping to secure an agreement on a tax proposal by Christmas.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

producing 13 foals that are all winners, so we asked our audience for suggestions of other mares with remarkable records.\nHere is some of the feedback:\nCharivara will take some beating 16 foals 16 winners 166 races ....this includes 6 stakes winners and also the grand-dam of at least 2 Group I winners in Kembla and Cherete one of the best two years olds of her year. Pretty sure Balcrest Stud still have descendants of the family also.\nIt must be a South Australian thing with David Peacock's mare (She's Discreet)and John Haigs mare.\nThis photo taken from the SA 1971 Yearling catalogue \u2013 Glenrae Stud\nContract Racing's Crystal Snip, who died in 2013, is not far off She's Discreet with her perfect 13 from 13. Crystal Snip had 12 foals and all are winners headed by Golden Slipper winner Crystal Lily and stakes-winners Crystal Wit, Crystal Web and Amaethon. She is also the grandam of Group II winner Carrara and spring stakes-winner Crystal Dreamer. \u2013 Adrian Hancock\nI nominate Coureuse, 13 named foals and about to have her last making 15. I think her progeny speak for themselves and this has continued with her daughters progeny.\nCoureuse has had 12 foals to race, 8 winners including stakes-winner Sichuan Success and stakes-placed Pirouettes and Tom Coureuse.\nIn 2010 she passed in at Inglis for $57.5k in foal to Bernardini at the age of 16. Then 5 years later found herself at Echuca horse sales.\nNow there is a story of a great broodmare with a happy ending as she will live her days out with lots of foals to nanny which she loves.- Cathryn Kelly\nProfessionelle (15 foals, 12 raced, 11winners), Parfore (11 foals, 9 raced all winners), Bravery (10 foals, 9 raced all winners) \u2013 Scott Palmer\nCurrabaha was a beauty. She had 15 named foals, 14 to race all winners her best Group II winner Ponton Flyer. \u2013 Chris\nTaiona, my old favourite, 12 foals , all raced, 9 winners including Gurners Lane, Sovereign Red and Trichelle! \u2013 Caroline Searcy\nAminona (NZ) by Oakville (GB) had 17 foals. But only 12 raced. All were winners. The first 13 were in consecutive seasons, then she was given a year off! Then she had another 4.\nHer first 2 foals were top class SW in Singapore Andermatt and St Gallen after early form in NZ (the mare was always owned by the Choo family who were from Singapore and named their horses mainly after Swiss ski resorts), her 5th foal Celerina was Group-placed (I bought her), her 13th foal was Ascona a G3 winner in Australia (and dam of our Daybreak Farm showjumping star Daybreak Del Pietro (aka Piazza San Pietro) ridden by Jasmine Haynes!), her 15th foal Fionnay is the dam of Oaks winner Bulla Borghese and grandam of Bound For Earth and great-grandam of Magic Night/Gimcrack winner Calliope and Caulfield Guineas runner-up Lizard Island.\nRoyal Symphony's dam Naturalist had 11 foals in a row, then a slip then another 6 on the trot. Royal Symphony was her 17th and last foal. Only 12 raced and only 8 were winners, one other being SP. So she's just a hack!\nFinneto also had 17 foals. 12 raced, 11 were winners. 4 were SW, Timeless Grace, King Brian, Malcolm (her 15th foal, won $700k), and something called Fields Of Omagh. She is the grandam of Infinite Grace and the great grandam of Fontein Ruby.\nDame Ivor (USA) was remarkable. She began her breeding career in the USa then came to Australia as a 16yo! She had 15 consecutive foals, then had a year off then produced two more. She produced 3 SW of which SW Club Liquid was foaled in Australia - her 17th and last foal.\nThere are more of these than you might think. \u2013 Steve Brem\nDane Belltar was nominated by a reader and she's an interesting one as she's still a work in progress.

Fortunately, Boston has a huge abundance of creative entrepreneurs \u2014 and their small businesses and start-ups are full of innovation and offer specialty curation and differentiation in almost every category.\nThis year I was just lucky enough to discover even more of them through a contest I helped out with. Mastercard and Bank of America have a unique interest is helping small businesses in the Boston area, so they held their #Growyourbizcontest for local owners to pitch how they planned to grow their business for the chance to win $25,000 and one-on-one expert business advice.\nThe contest\u2019s big winner was More to Love Yoga , owned by Rachel Estapa. She created her company when she realized that much of the clientele at boutique yoga classes are not particularly accepting of bigger yoga practitioners.\nAt a studio space in the Somerville Arts Armory, she has set up a supportive and empowering way to practice yoga. More to Love is having a terrific holiday special (classes are usually $39 and are now $9.99) that is a perfect gift for friends and family \u2014 and they have holiday gift cards at moretolovewithrachel.com.\nOther finalists from #Growyourbizcontest were also full of innovative promise and fab gift ideas. Consider the start-up Birch Baby (birchbaby.com). Started by a woman as a cloth diaper store and now run by two dads, the company sells a ton of hand-picked gifts for the wee ones in your life \u2014 from self-balancing scooters and Ecobricks building blocks to gifts for new moms such as supercool strollers and adorable diaper bags.\nNext up is the genius gift of thicker, shiny and dreamy goddess locks, for anyone you know who is as obsessed with clip-in extensions as I am. Intriguing Hair (intriguinghair.com), out of Hyde Park, is doing unstoppable business as a hair extensions expert, selling virgin extensions that are shiny, silky and thick \u2014 an exceptional quality for the price. Order online or give a gift certificate to anyone whose Christmas wish is to have thicker, longer hair.\nWant a holiday celebration blow-out \u2014 literally? Look no further than Paddy Wagon Pub (thepaddywagonpub.com). A creative group of local guys came up with the clever idea to rent out instantaneous, blow-up pubs in which you can put on a party virtually anywhere. They will also provide traditional Irish food, drink and entertainment, if you like.\nBut even beyond #Growyourbizcontest, Boston is filled with burgeoning businesses churning out plenty of great unique gifts. A few of my favorites:\nThe phenomena success of Boston-based Rue La La (ruelala.com) is no surprise to fashionistas all over. Every day, the site curates designer boutiques and offers them at sweet prices for its members over the course of the day. Looking for an incredible Celine handbag or Burberry shades at a huge discount for your loved ones? This is your go-to source.\nAnd then there are other innovative products \u2014 lots of them equally wearable. You must check out Alps & Meters (alpsandmeters.com), the Boston ski gear and sportswear company founded by a former global director of strategy and innovation at Puma. Inspired by the retro styles of the past several decades of skiers, the brand\u2019s current designs fuse performance and style rooted in alpine-sport-cool.\nAnd what does anyone need to have while wearing such awesome gifts? Another gift: A Moon Selfie Light (moonselfie.me) \u2014 so they can properly document that awesomeness, even when skiing at night or while out at clubs, when darkness ruins way too many photos. Invented by two guys out of Harvard, the light is basically an upgrade to pics for whatever lucky soul you gift it to.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gretta monahan", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "birch baby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel estapa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bank of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddy wagon pub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alps & meters alpine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "somerville arts armory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alps & meters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alps & meters credit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mastercard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puma", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hyde park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:44.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a5164c997e6b33f267a965f9f37b5d2c26d3ccb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgx1Ghi4N2YEGHshZVeQy_su122fboe7Ul5mzQYfkHWo.cW8j6BQG3b6f3UeFSr0PgdAp5ITKKroAuYjgtoQ8buu0z8Y7V54F7k-", "site_full": "filipinochannel-tf.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://filipinochannel-tf.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Filipino Channel", "title": "Wildflower - 07 December 2017", "title_full": "Wildflower - 07 December 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6a5164c997e6b33f267a965f9f37b5d2c26d3ccb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgx1Ghi4N2YEGHshZVeQy_su122fboe7Ul5mzQYfkHWo.cW8j6BQG3b6f3UeFSr0PgdAp5ITKKroAuYjgtoQ8buu0z8Y7V54F7k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tony (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Wildflower - 07 December 2017", "text": "VIDOZA ESTREAM STREAMNAGO ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:44.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c42b5cc16dda3a688f775260d6c6c387d29dd26f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYtgEmkZrq8ydhlAwmuVkpUxUh_s1vVEFmP8W8pBKxKD8L1wsX4UpbB0tAxddfIASe2MKrKp8F6zEqzZyA.GixYIVlUNuZ61q7O.uHa2miYCjv3uf0pTS2mcyp9e3rG9Kjl0wjHqWFtz6Rt.F.jIrdNe", "site_full": "journalstar.com", "site": "journalstar.com", "site_section": "http://journalstar.com/search/?f=rss&amp;t=article&amp;c=template&amp;l=50&amp;s=start_time&amp;sd=desc", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "journalstar.com - RSS Results", "title": "Index", "title_full": "Index", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 25831, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c42b5cc16dda3a688f775260d6c6c387d29dd26f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYtgEmkZrq8ydhlAwmuVkpUxUh_s1vVEFmP8W8pBKxKD8L1wsX4UpbB0tAxddfIASe2MKrKp8F6zEqzZyA.GixYIVlUNuZ61q7O.uHa2miYCjv3uf0pTS2mcyp9e3rG9Kjl0wjHqWFtz6Rt.F.jIrdNe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "the Lincoln Journal Star", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Index", "text": "We hope you have enjoyed your complimentary access for the month.

Inclusion on the list could affect billions of dollars of capital flows through both countries, which are Middle Eastern banking centers.\nCountries on the blacklist may no longer be used by EU institutions for international financial operations, and transactions involving them could be subject to closer scrutiny.\nOn Thursday, both the UAE and Bahrain said they did not deserve to be on the list because they had already taken many steps to exchange financial information with other countries. But they pledged to do more to satisfy the EU.\n\u201cWe have committed to a reform process which will be finalised by October 2018, and we are absolutely confident this will ensure the UAE is swiftly removed from the list,\u201d the UAE said.\nIt said its only outstanding issue with the EU was implementing the BEPS Minimum Standard. BEPS is a set of policies to tackle tax avoidance strategies that allow multinational companies to shift profits artificially to low or no-tax locations.\nThe UAE has committed to finalizing implementation of BEPS by October 2018 and ratifying it by March 2019, a schedule which would give the country\u2019s federal structure enough time to ratify the measure across all seven emirates, the government said.\n\u201cWe stand by this realistic timeline,\u201d it said, adding that it was confident of being recognized as an internationally compliant tax jurisdiction at the EU\u2019s next review.\nBahrain said its national assembly had begun the process of approving agreements that would allow it to collect information from its financial institutions and automatically exchange it every year with other countries.\nThe government also said it would commit to becoming a member of the Inclusive Framework on BEPS, a group of over 100 countries and jurisdictions that cooperate to implement BEPS policies.\n\u201cBahrain will initiate dialogue with the EU on this matter, to ensure understanding and recognition of the Kingdom\u2019s efforts to ensure financial transparency, international cooperation and a robust regulatory environment,\u201d it said.\nReporting by Andrew Torchia, editing by Larry King\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew torchia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry king", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "oecd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "min read dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united arab emirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bahrain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:45.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8789a07ee28d416bdcac5f522bb3266c8a102b7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6yfh9VRxupYuTzxdovbIeSC9hy_XTfGXqjswU7alhr5ZmPYJaF0m2NaBm82RcXyUtUu5r1rwWhDPt2Fo1eLQYYDjQC65pOcHNg--", "site_full": "community.betfair.com", "site": "betfair.com", "site_section": "http://community.betfair.com/horse_racing", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Horse Racing Forum &gt; Betfair Community", "title": "GVC in for Ladbrokes/Coral", "title_full": "GVC in for Ladbrokes/Coral > Betfair Community > Horse Racing", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.069, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2131, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8789a07ee28d416bdcac5f522bb3266c8a102b7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6yfh9VRxupYuTzxdovbIeSC9hy_XTfGXqjswU7alhr5ZmPYJaF0m2NaBm82RcXyUtUu5r1rwWhDPt2Fo1eLQYYDjQC65pOcHNg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ph.", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "GVC in for Ladbrokes/Coral", "text": "made for each other, no arm of their businesses interested in taking a bet and buy out offer all subject to reduction in FOBT's stakes.

With a more than favorable response, Backdoors returns with twice the number of artists, expanding to set up an edition in Mumbai as well. \nThe second edition of Backdoors, set to take place on February 14th in Mumbai and February 17th in Bengaluru, will bring to stage some of the most hyped and critically-lauded names in international music \u2013 American rapper, singer, drummer and producer Anderson .Paak and The Free Nationals, London rockers Wolf Alice, hip-hop artist Watsky, English drummer Danny Goffey (from erstwhile rockers Supergrass) and one more name that\u2019s yet to be finalized. London rock band Wolf Alice will make their India debut at Backdoors in 2018. Photo: Laura Allard Fleischl \nIndian artists tapped to perform at Backdoors include New Delhi singer-songwriter Prateek Kuhad , Mumbai firepower rapper DIVINE and Bengaluru folk/indie band When Chai Met Toast . The Humming Tree founder Nikhil Barua also mentioned that they are partnering with Amnesty International for the series, to increase awareness of gender-based discrimination.

The challenge here is always to push and be the very best we can be despite the resources we have.\n\u201cAt this level we are nowhere near it. But at this level we have to find a way and try and represent Celtic and represent the nation the best we can.\n\u201cThe players we have will benefit from being involved in the Champions League, but it is also about quality as well. If you are going to compete then of course it is about quality.\nRead more: Scott Brown: I feared my record-breaking Champions League record was doomed after one match\u200b\n\u201cBut it is very difficult for us to get that. We will always rely on the collective, we will always rely on the team. There won\u2019t be one player at this level who is a massive stand-out. Our star is the team. That is the way it will always be.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Rodgers has expressed the view that Celtic's disappointing showing against Anderlecht at Parkhead was partially down to the fact their opponents, who they had defeated away in Belgium back in September, needed to win 3-0 in order to go through.\nHe added: \u201cWe weren\u2019t very good in our ball possession in the first half, in our belief in taking the ball. But I also think part of that was down to the context of the game.\n\u201cAs easy as it is to say it is 0-0 when we play the game there is still that mentality, not just from ourselves, but also from them.\n\"They have got to start the game and really come onto the game.

We will be working in partnership with Brighton and Hove News and its editor Frank le Duc to provide the Brighton coverage. \nWith print and digital titles covering every part of the county, Sussex Newspapers has 1.4m unique browsers each month and hundreds of thousands of weekly print readers. It is part of Johnston Press which has led the way in developing the ground-breaking national scheme with the BBC under the direction of chief executive Ashley Highfield. \nContracts to employ an initial 144 full-time and two part-time Local Democracy Reporters have been allocated to 58 news organisations in England, Scotland and Wales following a competitive bidding process. \nThose news organisations - ranging from a radio station to online media companies and established regional newspaper groups - will now receive funding from the BBC to cover employment costs of the reporters. \nOnce recruited, stories written by the democracy reporters will be shared with more than 700 media organisations that have signed up to be part of the Local News Partnerships scheme. \nDavid Holdsworth, Controller of BBC English Regions, said: \u201cThis is a major advance in the partnership which will significantly improve the reporting on councils and public institutions, leading to greater public accountability for our local politicians.\u201d \nAs part of its Charter commitment, the BBC is investing up to \u00a38m annually in the Local News Partnerships during the next nine years to the end of the Charter in 2026. \nThe landmark partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association also includes a Shared Data Unit, based at BBC Birmingham, and a facility allowing local news providers access to relevant regional BBC video and audio content. \nThe Shared Data Unit will utilise BBC teams and seconded journalists from the wider industry to develop data journalism expertise. The first regional journalists to be seconded started on November 20. \nAshley Highfield, chair of the News Media Association and chief executive of Johnston Press - publisher of this title - said: \u201cThe ground-breaking Local News Partnership between the NMA and the BBC is now becoming a reality which will benefit the BBC, local media and, most importantly, local communities.\u201d \n\u201cThe initiative has moved the whole relationship between the BBC and the local media sector from confrontation to collaboration, and key benefits will include 150 new journalists on the ground holding public institutions to account on behalf of their readers. \n\u201cManaged by local media and funded by BBC, the Local Democracy Reporters are just a part of a slew of collaborative initiatives that will see local media get access to BBC\u2019s local video and data journalism.\u201d \nTo be awarded the democracy reporter contracts, the 58 successful news organisations had to pass stringent criteria which included financial stability and a strong track record of relevant journalism in the area they were applying to cover. \nThe award decisions were made by senior editorial BBC figures across the English regions, Wales and Scotland. \nIn areas where a single contract contained multiple reporters, some successful bidders opted to share the allocation with neighbouring news organisations. \nThe next step will be for the successful organisations to start recruiting, with a view to becoming operational in the next few months. \nA total of 150 local democracy reporters will eventually be employed once all contracts have been awarded.

A more arcane provision in the Senate bill \u2014 regarding blocks of stocks bought at different times \u2014 could make the benefits of harvesting tax losses, a staple of basic financial planning, harder to accomplish. \u201cThe loss of some of the deductions will go a long way toward tax simplification but not necessarily toward tax savings,\u201d said Timothy M. Steffen, director of advanced planning at Baird, a wealth management firm. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be easier to figure out how much more you\u2019re going to have to pay.\u201d For those who would like to take advantage of tax benefits now, here are strategies they can follow. Pay property taxes early. Both the House and Senate bills allow for $10,000 in real estate tax deductions, which is high enough for taxpayers in many states. Nine counties in the United States with populations of 100,000 or more, however, have an average real estate tax that exceeds that amount, according to an analysis by Attom Data Solutions. No. 1 is Westchester County , outside New York City, at $16,500 a year. The other eight are in New Jersey, New York, Northern California and southern Connecticut. There are 32 additional counties \u2014 in Illinois, Virginia and Massachusetts \u2014 where the average property tax is $7,000 or more, meaning people who own larger homes in those areas will feel the bite. Most municipalities set property tax rates in the middle of the year. Homeowners either pay them as part of their mortgage or directly to their town semiannually. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story If the latter is the case, advisers say to pay the installment due in early 2018 now. And if the taxes are paid as part of the mortgage payment, they advise checking with the bank to make sure the tax is paid this month and not in January. Prepay state taxes. Advisers suggest paying state taxes early, to the extent that is possible, by making an estimated tax payment for what is owed this year. This is something that affects more people, because 41 states tax earned income . Joseph J. Perry, the tax and business services leader at Marcum, a national accounting firm, said his firm was exploring a novel strategy for clients to prepay New York State tax for the first, second and third quarters of 2018. He said it appeared to be allowed under a mechanism in the state tax code. But early payment strategies work only if you do not qualify for the alternative minimum tax. Once taxpayers set off the A.M.T., their income is taxed at 28 percent, but they lose these deductions. High earners with savvy accountants could, however, work the math to accelerate income while qualifying for the A.M.T. this year to pay less in taxes than they might next year, Mr. Perry said. \u201cIf you\u2019re at a higher rate next year, you\u2019re not going to have that state deduction to bring you down,\u201d he said. Therefore, if high earners could receive a bonus this month instead of early next year, they could potentially have that money taxed at the lower rate. (Like all tax strategies, though, this requires running various calculations with an accountant.) Make large charitable donations. Calculating the tax value of charitable donations is a little trickier. The wealthiest will still get a benefit under certain circumstances. For example, if a married couple had a $1 million mortgage with a 4 percent interest rate, it could deduct $40,000 for its mortgage interest plus $10,000 for real estate taxes under the Senate version of the tax bill. This would give the couple $50,000 in deductions, which is above the standard deduction of $24,000, allowing them to claim charitable donations as a deduction. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Under the House proposal, which caps the mortgage that can be used for the deduction at $500,000, they would have $20,000 in mortgage interest and $10,000 for real estate taxes. At $30,000 in deductions, their charitable gifts would still count. But if that same couple rents instead of owns, it would not have those other deductions to get above the standard amount. So any benefit it gets today from itemizing charitable deductions would be subsumed under the standard deduction. If the tax math works \u2014 and given that the income tax rates are likely to be higher this year than next year \u2014 people who can make large charitable deductions this year are likely to get more benefit. Those who do not want to give outright to a charity can make a donation to a donor-advised fund. In doing so, they get the deduction this year but can make the grants to charities later. Harvest stock losses. The Senate bill has a seemingly arcane provision that addresses the adequate identification rule, which has to do with selling blocks of stock. As the rule stands, people who bought blocks of stock at different times can choose which blocks to sell or give away for tax purposes. Under the proposed changes, an investor would have to sell the oldest stock first \u2014 under the premise of first in first out, said Gary M. DuBoff, principal in the tax and accounting department at MBAF, an accounting firm. The shares with the highest embedded taxes are the ones that people usually donate to charity, but Mr. DuBoff pointed out that this change would have an effect on tax-loss harvesting, a strategy in which an investor sells stocks that have performed poorly to take a capital loss. This still works if someone is selling the entire position, but not if the investor wants to sell more recently purchased blocks, which may have gone down in value while earlier blocks are still up, Mr. DuBoff said. So this is a good time to make sure your adviser is harvesting losses on blocks within large stock holdings, particularly if earlier blocks have appreciated. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Don\u2019t act hastily. There are risks to acting now without full information. In 2012, Congress and President Barack Obama were locked in a tense debate over tax rates as the United States inched toward what was called the fiscal cliff \u2014 meaning that after Dec. 31, taxes would rise automatically if an agreement was not reached. As the year was nearing an end, a swath of wealthy taxpayers rushed to make taxable gifts, thinking that Mr. Obama would reduce what had been a generous estate and gift tax exemption of $5 million a person. Instead, the opposite happened. Mr. Obama and the House speaker, John Boehner, reached an agreement to make that exemption permanent and index it to inflation. That exemption essentially eliminated the estate tax for all but a few Americans, but it was bad news for some people who had made irrevocable gifts solely for tax purposes. Their money was gone before it had to be. Planners say the risk this year is lower, and they predict that any changes to the bills are going to be on the margins. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to get blindsided here,\u201d said Jay Messing, senior director of planning for Wells Fargo Private Bank. \u201cMost itemized deductions are going away. If there\u2019s a change and it didn\u2019t make sense to donate this year, maybe you just gave money to your favorite charity a little early.\u201d It\u2019s smart to act now on some strategies, but others should wait until 2018. Thinking through those will be the focus of next week\u2019s column.

Photo: Joan Marcus Share this: \nWhen Tina Landau\u2019s agent asked her if she would be interested in directing a musical based on SpongeBob SquarePants , she replied with a blunt \u201cNo.\u201d \n\u201cAll that came to my head was a big, theme-park\u2013style children\u2019s show with giant mascot heads and foam characters,\u201d she says. \u201cThat did not interest me.\u201d \nBut when she learned that the cartoon\u2019s creator, Stephen Hillenburg, wanted the show to be as eccentric as his original concept of a talking kitchen sponge living in a piece of fruit underwater, she changed her tune and agreed to sign on. Now, her wacky, inventive vision of Bikini Bottom has just made its Broadway debut \u2013 complete with a set of 18 songs penned by high-profile rock and pop artists ranging from the Flaming Lips, T.I. and Aerosmith\u2019s Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, to Panic! At the Disco, Sara Bareilles and even David Bowie. \nTom Kitt, a Pulitzer-winning Broadway composer and the show\u2019s musical director, said that the key to making the project work was allowing the artists to write in their own voice. \u201cI very much wanted to make sure that the intention of the composition was really present,\u201d he tells Rolling Stone . \u201cAs all of these layers of musical theater were being applied, it was important to make sure that the artists\u2019 voices were front and center.\u201d In the early stages of developing the show, Landau and her creative team had outlined a basic plot (a volcano threatens to destroy Bikini Bottom and SpongeBob is tasked with saving the day) and song ideas. Once they had their list of potential songs, the team began asking one another who would be the best fit for each tune. When Tom Higgenson of pop-rockers Plain White T\u2019s received a call asking if he would contribute to the project, he was ecstatic. He had his sights set on writing a pirate sea shanty, but quickly realized why he had really been contacted. \u201cThere was this one song that was, like, a friendship love song between SpongeBob and Patrick [Star],\u201d Higgenson says. \u201cOnce I saw that, it was like, \u2018OK, they\u2019re probably reaching out to the Plain White T\u2019s for the love song, not the pirate song.'\u201d The song, \u201cBFF,\u201d sounds like a deep-cut off of an early Plain White T\u2019s record \u2013 an acoustic guitar strums the melody while SpongeBob and Patrick sing sweetly about being best bros. \u201cThey definitely embellished it and made room for those theatrical moments,\u201d Higgenson says. \u201cBut the basis of the song is literally the same key and the same little parts and everything that I first recorded. It\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Danny Skinner and Ethan Slater in the \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 musical. Photo: Joan Marcus \nFor the Flaming Lips\u2019 Wayne Coyne, his involvement with SpongeBob SquarePants extended back to the 2004 SpongeBob movie soundtrack. The Lips\u2019 song on that record, \u201cSpongeBob & Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy,\u201d confirmed for Landau that they were one of the essential acts she needed for this show. \u201cI started saying very early on that this show should feel like a Flaming Lips concert,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s confetti in the air and balls in the audience.\u201d Coyne and the band were tasked with composing the show\u2019s Act One closer, \u201cTomorrow Is,\u201d where the citizens of Bikini Bottom realize that they may only have one day left on Earth. According to Coyne, that drama is right within the Flaming Lips\u2019 wheelhouse. \u201cWe have these songs that kind of hint at the epic nature of life,\u201d the singer tells RS . \u201cLike a, \u2018If this is the last day on Earth, then make the most of it,\u2019 kind of thing. And I think [Tina] thought that we could naturally bring the drama that the show needed.\u201d Throughout the songwriting process, Landau said that Coyne sent her a series of images of things like melting chocolate and \u201cpsychedelic paint\u201d with little messages keeping her updated about where he was in the writing process. Coyne says that\u2019s something he often does when writing for other artists. \u201cI think it\u2019s a nice way to let people know that you\u2019re still thinking about them,\u201d he says. \u201cBut to be honest, I don\u2019t always put a lot of thought into the photos I send,\u201d he adds with a laugh. David Bowie also had a history with the SpongeBob franchise. The late icon had voiced the character of Lord Royal Highness in a 2007 episode of the TV show called \u201cAtlantis SquarePantis,\u201d so when Landau was considering who to contact, he seemed like a natural fit. When she reached out to Bowie in 2012, he said that he was very interested, but \u201cdidn\u2019t have time\u201d to write an original song for the musical. Also See #50GreatestConcerts: Janis Joplin, 1968 \u201cI\u2019m not sure where he was with his health at that point,\u201d Landau says. \u201cBut he told us he wanted to contribute and asked us to go through his catalogue, and see if there was a song we could adapt.\u201d Hoping to find a lesser-known Bowie song, Landau stumbled upon \u201cNo Control,\u201d a B side from the singer\u2019s 1995 Brian Eno collaboration 1. Outside . \u201cIt seemed like quintessential Bowie, and it fit thematically with what we were doing,\u201d she says, referring to the show\u2019s apocalyptic plot. \u201cSo with his blessing, we started adapting the music and lyrics to fit the show.\u201d Lilli Cooper and Ethan Slater in the \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 musical. Photo: Joan Marcus Only one other song from the show is an adapted piece: \u201cBest Day Ever\u201d was written by Andy Paley and Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob on the TV show, for a SpongeBob -themed album, though it was first heard in the franchise\u2019s 2004 movie. Kenny says that the Brian Wilson\u2013inspired song encapsulates the character of SpongeBob perfectly. \u201cHe totally believes every day is going to be the best day ever,\u201d he tells RS . \u201cSometimes he gets his little square ass kicked, just like the rest of us, but as he goes to bed, he pushes a reset button and says, \u2018Maybe tomorrow.\u2019 And that is what is so key to him.\u201d \nEthan Slater, who plays the titular sponge in the musical, agrees that what makes the character special is his unwavering optimism. He says he tries to bring that idea to every song he performs in the show, despite how eclectic the compositions can be. \n\u201cI\u2019m always sort of changing, stylistically, the way that I\u2019m singing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s never distinct from the character or the story.\u201d \nLandau says that at the outset of this process, she was skeptical that she and her team would be able to realize their ambitious vision for the soundtrack. \u201cI\u2019m still, to this day, surprised, but it ended up not being the logistical nightmare you might imagine it could have been,\u201d she says. \nBut Kitt says he\u2019s not surprised that so many artists wanted to be involved with a show that is spreading a simple message of kindness and hope. \u201cEveryone loves this character and this world,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all just feel blessed to bring joy and optimism to the world right now.\u201d Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",
