People on Medicaid are prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But a new survey says that\u2019... \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Trends Indicate Positive Movement", "text": "Can National Bank of Canada (NA.TO) Move Higher? Trends Indicate Positive Movement December 7, 2017 Newswire \nIn the latest session, National Bank of Canada (NA.TO) moved -0.010%, touching a recent bid of 63.38. Current price levels place the shares above the rising trendline. \nOne of the basic tenets put forth by Charles Dow in the Dow Theory is that security prices do trend. Trends are often measured and identified by \u201ctrendlines.\u201d A trendline is a sloping line that is drawn between two or more prominent points on a chart. Rising trends are defined by a trendline that is drawn between two or more troughs (low points) to identify price support. Falling trend-s are defined by trendlines that are drawn between two or more peaks (high points) to identify price resistance. \nA principle of technical analysis is that once a trend has been formed (two or more peaks/troughs have touched the trendline and reversed direction) it will remain intact until broken. That sounds much more simplistic than it is! The goal is to analyze the current trend using trendlines and then either invest with the current trend until the trendline is broken, or wait for the trendline to be broken and then invest with the new (opposite) trend. \nOne benefit of trendlines is they help distinguish emotional decisions (\u201cI think it\u2019s time to sell\u2026\u201d) from analytical decisions (\u201cI will hold until the current rising trendline is broken\u201d). Another benefit of trendlines is that they almost always keep you on the \u201cright\u201d side of the market. When using trendlines, it\u2019s difficult to hold a security for very long when prices are falling just as it\u2019s hard to be short when prices are rising\u2013either way the trendline will be broken. \nInvestors may be watching other technical indicators such as the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This indicator compares the closing price of a stock in relation to the highs and lows over a certain time period. A common look back period is 14 days. National Bank of Canada (NA.TO)\u2019s Williams %R presently stands at -60.74. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would indicate an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation. \nNational Bank of Canada (NA.TO)\u2019s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R presently is at -60.74. In general, if the reading goes above -20, the stock may be considered to be overbought. Alternately, if the indicator goes under -80, this may show the stock as being oversold. The Williams %R indicator helps show the relative situation of the current price close to the period being observed. \nWe can also take a look at the Average Directional Index or ADX of National Bank of Canada (NA.TO). The ADX is used to measure trend strength. ADX calculations are made based on the moving average price range expansion over a specified amount of time. ADX is charted as a line with values ranging from 0 to 100. The indicator is non-directional meaning that it gauges trend strength whether the stock price is trending higher or lower. The 14-day ADX sits at 31.95. In general, and ADX value from 0-25 would represent an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would indicate a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would signify an extremely strong trend. At the time of writing, National Bank of Canada (NA.TO) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -90.46. Developed by Donald Lambert, the CCI is a versatile tool that may be used to help spot an emerging trend or provide warning of extreme conditions. CCI generally measures the current price relative to the average price level over a specific time period. CCI is relatively high when prices are much higher than average, and relatively low when prices are much lower than the average. \nA commonly used tool among technical stock analysts is the moving average. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators that simply take the average price of a stock over a certain period of time. Moving averages can be very helpful for identifying peaks and troughs. They may also be used to assist the trader figure out proper support and resistance levels for the stock. Currently, the 200-day MA is sitting at 57.21. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of stock price movements. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it oscillates between 0 and 100. Generally, the RSI is considered to be oversold when it falls below 30 and overbought when it heads above 70. RSI can be used to detect general trends as well as finding divergences and failure swings. The 14-day RSI is presently standing at 56.97, the 7-day is 47.33, and the 3-day is resting at 28.10.

It changes the definition of marriage from solely between a man and a woman to \"a union of two people\" excluding all others. The legislation passed with a majority that wasn't challenged, although five lawmakers registered their opposition. \nThe Senate passed the same legislation last week 43 votes to 12. After royal assent and other formalities, the law will likely take effect in about a month, with the first weddings expected about a month later. \nChampagne and tears of flowed in the halls of Parliament House as gay celebrities including Olympic champion swimmer Ian Thorpe and actress Magda Szubanski hugged lawmakers and ordinary folk in a party atmosphere. \n\"What an amazing day, I'm a little bit delirious, it's extraordinary,\" said Szubanski, who sat in the public gallery during Thursday's daylong debate. \nThorpe thanked \"our straight brothers and sisters\" for strongly backing marriage equality in the two-month postal survey. \n\"Quite literally without them voting for us, this would never have happened,\" Thorpe said. \n\"It means that we've created an Australia that is more equitable, it's more fair, it's more just,\" he added. \nAmendments meant to safeguard freedoms of speech and religion for gay-marriage opponents were all rejected, though those issues may be considered later. The government has appointed a panel to examine how to safeguard religious freedoms once gay marriage is a reality in Australia. \nLawmakers advocating marriage equality had argued that the national postal survey in November mandated a change of the marriage definition alone, so changing the law should not be delayed by other considerations. \nGay marriage was endorsed by 62 percent of voters who responded to the postal ballot. \n\"It is now our job as members of Parliament to pass a fair bill that does not extend or create any new discriminations,\" an emotional government lawmaker Warren Entsch, who helped draft the bill, told Parliament. \"It is a strong bill that already strikes the right balance between equality and freedom of religion.\" \n\"It's an historic day for Australia today and I think the celebrations around the country when we finally ... achieve marriage equality are going to be immense,\" Janet Rice said before the vote. Rice is a minor Greens party senator who was only able to remain married to her transgender wife of 31 years, Penny, because Penny remained listed as male on her birth certificate. \nPenny Wong, an opposition Labor Party senator who has two children with her lesbian partner, said, \"I am feeling happy.\" \nMost gay rights advocates believed the government should have allowed marriages years ago and saw various ideas for a public survey as a delaying tactic. The U.N. Human Rights Committee had called the ballot survey \"an unnecessary and divisive public opinion poll.\" \nThe current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from anti-discrimination laws. \nOne of the rejected amendments would have ensured Australians could speak freely about their traditional views of marriage without fear of legal action. It was proposed by Attorney-General George Brandis and supported by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, both gay marriage supporters. \nFormer Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a high-profile advocate of traditional marriage, told Parliament that Turnbull and opposition leader Bill Shorten had failed to deliver detailed protections for freedoms of speech, conscience and religion in the bill. \n\"A promise was made by the leaders of this Parliament and the promise has not adequately been delivered on,\" Abbott said. \nAbbott pointed to an Australian teenager who lost her job for advocating against gay marriage on social media and an Australian Catholic bishop who was taken before a state anti-discrimination tribunal over a pamphlet he published extolling traditional marriage. The complaint against the bishop was dropped. \n\"The last thing we should want to do is to subject Australians to new forms of discrimination in place of old ones that are rightly gone,\" he said. \nGovernment lawmaker Trevor Evans ruled out an Australian equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court case in which a baker who refused to provide a wedding cake for a gay couple argued he was exercising artistic freedom and was exempt from Colorado anti-discrimination laws. \n\"Let's be honest here, for a case like that to arise in Australia, it would require a gay couple who care more about activism than about the success of their own wedding, to find a business operator who cares more about religious doctrine than the commercial success of their own small business, and for both of them to commit to having a fight,\" Evans told Parliament. \n\"Typical Australians would genuinely question the bona fides of the players in a case like that and the slim prospects of that occurring doesn't warrant the pages and pages of commentary and debate that have been dedicated to it,\" he added. \nSeveral gay marriage opponents in Turnbull's conservative coalition have regarded marriage equality as inevitable and have welcomed an end to an issue that has long divided the government ranks. \nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann, a same-sex marriage opponent who oversaw the postal ballot, said he felt \"great satisfaction\" that the issue was resolved. \n\"It was a polarizing issue on which good Australians had strongly and sincerely held views on both sides of the argument,\" Cormann said. \nThe result is a political win for Turnbull, who became prime minister after deposing Abbott in 2015 in an internal government leadership ballot. \nAbbott was head-butted by a gay rights advocate during the postal survey campaign in September. Kevin Rudd, a center-left Labor Party prime minister whom Abbott defeated in elections in 2013, blamed the postal ballot for an assault on his 19-year-old godson as he campaigned for marriage equality a week earlier. \nVeteran gay rights campaigner Rodney Croome said he expected the first same-sex weddings in Australia would not take place until February. \nThe law will likely take effect after a month. State laws then require couples to give 28 days' notice of their intention to marry, Croome said. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\" Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. Can't Find Something?

About one-third of people tend to visit physical stores 10 times during the month. \nAmericans spend $482 on average for their Christmas gifts. Breaking it down, the report found Americans will spend $330 on children, $196 on their significant others, $105 on their parents, $90 on siblings and $57 on best friends. \nSo what gifts do American want this year? Fifty-three percent hope to buy clothes or shoes, while 51 percent are hoping to buy electronics like iPhone 8 and the Google Home assistant. Meanwhile, 32 percent are searching for toys like Hatchimals Surprise and Nerf Rival Nemesis toys. \nAccording to the National Retail Federation, Americans are likely to spend $967 on average for the holidays, which is higher than RetailMeNot's $482 average. \nThe federation estimates Americans will spend $608 on gifts alone, with $218 spent on candy, food and decorations. Consumers will spend an additional $141 on \"non-gift purchases\" for themselves and their families, too. \nHoliday sales are expected to climb this year between 3.6 and 4 percent, the federation report found. In total, experts estimate Americans will spend somewhere between $682 billion $678.75 billion on the holidays, which is up from $655.8 billion last year.

Defying dire, worldwide warnings, President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke with decades ... \nBy KARIN LAUB and ILAN BEN ZIONAssociated Press \nJERUSALEM (AP) - Palestinians shuttered schools and shops and called for protests in West Bank towns on Thursday, in show of anger over President Donald Trump's recognition of bitterly contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nTrump's dramatic break Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. The Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, condemned the Trump administration's decision in a rare public rebuke by the U.S. ally. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who leads Trump's efforts to restart Mideast peace talks. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa warned American citizens of possible protests following Trump's move. \nIn recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel's hard-line government which says it will not give up any part of the city. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has suggested that the United States disqualified itself as mediator between Israelis and Palestinians, a role it has played exclusively in more than two decades of stop-and-go negotiations on setting up a Palestinian state alongside Israel. \nThe talks, stalled in recent years, have failed to bring the Palestinians closer to the state the seek in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. In parallel, Israel has steadily expanded Jewish settlements on war-won lands, even as it said it wants to negotiate a deal. \nTrump's claim Wednesday that he still wants to pursue what he has called the \"ultimate\" Mideast deal was met by mounting skepticism. \n\"With its decision, the U.S. has isolated itself and Israel, and has pushed the area into a dangerous situation and stopped the peace process,\" said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a senior Abbas aid. \"Without a doubt, this decision will not help at all in solving the problems in the area, but rather strengthen the extremists.\" \nAbbas has not said what steps he would take, if any. Later Thursday, he is to meet with his closest Arab ally, Jordan's King Abdullah II, to coordinate positions. \nJordan plays a central role in the mounting controversy and, alongside other U.S. allies in the region, has slammed Trump's decision on Jerusalem. \nThe king is seen as one of Washington's most dependable partners in the battle against Islamic extremism in the region. \nAt the same time, the legitimacy of his Hashemite dynasty is closely linked to its special role in Jerusalem, as religious guardian of a key Muslim shrine in east Jerusalem. Jordan, which has a large population with Palestinian roots, cannot afford to be seen as soft on Muslim claims to the holy city. \nThe consultations between the monarch and Abbas will kick off a series of meetings in the Arab and Muslim world on how to respond to Trump. \nThe Arab League, a group representing most states in the Middle East and North Africa, will meet Saturday. Next week, Turkey will host a gathering of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which has 57 Arab and Muslim member states. \nThe region has been bracing for fallout from Trump's seismic policy shift. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday accused Trump of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" and said his motives were difficult to fathom. \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it, Erdogan said, referring to Trump in a speech to a group of workers at Ankara's airport. \n\"Political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace,\" Erdogan said. \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nWith his announcement Wednesday, Trump shattered decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on Jerusalem. \nDefying dire, worldwide warnings, Trump insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, starting with what he said was his decision merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. He also said the U.S. would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable. \n\"We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past,\" Trump said, brushing aside the appeals for caution from around the world. \n___ \nLaub reported from Amman, Jordan.

and activist Tarana Burke, creator of the #MeToo movement, along with the Hollywood star who amplified it on social media, Alyssa Milano. \n\"The galvanizing actions of the women on our cover \u2026 along with those of hundreds of others, and of many men as well, have unleashed one of the highest-velocity shifts in our culture since the 1960s,\" Time's editor in chief, Edward Felsenthal, told NBC's \"Today\" show Wednesday. \nThese \"silence breakers\" have forced a national reckoning on sexual harassment. \nThe media's endless stream of sexual harassment investigations and the countless #MeToo accounts of harassment, sexual abuse and worse have ensnared an ever-growing list of public figures - celebrities, executives, politicians, business leaders, whose lives and careers have come crashing down, or are dangerously close to doing so, amid all the accusations. \nLike Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer and Mark Halperin and former NPR news chief Michael Oreskes. \nLike Russell Simmons and Louis C.K. and Kevin Spacey and James Levine and Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn. \nLike John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the erstwhile dean of the House who resigned Tuesday amid mounting allegations of sexual harassment. \nThe barrage of sexual misconduct accusations, from Hollywood to Capitol Hill, came after the Weinstein scandal exploded in public view - with claims from numerous women who said he sexually harassed them, assaulted them and even raped them. \nAnd a social media movement emerged with the hashtag #MeToo, which has been used more than 3 million times on Twitter, according to company data. \nAs Katrina vanden Heuvel wrote in The Washington Post: \"More women are emboldened to talk, and more are being heard. The risks for abusers - particularly public figures - are rising. We know the roots of this extraordinary moment; where the moment leads remains to be seen.\" \nIn its Person of the Year 2017 cover story, Time noted that \"this moment is borne of a very real and potent sense of unrest. Yet it doesn't have a leader, or a single, unifying tenet. The hashtag #metoo (swiftly adapted into #BalanceTonPorc, #YoTambien, #Ana_kaman and many others), which to date has provided an umbrella of solidarity for millions of people to come forward with their stories, is part of the picture, but not all of it.\" \n\"This reckoning appears to have sprung up overnight. But it has actually been simmering for years, decades, centuries. Women have had it with bosses and co-workers who not only cross boundaries but don't even seem to know that boundaries exist. They've had it with the fear of retaliation, of being blackballed, of being fired from a job they can't afford to lose. They've had it with the code of going along to get along. They've had it with men who use their power to take what they want from women. These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced. In some cases, criminal charges have been brought. \n\"Emboldened by Judd, Rose McGowan and a host of other prominent accusers, women everywhere have begun to speak out about the inappropriate, abusive and in some cases illegal behavior they've faced. When multiple harassment claims bring down a charmer like former Today show host Matt Lauer, women who thought they had no recourse see a new, wide-open door. When a movie star says #metoo, it becomes easier to believe the cook who's been quietly enduring for years.\" \nIn choosing its Person of the Year, Time has said it names the person or people who had the greatest influence over the past 12 months. \nIn 2015, Time chose German Chancellor Angela Merkel; in 2014, it was \"The Ebola Fighters\"; and in 2013, Pope Francis - \"The People's Pope.\" \nLast year's choice was President Trump. \nIn explaining that pick, Time's then-editor Nancy Gibbs wrote: \"This is the 90th time we have named the person who had the greatest influence, for better or worse, on the events of the year. So which is it this year: Better or worse? The challenge for Donald Trump is how profoundly the country disagrees about the answer.\" \nTrump made the shortlist again for 2017.

U.S. health of... \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Andrews - The Washington Post \nStarbucks once made waves with the indulgent sizes of some of its drinks, such as the Trenta, which contains a staggering 31 ounces of joe. Now, as part of the company's aggressive expansion in China, the Seattle-based coffee retailer opened its largest store in the world: a nearly 30,000-square foot compound that does much more than simply serve coffee. \nThe new Starbucks Reserve Roastery, which opened Tuesday in Shanghai, is the first non-U.S. location of a new series of shops designed to offer a more \"immersive\" experience for coffee lovers, according to Starbucks. The first such roastery, which opened in Seattle in 2014, is about half its size, CNN reported. \nThe Shanghai location is the world's largest Starbucks. It includes three coffee bars, one of which clocks in at 88 feet long - the chain's longest to date. The coffee bars will serve cups made from beans grown in China's Pu'er in Yunnan Province, USA Today reported. A two-story, 40-ton copper cask towers over the store, refilling the coffee bars' various silos. \nAs a nod to the local beverage of choice, it also includes a tea bar made from 3D printed materials, and an in-house bakery employing more than 30 Chinese bakers and chefs, the company stated. \nThe experience seems curated to keep people mulling about the store. It is the first Starbucks location to integrate augmented reality, which refers to technology that combines real-world surroundings with tech, in this case the customers' smartphones. They can point their phones at various spots around the cavernous room to learn about the coffee brewing process. \nChina might seem like an odd place to open the world's biggest and arguably flashily Starbucks, given the country's traditional warm beverage has long been tea, not coffee. And, in fact, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said the company struggled when it opened its first store in China in 1999. \n\"We had to educate and teach many Chinese about what coffee was - the coffee ritual, what a latte was,\" Schultz told CNN. \"So in the early years, we did not make money.\" \nBut now, the company is expanding faster than frothed milk. Since 2016, it has been on pace to open an average of one new store every day for five years, CNN reported. In 2021, the company plans to have almost 5,000 stores across the country. For comparison, there were more than 11,100 Starbucks in America in 2012. \n\"When people ask me how much can you really grow in China, I don't really know what the answer is, but I do believe it's going to be larger than the U.S.,\" Schultz told the New York Times. \nThe company's practices in China haven't been free of criticism. In 2014, reports came out that a latte cost nearly a dollar more in China than in the United States, even though the U.S. boasted a per capita income that was 5 1/2 times China's, the Atlantic reported. The company defended its pricing structure, and has not adjusted it. \n\"When you look at our pricing structure, we look at it market by market. It's based on our true cost of running our business in China and or any market that we operate,\" John Culver, group president at Starbucks Coffee China and Asia Pacific, told CNBC Asia's \"Squawk Box.\" \nThe higher prices don't seem to have driven away many customers. Over the past year, sales in China grew by seven percent compared to a three percent in the rest of the word, ABC News reported. \nSome believe that's why the company chose to open the new splashy location in Shanghai. \n\"This is a show store,\" John Gordon, a restaurant analyst at Pacific Management Consulting, told CNN. \"The point is to be in a highly, highly visible, touristy [area] where there's foot traffic, offices and urban housing in order to promote the brand. \nThe store's boasting rights as the world's largest won't last long, though. The company plans to open a 43,000 square foot location on Chicago's Michigan Avenue in 2019, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Accompanied with a rich chestnut stuffing, garden greens and roasted potatoes drenched with giblet gravy and a side of cranberry and mustard sauce, this succulent dish is so lip-smackingly good, you\u2019ll be hungry for seconds or thirds. \nBut wait! For a little something different but equally satisfying, try their Salmon Gravalax Board, a Nordic dish of raw salmon cured in salt, sugar and dill typically eaten as an appetiser before you dig into the real heavy stuff. But hey, nobody\u2019s judging \u2013 so go ahead and enjoy this dish any way you wish. \nIf you\u2019re in the mood for chilled seafood, the hotel\u2019s Seafood Platter On Ice will play havoc on your tastebuds with fresh oysters, scallops and a host of other shellfish vying for your attention. \nOther highlights of your evening meal include Stewed Lamb Cutlets and Osso Buco Jardini\u00e9re, which are veal shanks braised with vegetables, white wine and broth. \nThe Pan Seared Salmon Fillet meanwhile puts on a good show with its accompaniments of avocado salsa, lemongrass butter and roasted baby potatoes in garlic herbs. \nThe Texan Braised Cumin Chilli Beef on roasted pumpkin with caraway cream and Roasted Chicken Breast with mushroom sauce are two other delights that you must make space for in your tummy. \nThe live cooking stall with its assortment of barbecued seafood, chicken, strip loin and lamb cutlets as well as chicken and beef satay are great for nibbling as you chat the night away with family and friends. Desserts galore and the highlight of the Christmas dinner table \u2013 the Grand Seasons\u2019 Roasted Turkey. \nAlways leave the table with sweet memories. And nothing quite does it better than Grand Seasons\u2019 selection of seasonal desserts \u2013 from the traditional Christmas Pudding with rich butter sauce to Mini Mincemeat Pies, to Chocolate Yule Logs and Christmas Stollen, a traditional German bread made with chopped candied fruit and/or dried fruit, nuts and spices. \nIf that\u2019s not enough to give you a sugar rush, try their gingerbread or cinnamon-star anise cookies that are perfect with a cup of piping hot coffee or tea. A chocolate fountain with its host of tempting festive bites will give you just one more reason to linger on for a while more. A New Year\u2019s spread bound to make any meal a fascinating feast. \nFor those planning on celebrating Christmas and New Year at home, place your order of Roast Turkey, priced at RM350 nett.

If you are passionate about books and writing, this is the blog which will help you express your life. Kitchen Table Writers love it when their work is published, but it's the joy of books that really makes them tick\u2026and makes them write. Pages 'Read Classic', an occasional series of posts on Kitchen Table Writers A friend gave me my copy of Moby-Dick, by Herman Melville as a gift, around 15 years ago. It measures 6 1\u2044 2 \u201d by 4\u201d by 1 1\u2044 2 \u201d with 798 gold-edged wafer-thin pages and 135 chapters, a \u2018Collector\u2019s Library\u2019 edition, \u2018 complete and unabridged\u2019. When I first tried to read it, I got bored quickly. I was 150 pages in and they\u2019d only just gone aboard The Pequod \u2013 200 pages in and we still hadn\u2019t met Ahab\u2026 Steadily, I read less, until the little golden book was forgotten. Then my reading group, bless them, decided that we should all read a different 19th century American work. I pulled out Moby-Dick, blew off its dust and started again. Maybe I was in a different place, a different reading mindset. But instantly, I loved it. I dove into the rich, warming narrative \u2013 words that go on and on. I swam within them as if they were fish teeming in the Pacific. I\u2019d finished it within the four allotted weeks, and watched the 1956 film, starring Gregory Peck as Ahab, with a screenplay by Ray Bradbury. At the meeting, I read out the passages I particularly loved\u2026 And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field.... Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. Chapter 41, Moby Dick Herman Melville Herman Melville was born in New York in 1819 and by the age of 13 was working in a bank. At 18 he completed his education and moved from job to job; school teacher, newspaper reporter, merchant sailor. He went West to (unsuccessfully) seek his fortune. Down on his luck he set sail on a whaler bound for the South Seas, where he spent time in the company of the natives. He detailed his adventures in a series of novels which, in his own lifetime, proved continually more popular than Moby-Dick. MOBY-DICK; or THE WHALE, first appeared in 1851, when he was 32. Now, it is considered his seminal work, and having read it, I know it is a masterpiece, a gothic philosophical allegory and a scathing satire on life. It is profoundly inventive, intense and ironic, the style and language standing alongside other great experimental novels, from Tristram Shandy to Ulysses. I loved its soaring voice, which moves from long passages of soliloquy, through pieces of script format, to sharp and dramatic dialogue \u2026 \u2026\u201cLook ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?\"- holding up a broad bright coin to the sun- \"it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D'ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.\" While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him. Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \"Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke- look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!\" \"Huzza! huzza!\" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast. \"It's a white whale, I say,\" resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul: \"a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.\" All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection. \"Captain Ahab,\" said Tashtego, \"that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick.\u201d Chapter 36, The Quarter-Deck. Most of the information between the pages is now anachronistic and almost forgotten, but I was fascinated by how whale blubber was rendered down on board into barrels of oil \u2013 how the first steak from a kill would be eaten ceremoniously. And yet, counterpointing all the minutiae and trivia, the ways of Moby Dick remain unknown. Melville (and Ishmael) are sure upon that; the white whale is like God in his Heaven, which makes Ahab a fool for trying to find and outdo him. The result, of course, is futile\u2026and fatal. The book teems with ideas, imagery and emotion, but between these subtleties lie those hard facts. Melville makes use of his first-hand descriptions of whaling alongside an encyclopaedic knowledge of the nature of the whale\u2026 The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness, tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though, and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about in quest of settlements, that is, harems. Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull- poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey. Chapter 88, Schools and Schoolmasters The book is chocked with symbolic motifs which develop and inform the text\u2019s major themes, and I enjoyed spotting them. The first one is the colour white, which Ishmael, finds threatening; white waves albinos, whale spout\u2026 It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver; and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence, not a solitude: on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea\u2026 Chapter 51, The Spirit-Spout Then there is the coffin, which symbolizes life and death. When Ishmael\u2019s friend, the harpooner Queequeg, falls ill, he asks the carpenter to build him a coffin, but survives and stores his belongings in it. When the Pequod sinks, the coffin becomes Ishmael\u2019s lifeboat. Call me Ishmael. Some years ago -- never mind how long precisely -- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off -- then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. Chapter 1, Loomings And the themes themselves are grand. Like the heroes of Greek or Shakespearean tragedy, Ahab suffers from a single fatal flaw. He is obsessed, monomaniacal, believing that, like a god, he will remain immune to the forces of nature while pursuing the White Whale\u2026it\u2019s his inescapable fate to destroy this evil. The Pequod represents the world\u2026its crew, all of humanity\u2019s fears, frailties and faiths are acted out. It is a symbol of doom, painted black and covered in whale teeth and bones, mementos of their violent death. The name was taken from a Native American tribe made extinct by the white invaders. But despite the wanderings of both book and ship, there is a plot, and it uses causality, something I love in a story. From the beginning, Ishmael notes Ahab\u2019s eccentricity and madness getting worse, until, The Pequod encounters the whaling ship Rachel , imploring help to search for the missing whaling-crew, including the captain's son. But as soon as Ahab learns that the crew disappeared while tangling with Moby-Dick he refuses the call to aid \u2013 something unheard of in whaling tradition \u2013 and goes off to hunt the White Whale. After The Pequod goes down, Ishmael, in his coffin, is ironically rescued by the Rachel which has continued to search for its missing crew.
