BIRN Hague Tribunal president Carmel Agius. Photo: ICTY. \nCarmel Agius, the president of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, ICTY, told the Security Council in New York on Wednesday that the UN court\u2019s mission had been accomplished with its final two verdicts last month. \nAgius said that the verdicts in the cases against former Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic and six wartime Bosnian Croat officials, including military leader Slobodan Praljak, were \u201cpoints of no return, which forever changed the landscape of international justice\u201d. \n\u201cIn retrospect\u2026 the establishment of the ICTY [in 1993] was one of the international community\u2019s proudest moments,\u201d Agius said. \nThe ICTY shuts down on December 31 this year and its remaining work, including the appeal in the Mladic case, will be completed by the Mechanism for International Tribunals. \nAgius said that the challenges and difficulties faced by the ICTY should \u201cin no way lead one to conclude that to resort to international criminal tribunals is not worth it\u201d. \nIn its most recent controversy, Slobodan Praljak swallowed poison in the courtroom after hearing his sentence and died within hours. An investigation into his death, and how he got access to the poison, is underway. \nAgius said that international criminal justice would always be time-consuming and expensive, but \u201cto live with the alternative of doing nothing and giving in to impunity is to pay a much, much higher price\u201d. \nHe admitted however that while the ICTY\u2019s supporters see it as having played an important role in the struggle against impunity, its detractors would continue to denounce it \u201cfor reasons of political or personal gain, blind nationalism and ethnic hatred\u201d. \nICTY chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz told the Security Council meanwhile that there was still an absence of genuine reconciliation in the former Yugoslavia , where \u201cconvicted war criminal continue to be seen by many as heroes, while victims and survivors are ignored and dismissed\u201d. \n\u201cThere is still no true will within the region to accept the immense wrongdoings of the past and move forward, sadly most of all among the political leadership,\u201d Brammertz said. \nHe argued that as a result of the ICTY\u2019s work \u201cso many victims and survivors received some measure of justice for the immense wrongs they suffered\u201d. \n\u201cOur results show that if there is a clear political agenda in favour of accountability, and if the international community speaks with one voice, those most responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law can be held accountable for their crimes,\u201d he said. \nBrammertz also argued however that much more remains to be done after the closure of the ICTY to ensure the guilty are held accountable for their crimes. \n\u201cMany victims, from all communities, are still waiting for justice,\u201d he said.

It coincides with the 30 Nov and 5 Dec rejection points\u00b9. Meanwhile, to the upside there's a bit more resistance levels nearby sitting at the 5 Dec high\u00b2 of 112.87, and the 4 Dec high\u00b3 of 113.09. But in general, the 113.00 level should provide the next level of strong resistance should we make a move there. The slight jump in the last hour coincides with the breaking of the downward sloping trendline from 4 Dec to 5 Dec - and also a firm break of the 100-hour MA. European equity markets are generally in the green now with Eurostoxx, DAX, FTSE, CAC40, FTSE MIB, and Ibex indices all higher on the day so far. That's a vast improvement in sentiment in the equities market. Meanwhile, slight dollar strength across the major bloc is also helping to keep the pair bid for now. I prefer to trade this on the daily chart as it provides a clearer picture, as the topside resistance of the 23.6 retracement level at 114.54 is the key one the pair must break through. It's been rejected three times since May. Meanwhile, on the bottom side of the range the 108.00 level is one that the pair must break away from to trend lower. As we're closer to the topside of that 108.00 to 114.54 range, I'd sell on rallies if I get the chance when we move higher to the upper bound of the range.

People on Medicaid are prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But a new survey says that\u2019... \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.

Singapore has been invited by Argentina to attend the annual meeting of the world's top economic leaders in 2018. \nAt the Buenos Aires Summit, leaders of the Group of 20 (G-20) economies will discuss the challenges facing the global economy and the policies to promote strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth \nThe summit from Nov 30 to Dec 1 next year, will be the 13th meeting of the G-20. \nSingapore, a major financial centre and hub for investments into Asia, looks forward to contributing actively to the G-20 discussions, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a joint statement on Thursday (Dec 7). \nIn particular, Singapore is keen to promote an open, rules-based international economic system as well as discuss infrastructure financing, international tax cooperation and the future of work. \nAn international panel of top economists and leaders chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam will also be submitting its final recommendations on global financial governance by October 2018. \nThis G-20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance was set up in April this year, and tasked to review issues related to global financial governance.

The phone will have a starting price of Rs 5,999 after the scheme expires, the same price tag seen on Xiaomi Redmi 4A.\n\u00a9 Provided by India Today Xiaomi's cheapest phone Redmi 5A launched at Rs 4,999 with 8-day battery life The Redmi devices have already registered over 10 lakh buyers for the device across Flipkart and Xiaomi's official website. The company will also sell the device from brick and mortar stores in the country. The offline retail partners comprise Sangeetha, Poorvika, UniverCell, E-Zone and more.\nThe company has introduced an 8-day battery life with the new Redmi 5A. Xiaomi claims that 3000mAh battery on the Redmi 5A is good for a standby time of 8 days, or 7 hours of video playback. One of the biggest gripe with Xiaomi devices this year has been the hybrid SIM slot. Xiaomi has taken care of it with the Redmi 5A, giving it a dedicated microSD card slot apart from the dualSIM slots.\nAs earlier indications suggested, Xiaomi redmi 5A will be 'Made in India' and will have some changes as compared to the version sold in China. Launched in October earlier this year, the Chinese model of the sports a hybrid SIM tray, where the Redmi 5A will ship with a dual SIM slots and a dedicated microSD card slot. Additionaly, Xiaomi is bringing a 3GB RAM/32GB ROM variant to India which is not available in China.\nProcessor\nThe Redmi 5A is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 quad-core chipset clocked at 1.4GHz. The device comes in two options, one with 2GB RAM, 16GB ROM, and another with 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage. The chipset will also be paired with Adreno 308 GPU.\nSEE: The 100 Coolest Tech Gadgets of 2017\nThe 100 Coolest Tech Gadgets of 2017 (Slideshow provided by Bestproducts.com)\nDesign\nWhen it comes to design, the device looks similar to the previous iteration. However, this time around the company has used a metal body instead of polycarbonate that was used in the Xiaomi Redmi 4A. Similar to other current generation Redmi phones, the antenna-lines have been pushed to the edges of the device, giving it a cleaner look altogether.\nSimilar to the previous iteration Xiaomi Redmi 4A, the company will be skipping on the fingerprint sensor for this budget oriented Redmi 5A.\nCamera\nThe rear camera on the Redmi 5A sports a 13Megapixel module with an aperture of f/2.2. The camera comes with common features like HDR mode, panorama mode and burst mode. For the front camera, Xiaomi used a 5Megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture.\nDisplay\nRedmi 5A features a 5-inch display with a resolution of 1280x720. The IPS LCD panel on the Redmi 5A is a multitouch display with a pixel density of 296ppi.\nConnectivity\nFor connectivity, Xiaomi has placed a dual SIM tray which can either store two SIMs, along with a dedicated slot for a microSD card upto 128GB. The device comes equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1 and GPS with A-GPS, GLONASS, BDS, and a 3.5mm audio jack. The array of sensors on the device include an acccelerometer, a proximity sensor and ambient light sensor.\nThe Xiaomi Redmi 5A will also come with an IR blaster which can turn the device into a universal remote with the Mi Remote app.\nSoftware\nOn the software front, the device will ship with MIUI 9 based on Android Nougat out of the box.\nBattery\nOne of the biggest USP's of the previous Redmi 5A was its lasting battery and this time the company claims to have radically improved on that end. Xiaomi claims that the Redmi 5A can give a battery-life of eight days. Although the device sports a smaller 3000mAh battery, running MIUI9 and Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 helps the Xiaomi Redmi 5A with battery life.\nPrice\nThe Xiaomi Redmi 5A has been launched in Indian with a introductory price of Rs 4,999 for the 2GB/16GB variant, making it the cheapest smartphone Xiaomi markets in India. The offer stands for the first 50 lakh customers only. After the introductory scheme expires, Xiaomi will sell the device at Rs 5,999 for the base variant and Rs 6,999 for the higher 3GB/32GB variant.\nReplay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO (Video provided by NDTV)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBGczQz.img&quot;}}", "http://drop.ndtv.com/mobile/xml/bing/ndtv-latest-videos.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;NDTV&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerUri&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.ndtv.com/&quot;}", "https://www.ndtv.com/&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "flipkart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xiaomi redmi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sangeetha", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "xiaomi redmi 5a", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "univercell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bestproducts.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "redmi 5a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ndtv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gpu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india toda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poorvika", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flipkart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:59.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7819def729116b118a69bfe2171611c241591d4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspa09cPOGnxA4.N6d10rPDETTPZv3N355gx46FGworqHeyIICrmhdztOQS4wW2S9r0y", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/Manhattan-Hoteis.d129440.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Manhattan: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Pod 51:", "title_full": "Pod 51: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-11-28T19:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4eef8e292eb74aacbcc49f3680235018a7f03773", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspa09cPOGnxA4.N6d10rPDETTPZv3N355gx46FGworqHeyIICrmhdztOXIFOb5.6YS1IQ_Xap5Jkd61u1Fb_V2fbk1RP7dfuJVI", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-03T00:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The look and feel of the single bed rooms at the pod 51 are like a university dorm room.

It saw the participating startups get \u20ac15 000 in return for eight percent equity and access to over 100 mentors and free office space. \nThe 10 startups \u2014 from Nigeria, Uganda, South Africa and Zimbabwe \u2014 were: Brownie Points , Brave , Dusu Pay , Fo-Sho , Got Bot , Just Now , Khoyn , Mobicure , Spoon Money , and Virtual Drive . \nGeorge said the 10 had all achieved significant commercial traction, with all the startups currently in discussion around possible seed and angel funding. \nAt the inception of the programme three of the startups were still in the concept stage. Just four were in the post-revenue stage. \n\u201cAll of them are generating revenue and a few have even broken even,\u201d he said. \nYesterday\u2019s demo day, he said, was historical as it marked the first time corporations from around the world have collaborated to work with African startups towards proof of concepts and commercial agreements. Said George: \u201cToday is just the beginning\u201d. \nArticle by Daniel Mpala ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

The main ingredients are the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) at 1.5 billiob CFUs, and 1 milligram of german chamomile extract per 5 drops. The great thing about these drops is that they can be administered orally by the included syringe or you can add it to a bottle of formula or directly during breastfeeding.\n\nAs far as allergies and irritants go, there are no artificial dyes, preservatives (must be used within 60 days of opening sealed bottle), dairy, sugar, lactose, milk, yeast, soy, or gluten, so there won\u2019t be any worries about any sneaky ingredients causing further upset. Being safe for use from birth to 1 year old, that is a lot of fussiness, gas, and digestive upset that can be cured with just 5 drops! I love Culturelle as an adult with digestive issues, and I am eager to see how well they work on our new little one if she needs them once she is here!

\u20ac11,870) on Thursday, surging $2,000 in less than 24 hours \nThe cryptocurrency began the year below $1,000 but continues its sharp rise despite warnings of a dangerous bubble.\n\nBitcoin hit the latest milestone during early trading in Asia, according to the website Coindesk.com.\n\nThe new record high comes just days before the launch of bitcoin futures on two exchanges, including the world's largest futures exchange, CME.\n\nSpread betting firm CMC Markets said the rise had all the symptoms of a bubble market, warning \"there is no way to know when the bubble will burst\".\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nThere are two key traits of Bitcoin: it is digital and it is seen as an alternative currency.\n\nUnlike the notes or coins in your pocket, it largely exists online.\n\nSecondly, Bitcoin is not printed by governments or traditional banks.\n\nA small but growing number of businesses, including Expedia and Microsoft, accept bitcoins - which work like virtual tokens.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of users now buy and sell them as a financial investment. \nThe digital currency's rapid ascent from around $1,000 at the start of the year has put it in the spotlight.\n\nCritics have said Bitcoin is going through a bubble similar to the dotcom boom, whereas others say it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream.\n\nFinancial regulators have taken a range of views on the status of digital currencies and their risks.\n\nThe UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned investors in September they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by firms, known as \"initial coin offerings\".\n\nBut last week a US regulator agreed to let two traditional exchanges, CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, begin trading in Bitcoin-related financial contracts.\n\nThe announcement from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it will allow investors to buy and sell \"future\" contracts in bitcoins - an agreement to buy the crypto-currency, for example, in three months time at a certain price - was seen as a watershed moment for Bitcoin.\n\nCambridge Global Payments director of global product and market strategy Karl Schamotta said that move was behind the latest rally: \"The perception in households around the world that the CME and the CBOE are providing legitimacy to Bitcoin is really what is driving the massive rally here.\"\n\nBut Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, said the rise in Bitcoin's value was \"mostly motivated by fear of missing out and greed\".\n\nBitcoins are created through a complex computer process known as mining, and then monitored by a network of computers across the world.\n\nA steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins are created a day - with about 16.5 million now in circulation from a maximum limit of 21 million.

U.S. health of... \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Different sources of information will give different tips, for instance, the use of essential oils, non-use of the essential oils and so on. As such, it is essential that much thought is directed towards the choice of good Moisturizing skin care products Fl . Knowing what product works best for you will always enable you to achieve the best results on skincare.\n\nIf you need to be moisturized or hydrated, you will need an understanding of your skin type as well as what it requires first. The one you select should be able to meet the requirements of your skin. If the one used does not have positive results or has some negativities, you need to completely avoid it. Skins type determination is an activity that can be done in a simple way while the determination of the best moisturizer will be known before the end of the day.\n\nPeople who suffer dry-skins conditions are usually affected by slight allergic reactions hence are encouraged not to use conventional moisturizers. This owes to the fact that they have chemicals that will damage the delicate surface. Using oil-based moisturizers, on the other hand, for acne-prone skins may be disastrous. Such skincare blunders can, however, be avoided. For individuals with oily skins, lotions remain a preferred option and not creams.\n\nIn fact, those people suffering from dry skin conditions and suffer from allergic problems are advised not to use conventional moisturizers. The main reason as to why this advice is given is because usage of these compounds causes harm to the external surfaces that are fragile due to the chemicals they contain, In addition, when oil-based moisturizers are used on skins with acne conditions may cause some problems. Therefore, these types of mistakes should be avoided. In fact, using lotions over creams is recommended to those people with oily skins. On the other hand, you need to look for formulas that have exfoliating ingredients in them. Such ingredients include lactic and salicylic acid.\n\nSkincare specialists can also give recommendations for people having combinations of dry and oily skins. This is usually a tough task but the products such as lotions that have no acid contents are appropriate. For individuals having normal skins, ointments are usually recommended. Just thin layers of an ointment are applied at night to help to protect against various forces of nature.\n\nThe other essential aspect worth considering when choosing a suitable product for your skincare is the climate in your area of residence. Whether hot, dry, or windy, the climate is usually an essential element considered when selecting moisturizers. Refinements of chilly areas usually need to select ointments. Moisturizers are actually usually absorbed while ointments leave an extra layer of protection. In humid conditions, gels are deemed to be beneficial because they are more hydrating.\n\nIf your skin texture is normal, use of natural ointment is okay. You can apply thin ointments layers during the night in order to eliminate the effects caused by natural forces. You also need to consider factors like climatic condition of the environment you dwell in.\n\nThe marketing of the product can also be looked into. Moisturizing products can be branded as hypoallergenic yet they contain elements that react with the body. The ingredients ought to should be assessed to prevent misuse or waste. Again, consider applying the moisturizers when your are still is wet. Applications carried out after toning will guarantee maximum benefits\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nGet a summary of the factors to consider when buying moisturizing skin care products FL companies sell at http://www.naiwbellc.net/products right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger miller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:01.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f92df3869810f07c012d69cc1c806e1bfadbad7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ2mGGwvCGMRhVEhj2NuDdIs.QzziHsCXHpRVAs9igJ6xlWJ7xUcJzFVAXyBEDJpyIeconUkhUf0S8kK3kAUWEQUPogsNo6U2rxBGIO9F10pUrAr1cZZPf.mq1SbZERVEdiX6aft3TEKrnKrHlN8vk8Rc3qFXL.X8EMS0JFQucId18XwwpEKEzinVAsPWsxGJ1", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Kitchen-Kitchen-Cabinets-Assembled-Kitchen-Cabinets/N-5yc1vZchbp/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Hampton 18x34.5x23 Drawer Base with Ball-Bearing Drawer Glides in Cognac-KDB18-COG", "title_full": "Hampton Bay Hampton Assembled 18x34.5x23 in.

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

time.\n\nHe, however urged pastors to contribute in development of Nigeria\u2019s economy rather than leaving it in the hands of politicians.\n\nHe said \u201cThe context of nigeria, mass needs blew

example, Pastor Adeboye he was in Toronto and had to meet up for a flight in Washington to meet with pastors\n\n\u201cYou can sit in some airport for 16hrs and end up missing meetings.\n\n\u201d I think the issue was blown out of proportion, sometimes we look at need and fail to recognise if it\u2019s a necessity for some people\n\n\u201cWe have not challenged people who are under 45years or those that just finished university that have jets. we wonder when the economy got so good that we have billionaires with over 40 parked jets at Murtala Mohammed Airport.\n\n\u201cCertainly there are issues within the religious bodies, it is very difficult for a nation not to reflect church in it and difficult for church not to reflect nation in it\n\n\u201cHowever it is important for leaders of

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite). Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., meets with reporters after House Republicans held a closed-door strategy session as the deadline looms to pass a spending bill to fund the government by week's end, on Capitol Hill... \nBy ALAN FRAMAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Congress seems set to prevent a weekend government shutdown, but lawmakers and President Donald Trump still have longer-range disputes to settle over spending, immigration and other issues before they can declare budget peace. \nWith many on both sides deciding a headline-grabbing federal closure would be a political blunder - at least for now - the House planned to approve legislation Thursday financing federal agencies through Dec. 22. The Senate seemed ready to follow. Without legislation, many agencies would run out of money after midnight Friday and grind to a close. \nThe two-week spending measure is aimed at giving both parties' bargainers more time to reach longer-term budget decisions. To jumpstart that negotiating, Trump and congressional leaders were meeting Thursday to try reaching agreements. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., prompted the two Democrats to skip a bargaining session that was planned then. \nThis time, the White House smoothed the waters by following up with a more peaceable, written statement. It praised Pelosi and Schumer for choosing to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\" \nLater, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension. It also laid out administration budget goals, saying money for the military including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\" \nFor Republicans, a shutdown would put a humiliating bookend on a year in which they've controlled the White House and Congress with little to show for it. They want the public to focus instead on the GOP's prized $1.5 trillion tax bill, which party leaders hope to send Trump by Christmas. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nEven the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have been threatening to oppose the temporary spending measure, predicted passage. \n\"No one wants a shutdown, including Freedom Caucus members,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters. \nThe roughly 30-member caucus has been trying to win promises from leaders of spending curbs and quick passage of a full-year defense budget in exchange for backing the short-term bill. Without support from many of them, Republicans would need votes from Democrats to push the temporary spending measure through the House. \nWhile many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the short-term bill, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there.

If the EU\u2019s guidelines for phase two talks are not in place, weeks or even months could be lost with no talks on transition. The timetable for a transition deal \u2014 all-important for British businesses \u2014 would slip, with the risk that many firms would trigger contingency plans to move jobs and investment out of the U.K..\nMay has not been idle since Monday\u2019s setback.\nThe British side are sticking to what May said on Monday, one senior official said: \u201cWe will reconvene by the end of the week.\u201d\nAnother U.K. government official who spoke to POLITICO on condition of anonymity said the view in the negotiating team was that the Friday deadline was not set in stone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about political will,\u201d the official said. \u201cIf we came back with a deal on Monday they could do it. The guidelines are practically done anyway. Even if we came back Wednesday it might be possible.\u201d\nPolitical will Privately, U.K. officials believe a special meeting of the General Affairs Council \u2014 foreign affairs or Europe ministers from the EU countries who lay the groundwork for summits of EU leaders \u2014 could even agree the negotiating guidelines a week after the Council, should that be required.\n\u201cEveryone wants progress \u2014 them as much as us. It really is about political will at this stage. That said, we do have to get our own house in order first, that\u2019s true,\u201d the government official said.\nOthers appeared to be taken by surprise by the suggestion that the EU could grant sufficient progress but not proceed to talks about the U.K.\u2019s future relations with the bloc. It would be a \u201cstrange option,\u201d said one government minister.\nMay and Juncker prepare to give a press briefing on December 4 | Olivier Hoslet/EPA\nBernard Jenkin, one of the leading Brexiteers on the Conservative backbenches, branded the apparent deadline an \u201cEU negotiating tactic\u201d and urged May not to be \u201cintimidated.\u201d\nBut Anna Soubry, a Tory MP and one of the most outspoken supporters of a close post-Brexit relationship with the EU, said the urgency of moving to phase two of talks should push May into \u201crubbing out her red lines\u201d and reaching a \u201crealistic deal.\u201d\nSoubry has called for the U.K. to effectively remain in the customs union and the single market \u2014 both of which the government has ruled out.\nA former business minister, Soubry added that British firms were \u201cincreasingly frustrated by the lack of progress\u201d in the talks. Business lobby groups like the CBI and TheCityUK have called for a transition deal to be secured as soon as possible to prevent businesses in the U.K. moving investment and staff across the Channel to guarantee continued single market access.\n\u201cThe Conservatives are the party of business \u2014 time to prove it,\u201d Soubry said.\nMay has not been idle since Monday\u2019s setback. She made two key phone calls Wednesday; one, in the morning, to DUP leader Arlene Foster and another in the afternoon to Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, but with no clear sign of a breakthrough.\nShe told Varadkar her government was \u201cworking hard to find a specific solution to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland that respects the integrity of the U.K., the European Union and the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement.\u201d\nThe split also runs through the Cabinet.\nVaradkar agreed to speak to May again in the coming days, Reuters reported. Earlier in the day he had done little to raise British hopes of a speedy resolution by confirming talks could always be picked up \u201cin the new year.\u201d\nThat prompted anger from the DUP, who blame the hold-up on Dublin. Their deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, said delays to trade talks threatened the Irish economy more than the U.K.\u2019s.\n\u201cMr. Varadkar may try to appear calm on the surface but he is playing a dangerous game \u2014 not with us but with his own economy,\u201d Dodds said, further ramping up his party\u2019s criticism of Varadkar\u2019s government.\nThe home front At home, the simmering tension within May\u2019s Conservative party over the kind of Brexit the U.K. should be pursuing \u2014 soft or hard, close to EU rules or free to strike out alone \u2014 has broken out into open warfare.\nAt Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in the House of Commons, Brexiteers teamed up to turn the screws on May.\nJacob Rees-Mogg asked her to \u201capply a new coat of paint to her red lines\u201d which on Monday had begun to look \u201ca little bit pink.\u201d\nJenkin warned her not to keep the U.K. \u201cshackled\u201d to EU rules for fear of compromising future trade deals with Canada, Japan, the U.S. and Australia. Peter Bone asked quite openly if the government\u2019s planned Brexit, which he had previously endorsed, was \u201cstill on course.\u201d\nDelegates attend the first day of the annual Conservative Party conference on October 1, 2017 in Manchester, England | Carl Court/Getty Images\nMore quietly but no less forcefully, the Conservatives\u2019 soft Brexit faction lobbied the prime minister via a letter, signed by 19 MPs and seen by Buzzfeed , expressing disappointment that \u201cyet again some MPs and others seek to impose their own conditions on these negotiations.\u201d\nThe split also runs through the Cabinet. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, the most prominent figure on the soft Brexit wing, confirmed to MPs on Wednesday that the Cabinet is yet to have a \u201cspecific mandating\u201d discussion on the \u201cend-state\u201d relationship the government is seeking with the EU.\nThat will happen by the end of the year, Downing Street confirmed Wednesday evening, risking a showdown between Hammond and his allies with advocates of a more detached relationship with the EU such as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove.\nWhether it will take place in the happy context of a deal on phase one of the Brexit talks or amid a crisis over no deal being struck depends on the offer that May takes back to Brussels \u2014 and how soon she gets there.\nRelated stories on these topics: Article 50 Brexit British politics Customs Customs Union Negotiations Single Market Ireland Northern Ireland United Kingdom Anna Soubry Bernard Jenkin Boris Johnson Jacob Rees-Mogg Leo Varadkar Michael Gove Philip Hammond Theresa May View Comments Cancel reply Name *\nEmail *\nWebsite\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nPriscilla du Bleu\n\u201cMay has not been idle since Monday\u2019s setback.\u201d\nLOL.

To convince DUB that it is not that bad really to stay aligned with EU? Anybody sees a chance for that?\nKeeping the whole of UK aligned infuriates Brexiteers, that\u2019s about as unlikely.\nWhy does she not simply say: As NI/DUB is not willing to seperate we have no other chance then going for a border, but we will try to keep it as light as possible? That is the only rational possibility I see. Is this politically not possible in UK?\nWith Hammond saying the money has to be paid anyway and the Lords saying that no deal would be economical suicide the position of UK did not get stronger actually (that was obvious for EU all the time, but in UK this might have an political effect how people think about Brexit). So if EU does not go on to phase two the extreme outcome might even be that the whole process of Brexit might come to a halt. Is it that what she wants?\nPosted on 12/7/17 | 8:48 AM CET\ntpk\nWell, after a second thought: if even Brexiteers came to the conclusion that no deal is not a serious possibility and UK desperatly needs a transition than Irland and EU really have huge leverage here. Up to the point to bring Brexit to a grinding halt.\nPosted on 12/7/17 | 9:13 AM CET\nAdalberta Schwanzlutscher\n@Priscilla du Bleu\nYou are German and you hate the UK and love all things German.\nWhy do you remain in the UK?\nWhy don\u2019t you live in Germany ?\nPosted on 12/7/17 | 9:16 AM CET\nFran\u00e7ois P\n@tpk\nIt is not in our long-term interest to overplay our hand.

I am just thinking about the options here.\nBut EU can not really help as long as Mays blocks herself with clinging to the no border.\nAh well, and on the other handside: 50% are against Brexit, the number not completely unlikely to rise and, very important, somewhat like 80% of economy should be against Brexit. So there might be a little contempt for Brussels to not really make it easy on UK.

with significantly lower monomer content | 4-Traders", "text": "Responsible handling of chemical substances has always been necessary for avoiding health risks. This also holds true for isocyanate processing. Covestro is committed to continually improving the performance and safety of its products, and above all, to setting new standards in industrial hygiene. \nThrough continual improvements to the manufacturing process, Covestro has succeeded in reducing the residual monomer content of free monomeric diisocyanates to under 0.1 percent by weight. Products meeting these requirements can be recognized by the addition of 'ultra' to the product designation. In the coming months Covestro wants to offer raw materials for solvent-based and solvent-free products (Desmodur\u00ae ultra) as well as for aqueous coatings and adhesives (Bayhydur\u00ae ultra), thereby replacing a significant proportion of the previous product portfolio. Further products should be added to the ultra line in the near future. \n'With the new ultra products, in combination with the application of the usual safety measures, we are setting new standards for our customers in industrial hygiene,' says Michael Friede, Global Head of the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialties segment at Covestro. 'As a result, the new product line's raw materials match the performance level of our conventional products.' \nAbout Covestro: \nWith 2016 sales of EUR 11.9 billion, Covestro is among the world's largest polymer companies. Business activities are focused on the manufacture of high-tech polymer materials and the development of innovative solutions for products used in many areas of daily life. The main segments served are the automotive, construction, wood processing and furniture, and electrical and electronics industries. Other sectors include sports and leisure, cosmetics, health and the chemical industry itself. Covestro has 30 production sites worldwide and employs approximately 15,600 people (calculated as full-time equivalents) at the end of 2016. \nFind more information at www.covestro.com . \nFollow us on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CovestroGroup \nForward-looking statements \nThis news release may contain forward-looking statements based on current assumptions and forecasts made by Covestro AG.

It meets passengers at the final station and delivers them back to their regular stop for the relatively small fee \u2013 when compared to a hotel room \u2013 of 880 yen (7.85 USD). \nThe rescue bus was the idea of a Nishi Tokyo Bus driver who pitched it to the company four years ago and they have been offering the service ever since. During the 2016 holiday season alone 75 passengers utilized the rescue bus, including 32 on the busiest night. This year, the rescue bus will operate every Friday evening throughout the month of December, as that is when the majority of company end-of-the-year drinking parties (called \u201cbonenkai\u201d in Japanese) take place. Photo: Nishi Tokyo Bus Company \nNesugoshi Kyusai is limited to the Chuo-line, which connects central Tokyo with the capital\u2019s western outskirts. Takao Station, the final stop on the line, is located in the foothills of a mountainous region, 30 miles from downtown Tokyo, that lacks affordable hotels or 24-hour restaurants where stranded passengers might find shelter, hence the need for such a service. \nThe bus will be waiting at the Takao station at 12:55 am for the arrival of the last express train on the nights of December 9, 16, and 23. Then from 1:05 am it will work its way back to Hachioji Station, dropping passengers at their respective stops along the way. Hachioji, the final stop, is located quite far from downtown Tokyo, but it does offer plenty of services such as hotels for passengers who are still unable to make their way home. Photo: Nishi Tokyo Bus Company \nPassengers have widely lauded the rescue bus, and many have expressed a wish for other lines to follow suit and incorporate rescue buses into their regular holiday services.

You want hogs to enter the trap slowly rather than rush to the back for bait. That way there is the opportunity for multiple hogs to be in when the doors close. At least one study by Texas A&M indicated that, once hogs are in a trap very few more push in and often some escape as others try to enter.
