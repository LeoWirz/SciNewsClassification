The U.S. currency slipped against the safe-haven Japanese yen on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel - a move that imperiled Middle East peace efforts and provoked widespread condemnation.\nBut amidst a broader climb in global stocks on Thursday, the greenback rose 0.3 percent against the yen to trade at 112.60 yen, and hit a two-week high against a basket of peers.\nThe MSCI World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent. \nUnderpinning some of the dollar's gains analysts said was some cautious optimism on progress over U.S. tax reforms.\nU.S. Senate Republicans agreed to talks with the House of Representatives on sweeping tax legislation on Wednesday, amid early signs that lawmakers could bridge their differences and agree on a final bill ahead of a self-imposed Dec. 22 deadline.\n\"The dollar is fighting back a little bit but there\u2019s still some caution, as it could still be a few weeks until we know the outcome of the tax reform bill,\" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley, in London.\n\"The yen will be sensitive if geopolitical tensions rise again, and I think there\u2019s an inevitability to that, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be too much upside for dollar/yen in this environment,\" she added.\nUpbeat U.S. private-sector employment data released on Wednesday also provided some support to the dollar. But strategists said the currency would trade in narrow ranges until the release of the closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday.\nBitcoin soared to a record high of more than $14,500, up almost 7 percent on the day and continuing a staggering surge from less than $1,000 at the beginning of the year.\n\nSTOCKS RECOVER\nEuropean stock markets appeared to take their cues from a general recovery in tech stocks overnight in Asia and Wall Street. \nThe pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.2 percent with tech stocks initially up 0.5 percent. Financials, industrials and healthcare shares also added points to the index.\n\"We have seen some aggressive moves in Asia, whereas Europe seems to be a bit more subdued,\" said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets in London.\n\"It's almost like European markets look for an excuse to selloff but it takes them a lot to be convinced to actually push higher.\"\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets\nShares in the energy sector, which weighed on shares earlier in Wall Street and Asia, rose in Europe, as oil prices recovered from a big fall on Wednesday. [O/R]\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded at $56.13 per barrel in European trade, up 0.3 percent on the day.\nBrent futures gained 0.4 percent to $61.45 per barrel.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.2 percent as some technology bellwethers rebounded, with Tencent rising over 3 percent and Alibaba more than 2 percent. \nIn Japan, the Nikkei jumped 1.5 percent, recouping much of its 2.0 percent loss the previous day, which was its biggest fall since late March.\nThe price of copper, seen as a barometer of global economic health because of its extensive industrial use, also fell sharply earlier this week, raising worries about the world growth outlook.\nCopper traded at $6,576 a tonne, up 0.5 percent on the day and above a two-month low of $6,507.5 touched on Tuesday. \n\n\n(Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Jemima Kelly in London)\nBy Ritvik Carvalho", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david madden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ritvik carvalho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jemima kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jane foley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tencent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabobank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cmc markets", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia-pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:21.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f28e0e11148bd1241121472e5f63d6e31d2cb136", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pF3cLPtz3dd5TMUha8HPcZGmTQp7ka7UR", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/jp/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/jp/ - Otaku Culture - 4chan", "title": "Touhou Gameplay Thread", "title_full": "/jp/ - Touhou Gameplay Thread - Otaku Culture - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T00:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2271c01d176d41e20304d8af44ba8a8d5fccdfd4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pF3cLPtz3dd5TMUha8HPcZO_9fZrMJdBPp1GBbJVaPfc-", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>18000923\nthanks m8.

Painful sex (dyspareunia), problems with libido, physical changes such as menopause can all impact on your sex life and your relationship. Consider having an open discussion with your partner and/or a health professional about how you feel. If you've been avoiding sex this can be especially difficult. But if you do find support, it can build intimacy and help you to manage your sexual relationship more honestly. The good news is there are strategies to help you. \nRelationships & painful sex Feeling stressed, self-conscious about your body, depressed or anxious about intimacy can make sex uncomfortable, and even painful. Sometimes dyspareunia (painful sex) begins as a physical problem, but then has a flow-on effect to your psychological wellbeing and relationships, causing stress and anxiety. A vicious cycle can develop where past experiences of painful sex cause anticipatory fear of more pain. This fear creates stress, tension and reduces libido and arousal and as a result, sex becomes painful. For some women their past experiences may include sexual or emotional abuse, which can a be a trigger for experiencing painful sex, even in good relationships with an understanding partner. \nFor women approaching menopause who are experiencing sexual problems in a relationship, it is helpful to sort out how much is due to the physical symptoms of menopause rather than other sexual issues. It can be difficult to know if menopause influences your relationship with your partner, or if the relationship you have with your partner influences your experience of menopause. There are many ways two people can be sexual, or sensual, with each other that do not involve vaginal penetrative sex. Think of all the things you did before you had sex for the first time. We sometimes call this 'outercourse', and refers to kissing, hugging, fondling, touching etc. Treatment The right treatment depends on the cause of the pain, but almost all treatment options will include a combination of individual and couples sexual and relationship counselling. If you are in a relationship, encourage your partner to be involved in your treatment, particularly the counselling sessions. Women and their partners often experience feelings of rejection, confusion, helplessness and frustration and the sooner these feelings are discussed the better the outcome for all concerned. It can also help if both partners read relevant books and seek out other resources together. It's okay (and a good idea!) to have some fun with sexual exploration. Sometimes couples get into a 'routine' for sex that's no longer working for one or both partners. Self-help books can be easily bought over the internet, so there's no need to be shy. For single women, dyspareunia can prevent them from approaching partners or entering new relationships. Talking to a health care professional about your feelings can help to stop the negative pain cycle. Relationships & libido It is quite common for women to experience a decline in spontaneous sexual desire with age, or when you have been in a long-term relationship. Chronic low libido can sneak up on you. Initially, you may feel like it's just another dip in your sexual interest and manage it the way you have in the past; explaining it away as a normal response to the stresses of life. But, if low libido has been happening for a long time and it is distressing, or causing relationship disharmony, you should examine your real reasons for not wanting to have sex. Is it about short-term or recent events, or is it beginning to look like a way of life? Is it a way of life you want or is it distressing you? How does it impact on your partner? For couples, differences in sexual desire can create significant problems. A pattern of avoidance and resentment can build up especially if sex is initiated by one partner and refused by the other over and over again. The partner with lower libido may feel bothered by sexual overtures and the partner with higher libido may feel frustrated, rejected and unloved. Some couples stop being affectionate and loving with each other and negative feelings become more and more overwhelming. These difficult feelings, if not talked through, can impact negatively on the relationship. What can you do about desire discrepancy? Solving the problem of desire difference in a relationship can be challenging. There is no magic wand (or pill, potion or cream) that will create sexual desire. And it's not about just having sex whenever your partner wants. The exercises below assume you have the building blocks of a workable relationship and the ability to work together on this issue. There are many things that may turn someone off sex. It's not possible to discuss them all on a webpage. It is important to understand that if there is conflict or abuse in your relationship; it may not be possible to solve a sexual problem. Sometimes a sexual problem is a symptom of an unhealthy relationship. Good sex can give a well-grounded relationship a really positive boost, but it won't solve serious relationship problems. Relationship counselling might be an important first step in building trust and communication before working on a sexual problem. More complicated personal reasons can also underlie low libido, so seek counselling if you think this is the case. WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT SEX FOR YOU? Make a list of all the things that are: enjoyable positive beneficial worthwhile about sex for you For example: I enjoy the feeling of sexual arousal I like the touching, the feel of my partner's skin next to mine I sleep well afterwards I enjoy seeing my partner experience pleasure My partner and I feel closer emotionally Anything at all that's good about sex needs to go on the list. Don't worry about any bad things that counter the positives at this point. They will go into their own list and be dealt with separately. This list of good things about sex is part of your motivation for having sex. If you have good reasons for having sex, you can use these reasons to examine and influence sexual desire, and sometimes have 'decision driven' sex, rather than 'desire driven' sex. \nWHAT REDUCES YOUR INTEREST IN SEX? Think about all your reasons for not wanting to have sex and write them down too. You don't need to show anyone your list so be honest (with yourself). For example: I am too tired (a common reason) I am too stressed (also common) I am bored with our routine Sex is painful I don't get aroused like I used to It is not very pleasurable I feel self-conscious about my body I can never orgasm My partner needs to attend to personal hygiene Try to be explicit about what it is that's putting you off so you have something to work with. If your reasons don't seem very concrete think about the feelings you have during sex or when your partner approaches you sexually.  Do you feel: pressured guilty manipulated grief shame embarrassment Feelings like this will be off-putting, so recognising and understanding them is a first step towards getting them out of the bedroom. \nSTRESS Stress is part of life. It may be related to day-to-day 'busyness' with too much to do, and never enough time.  Or it may be a more serious and recent event such as job loss, illness or death of a loved one. It is not always reasonable for some people to feel like having sex around the time of serious stress.  But if normal day-to-day stress is getting on top of you, it's probably worth considering some strategies that might help you get on top of it. Some people want more sex at difficult or sad times; to help them relax, as a comfort or a distraction, or to feel alive and joyful. Everyone is different, especially when it comes to sex. Think about the sort of things that make you feel tense or stressed and not sexual: Are they things that are going to go away? What can you do to change them? Are they serious crises? Are they part of your life that you can't or don't want to change? How can your partner help to change them? Can you make a decision to give yourself some time each day where you will make the effort to relax and not focus on the stressful things? Letting go of stress may not be easy, but if you can find a way to relax, it may give you the energy and the focus you need to enjoy life and maybe sex as well. \nPAIN DURING SEX Physical pain is a good reason not to desire sex.  If you anticipate pain during sex, you will be anxious and this will reduce libido and arousal. Talk about the pain with your partner so they know how you are feeling. You should not experience pain during sex so don't ignore it if you do.  See our webpages on  painful sex  for more information. Talking with your partner Frightening as it can seem, consider having an open discussion with your partner about how you feel. If you've been avoiding sex this can be especially difficult. But if you do it well, it will build intimacy and help you to manage your sexual relationship more honestly. Be kind This is a sensitive issue to discuss for both of you, acknowledge that at the start of the conversation Avoid saying anything hurtful or making accusations Frame the discussion positively, for example: 'I really like it when you\u2026.' Instead of 'I hate it when you\u2026.' And 'Could we try this instead of that'. Be aware your partner may not have thought about this the way you have and may be surprised or react defensively Try to take responsibility for your part of the relationship (be honest about your reactions and responses \u2013 how would you feel in your partner's shoes?) Remain focused on solutions Choose your time Talk when you have the privacy, the time and the energy (don't just surprise your partner with a conversation like this at the end of a long day) Talk when you are feeling positive about making changes Listen Find out what it's like for your partner when you refuse sex How can you do it better without it feeling like a rejection? Be positive & stay focused on solutions If tiredness is overwhelming, can you schedule a time for sex? It may not seem romantic, but not being tired or pressed for time might be more practical. Sometimes this means a change in routines, or getting a baby-sitter, or keeping the bedroom door closed so that small children can't just wander in. If sex is painful \u2013 can you talk with your doctor together about possible reasons? Would you benefit from local oestrogen replacement? Are you aroused enough or could you: spend more time on foreplay try some new strategies read some erotic literature, or watch an erotic film together explore other sexual activities besides intercourse (massage is a good place to start) buy some new lingerie, light a few candles, add some soft music use a vibrator together (sex-toys can be bought online) try a lubricant (this can be bought in the supermarket) Be conscious of both your limitations Don't expect miracles \u2013 the discussion may not go exactly how you hope If your partner isn't a big talker you may need to use actions to get things to change \u2013 for example, show them how you would like to be touched, gently guide their hand to where you want to it to be Challenge your own shyness if it's holding you back Feeling uncomfortable initiating new sexual practices is not unusual, but may be worth it in the long-term The aim of this exercise is not to have you swinging from the chandelier every night of the week. It's to enhance honesty, intimacy, fun and pleasure in your relationship and hopefully help you manage differences in sexual desire instead of using excuses to avoid the issue. It's also not to encourage you to have sex when you don't want to. Use it as a pathway to understanding each other and finding a middle ground that is more satisfying to both of you. Don't forget that it will take ongoing commitment and revisiting the discussion to keep it working in the long-term.  And if you get stuck, talk to a trained sex therapist.

He always does that.\" \nIbrahimovic was able to back up his bold comments off the field with eye-catching performances on it in 2016-17. \nHe helped United to get back on the trophy trail with winning goals in the Community Shield and EFL Cup final, while also putting them on the path to Europa League glory. \nHis debut campaign at Old Trafford had delivered 28 goals by the time he picked up an untimely knee injury in April which forced him under the knife. \nHaving worked his way back from that ailment, Ibrahimovic has been handed another short-term deal by Mourinho.

Though every person is entitled to enjoy his/her individuality, he /she also has to be constantly sensitive to other people\u2019s equal sentiments,\u201d said the Archbishop. \n\u201cWe note in particular that there are some worrisome trends in our democratization and emancipation that push for a worldview independent and sidelining God, and making human being dependent on their own intellect, determining for themselves what is right and what is wrong. We are saddened to read that religion should not regulate morals,\u201d he said. \nAccording to Archbishop Msusa, the recent campaign calling for implementation of abortion law is contrary to the principle of human dignity and sacredness of life. He also called upon the church to preach against the bill because it is against Christian teachings. \n\u201cWe believe that life begins at conception; sacredness and sanctity of human life; both the mother and unborn child have the right to life and that all instances of direct abortions are violations of the rights of the unborn because it is a wilful killing of innocent life,\u201d he said. \nThey assured that the church would continue working on their mission and mandate to protect and defend life. \nThe Archbishop was speaking during World Congress of Families for African Regional Conference in Lilongwe held last week. \nThe conference brought together delegates from all over Africa and the United States of America to discuss the African Family and Cultural Colonisation.

Some of those situations and relationships never really got closure to them, therefore bringing remembrance and reflection can ignite new life to those flames of compromise. We don\u2019t want to do that because some of us have a difficult time reflecting and then returning to that lifestyle. Why? Because without having closure to that past life, we\u2019ll want, even desire, to keep it alive and make a possible return at any time. Not a good idea to even give it a thought. While in our recovery, if we have any thoughts, desires or passions of returning to that life we need to bring them to light-expose them for what they really are and that\u2019s a hindrance to our recovery. We should want to expose them, denounce those past relationships and situations of the past and not give them life ever! If we truly want freedom from our past, and want to move forward in regaining trust in our marriages and relationships we ought to want to bring those thoughts, those desires and situation captive as the Word of God instructs us to do ( 2 Cor. 10:5 ). These reflections can hinder every effort we\u2019re making toward wholeness and purity in Christ. Our wives, our new relationships we are re-establishing deserves renewed thinking and transformed hearts ( Romans 12:1, 2 ) as a new foundation of trust with us. Get with your accountability partner, your Christian counselor, or even your wife if you have progressed that far enough in your recovery to share those thoughts and reflections and let it out, bring light to it all. It brings a true sense of freedom and comfort when we\u2019re open and honest about it, and it really shows our heart\u2019s desire to move forward in to being trusted in every area of our lives.

They originally got community service or suspended sentences but those were upgraded after the justice secretary asked for a sentencing review, a move that raised fears the city\u2019s independent judiciary was being undermined. \nWong was bailed when he received permission to appeal, which will be heard in January. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Bridge Constructor with portals? Either way you look at it, Bridge Constructor: Portal sounds like a recipe for good times. A mashup of ClockStone Software\u2019s popular construction puzzler and Valve\u2019s timeless classic may sound like a bridge too far, but any opportunity to step back into Aperture Laboratories\u2019 test chambers sounds good to me. \nAs the name suggests, Bridge Constructor: Portal takes the bridge construction formula and throws in Portal\u2019s blue/orange teleport technology and instantly recognisable minimalist aesthetic. I probably don\u2019t have to explain how it\u2019s going to work, do I? It\u2019s Portal, but with vehicular test subjects, so you\u2019re building bridges and popping through space holes to get from A to B. \nNo, it\u2019s clearly not the new Portal game fans would have been waiting for, but I guess it will have to do. I\u2019m just looking forward to being reunited with the chronically sardonic GLaDOS, she tends to steal the show whenever she\u2019s around.

configure the Google Invisible reCAPTCHA widget, but there is always an issue with the latest Firefox browser, detailed as follows:\nadd the plugin to a web page, which has other JS such as a dropdown menu load the web page keep loading the web page over and over, in an attempt to catch it 'half loaded' eventually you will see for a split second an alert \"The page at https://www.google.com says: Cannot contact reCAPTCHA.

The U.S. currency slipped against the safe-haven Japanese yen on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel - a move that imperiled Middle East peace efforts and provoked widespread condemnation.\nBut amidst a broader climb in global stocks on Thursday, the greenback rose 0.3 percent against the yen to trade at 112.60 yen <=JPY>, and hit a two-week high against a basket of peers. <.DXY>\nThe MSCI World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent. \nUnderpinning some of the dollar's gains analysts said was some cautious optimism on progress over U.S. tax reforms.\nU.S. Senate Republicans agreed to talks with the House of Representatives on sweeping tax legislation on Wednesday, amid early signs that lawmakers could bridge their differences and agree on a final bill ahead of a self-imposed Dec. 22 deadline.\n\"The dollar is fighting back a little bit but there\u2019s still some caution, as it could still be a few weeks until we know the outcome of the tax reform bill,\" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley, in London.\n\"The yen will be sensitive if geopolitical tensions rise again, and I think there\u2019s an inevitability to that, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be too much updside for dollar/yen in this environment,\" she added.\nUpbeat U.S. private-sector employment data released on Wednesday also provided some support to the dollar. But strategists said the currency would trade in narrow ranges until the release of the closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday.\nBitcoin soared to a record high of more than $14,500, up almost 7 percent on the day and continuing a staggering surge from less than $1,000 at the beginning of the year.\n\nSTOCKS RECOVER\nEuropean stock markets appeared to take their cues from a general recovery in tech stocks overnight in Asia and Wall Street. \nThe pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> was up 0.2 percent with tech stocks <.SX8P> initially up 0.5 percent. Financials, industrials and healthcare shares also added points to the index.\n\"We have seen some aggressive moves in Asia, whereas Europe seems to be a bit more subdued,\" said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets in London.\n\"It's almost like European markets look for an excuse to selloff but it takes them a lot to be convinced to actually push higher.\"\nShares in the energy sector, which weighed on shares earlier in Wall Street and Asia, rose in Europe, as oil prices recovered from a big fall on Wednesday. [O/R]\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures <CLc1> traded at $56.13 per barrel in European trade, up 0.3 percent on the day.\nBrent futures <LCOc1> gained 0.4 percent to $61.45 per barrel.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> edged up 0.2 percent as some technology bellwethers rebounded, with Tencent rising over 3 percent and Alibaba <BABA.K> more than 2 percent. \nIn Japan, the Nikkei <.N225> jumped 1.5 percent, recouping much of its 2.0 percent loss the previous day, which was its biggest fall since late March.\nThe price of copper, seen as a barometer of global economic health because of its extensive industrial use, also fell sharply earlier this week, raising worries about the world growth outlook.\nCopper <CMCU3> traded at $6,576 a tonne, up 0.5 percent on the day and above a two-month low of $6,507.5 touched on Tuesday. \n\n\n(Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Jemima Kelly in London)\nBy
