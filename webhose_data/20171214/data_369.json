We will be ready again on Sunday and if the crowd are ready to help us, it would be nice again.\u201d \nA brace from Coutinho, the first a penalty, and an opportunistic Firmino strike put Liverpool 3-0 up inside 18 minutes and they turned the screw after half-time. \nMane and Coutinho struck in quick succession, the latter completing his first Liverpool hat-trick, before further neatly worked goals from Mane and Salah took the team\u2019s goal tally to 32 in nine matches. \nKlopp could not disguise the extent to which he had enjoyed watching his team, saying they had scored \u201cfantastic goals, unbelievably nice goals\u201d, but there was an accompanying note of caution. \n\u201cWe should not think it will be like this from now on until the end of our entire lives,\u201d he said. \nEmre Can received a booking that rules him out of the first leg of Liverpool\u2019s last-16 tie and Klopp admitted an injury that forced left-back Alberto Moreno to limp off in tears had further dampened the mood. \n\u201cWe come to the little shadow tonight that Alberto Moreno needed to get substituted,\u201d said Klopp. \n\u201cIt was a strange situation. He\u2019s a tough guy and if he cannot continue the game, then we should consider it could be something serious. \n\u201cIn the treatment room he was a little bit more positive, so maybe we are lucky and it\u2019s not too serious.\u201d \n\u2013\u2018Learn a lesson\u2019\u2013 \nAs group winners, Liverpool should theoretically receive a kinder draw in the last 16, but with Bayern Munich, Juventus and Real Madrid among their potential opponents, Klopp does not expect any favours. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s really strange this year in the group phase,\u201d said the German after Liverpool ended a nine-year wait to reach the knockout phase. \n\u201cIn the last 16 of the Champions League, they\u2019re always strong sides, but this year it\u2019s quite special. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can often face Bayern Munich and Real Madrid and Juventus in the last 16 if you win the group. And all the others. That\u2019s quite interesting. \n\u201c(Chelsea manager) Antonio Conte said it yesterday: there are no easy opponents. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody will be happy when they get us in the draw, so we will not be happy when we see who we will face in the next round. But we will be ready, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d \nSpartak coach Massimo Carrera, whose team dropped into the Europa League, issued a scathing verdict on his side\u2019s performance, saying his players had \u201calmost played like they were afraid\u201d. \nBut he said playing in the Champions League had been a broadly positive experience. \n\u201cIf we forget today\u2019s result, our campaign went pretty well,\u201d said the Italian, whose team face city rivals CSKA Moscow this weekend. \n\u201cWe knew it would be a good result to go through to the Europa League and we achieved it. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll try to forget this game for now, but we\u2019ll try to learn a lesson from it.\u201d \nAFP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jurgen klopp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "philippe coutinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emre can", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massimo carrera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roberto firmino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio conte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamed salah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coutinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sadio mane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "klopp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberto moreno", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "klopp calls for liverpool focus after euro spree klopp calls for liverpool focus after euro spree  liverpool", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "spartak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham hotspur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "real madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juventus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sevilla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bayern munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europa league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "everton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spartak moscow", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "spartak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maribor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:22.034+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51a4f6f615d75d2660bf943698d648e025c1c191", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacIyipa9mApekC3z8BCRVnyBi2Iys8OiVVWJbHXqgiXVQ_603HWekEJhD.MY_4k3eG", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/culture", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Culture - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "Saudi Arabia Housemaid Employment Visa", "title_full": "Saudi Arabia Housemaid Employment Visa - Culture - Nigeria", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "74b9a1c92a66a9b15566f3bd4283499534ec4c2f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacIyipa9mApekC3z8BCRVnyBi2Iys8OiVVWJbHXqgiXVQ_603HWekEJgJWsW_b.gj8ELU50W.5_Ifl6kKOMFen3A--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "adontcare", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Slave trade", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:22.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "742a05a12b4cf26d2242ac5069957b1aeea392b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIJjsdZnWKQNLZ1P7SbggTkXLLNIGAVBHR_O2veEtn8KDQSkL7.rG8yU7slwI2ghSkt22eXezqk5boMrQ7HbvbSKHNigqOljtwQWNq9OsP0DOArxUZSjth1ZWvX0K6TH1HrN2nApvjmpa6UW4VQL7mMeHncXZhu5Y-", "site_full": "www.insidehighered.com", "site": "insidehighered.com", "site_section": "http://www.insidehighered.com/rss/feed/ihe", "site_categories": ["graduate_school", "job_search", "education", "jobs", "career_planning"], "section_title": "Inside Higher Ed", "title": "Texting Teens?

Proceed with Caution", "text": "Let\u2019s be clear: just because the average teen texts dozens of times a day doesn\u2019t mean they want to get texts from you \u2014or the college or university you work for. \nOf course, teens spend a lot of time texting each other. You can\u2019t speak to a teen these days without hearing the dings or buzzes that signal the arrival of an incoming text. And the more popular the teen, the more dinging and buzzing there is as members of her friend network reach out through a channel and a device that teens consider to be very personal. \nSome of these exchanges are private \u2014 a teen sharing intimate thoughts with a close friend. Others involve groups of friends conducting a conversation around social plans or other topics. But one of the most important attributes of texting (and apps like WhatsApp) is that teens can curate exactly who is involved in these conversations and exclude people who don\u2019t belong. \nIn her (excellent) book about teens and social media, It\u2019s Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens, danah boyd wrote, \u201cTeens have many words for the kinds of everyday surveillance that they have grown accustomed to: lurking, listening in, hovering, and being \u2018in my business.' Many of the privacy strategies that teens implement are intended to counter the power dynamic that emerges when parents and other adults feel as though they have the right to watch and listen.\u201d \nRemember that this generation of teens watched older brothers, sisters, and friends get busted by parents, teachers, law enforcement, and college admission officers for oversharing on social networks. They\u2019re not about to make the same mistake, if they can help it. They don\u2019t want adults creeping on their Facebook feeds, and they\u2019re careful about what they post \u2014 if they post at all. And while they will text with adults, it\u2019s usually with adults with whom they have a relationship. \nGiven this context, it\u2019s a good thing that colleges are cautious about texting teen prospects and applicants rather than just texting away. Responsible consultants like Mongoose advocate a strategic approach to texting \u2014 including a holistic, campus-wide policy to avoid spamming. \nWhat teens say about texting today \nWe\u2019ve surveyed teen college prospects about texting twice in the past three years, both in research with Chegg in 2015 and with The National Research Center for College & University Admissions (NRCCUA\u00ae) this year. As part of our \u201cMythbusting\u201d series, we fielded similar questionnaires with teens and college marketing and admission professionals to identify overlaps and gaps in the responses of these two groups. \nIn 2015, responses were about evenly split between teens who wanted texts \u201coften\u201d and \u201csometimes\u201d and those who wanted them \u201crarely\u201d or \u201cnone.\u201d At that time, only nine percent of respondents said they wanted to be contacted by a college via text message, and only 14 percent said they had texted with a college representative. \nIn this year\u2019s survey, which explores a range of tactics higher ed uses in marketing to teen applicants, we revisited the topic. [We\u2019ll release a white paper about this research in January.] \nWe learned from teens that 82 percent had not received a text message from a college. We asked those who had what impact it had on their perception of that college; a third (33 percent) told us that it had no impact; and 56 percent said it had a positive impact. \nNot only can the right kind of text make a good impression, teens say they\u2019d welcome certain kinds of text messages. Asked what kinds of information they would like to receive from a college via text message: 79 percent wanted application reminders 71 percent wanted info on admission-related campus events 64 percent said they\u2019d like reminders about financial aid. \nAnd, we note that a majority (55 percent) of teens, when asked how they\u2019d like to be contacted by current students or admissions officers, said they\u2019d like to be texted. \nSo our findings indicate that teens in 2017 may be more open to receiving and exchanging texts with college representatives than those who responded to our surveys a few years ago. \nStill, colleges take note: caution should still prevail. \nTeens want useful texts, not spam. And they don\u2019t want random college representatives cold-texting them. If they indicate they\u2019re open to communicating with via text messaging, text them.

\nREPRESENTATIVES of people in north Wiltshire have hit out at the Government, accusing it of \u2018punishing\u2019 the county\u2019s residents for the services they pay for. \nAccording to research conducted by the County Councils Network (CCN), people in rural counties such as Wiltshire are receiving almost 50 per cent less funding for their public services compared with their neighbours in England\u2019s largest cities. \nIn Wiltshire, the average government funding per person for services such as buses, pothole repairs, bin collections and adult and children\u2019s social services is just \u00a3555, compared with nearly \u00a31,200 per person in central London. \nMalmesbury\u2019s county councillor, Gavin Grant, is asking why the county is getting such a raw deal and has called on the Government to redress the balance, saying residents in the town are \u2018being punished\u2019. \n\u201cWe get just \u00a3555 per person for much-needed public services, less than half that of parts of London,\u201d he said. \n\u201cNext year our county has a \u00a325 million \u2018black hole\u2019 funding crisis so more services will be cut, vital jobs lost and another year of pay rises below price rises for the people that are providing those services in the NHS, schools, emergency services and social care. \n\"Wiltshire residents are being punished by this government, this must change.\u201d \nLast month, leaders of England\u2019s largest rural councils gathered at the annual conference of the CCN, which represents 26 million people across all 27 county councils and 10 unitary authorities in England. \nThey demanded a new deal for rural residents and threatened to cut frontline public services, saying there is a \u00a32.54 billion \u2018funding black hole\u2019 over the next four years. \nCouncillor Paul Carter, chairman of the CCN, told delegates at the meeting: \u201cOur services are threatened and under pressure like never before. \n\u201cUnless these inequalities are addressed, many of the highly valued services to our public will diminish or disappear.\u201d \nPhilip Whitehead, Wiltshire Council cabinet member for finance, demanded more for Wiltshire: \u201cWe work hard to secure the best possible deal for our residents, however because we are a rural county with low unemployment and fewer areas of deprivation, we receive less funding from central government. \n\u201cThrough constantly innovating Wiltshire Council continues to perform extremely highly, our schools are excellent, we have kept all of our libraries open, continued to roll out a community hub programme and invested more in a sustained roads maintenance programme than ever before. \n\u201cWe believe Wiltshire would benefit from economic independence by getting a defined percentage of business rates collected in the county. \n\"Also, if all authorities were single tier like Wiltshire Council, it is estimated \u00a331 billion could be saved over five years \u2013 additional funding which could then be distributed between all local authorities.\u201d \nA spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear that as part of our forthcoming Fair Funding Review we want to make sure councils, including those serving rural communities that face particular challenges, are funded taking into account their local needs and circumstances. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll be setting out more details on this review in due course.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

Shashi Tyagi, the Secretary of Gramin Vikas Vigyan Samiti in Rajasthan received the Jamnalal Bajaj Award for Outstanding Contribution to Constructive Work at the Jamnalal Bajaj Awards 2017. \nAn educationist and dedicated social worker, her journey in this field started in 1980, when she, along with her husband, the late Mr L. Tyagi shifted to Jodhpur. The couple founded the Gramin Vikas Vigyan Samiti (GRAVIS) in 1983 in Gagadi village, Jodhpur, to work on issues such as substance abuse, caste and gender discrimination, purdah system, illiteracy, water scarcity, affecting the people of the region. Today, GRAVIS works in the northwest region of Rajasthan across six districts, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Nagaur, Jaipur and Barmer, covering around 1200 villages and serving about 1.2 million people. \nGRAVIS works with vulnerable and needy groups, to develop self-reliance in rural communities. Blending traditional wisdom with modern sciences, it encourages community involvement and sustainable practices. \nSome of its areas of work include \u2014 \nVillage Development Committees: GRAVIS has helped the formation of community-based organisations called Village Development Committees (VDCs). Smt. Tyagi and her GRAVIS team guide and facilitate the VDCs to address pertinent issues, ensure people\u2019s participation and implement developmental programs initiated by her as well as those introduced under government schemes. \nWatershed development and management: GRAVIS uses both traditional as well as modern scientific methods for conserving and storing rainwater. The traditional ones are Khadin (bund construction), Taanka (rainwater harvested for drinking water), Naadi (village pond) and Beri (percolation well). The construction of khadins has resulted in soil moisture retention and a two-fold increase in crop yield. \nAccess to drinking water: The problem of access to drinking water in the desert region was adversely affecting the lives of the women and young girls. GRAVIS initiated construction of taanka for each house, and this meets the requirements of a family\u2019s water supply for 6-9 months; the families rely on wells or naadis (village ponds) for the remaining months. This initiative has helped in reducing the drudgery of the women and girls could go to school.

My next shot at the Ph.D. (yes, I\u2019ve started it twice) had to take on a radically different character. \nAnd, in fact, in my second attempt as a humanist professional -- a breed that intentionally or by necessity is preparing for employment outside the academy -- I was lucky to have the support of a group of forward-thinking professors from the Alexander Grass Humanities Institute at Johns Hopkins University. I remember it clearly: over coffee at an off-campus spot, the institute\u2019s director, William Egginton, and I discussed how earning a Ph.D. was in no way a nonrefundable ticket to solitary research. \u201cWe see literature more as life,\u201d he told me. \nIt is thanks to professors like him that by now, in the fourth year of my program, I have been able to take roughly half of my course work in a separate division at the university, giving me a valuable subspecialty in foreign affairs that I have leveraged in the professional world. American Foreign Policy Since World War II, International Law, Theories of International Relations -- these are but a few of the courses I have completed at the School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. \nThis cross-disciplinary approach has helped me land three internships to which I will soon add a fourth, as well as a conditional offer of employment, while enriching my research in ways I would have never thought possible had I not been exposed to those different modes of thinking. Like my professors, I have seen the humanities at work in various professional settings where doctoral training is an asset, not a liability. \nNevertheless, it has not been a smooth road. I came into my program knowing exactly what kind of professional outcome I wanted because I had learned the hard way. And I knew that institutionally, humanities departments as a whole have not often been wired for evolving market demands. \nSo I took ownership of the process. First, I chose the right advisers: people who get along with and support each other in a collegial, down-to-earth way. Let\u2019s not forget that one of the main causes of psychiatric conditions like depression in Ph.D. students (one in three are at risk) is bullying supervisors. \nSecond, I thought of a plan by asking myself some basic questions: How could I develop my research in such a way that it created dialogue with the discipline most immediately connected to my target sector of foreign affairs? How could I achieve this without sacrificing the vital humanistic inquiry and analysis we are accustomed to? After all, the humanities are present all throughout society; they are, in many ways, a highly transcendental discipline. Or as Charles Hill, a Yale University professor and former diplomat, so aptly said in his Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs address , the humanities have the capacity to be \u201cpredisciplinary.\u201d That is, they are the wheel within which all the other domains of knowledge are contained. \nIt\u2019s important for those of us who are in Ph.D. programs as well as for the future of the humanities as a whole to innovate , not reform. Too many times have we seen humanities advocates take a defensive posture against change. While I am also such an advocate, I say our best defense is an offense. No jobs? Create your own. For me, that meant rebranding myself as a communications specialist with a background in foreign media analysis. \nThird, I reached out to the dean\u2019s office. As Ph.D. candidates immersed in our course work and teaching, it is easy to forget that the strategic-level decision makers at our own universities are often our best allies for innovation. They are the people responsible for growing programs, attracting greater numbers of students and supporting student success -- the latter of which is perhaps the most relevant, given the median program completion rate of just 42 percent among humanities Ph.D. students. \nThus, I informed those administrators of what I was doing, reported my success in securing internships and generally proved the worth and validity of my approach. The response was positive, since these senior officials are constantly seeking ways to render university programs more attractive, competitive and, yes, lucrative. As difficult as it may be for some of us to accept, departments and disciplines actually compete with each other for funds, talent and other forms of capital, just like any other organization. \nThat has been my full-circle turn, and during it, I have received the following types of support that I believe will come to characterize the humanities departments of the future. In fact, I recommend that other graduate students in the humanities urge their departments and institutions to put such support in place. \nStipends for internships. This is the most pressing and necessary component of future doctoral training in the humanities. Employers today don\u2019t care so much what you studied ; they look for the experience you\u2019ve gained along the way. As a result, it is imperative for the future financial security of graduates that fellowship or assistantship funding be adjusted to allow for pay during internship semesters. \nIntegrated technology training. Some of the most in-demand skills I\u2019ve noticed during my internships are those associated with specific technology platforms: WordPress, Excel, InDesign, Photoshop. In many content-driven industries, they are used for consulting reports, policy briefs, magazine articles and social media marketing, among others. We humanists are experts at generating content, yet our departments offer little assistance in developing such competencies. In my personal case, I have had to spend thousands of dollars (in loan money) to complete the necessary workshops. Those of us in the humanities should urge our departments to help provide us such training. \nDedicated advising personnel. A number of institutions have hired a career counselor specifically trained to advise doctoral students from all disciplines. This is an example to follow, as humanities Ph.D.s have distinct hurdles to overcome in selling themselves to employers, even for internships. One of them (from personal experience) is the overqualification hump, where you must prove that you are not too \u201chigh and mighty\u201d for that internship staffed mostly by undergraduate students. \nA second type of training involves crossing with the sciences. At Hopkins, for instance, the school of engineering offers one-credit professional development seminars for Ph.D.s from all areas, a definite strength of our program. Before I graduate, I will have taken courses such as Effective Professional Presentations, Project Management and Management Consulting. \nI encourage more Ph.D. students to pursue this type of career counseling and job training -- and more institutions to offer them. \nRoom to maneuver. In many departments, the required course load in one\u2019s primary field is so burdensome that students are reluctant to explore other areas. But at Hopkins, I have been able to find the humanities in other fields such as foreign policy or management consulting, all thanks to the flexibility of my program. Many of these fresh, innovative connections between our fields and those of specific industries are impossible to make without distancing oneself from the canon, yet they are indispensable for showing that the humanities have an impact on public life. Peter Drucker, for instance, the founder of American management consulting (and former professor of politics and philosophy), calls his field a \u201cliberal art\u201d and says that the humanities will regain their relevance when they return to the openness that makes them what they are. The key to becoming a better manager? \u201cLearn to play the violin ,\u201d Drucker would say. \nEmployer education. The problem that many humanities Ph.D.s face in the professional job market has to do with perceptions. As such, it is important that departments invest time and money -- as they do for guest speakers or visiting candidates -- in educating human resources officers on the benefits of hiring a Ph.D. \nMany times, employers simply do not know what a Ph.D. means or how it can contribute to their organization. Instead, they view it as an alien credential for those guys who should be working only at places like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration or that really, really bookish kid with poor social skills whom you knew in college. \nHiring managers need to be invited to campus so they can see the kinds of skills and projects our humanist professionals are working on. This not only creates relationships for future employment, but it can also result in greater funding opportunities for humanities departments, with projects that show that we have something to offer the public and private sectors. \nBusinesses, think tanks, nonprofits, museums and government agencies need people who can rapidly analyze large volumes of information and turn them into comprehensible bytes. They need people who can make decisions when the \u201cright\u201d choice is unclear, when the information is incomplete and when conditions are volatile. Isn\u2019t that what we do every day as we teach, assess outcomes and interpret large bodies of works? But someone needs to educate organizations about that fact. \nTo close, I might offer advice to graduate students seeking change within their departments. As clich\u00e9 as it may be, there are three \u201cI's\u201d for improving your doctoral education in the humanities: innovate, inform and internship. You must begin by defining a project that sets you apart, an idea you can \u201cbrand\u201d intellectually as your own but also pitch to employers. Once that is in place, you must inform stakeholders -- high-level administrators, professors from other divisions, networking contacts -- about your goals. Then you can leverage that support to obtain internships, the magic ingredient for jobs. After that, the only \u201cI\u201d left to satisfy is you .

The first regional journalists to be seconded started on November 20. \nAshley Highfield, chairman of the News Media Association, said: \u201cThe ground-breaking Local News Partnership between the NMA and the BBC is now becoming a reality which will benefit the BBC, local media and, most importantly, local communities.\" \n\u201cThe initiative has moved the whole relationship between the BBC and the local media sector from confrontation to collaboration, and key benefits will include 150 new journalists on the ground holding public institutions to account on behalf of their readers. \n\u201cManaged by local media and funded by BBC, the Local Democracy Reporters are just a part of a slew of collaborative initiatives that will see local media get access to BBC's local video and data journalism.\" \nTo be awarded the democracy reporter contracts, the 58 successful news organisations had to pass stringent criteria which included financial stability and a strong track record of relevant journalism in the area they were applying to cover. \nThe award decisions were made by senior editorial BBC figures across the English regions, Wales and Scotland. \nIn areas where a single contract contained multiple reporters, some successful bidders opted to share the allocation with neighbouring news organisations. \nThe next step will be for the successful organisations to start recruiting, with a view to becoming operational in the next few months. \nA total of 150 local democracy reporters will eventually be employed once all contracts have been awarded.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david holdsworth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashley highfield", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "local news partnerships", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "local democracy reporters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shared data unit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newsquest media group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "news media association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:26.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "621203d64806fc42066094751a73be309d054efb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZShcLv2AiNvM8MAQEb8fCRCp73TrC3NQWSa.sgObY1jhEzxXiE4l0x35FG__._0.6wklr8.unpOT5xC13lyMEbG", "site_full": "forums.somethingawful.com", "site": "somethingawful.com", "site_section": "https://forums.somethingawful.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=130", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "The TV IV - The Something Awful Forums", "title": "Why in the yotz don't we have a Farscape thread?", "title_full": "Why in the yotz don't we have a Farscape thread?
