The other thing I would like to add is that they seem to really seem to be executing the project development as responsibly as possible. Consider for example, that they only have on-boarded several exchanges (despite the pressure from people who only want to see it on many exchanges so the price goes up). This means that they get an feel for how things are working end-to-end. If they do need to make any protocol or network changes, the impact is limited (from a technical and user standpoint).\nAgain, I think about the big effort that is now required for everyone to implement Bitcoin's Segwit protocol - wallets, exchanges,users - lots of code and software needs to be tested & pushed out for this to happen not to mention people moving all their coins to different addresses at high dollar cost. While this lags behind, adoption is faltering.\nCapacity planning on a world-wide network should be a huge effort to make sure it can truly handle the anticipated volumes and then several hundred percent more so you have time to scale things when (if ever) it's necessary.\nAs an end-user, I must admit that all this stuff is a little unnerving.

This goes against fundamental principles in the software lifecycle which require that when software is developed, it goes through various stages before it can be used in production scenarios - this includes various unit, integration and load tests. What you are reading in a white paper is all the research and theory behind the tangle. Implementation of course will have it's challenges and it's their white paper which guide them to developing the solution. When they actually write the software, there will also be unknowns that they discover on the way. What they are saying is that their research suggests is that the problem is largely solvable even though there will be hitches along the way.\nMy other response again for visibility:\nI agree with what you're saying and here's my assessment: First of all it is important to be aware that they are in beta. Therefore, there is no urgency at this stage to immediately solve any lags since it shouldn't be being used for production purposes yet. The good thing about being \"live but beta\" is that you are getting real-world scenarios where people are attempting to attack and hack the system and you can casually observe and optimize without being under severe pressure as with a production scenario (just think about Ethereum & Bitcoin and the congestion problems they're having now - they're paralyzed for a solution because anything they do could cause severe disruption).\nSo, with that said, a very typical thing to do in (good) development practice for stress testing is to see how your system performs without any of your optimizations and/or protection from attacks. From this, you will learn what weak points there are and you can tweak and optimize things on this level. Once this process is done, you will see if you have managed to alleviate or maybe even solve the load issue. This would imply that your base platform is rock-solid as can be for unforseen and future load. Then, you wait for potentially other attack vectors. Once you are satisfied that the network is operating as you expect, you then add your additional controls, checks and measures one by one to assess the impact of each.\nYou have to liken this to building a structure - make sure the foundations are correct before putting more stuff on top.

The tax was eliminated in 2010 but was reinstated a year later. Alex Wong / Getty Images \nRepublicans in Congress are on the verge of fulfilling their long-time dream of eliminating the federal estate tax, and they could do it in a way that is even more generous to heirs than previous repeal efforts. \nBills passed by the Senate and the House recently would reduce or scrap the taxes heirs now pay on estates larger than $5.5 million. And the bills would do so without repealing the so-called \"stepped-up basis\" provision. \nOrdinarily, people have to pay taxes when they sell off assets that have appreciated in value, like shares of stock or real estate. But heirs are exempted from that tax. That's because they already pay the estate tax. \nThe bills approved by Congress recently would eliminate or reduce the estate tax, while leaving the exemption in place. \nIn other words, you would be able to pass on assets that have gained a lot in value \u2014 like those Apple shares you bought years ago \u2014 and, unlike everyone else, your heirs never have to pay tax on the appreciation. \nTo put it another way: Someone could inherit her grandfather's large beachfront mansion without paying estate tax, and sell it off right away without paying any capital gains tax. \nIt's a much more generous policy than previous tax overhauls, says Lily Batchelder, a professor of law and public policy at New York University Law School. \n\"We've never seen a proposal like this,\" she says. \"I don't recall ever seeing a proposal that would both fully repeal the estate tax and fully exempt from tax all the accrued gains on these giant estates.\" \nThe bill passed by the Senate early Saturday would double the exemption on large estates, allowing people to pass on estates worth $11 million to their heirs tax-free. \nThe exemption for married couples would be $22 million. The House bill would gradually reduce the estate tax and then scrap it altogether in 2023. \nHouse and Senate leaders are now trying to reconcile the two versions of the tax overhaul, with a vote expected by the end of the month. \nThe estate tax has long been the bane of conservatives. Congress briefly eliminated the tax in 2010, but it came back the following year and remains in place today. \n\"We just think it's unfair. Death should not be a taxable event. And we should not be stopping people from being able to pass their life's work on to their kids,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox News recently. \nThe estate tax brings in a relatively small amount of money to the federal Treasury, about $19 billion a year, even as it hurts the large economy, says Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation. \nBecause of the tax, people end up pouring money into tax shelters and paying hefty bills to tax lawyers, he says. \nThe tax is especially onerous for assets that may be worth a lot on paper but are cash poor, such as certain kinds of businesses, Hodge says. In some cases, heirs have to break up or sell businesses to pay taxes, he says. \nPeople who want to keep the tax say such cases are extremely rare. They also say that at a time of growing income inequality, the estate tax plays an important role in making the economy fair. \n\"The estate tax is basically a way of partially leveling the playing field, so that these heirs of massive estates don't have quite as gigantic a leg up in life,\" Batchelder says.

I'm in PT and am looking for a partner for some sexual fun. We can do other things too, as time permits. But, I'm primarily looking for sex right now. If you're a top, I'm not too hung up on looks. If you're a bottom, looks are more important. If you're versatile, then middle of the road is probably going to work. Size of the package will probably trump everything. I can host. I prefer morning/daytimes to night but can do both. I'm looking for something longer term, so this isn't going to be a quick fix kind of thing. If you're married, that is fine. I'm discreet and know that you need to be as well. I've tried using Craigslist and I'm familiar with the weirdos and annoying responses. Don't send me a closeup pic of your junk that you took 12 years ago. Not that I don't like penis pics, but some are just pretty \"meh\". I'm looking for a bit more than a \"meh\" penis pic. Tell me a little about yourself, stats, what you're looking for, send me a pic or two and I'll send a one or two back. I'd like to feel that I'm going to enjoy time spent with you.

President Trump announced that the U.S. will view Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and he ordered the State Department to \"begin preparation to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv.\" The controversial move threatens to unsettle the region's volatile politics. Ahmad Gharabli / AFP/Getty Images \nPresident Trump's declaration that Jerusalem is Israel's capital and his order to move the U.S. Embassy brought quick and sharply differing reactions from Jewish, Christian and Muslim leaders. \nThe government of Israel considers Jerusalem its capital, and most Jewish-American organizations have long argued that the United States should acknowledge it as such. The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which called for the U.S. Embassy to be moved to Jerusalem, passed by a large bipartisan margin and was strongly supported by Jewish-American groups. \n\"It's been the consensus mainline view for decades,\" said Nathan Diament, executive director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, \"because Jerusalem is the capital city for Israel and the Jewish people. ... The United States puts its embassies in capital cities, and it's unjust and discriminatory to say we're going to single out Israel as the one country where we don't put our embassy [in the capital].\" \nWhen President Trump on Wednesday ordered the State Department to begin preparations to move the embassy to Jerusalem, several Jewish-American groups welcomed the move. \n\"By stating the truth of Jerusalem's status as the capital of the State of Israel, President Trump has asserted U.S. global leadership towards ending a longstanding, senseless anomaly,\" said David Harris, chief executive officer of the American Jewish Committee. \nThe Anti-Defamation League called the move a \"significant step,\" coming at a time \"when international organizations and other detractors delegitimize the Jewish state and deny any Jewish connection to the holy city.\" \nBut there were also misgivings from some Jewish-American groups. The Reform Jewish Movement, representing nearly 900 congregations, noted that it has long supported the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital but also believed that moving the U.S. Embassy there should happen only \"at the right time.\" Without a comprehensive peace plan, the movement said it cannot support the president's decision to move the embassy now. \nConservative evangelical Christian leaders had fewer qualms. \n\"This decision will be met by political praise and theological conviction,\" said Johnnie Moore, an informal spokesman for Trump's evangelical advisory group. \"Evangelicals in every corner of the United States will be ecstatic,\" he said. \nEvangelicals feel a special kinship with Jerusalem as the city where they believe Jesus Christ was crucified and rose again. Some sects even take an eschatological view, arguing that Jesus will return to earth in Jerusalem, once all Jews are reunited there. \nFor Trump's evangelical advisory group, said Moore, the only issue more important than the status of Jerusalem is the question of who will be appointed as federal judges. \n\"In our various meetings with the White House, this issue has always come up,\" Moore said, \"and it has always been an extended discussion around the table. I mean, at the heart of the relationship between the United States and Israel has been the friendship between evangelical Christians and the Jewish people.\" \nSome evangelical leaders who generally support the president's Jerusalem decision, however, fear the repercussions for their own Palestinian Christian followers. Muslim leaders in the Palestinian territories have warned there will be a reaction there to the president's announcement. The governments of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey all expressed alarm at Trump's decision, as did Muslim leaders in the U.S. \n\"The reality is that Palestinians have existed for generations on the land of Palestine [and] in Jerusalem,\" said Osama Abuirshaid, a board member of the American Muslims for Palestine, at a press conference near the White House. \"[Trump] cannot deny this reality,\" Abuirshaid said. \"He spoke about the Jewish connection to Jerusalem while negating the Christian and Muslim connection to the land and to the holy city.\" \nPope Francis advised against \"adding new elements of tension in a world already shaken and scarred by many cruel conflicts.\" The heads of several Christian churches in Jerusalem, in a joint letter to Trump, said a unilateral change in the status of Jerusalem by the U.S. government \"will yield increased hatred, conflict, violence, and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land ... [and] cause irreparable harm.\" \nA similar warning came from Elizabeth Eaton, the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran group in the U.S. \n\"This announcement,\" Eaton said, \"has a high probability of leading to violence and bloodshed and not ... getting any closer to having the two parties come to the table again.\" \nEaton spoke following a meeting in Geneva with fellow Lutheran chuch leaders from around the world, including those in Jordan and other Arab countries.

The delegation, led by Bashar al-Ja\u2019afari, walked out last week and returned to Damascus. Negotiations resumed on Wednesday without the Syrian government delegation. \nThe talks began last week and after a few days with little apparent progress, the UN mediator Staffan de Mistura said that the government delegation was returning to Damascus to \u201cconsult and refresh\u201d. \nThe government delegation blamed its departure on the opposition\u2019s uncompromising stance on Assad\u2019s future. Last month, the opposition drew up a statement in a meeting in Riyadh that rejected any future role for Assad in Syria. \nDuring last week\u2019s sessions, de Mistura shuttled between the representatives of the two warring sides, who did not meet face-to-face. He had planned to continue the round until Dec. 15. \nThe opposition negotiating team arrived at the UN offices in Geneva on Wednesday morning to resume talks with de Mistura. \nFrance accused the Syrian government on Wednesday of obstructing the peace talks with its refusal to return to Geneva and called on Russia not to shrink its responsibilities to get Damascus to the negotiating table.

The two banks are among the largest financial contributors to a $40 billion bailout package given to Ukraine to shore up and reform its economy after the 2014 Maidan protests ousted the Kremlin-backed president, Viktor Yanukovich. \nBut perceived backsliding on reform commitments has delayed billions of dollars in IMF loans and tested the patience of foreign allies, even as Kiev pushes for closer EU integration and increased foreign investment. \u201cWe are deeply concerned by recent events in Ukraine that could roll back progress that has been made in setting up independent institutions to tackle high-level corruption,\u201d IMF chief Christine Lagarde said in a statement. \nUkraine\u2019s backers are particularly concerned about recent actions by prosecutors that they say threaten the independence of the anti-corruption bureau known as NABU, which was set up after the Maidan protests and has been at loggerheads with other law enforcement bodies. \u201cWe urge the Ukrainian authorities and parliament to safeguard the independence of NABU and SAPO (anti-corruption prosecutor),\u201d Lagarde said. \nIn one recent episode, the General Prosecutor\u2019s office unmasked an alleged sting operation being carried out by NABU against suspected corruption in the migration service. It said NABU had overstepped the law. \nIn a separate statement, the World Bank\u2019s office in Ukraine also expressed its concern and said attacks on NABU and on SAPO \u201cthreaten their ability to fight corruption and recover stolen assets.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s critical they have the legislative framework & resources to fulfil their mandate,\u201d it said. The comments add to a chorus of criticism from Ukraine\u2019s backers this week. Earlier, the US State Department and European Union said the attacks on NABU risked eroding international support for Ukraine.

There, Republicans from both sides of Congress generally agree on two big changes. \nSaving for private school \nTaxpayers can currently save money for college through a 529 plan, where earnings grow tax-free. Many states also offer deductions for contributions. In the proposals, Republicans want to let taxpayers use 529s to pay for K-12 tuition at private and religious schools, too. Families can already do that with a different plan \u2014 Coverdell Education Savings Accounts \u2014 but these have low contribution limits and aren't open to high-income Americans. The move to expand the 529 would dramatically increase who could use these plans and the money they could save. \n\"I think the only taxpayers who will be in a position to benefit from the 529 change are very rich people,\" says Nora Gordon, an economist and associate professor at Georgetown University. She says using these accounts to save for elementary or high school won't help much unless you can afford to set aside a lot of money early on. No wonder, when the Government Accountability Office studied 529s and Coverdells a few years ago, it found \"families with these accounts had about 25 times the median financial assets\" of those who didn't use them and \"about three times the median income.\" \nWhile the proposed expansion of 529 plans would largely help affluent parents who use private schools, Republicans are proposing another change that could hurt funding for the nation's public schools. \nThe SALT (State And Local Taxes) deduction \nUp to now, taxpayers who itemize their deductions \u2014 generally high-earners who make up about a third of households in the U.S. \u2014 have gotten a break from the federal government for paying state and local taxes. \nThink of it as a kind of rebate \u2014 courtesy of Washington \u2014 that ultimately helps state and local governments pay for important things, like schools, among other things. \nRepublicans now want to cut that discount, getting rid of the income and sales tax deductions and putting a $10,000 cap on the deduction for property taxes. \n\"This bill is gonna make it more painful for residents to increase local property taxes to pay for public schools,\" says John Friedman, an associate professor of economics at Brown University. \nOn average, nearly half of public schools' funding (45 percent) comes from local taxes, often property taxes. In the past, when locals hiked these taxes to help pay for their schools, the federal government made the hike hurt less with that SALT deduction. So imagine, if Congress caps the property tax deduction, for high earners who already pay a lot \u2014 in places like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, even Texas \u2014 a new hike would hurt more than it used to. \n\"This is a really big deal for some states and no deal at all for other states. And the states that it's a really big deal for are blue states,\" says Nora Gordon of Georgetown. \"They're states with higher cost of living, higher property values, and states that spend more on their state and local government.\" \nWhile local taxes provide nearly half of public school dollars, state taxes account for much of the rest (46 percent). Kim Rueben of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says states often use these sales and income taxes to help their poorest schools. \n\"The money from the state ends up helping to prop up school districts that have less ability to raise money from the property tax,\" she says. Getting rid of these deductions, Rueben says, will make state-level taxes more painful for some and, again, could make it harder to raise money for schools in the future. \nImportant context: All this is happening with many school districts still reeling from the Great Recession. According to a recent analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, after adjusting for inflation, \"twenty-nine states provided less overall state funding per student in the 2015 school year than in the 2008 school year, before the recession took hold.\" \n*** \nThe two tax bills are farther apart when it comes to higher education. \nIn the House: fewer tuition benefits \nWe've heard a lot about graduate students' reaction to the proposal to tax their tuition waivers as income. \nAs Ariana Figueroa reported for NPR: \n\"Many grad students \u2014 especially in Ph.D. programs \u2014 receive tuition waivers in exchange for teaching classes or doing research. Under current law, that money isn't taxed as income. But the House bill calls for those tuition waivers to be counted as income and subjected to income taxes. \nThat means graduate students would be paying taxes on money they never receive.\" \nThe House bill also cuts or reduces other higher education tax benefits: The Hope Scholarship Credit The Lifetime Learning Credit and tuition deduction The deduction on interest for those repaying student loans The American Opportunity Tax Credit, which students and families can use to offset college tuition payments, is limited to exclude part-time and graduate students, although it is also extended for a fifth year. \nTogether, the axed benefits are worth about $6.5 billion a year to students and families, according to the American Council on Education. \nThe Senate bill doesn't include any of the above. \nState funding for public higher education may also be in jeopardy, for the same reasons we discussed above \u2014 a consequence of getting rid of the deductions for SALT. Scaling back, or cutting federal discounts to taxpayers may cause a squeeze on funding for state universities and colleges. \nPrivate college penalties \nBoth public and private colleges have expressed concern that fewer people are going to be taking the charitable deduction, because of the increase in the standard deduction. They're worried this will lead, in turn, to less money in donations. The American Council on Education estimates about $100 billion less a year in donations across all nonprofits. \nThere are also some provisions in the House and Senate bills that target private colleges specifically. One provision would levy a tax on investment gains for a small group of private colleges that have very large endowments on a per-student basis. Currently, this money grows tax-free thanks to the colleges' nonprofit status. \nThis affects about 65 private colleges with extremely large endowments. But even more colleges are worried about it, says Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education. \n\"Even though public universities are not affected by the endowment tax, they are very much opposed to it, for fear it would set a precedent that would be applied to them in the future.\" \nCulture war? \nThe tax plans, which passed on party lines in both the House and Senate, are aligned with a broader Republican agenda. On the K-12 side, cuts that impact the source of public school funding are coming hand in hand with special tax benefits for families with means to put aside money for private school tuition. \nOn the higher education side, Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and adviser to the Trump campaign, told Bloomberg that Republicans are going after university endowments because \"universities have become playpens of the left.\" Amplifying that point, a recent Pew poll showed there is a sharply rising partisan gap on higher education, with 58 percent of Republicans saying colleges have a negative effect on the country, while 72 percent of Democrats say they have a positive impact.

This is what the comedian has to say Farah Khan's tweet about someone from the industry of not having the courtesy to drop a personal text or call for a premiere has left everyone guessing whether it is about Kapil Sharma. By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Updated: December 7, 2017 2:32 pm Farah Khan\u2019s encrypted tweet is said to be for Kapil Sharma. Related News Farah Khan and Boman Irani\u2019s hilarious birthday wish \u2018tweet talk\u2019 has everyone in splits \nThey say friendships in the film industry are fragile, one incident and you might become someone\u2019s enemy or will be nothing more than an acquaintance. It seems something similar has happened with Farah Khan, who seemed to be upset with a gesture by a friend. A few days back, the choreographer-turned-director took to Twitter and wrote, \u201cDear Mannerless people,if u want me 2 attend ur premier/preview/party DON,T send me a \u201c janta invite\u201d on WhatsApp! U r not doing me a favour! The least u can do is make a personal call. If u cant find the time for it what makes u think i hav time 2 get ready n cm for you??!\u201d \nFarah dropped the tweet in the week when Firangi, the second film starring Kapil Sharma , was to release. Hence, rumours began that she is furious about Kapil\u2019s behaviour and the \u201cmannerless people\u201d was nobody but the comedian-turned-actor. \nThe two are said to have a good relationship and both have marked their presence on each other\u2019s television shows several times. In fact, Kapil remembers how Farah had got Happy New Year\u2019s team to the sets of Comedy Nights With Kapil and the entire team shot for six hours straight. However, it seems things have taken a turn for the worse. \n\nWhen Kapil got to know about it, he was a bit shocked. In an interview to skjbollywoodnews.com, Kapil quipped, \u201cWe had a show on Thursday. In whatever way I thought correct I had invited all my friends from the film industry. It was mostly attended by cast crew and our friends and family. I hope my big powerful friends in the film industry will see the film later.\u201d A source close to him feels since the comedian is experiencing a low phase of his career, he has become an easy target. \nMeanwhile, Kapil\u2019s recent release Firangi has not impressed the audience like his debut film Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon.
