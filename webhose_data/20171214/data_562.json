Here is her review\u2026 \nTo say that I love Sia is an understatement. I am completely IN LOVE with Sia\u2026. Always have been. Last night\u2019s Mt Smart solo show was a redefinition of live musical performance. It was provocative, deeply moving, spectacularly curated and well sung. Funnily enough, there are haters galore on Facebook all complaining of her as being \u2018farce\u2019and her not speaking between songs as getting \u2018tired pretty quick\u2019. I disagree. They just don\u2019t get the profound statements she makes as an artist. \nNo loss. Haters gonna hate. \nTruth be told \u2013 it was beautiful. I felt as if I was in the presence of genius. I guess these same critics wouldn\u2019t have liked Bowie\u2019s mime either (There\u2019s plenty ball-busting bluster out there if you want same-old, same-old\u2026) \nSia is a spectacular vocalist, artist and songwriter. But, she doesn\u2019t \u2018show-off\u2019 or rub our faces in this. There\u2019s no posturing or bravado (in stark contrast to the last gig I\u2019d seen at Mt Smart \u2026 Bruce Springsteen!) She very consciously shifted herself into the shadows in order to redirect our attention to the mesmerizing story-telling of her coterie of dancers on stage and actors on screen. Star of Chandelier\u2019s video and regular collaborator Maddie Ziegler was explosive and dynamic, holding centre-stage and totally embodying the songs. (I\u2019m delighted to age with her as a dancer\u2026. Now that she\u2019s 15) \nSia is entirely self-defined, interdisciplinary and genre-bending. The 16 song set combined pre-recorded cameo-studded large-screen video-art with live dancers onstage juxtaposed with an almost entirely motionless Sia. As a performer, even before hiding her face behind wigs and masks, she has always delivered songs from a stationary position. The songs were segued together with sound-art and spoken word. \nI first heard Sia when a student of mine tipped me off around 2004 or so. I wound up using her album Some People Have Real Problems as a soundtrack to my life (covering Soon Will Be Found with my own band). I\u2019d known her as the frontwoman for Zero 7 and was in awe of her distinctive powerful rasp. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a professional vocalist who doesn\u2019t fully respect Sia\u2019s originality, quirky childlike charisma and voice. \nShe writes of her own struggles with addiction, co-dependency, disempowerment and ultimately: transformation and victory. It was wonderful to see so many young women at this gig: you couldn\u2019t find a better role model: of humility, putting the \u2018art form\u2019 and lyrical intent first and dissolving herself into the background to allow the songs, dancers, costumes and choreography to shine. \nIt was important to note that it wasn\u2019t until exactly halfway through her set that she moved: using sign language to interpret Soon Will Be Found. This gave the song so much more impact, given her prior (and later continued) restraint. Watch this version of Chandelier with a sign language interpreter on SNL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Hg_rIqOZHc . \nEverything about Sia is gorgeously mindful and deliberate (like our own Anthonie Tonnon) \nHer legacy is long. Sia\u2019s first solo album was in 1997. She wasn\u2019t fully recognised by the mainstream until songs were placed in film and television and she made a very deliberate effort to write to a \u2018pop\u2019 audience pitching songs to \u2018pop\u2019 artists. ( Breathe Me was placed in Six Feet Under and later Elastic Heart featured on the soundtrack of The Hunger Games ). Her hits for other artists like Rihanna ( Diamonds ) and Beyonce ( Pretty Hurts ) have thankfully extended her listenership so that the impact of her highly experiential lyrics can reach as many hearts and ears as possible. \nI feel my friend Catherine Hamilton sums up the concert brilliantly with these one-liners: \u201cComplete redefinition of what it means to go to a pop concert\u201d \u2026 \u201cPop\u2019s anti-hero\u201d \u2026 \u201cAn amazing feat to perform them bangers as a living statue\u201d. \nBTW, even though the onstage banter was limited to one \u201cThank you\u201d and \u201cI love you so much\u201d, she did say something directly to us as Kiwis \u201cYou guys make the BEST coconut yogurt\u201d\u2026 and being a vegan, she\u2019d know. \nWhat a beautiful mix of people. What an honour and a joy. \nOh \u2026. As a bit of a giggle, I\u2019m curious to hear her recently released Everyday is Christmas (her eighth studio album).

Her new EP, Birthday At The Beach , was just released yesterday. \nI Had The Thought is the first single from the new EP. Listen to it here: Here is the record company blurb: \nThe Low Low brings a ebullient, off-kilter approach to classic pop. Nodding to the effortless yet incisive alt-pop of Broadcast and St. Vincent, the flawless melodies of Carole King, and the inventive vocal work of Vashti Bunyan and Diane Cluck, The Low Low\u2019s new EP \u201cBirthday at the Beach\u201d is unveiled today. \nA self-described \u201cchoir girl chamber-pop\u201d act (spearheaded by New Zealand\u2019s Catherine Walker), The Low Low began with a slow simmer. Following the release of 2012 EP Magenta , Walker spent time travelling, working at a vineyard on a reclusive island (where she\u2019d swim daily on her lunch breaks) before holing up on a Queenstown high country station \u2013 devising vocal parts for the body of work that would soon become Birthday at the Beach . \nBirthday at the Beach is a refined and muscular offering. Dipping into the sacred pool of all great pop material, The Low Low explores heartbreak, loneliness, longing and self-destruction across five tracks. Deceptively simple songwriting is infused with genuine feeling and a certain ease of phrase and harmony, produced with aplomb by Walker and Tom Healy (Tiny Ruins, Paquin, Bic Runga) at Auckland studio The Lab. \nSoaring opener \u2018Wellspring\u2019 (featuring Benjamin Morley of Mice on Stilts) is a warm, textural ode with hypnotically abstract lyrics rallying like a mantra. Second song \u2013 and first EP single \u2013 \u2018I Had The Thought\u2019 shimmers effortlessly along to a stomping four-to-the-floor beat, echoing the fluid electronic flow and melancholic psych-folk of Broadcast. Eponymous track \u2018Birthday at the Beach\u2019 could have come from the lips of Harry Nilsson, and showcases Walker\u2019s skill and taste for nailing the deceptively simple. \u2018Drink it Down\u2019 is a sombre musing on friendship and community, while EP closer \u2018Girl Like You\u2019 meditates on youthful loneliness with sensitivity and feeling. \nStunning string arrangements tug against sparkling synthesisers, and surprising shifts into dream-like layers and gracefully suspended moments \u2013 yet what shines through is The Low Low\u2019s knack for writing a classic pop track. Birthday at the Beach is brimming with them \u2013 and it feels like only the beginning.

Scrooge's late business partner gets the spotlight in this retelling of a holiday classic By MEGHAN PIERCE Tom Frey, Bridget Beirne, Jared Starkey and Kraig Swartz star in Peterborough Players' production of \u201cJacob Marley's Christmas Carol.\u201d (Meghan Pierce) WHAT\" 'Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol'WHEN: Thursday through Dec. 17, with evening and matinee performancesWHERE: Peterborough Players, 55 Hadley Road, PeterboroughTICKETS: $39INFO: peterboroughplayers.org; 924-7585 The Peterborough Players give a fresh take on an old tale this holiday season with \u201cJacob Marley\u2019s Christmas Carol.\u201dThe play opens today and will run through Dec. 17 at the theater\u2019s Hadley Road stage.In the traditional \u201cChristmas Carol\u201d tale, Jacob Marley plays an important but small role in a story of Ebenezer Scrooge\u2019s redemption. At the start of that journey, Marley, once Scrooge\u2019s business partner, shows him how a life of greed has led to an afterlife filled with torment.But in \u201cJacob Marley\u2019s Christmas Carol,\u201d the entire story is told from Marley\u2019s point of view.\u201cIt keeps intersecting with the story of \u2018A Christmas Carol\u2019 that we all know,\u201d said actor Tom Frey, who plays Marley. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like \u2018Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\u2019\u2019 (Tom Stoppard\u2019s play about two minor characters from Shakespeare\u2019s \u2018Hamlet\u2019) a little bit, where you pluck a character out of a great story and ask some great playwright questions.\u201d\u201cThe perspective is fresh. It gets you,\u201d Frey said of the Marley angle in the Peterborough production. Marley\u2019s visit to Scrooge serves as a jumping off point in this tale.\u201cThe Marley scene is the pivotal scene. He\u2019s only in one scene (in the original version), but it sets everything in motion,\u201d said actor Kraig Swartz, a Peterborough Players favorite who plays Scrooge.As the Peterborough Players explains it, the show picks up on Scrooge\u2019s mean, sour, pruney old business partner. Chained and shackled, Marley is condemned to a hellish eternity. He\u2019s even given his own private tormentor, a \u201chell-sprite\u201d who thoroughly enjoys his work. Written by Tom Mula, the play can be performed as a one-man show or, in this case, by four actors.Bridget Beirne portrays Bogle, \u201ca malicious little hell-sprite.\u201dBernie describes the Bogle as \u201cif you put an Irish Jiminy Cricket and Clarence Odbody the angel (from the film classic \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d) and a little tiny demon in a blender.\u201dRounding out the cast is Jared Starkey, who plays multiple roles including young Marley, nephew Fred, Dick Wilkins and Tiny Tim.There have been many iterations of \u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d said director Charles Morey, and like them, \u201cJacob Marley\u2019s Christmas Carol\u201d strikes a primal chord.\u201cThey all hook into the most basic mythic theme of a spiritual journey of redemption, and that goes back to the deepest roots of our cultural (history),\u201d Morey said.And while it hits those emotional marks of redemption and second chances, this version is funnier than the original, Swartz said. Frey agrees, \u201cIt\u2019s funny and a little meta. It\u2019s self-knowing.\u201dFrey is also acting as musical director for the production, which includes traditional Christmas carols. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of music. We\u2019ve got four great voices here, and Tom is a great musical director. So we\u2019ve taken a fair amount of Christmas music and are using it to open act one and act two and ... throughout the show,\u201d Morey said. Performances are Thursdays through Saturdays at 7:30 p.m., with matinee performances offered on Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m.The Peterborough Players second annual Winter Season of Plays will continue in February with the comedy-drama \u201cEvery Brilliant Thing\u201d by Duncan Macmillan and Jonny Donahue Feb. 1-11 and \u201cRipcord\u201d by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Lindsay-Abaire Feb. 15-25.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scrooge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bogle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraig swartz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duncan macmillan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meghan pierce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clarence odbody", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom stoppard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom frey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared starkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacob marley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beirne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakespeare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swartz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles morey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonny donahue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bridget beirne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ebenezer scrooge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meghan pierce tom frey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david lindsay-abaire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom mula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dick wilkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosencrantz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jiminy cricket", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peterborough players", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire union", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hadley road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peterborough", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:13.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db00ef07d5caa2377083cdec4a10ccbe2a30ff68", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTkOVeQ6uC0oWv7ojJbnWt_STFKWaL86tZv64thlW1gVwHDyrU9oWcdy9bsH8RJJHgcBENKo8YBjzm6qQCD6eXDb_IrXaXaydOmZmVkQ7lmGvub3kIl2268vMGdRG6dlAnxuMiJ.CA.w--", "site_full": "lagoseyemedia.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://lagoseyemedia.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Adamawa lawmaker Delivers triplets after 24 years of marriage \u2013 LAGOS EYE NEWS", "title": "Adamawa lawmaker Delivers triplets after 24 years of marriage", "title_full": "Adamawa lawmaker Delivers triplets after 24 years of marriage", "published": "2017-12-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db00ef07d5caa2377083cdec4a10ccbe2a30ff68", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTkOVeQ6uC0oWv7ojJbnWt_STFKWaL86tZv64thlW1gVwHDyrU9oWcdy9bsH8RJJHgcBENKo8YBjzm6qQCD6eXDb_IrXaXaydOmZmVkQ7lmGvub3kIl2268vMGdRG6dlAnxuMiJ.CA.w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LAGOS EYE NEWS ONLINE", "published": "2017-12-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Adamawa lawmaker Delivers triplets after 24 years of marriage", "text": "The wife of a member of the Adamawa State House of Assembly, Lumsambani Dilli, has delivered triplets after 24 years of marriage. \n\u201cBoth the mother and the babies are all hale and hearty,\u201d said the new father on Wednesday in a statement.\n\u201cWe found out we were having triplets;

TAX: The U.S. Senate voted to begin negotiation with the House to reconcile their two tax bills on Wednesday in a sign that they can iron out differences.

In other global developments, the British and Irish prime ministers spoke, seeking to overcome a logjam in Brexit talks, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough.

Photo: Kirsty Wigglesworth, AP Ireland's government expects UK to make new Brexit proposal 1 / 1 Back to Gallery LONDON (AP) \u2014 Ireland's government expects the U.K. to make a new Brexit proposal by Friday as officials in London struggle to resolve issues surrounding the Irish border that are stalling talks over Britain's departure from the European Union. British Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to persuade EU leaders to declare that sufficient progress has been made on divorce issues, including the Irish border, when they meet next week in Brussels so talks can move on to trade and future relations between the two sides. Business leaders warn further delays will hurt companies as they plan for the future. Ireland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said late Wednesday he hopes May will submit a new offer \"tonight or tomorrow.\" Disagreements over rules governing the border between the Republic of Ireland, which is a member of the EU, and the U.K. province of Northern Ireland derailed an earlier proposal. Existing rules allow people and goods to pass freely between the Republic and Northern Ireland with no border checks. Ireland wants to preserve the current arrangements, which have eased tensions along the border. May is struggling to balance those demands against the concerns of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to support her government in Parliament. Varadkar said Wednesday that avoiding a hard border remains his \"absolute red line.\" \"We will not loosen our position,\" he told Ireland's Parliament, the Dail. \"We will stay very firm.\" The British and Irish prime ministers discussed the Brexit impasse in a phone call Wednesday, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. May's office said she and Varadkar are \"working hard to find a specific solution to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland,\" which have triggered a crisis in Britain's divorce negotiations with the European Union.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leo varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirsty wigglesworth", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic of ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gallery london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:13.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e7581fbc1e0e8f45955435c4bb0e2833c97e7024", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_w9Sfj2_mXfN2rswjmpo6Jq", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ -

Prosecutors in Istanbul have charged 18-year-old Itir Esen with \"overtly insulting a section of the public\" for a remark she posted on Twitter as the country held memorials on the anniversary of the July 15, 2016 coup attempt, the agency reported. Esen was stripped of her Miss Turkey 2017 title a day after the competition in September when the tweet came to light. The model and university student denies any intent to insult. Turkish media reported that the tweet, which has since been erased, said: \"I got my period on the morning of the July 15 martyrs' day. I'm marking the day by bleeding as a representation of the martyrs' blood.\" The posting caused uproar on social media. A court must accept the indictment before a trial date is set.

If you suspect that another person is using your Skype, your Outlook email service, your Xbox ID, or your Microsoft account, you can find the real answer in minutes. Here is what you can do to discover whether you have been hacked or not and how to prevent being hacked in the future: What is a Microsoft, Hotmail, Skype or Xbox account? \nMicrosoft has many products and services that people use, through all kinds of accounts: email services like Hotmail or Outlook, Skype IDs, Xbox IDs, or Microsoft accounts that you use to log into Windows 10. Even though you might consider all these accounts different, they are all the same thing: a Microsoft account. Your Hotmail address is a Microsoft account; your Skype account is a Microsoft account, your Xbox ID is a Microsoft account, and so on. To learn more, read this article: Simple questions: What is a Microsoft account (Outlook, Xbox, Skype)? . How to check the recent activity on your Microsoft/Hotmail account \nOpen a web browser and go to https://account.microsoft.com . There, log in with your Microsoft account email address and password. If you have enabled two-step verification for your account, you might have to enter a security code that you can receive using an app on your smartphone, a text message or e-mail to another address. \nAfter you are signed in, you see a dashboard of your Microsoft account. In the toolbar on the top, click or tap Security . \nNow you see several security-related options. On the right, there is a square called \u201cReview recent activity.\u201d Click or tap the \u201cReview activity \u201d button. \nAt this step, you may be asked to verify your password one more time, because you are trying to access sensitive information. If you are, type your password and press \u201cSign in.\u201d \nNow you are shown a log of all your recent login activity, starting with the current session. \nScroll down the list of activities, and expand each one. For each sign-in activity, you see the date and time, its status (successful or unsuccessful sign-in), the device and the platform from where the attempt was performed, the browser that was used, the IP address and the geographical location from where the sign-in attempt originated. \nFor example, I have learned that someone from Bulgaria tried to access my Microsoft account and did not succeed. \nAfter you check everything in the recent activity log, you know whether someone else has hacked your account. What to do if your Microsoft account has been hacked \nIf a sign-in activity is fishy, you should click or tap the link that says \u201cSecure your account.\u201d Then, continue with the instructions given by Microsoft to change your password and review your account security. \nIf your Microsoft account was hacked and the person who hacked it has changed your password, then you are in a terrible situation, and only Microsoft can help you. Go to this page and follow the instructions shared there: Recover your Microsoft account . How to prevent being hacked? \nIf you do not want your account hacked, we recommend that you change your Microsoft account password and use a long one, that contains diverse characters and is hard to guess. You should also enable two-step verification and approve sign-in requests using your smartphone. This way, each time someone else authenticates using your hacked password, you can deny the sign-in attempt straight from your smartphone.

Photo: Michael Sohn, AP Germany's Social Democrats OK talks on a new Merkel govt 1 / 6 Back to Gallery BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Germany's center-left Social Democrats agreed Thursday to open talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on whether to renew their governing coalition or at least to support a minority government. Party leader Martin Schulz, Merkel's defeated challenger in Germany's Sept. 24 election, secured a party congress's agreement to a motion calling for talks on \"whether and in what form\" the party could support a new government. Delegates voted down a call from party's youth wing to explicitly rule out a repeat of the \"grand coalition\" of Germany's biggest parties in which the Social Democrats have been junior partners since 2013. But the road to a new government is likely to be lengthy and bumpy \u2014 a several-hour debate revealed little enthusiasm for a coalition. Schulz had insisted after the Social Democrats' disastrous election result in September that the party would go into opposition. He said he still wouldn't contemplate joining a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. But President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear he doesn't want a new election, and Schulz reversed course. Schulz told Thursday's previously scheduled congress that the leadership's plan for talks, which he hopes to start next week, \"takes no option off the table\" and wouldn't automatically lead to a coalition. \"We don't have to govern at any price, but we also shouldn't want not to govern at any price,\" he said. \"What is important is what we can implement.\" Schulz has promised a ballot of the party's entire membership on any coalition deal with Merkel's Union bloc. On Thursday, leaders agreed also to hold a party congress to consider whether to move on from exploratory talks \u2014 if they are successful \u2014 to full coalition negotiations. If no coalition is agreed upon, that would leave only a minority government or a new election as options. Merkel has said she is \"very skeptical\" about leading a minority government, which hasn't yet been tried in post-World War II Germany. Schulz, however, made clear that some form of support for a minority conservative government is very much an option for his party. \"I give you this promise: we will explore every path,\" he told delegates. In his speech, Schulz listed center-left priorities such as equal treatment for men and women in the labor market and a relatively liberal approach to immigration, rejecting the idea of a cap on the number of refugees allowed into the country. The former European Parliament president called for a eurozone budget to boost investment and growth in Europe, and a European finance minister who would curb \"tax dumping.\" He also advocated aiming for a federal \"United States of Europe\" by 2025, and argued that countries that don't sign up to a treaty establishing a federal setup should then automatically leave the European Union. Merkel gave a skeptical response when asked at a separate event in Berlin about Schulz' push for a federalized Europe. She said she would concentrate on securing greater cooperation on economic, security, defense and other issues by 2025. The Social Democrats have been part of Germany's government for 15 of the past 19 years \u2014 twice joining a \"grand coalition\" under Merkel, from 2005 to 2009 and again from 2013 until now. But the party suffered historically poor election results after both Merkel coalitions, with support slumping to a post-war low of 20.5 percent in September. \"The renewal of the Social Democratic Party will happen outside a 'grand coalition,' or it won't happen,\" said the leader of its youth wing, Kevin Kuehnert. Delegates later re-elected Schulz as party leader. Schulz, who ran unopposed, won some 82 percent support \u2014 short of the unanimous backing he received when first elected in March. \"I hope that, on the basis of this result, better times will come,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "merkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin schulz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea nahles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angela merkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "markus schreiber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank-walter steinmeier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schulz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerhard schroeder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "spd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap german social democrats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social democrats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gallery berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:14.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18d502a2060b116a22087042a1fb3ef4f2a96e75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_0wqT7Ae5UJvzJ_c9Ah3oBLmUPfpyarcWm0M5oMliGj2P2RAK1P6KT_FlK8YzhSIchpN5QdupQaQ6iB4ao8KEJOC3gG1m1U2y8.pQAJw4i6hgcM.vda5V8Ktd9UkcSBdrTPDZD8Vvwmw--", "site_full": "www.beaumontenterprise.com", "site": "beaumontenterprise.com", "site_section": "http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/world/collectionRss/News-World-Heds-7344.php", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News World Heds", "title": "Russian ex-minister gives final argument in corruption trial", "title_full": "Russian ex-minister gives final argument in corruption trial", "published": "2017-12-07T11:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/11/14664259/3/rawImage.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "18d502a2060b116a22087042a1fb3ef4f2a96e75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_0wqT7Ae5UJvzJ_c9Ah3oBLmUPfpyarcWm0M5oMliGj2P2RAK1P6KT_FlK8YzhSIchpN5QdupQaQ6iB4ao8KEJOC3gG1m1U2y8.pQAJw4i6hgcM.vda5V8Ktd9UkcSBdrTPDZD8Vvwmw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Russian ex-minister gives final argument in corruption trial", "text": "Close Image 1 of 3 Former Russian Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev is escorted to a court in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017.

Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. The circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. In his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. Sechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. Referring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared \u2014 what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" Ulyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. In wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. Ulyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" Ulyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you're doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people's misfortunes.\" Ulyukayev asked for \"people's\" forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \"defending people's interests.\" The court is expected to deliver the verdict next week.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexei ulyukayev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ulyukayev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igor sechin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivan sekretarev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sechin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap image", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosneft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gallery moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:14.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e036494df7b0f40eb33721eb935caff9069344a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWjf5w6mSGwPk4HNsLwAdp.VBD12oPeXehSnCwZwcYZ8jpAMppXrdJaFRsAlfEDMJR79eLg3NHqyVO86PaiinMzTvpwPXa8UkXytucucBjF12GLU4Hs_t0Zw--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-laundry-cleaning/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Laundry &amp; Cleaning - Buy Laundry &amp; Cleaning at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "3 Tier Clothes Hanging & Drying Rack (Pink)", "title_full": "3 Tier Clothes Hanging & Drying Rack (Pink) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2000-12-31T18:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 156, "participants_count": 139, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5bbd2a62937c99142da6b7c32b80a5ec502fc5f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWjf5w6mSGwPk4HNsLwAdp.VBD12oPeXehSnCwZwcYZ8jpAMppXrdJaFRsAlfEDMJR79eLg3NHqyVO86PaiinMzTvpwPXa8UkXytucucBjF11qSKADk5tuZjLQeeggE3cm", "ord_in_thread": 113, "author": "Mohd Taqiuddin Bin Basiron", "published": "2017-11-27T11:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Barang xsampai..tp dah close..pe hal???", "text": "Dah close order..brg xsampai2 lg..pe cite n...nk call cust service mlslah..byk credit lak nnt..Ninja van lah..slow la ninja ni..haram xninja pun..", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:14.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e036494df7b0f40eb33721eb935caff9069344a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWjf5w6mSGwPk4HNsLwAdp.VBD12oPeXehSnCwZwcYZ8jpAMppXrdJaFRsAlfEDMJR79eLg3NHqyVO86PaiinMzTvpwPXa8UkXytucucBjF12GLU4Hs_t0Zw--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-laundry-cleaning/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Laundry &amp; Cleaning - Buy Laundry &amp; Cleaning at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "3 Tier Clothes Hanging & Drying Rack (Pink)", "title_full": "3 Tier Clothes Hanging & Drying Rack (Pink) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2000-12-31T18:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 156, "participants_count": 139, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91f06a924c050b8b6029b999e00beda202e6049e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWjf5w6mSGwPk4HNsLwAdp.VBD12oPeXehSnCwZwcYZ8jpAMppXrdJaFRsAlfEDMJR79eLg3NHqyVO86PaiinMzTvpwPXa8UkXytucucBjF11qSKADk5tuZmrJQUePPN3D", "ord_in_thread": 115, "author": "Rohayu", "published": "2017-11-28T05:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "barang ok penghntran je xok lambat", "text": "kenapa tak pakai pos laju???

But the company did not reveal any information about the hacker or how it paid him the money. \nUber made the payment last year through a program designed to reward security researchers who report flaws in a company\u2019s software, these people said. Uber\u2019s bug bounty service - as such a program is known in the industry - is hosted by a company called HackerOne, which offers its platform to a number of tech companies. Head of Uber's online food-delivery service quits \nReuters was unable to establish the identity of the hacker or another person who sources said helped him. Uber spokesman Matt Kallman declined to comment on the matter. \nNewly appointed Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi fired two of Uber\u2019s top security officials when he announced the breach last month, saying the incident should have been disclosed to regulators at the time it was discovered, about a year before. \nIt remains unclear who made the final decision to authorise the payment to the hacker and to keep the breach secret, though the sources said then-CEO Travis Kalanick was aware of the breach and bug bounty payment in November of last year. \nMr Kalanick, who stepped down as Uber chief executive in June, declined to comment on the matter, according to his spokesman. \nA payment of $100,000 through a bug bounty program would be extremely unusual, with one former HackerOne executive saying it would represent an \u201call-time record.\u201d Security professionals said rewarding a hacker who had stolen data also would be well outside the normal rules of a bounty program, where payments are typically in the $5,000 to $10,000 range. \nHackerOne hosts Uber\u2019s bug bounty program but does not manage it, and plays no role in deciding whether payouts are appropriate or how large they should be. \nHackerOne chief executive Marten Mickos said he could not discuss an individual customer\u2019s programs. \u201cIn all cases when a bug bounty award is processed through HackerOne, we receive identifying information of the recipient in the form of an IRS W-9 or W-8BEN form before payment of the award can be made,\u201d he said, referring to US Internal Revenue Service forms. \nAccording to two of the sources, Uber made the payment to confirm the hacker\u2019s identity and have him sign a nondisclosure agreement to deter further wrongdoing. Uber also conducted a forensic analysis of the hacker\u2019s machine to make sure the data had been purged, the sources said. \nOne source described the hacker as \u201cliving with his mom in a small home trying to help pay the bills,\u201d adding that members of Uber\u2019s security team did not want to pursue prosecution of an individual who did not appear to pose a further threat. \nThe Florida hacker paid a second person for services that involved accessing GitHub, a site widely used by programmers to store their code, to obtain credentials for access to Uber data stored elsewhere, one of the sources said. \nGitHub said the attack did not involve a failure of its security systems. \u201cOur recommendation is to never store access tokens, passwords, or other authentication or encryption keys in the code,\u201d that company said in a statement. \n\u2018SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS\u2019 \nUber received an email last year from an anonymous person demanding money in exchange for user data, and the message was forwarded to the company\u2019s bug bounty team in what was described as Uber\u2019s routine practice for such solicitations, according to three sources familiar with the matter. \nBug bounty programs are designed mainly to give security researchers an incentive to report weaknesses they uncover in a company\u2019s software. But complicated scenarios can emerge when dealing with hackers who obtain information illegally or seek a ransom. \nSome companies choose not to report more aggressive intrusions to authorities on the grounds that it can be easier and more effective to negotiate directly with hackers in order to limit any harm to customers. \nUber\u2019s $100,000 payout and silence on the matter at the time was extraordinary under such a program, according to Luta Security founder Katie Moussouris, a former HackerOne executive. \n\u201cIf it had been a legitimate bug bounty, it would have been ideal for everyone involved to shout it from the rooftops,\u201d Moussouris said. \nUber\u2019s failure to report the breach to regulators, even though it may have felt it had dealt with the problem, was an error, according to people inside and outside the company who spoke to Reuters. \n\u201cThe creation of a bug bounty program doesn\u2019t allow Uber, their bounty service provider, or any other company the ability to decide that breach notification laws don\u2019t apply to them,\u201d Moussouris said. \nUber fired its chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, and a deputy, attorney Craig Clark, over their roles in the incident. \n\u201cNone of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,\u201d Mr Khosrowshahi, said in a blog post announcing the hack last month. \nMr Clark worked directly for Mr Sullivan but also reported to Uber\u2019s legal and privacy team, according to three people familiar with the arrangement. It is unclear whether Mr Clark informed Uber\u2019s legal department, which typically handled disclosure issues.

The Taurus Curve is a well-rounded package, coming with two six-shot magazines and a trigger shield for immediate use\u2014if need be. (Photo: Terril James Hebert) \nThirty years ago, if you wanted a reliable pocket gun, a small .38 Special revolver was the end all and be all unless you wanted to take a gamble on an older, yet well-made .25 ACP. Anything less seemed unreliable. But, times have changed. The .25 is mostly dead and .38 revolvers have taken a backseat to new, more reliable automatics. Guns like the Ruger LCP, the Seecamp and Smith & Wesson Bodyguard epitomize the balance of compactness, power and reliability. And then Taurus upped its game by trying to advance the concept of a pocket gun with the Taurus Curve . \nFully loaded at 13.6 ounces and measuring in at only five inches long, the Taurus Curve qualifies as a pocket gun. The pistol is chambered for .380 ACP, a round that nearly equals the power of standard .38 Special loads. With its six-shot detachable magazines, the reloading aspect is somewhat faster than breaking open a revolver to initiate the reload. \nLike others of its class, the Curve has a polymer frame and steel slide. Right away, the complete lack of snag hazards grabbed me by the lapels. The pistol wears no sights and the only obvious high point is the loaded chamber indicator just behind the breech. What Taurus does to make up for sights is a painted crosshair on the back of the receiver where the shrouded hammer rides. \nThe Curve may appear featureless, but it has a bit more going on. The pistol is equipped with an integral Laserlyte combination laser and light housed forward of the triggerguard. The system is powered by 357 batteries and is activated by a knurled button on the right side of the pistol. \nThe barrel is cut awkwardly and rounded off to conform to the rounded slide. The grip of the pistol, like so many other pocket guns, is only good for a two-finger grip below the triggerguard, but the stippling on the backstrap and front strap of grip is a smart move. The barrel is cut an awkward angle. This would normally lead to bullets that tumble, but this did not occur. The rifling is squared off and recessed. The slide gets to keep its rounded profile and the gun is still quite accurate. (Photo: Terril James Hebert) \nUnlike other guns in its class, the Curve comes equipped with a detachable belt hook and a trigger sheath so you can carry the gun right out of the box. You also get two magazines, instead of the usual single magazine come with lower-priced \u201ceconomical\u201d options. The magazines are unique in that the polymer baseplate forms a lip that catches on the inside of the grip. The magazines are released by pinching that base and pulling the magazine free. \nOperationally, the Curve has a Browning-style locked breech system that mates the barrel to the slide when the gun is in battery and ready to fire. The pistol has no manual safety and relies on a long, double-action type trigger pull to fire the weapon. \nThis is typical of many new .380 autoloaders, but one feature stands out\u2014the curve. The grip-frame is curved out to the right-side. This was intended to allow for the gun to be comfortably carried without discomfort or printing through clothing. I will give a clap to Taurus for realizing that the human body is curved and flat autoloaders just don\u2019t cut it sometimes. Taurus\u2014to their credit\u2014thinks outside the box. But for Taurus owners, some pistols are a swing and a miss. Through nearly 400 rounds at the range, I found the Curve to be a near-miss. Eating the ammo of death \nOn a cold spring day, I set out with the Taurus Curve and 150 rounds of Tul-Ammo .380 FMJ ammunition. This ammunition is steel cased and is known for having ignition problems due to hard primers. If this gun was going to choke, this had to be the ammo to do it. \nLoading the two provided six-round magazines were buttery smooth with no issues. The springs gave good, but not firm resistance to being loaded to full capacity. Unlike most blowback .380s, the Curve doesn\u2019t take much effort to rack, but the lack of material to grip is dicey. The swirling mill marks on the slide allow for a relatively good grip on what is a relatively slick, featureless surface. A typical group posted with the Curve. While you won\u2019t be competing in postal matches with it, the gun is surprisingly accurate for what it is. (Photo: Terril James Hebert) \nWith daylight shining, it made no sense to use the laser, so I took aim without it. But I was conflicted. The white crosshairs are stuck square in the middle of the slide, not on the top like real sights. It felt unnatural and the receiver covered up a good bit of that 12-inch bullseye target posted at seven yards. I looked over the top of the barrel and saw the loaded chamber indicator\u2014forked in appearance\u2014sticking up in the middle of my sight picture. So, I used that as my sight. \nI pulled back the trigger, which felt somewhat mechanical, but smooth with a relatively light release despite it being quite long. The take-up was very predictable and I cranked it right to breaking point and fired again and again. All I got were holes in the target. No malfunctions of any kind right out of the factory grease. \nI ended up leaving the range, having expended all rounds without any malfunction. The web of my hand was a little red, but recoil wasn\u2019t so much as to be unpleasant. Though the pistol lacked a full grip, the way it is stippled helped greatly with recoil management. The pistol didn\u2019t jump out of my hand in the least. The fact that the Curve has a locked breech, over a standard blowback action the .380 is designed around, helps absorb recoil considerably. Having a heavy slide beating back violently, rubbing your hand with every pass isn\u2019t pleasant. I did not experience that with the Curve. The gun\u2019s oddly offset grip produced no consequential discomfort or awkwardness. It gripped like a normal pistol and it shot like one, too. \nI managed good, semi-rapid one-handed groups at seven yards with my best group coming in at eight inches, but a solid 12-inch group was most typical. Is that good? The FBI has been telling us for years that, statistically, the average distance of a self-defense encounter is seven yards. So, yes, the Curve can put the bullets on target\u2014even without real sights. The mag dump gauntlet \nI was satisfied with the Curve. I took it home and cleaned it thoroughly, but no one is really satisfied with shooting cheap, full metal jacket ammo. Hollow-points, with their flattened shapes, don\u2019t feed well in some pistols. Though hollow-points are debatable in .380 caliber, I hauled three different types of ammunition to put through the Curve: PPU 94 grain brass-cased FMJ, Sig Sauer V-Crown 95 grain hollow-point, and Federal Hydroshock 95 grain hollow-point. The Curve disassembles relatively simply for a pocket gun. (Photo: Terril James Hebert) \nOn the range, I focused primarily on getting rounds out of the gun, reloading, and doing it again in what I call my \u201cmag\u201d dump tests. Accuracy takes a backseat to function and in this the Curve fails. Right away, the Sig ammunition gave me a stovepipe jam. One round from the Federal Hydroshocks failed to feed from the magazine into the chamber. The next 150 rounds were nightmarish, but not because of jammed rounds, but light strikes. Between one to three rounds of every string of six shots was a light strike. The hammer came back, flew forward, striking the primer of the cartridge, but the cartridge did not fire. The primer dent was quite small on these and one might chalk this up to the ammunition, but all ammunition used suffered this problem. \nLight strikes are especially a big deal in the Taurus Curve because the gun doesn\u2019t have a true double-action only trigger. The hammer is preset and once it fires, the slide must go backwards to reset the slide. You can\u2019t pull the trigger again and get the hammer to strike the round a second time. So, I spent half my time clearing jams. In darkness \nI held onto the Curve for quite a while. After it shot through a few magazines of ball ammunition after a good cleaning, I was feeling a little more optimistic. I decided to take the pistol to Spring Guns and Ammo to test the light and laser capability and see if there was a silver lining to this pistol. Perhaps all the fuss really was the break-in period? \nThe pistol was stoked with the same exact brands as before, but I put my index finger forward and pushed the button that activated the light/laser. I could see it and use it in this dimmer environment. The light illuminated the torso target at seven yards very brilliantly and the red laser looked menacing, though I was sure it was off. The gun\u2019s laser can be zeroed with the help of an included allen wrench to fix elevation and windage to get to point of aim. I did not zero the laser. At this point, 300 rounds in, I wanted to see the Curve run with ammunition you and I may stoke in the gun to save lives. The same problems dogged the Curve as before. \nStovepipe jams happened, but the ever present and unpredictable light strikes kept on coming regardless of ammunition used. Worse, the laser system completely shut off after a few rounds of fire. The recoil must have jarred the laser back to its off position. But I needed it to aim effectively for the test. I pushed on the button hard and it came back, but not for long. After the first magazine, the light had also shut off on its own under recoil. Nearly four hundred rounds in, the Curve should have surpassed any break-in period. But the issues only seemed to amplify. The Curve is as barebones as they come. Check out the sights\u2014there aren\u2019t any, really. The white crosshair \u201csight\u201d to be unnatural and useless. This gun is designed for point-blank shooting. (Photo: Terril James Hebert) Parting shots \nI admit being relatively new to Taurus and their firearms. Putting hundreds of rounds through their flagship gun\u2014the Model 85\u2014left me with a very optimistic view. Though not nearly as refined as other revolvers that I am partial to, the M85 is a great buy and one I can stake my life on. The Curve is no such thing. \nOn the outside, the gun utilized a new and bright concept and combined it with what we really need in a carry gun in a well machined, well fitted package. But the gun doesn\u2019t function well enough, despite the promising start. I look forward to Taurus perfecting the concept, but for now, it is off my list.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sig sauer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terril james hebert", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "smith & wesson bodyguard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lcp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:14.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c955892a7e24b250daf26b9fdec309b5cc9700bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSzgu5Z7ZmAguJ6Gr4RkNi1oDPNFy3OjGpYvf05psMQ7.R.CWSVXgZkDq73QE_VD5Y09ZXK3UTx_Aa70ipk1KhhyHnSJMUH2wDhVOLv0fkT9A--", "site_full": "gazketmusic.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://gazketmusic.wordpress.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Gazketmusic Entertainment", "title": "[Music] Matter-nathytainer ft flexyjaybaba", "title_full": "[Music] Matter-nathytainer ft flexyjaybaba", "published": "2017-12-06T18:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://gazketmusic.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/img-20171203-wa0003.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c955892a7e24b250daf26b9fdec309b5cc9700bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSzgu5Z7ZmAguJ6Gr4RkNi1oDPNFy3OjGpYvf05psMQ7.R.CWSVXgZkDq73QE_VD5Y09ZXK3UTx_Aa70ipk1KhhyHnSJMUH2wDhVOLv0fkT9A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gazketmusic", "published": "2017-12-06T18:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "[Music] Matter-nathytainer ft flexyjaybaba", "text": "Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Email (Address never made public) Name You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

The woman too is seen shouting back at the man.\nA few seconds into the video, the man sits back into his car, but steps back out after the female toll plaza employee says something in his direction.\n#WATCH : Man argues & attempts to beat a female toll plaza employee in #Gurugram pic.twitter.com/QlhYun3x3i\n- ANI (@ANI) December 7, 2017 This time, instead of just arguing, the man attempts to storm into the toll booth, but is stopped by another individual standing at the door of the cabin.\nThe motorist then comes back to the booth window, attempts to slap the woman, and then tries to storm into the cabin again. After a long argument with the other individual standing at the back of the booth, the motorist returns to the cabin window and attempts to hit the woman - twice.\nThe video ends abruptly, not making it clear what happened at the end of the argument.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dev goswami", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india today", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gurgaon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:14.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e036494df7b0f40eb33721eb935caff9069344a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWjf5w6mSGwPk4HNsLwAdp.VBD12oPeXehSnCwZwcYZ8jpAMppXrdJaFRsAlfEDMJR79eLg3NHqyVO86PaiinMzTvpwPXa8UkXytucucBjF12GLU4Hs_t0Zw--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-laundry-cleaning/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Laundry &amp; Cleaning - Buy Laundry &amp; Cleaning at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "3 Tier Clothes Hanging & Drying Rack (Pink)", "title_full": "3 Tier Clothes Hanging & Drying Rack (Pink) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2000-12-31T18:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 156, "participants_count": 139, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "674f33d105ea82122af553685e46657df0bb1c00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWjf5w6mSGwPk4HNsLwAdp.VBD12oPeXehSnCwZwcYZ8jpAMppXrdJaFRsAlfEDMJR79eLg3NHqyVO86PaiinMzTvpwPXa8UkXytucucBjF11qSKADk5tuZrLfJZWfl3KC", "ord_in_thread": 116, "author": "muhammad", "published": "2017-11-28T10:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Patah retak", "text": "Baru pakai skali dah patah.

Photo: AP Secret scholar who battled Islamic State goes public 1 / 5 Back to Gallery But over three years, his double life grew too heavy to bear. His secrets consumed him, sapping the energy he needed to work on his doctoral dissertation and to help Mosul rebuild. In face-to-face conversations with AP reporters over the course of two months, he agonized over how to end the anonymity. The day he revealed his identity to the world, Mohammed told AP: \"I feel free.\" He received scores of media requests, and on Facebook and Twitter, his fans poured out their feelings. Tahani Saleh posted on Facebook: \"When death was sweeping over us, you said: We are the life. I am very proud of you, Omar.\" Bella Oskar, a member of the \"Women of Mosul\" Facebook group, wrote, \"I used to read what you posted on Mosul and your love for it and for its people. The voice of Mosul reached the world by the son of Mosul.\" Mohammed decided to reveal his identity for his thousands of readers and followers, for all his volunteers in Mosul who have been inspired by a man they have never seen. But above all, he did it in memory of his older brother, who died in the final battle for the Iraqi city, and for his grieving mother. \"I can't be anonymous anymore. This is to say that I defeated ISIS. You can see me now, and you can know me now,\" he told AP. Mohammed first posted about the Islamic State group under his own Facebook account, in the first few days after its fighters swept into the city, but a friend warned him he risked being killed. A newly minted teacher with a reputation for secular ideas, he lost his university job when IS took over. On June 18, 2014, he became Mosul Eye. His motto: Trust no one, document everything. \"My job as a historian requires an unbiased approach which I am going to adhere to and keep my personal opinion to myself,\" he wrote on that first day. Mosul Eye became one of the outside world's main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself. Much of what he collected went on the blog. Other details he kept in his computer, for fear of blowing his cover. Someday, he promised, he would write history with them. Mohammed's information sometimes included photos of the fighters and commanders, complete with biographies surreptitiously pieced together during the course of his normal life \u2014 that of an out-of-work scholar living at home. When intelligence agencies made contact with Mosul Eye, he rebuffed them. \"I am not a spy or a journalist,\" he would say. \"I tell them this: If you want the information, it's published and it's public for free. Take it.\" His computer hard drive filled with death, filed according to date, cause of death, perpetrator, neighborhood and ethnicity. Accompanying each spreadsheet entry was a separate file with observations from each day. \"IS is forcing abortions and tubal ligation surgeries on Yazidi women,\" he wrote in unpublished notes from January 2015. A doctor told him there had been between 50 and 60 forced abortions and a dozen Yazidi girls younger than 15 died of injuries from repeated rapes. April 19, 2015: \"The forensics department received the bodies of 23 IS militants killed in Baiji. They had no shrapnel, no bullets, no explosives and the cause of death does not seem to be explosion. It is like nothing happened to the bodies. A medical source believes they were exposed to poison gas.\" July 7, 2015: \"43 citizens were executed in different places, this time by gunfire, which is unusual because they were previously beheadings. A source inside IS said that 13 of those who were executed are fighters and they tried to flee.\" Finally, he decided it was time to get out. On Dec. 15, 2015, he left with a smuggler whom he paid $1,000. Overnight, Mohammed had transferred the contents of his computer to a hard-drive that he packed with him. Once in Europe, Mosul Eye kept at his mission: via WhatsApp and Viber, from Facebook messages and long conversations with friends and relatives who had contacts within IS. By mid-2016, deaths were piling up faster than he could record. The Islamic State group was on a hunt for traitors and the airstrikes were taking an increasing toll on everyone. His records grew haphazard, and he turned to Twitter to document the atrocities. In February 2017, he received asylum in Europe. After he posted his name on Facebook, among the dozens of responses one from Safwan al-Madani stood out: \"You defied all expectation and speculation about who you are. We waited for so long for this moment.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "viber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul eye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omar mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tigris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:14.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "59a54fdb1b4d0e8be5ff776baebfc1b06d5e467c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_0wqT7Ae5UJvzJ_c9Ah3oBLmUPfpyarcUtUL_89Y2t_sVKtpcTVjh8T7gBuZPe78JpYB3COpdjsvUxSfw81ZYRwDQHJuJ5j7AoIuSWtR3jtMWVrM2PJl_RXcgnG_bSvSQPO9ioYapx0g--", "site_full": "www.beaumontenterprise.com", "site": "beaumontenterprise.com", "site_section": "http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/world/collectionRss/News-World-Heds-7344.php", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News World Heds", "title": "Hamas leader calls for new uprising against Israel in wake of US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital", "title_full": "Hamas leader calls for new uprising against Israel in wake of US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/img/pages/article/opengraph_default.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "59a54fdb1b4d0e8be5ff776baebfc1b06d5e467c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_0wqT7Ae5UJvzJ_c9Ah3oBLmUPfpyarcUtUL_89Y2t_sVKtpcTVjh8T7gBuZPe78JpYB3COpdjsvUxSfw81ZYRwDQHJuJ5j7AoIuSWtR3jtMWVrM2PJl_RXcgnG_bSvSQPO9ioYapx0g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hamas leader calls for new uprising against Israel in wake of US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital", "text": "Menu Sections http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/world/article/Hamas-leader-calls-for-new-uprising-against-12412257.php Hamas leader calls for new uprising against Israel in wake of US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital Updated 3:20 am, Thursday, December 7, 2017 GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 Hamas leader calls for new uprising against Israel in wake of US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:14.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "263e8e3a04c8671dffc23d3cf39745c7d550ae98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1qYAv4T9RGhMfOnrDdqLmg-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "263e8e3a04c8671dffc23d3cf39745c7d550ae98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1qYAv4T9RGhMfOnrDdqLmg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "<?php\n          $args=array(\n            'name' => 'category',\n            'public'   => true,\n            '_builtin' => true\n\n          );\n          $output = 'names';

Act of Congress Alabama string band shares stage with Symphony NH By CHRIS BIERI Act of Congress, an Americana group shown here performing with the Alabama Symphony Orchestra, next will team with Symphony NH for a pair of shows. (Facebook) If you go... WHAT: Symphony NH Holiday Ops featuring Act of CongressWHEN & WHERE: 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Keefe Center for the Arts, 117 Elm St., Nashua; 3 p.m. Sunday at Concord City Auditorium, 2 Prince St., ConcordTICKETS: $18-$49, with discounts for seniors and studentsINFO: www.symphonynh.org Act of Congress has taken a circuitous route to the musical realm it now inhabits. The Alabama string band started off as acolytes of the ambitious, progressive bluegrass played by a band like Nickel Creek. But in the past 10 years, the group has started performing with symphonies and has produced a pair of Christmas albums. \u201cI want to be the acoustic version of Trans-Siberian Orchestra,\u201d guitarist Chris Griffin said. The group brings that diversity of sound to a pair of holiday pops performances in Keene and Concord this weekend with Symphony NH, which will be helmed by guest conductor Joseph R. Olefirowicz.After meeting in college, Griffin formed Act of Congress with Adam Wright, who was a piano player at the time. \u201cNickel Creek, in the beginning they were really an inspiration for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all come from diverse backgrounds, but that band had the melting-pot effect and the musicianship and the harmony. None of us grew up in the bluegrass world. We\u2019re a little bit of an outcast from that perspective.\u201dThe band\u2019s name, which Griffin said he would\u2019ve changed had he known the band would endure for nearly a decade, is a reference to their sparse practice schedule.\u201cIt\u2019s going to take an act of Congress to get us together,\u201d he joked.Once it became established as an acoustic string band, the group started to bring other influences into the fold. Act of Congress\u2019 interest in collaborating with symphonies started on a local level in Alabama after a chance discussion with the director of the state symphony.\u201cI didn\u2019t know very much about symphonies, especially the business end,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cSymphonies are in an interesting place. They\u2019re trying to find things that appeal to a new generation of people that aren\u2019t strictly fans of classical music. Our instrumentation ... we\u2019re really into high musicianships. It really blends well with the orchestra.\u201dGriffin admitted feeling some nerves when the group started playing with larger orchestral groups. \u201cI freak out all the time. We start in October for the preparation for this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe write several of these songs a year. You never think you\u2019ll have to put them together into one show. There\u2019s a lot of practice and a lot of variables. When you realize the audience isn\u2019t just hearing you, they\u2019re hearing 70 of you, it gets to be one cool wall of sound.\u201dThe band has earned its chops, in part by being relentless live players. In 2012, the group auditioned to play with American Music Abroad, the State Department program that sends musicians to other countries as cultural ambassadors. Symphony NH Executive Director Marc Thayer was working with American Voices at the time, the State Department\u2019s contractor for organizing and booking the tours. \u201cOut of 300 bands that auditioned, they were one of 10 bands chosen to tour that year and in subsequent years,\u201d Thayer said in an email.Act of Congress played in Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries and traveled with Thayer to Liberia right after the Ebola crisis.Along the way, Act of Congress has been able to dive into another passion \u2014 holiday music. The band released an EP titled \u201cChristmas Vol. 1\u201d in 2011 and followed it up with \u201cThe Christmas Collection\u201d in 2016, and annually Act of Congress performs a battery of Christmas performances.\u201cI see our Christmas show as something that\u2019s very unique and different,\u201d Griffin said. That combination of talent and range made Act of Congress a great fit for the Symphony NH holidays shows, according to Thayer.\u201cI knew that their music would be a good fit with our holiday celebrations, and the audiences here in New Hampshire love bluegrass, country, folk music, patriotic music and traditional holiday songs that we\u2019ve known since childhood,\u201d Thayer said. \u201cThe band\u2019s arrangements for orchestra are very high quality and fun for the symphony musicians to play. And the band members are each such fine instrumentalists and singers I knew that this would be a fun change for our regular audience members as well as new people, families, everyone that loves the holidays.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris griffin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam wright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris bieri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marc thayer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph r. olefirowicz.after", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thayer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "griffin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "symphony nh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "concord city auditorium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama symphony orchestra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast asian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nickel creek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keefe center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nashua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince st.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "concord", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:14.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c30e2bebb444952a685c879e67747ddc0ee7aca9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdhdtyEekhwK.4.bckVevBX0EHrybsPT_holl2_iZ9jHqS3PiMpnKUMBCtzPNLnHsJDLUxxPFb0vF4xDIN911nrIs3GGTSAAQ-", "site_full": "hudsonvalley.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://hudsonvalley.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist hudson valley | for sale search", "title": "Handmade Columns (Poughkeepsie)", "title_full": "Handmade Columns (Poughkeepsie)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c30e2bebb444952a685c879e67747ddc0ee7aca9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdhdtyEekhwK.4.bckVevBX0EHrybsPT_holl2_iZ9jHqS3PiMpnKUMBCtzPNLnHsJDLUxxPFb0vF4xDIN911nrIs3GGTSAAQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "Handmade Columns (Poughkeepsie)", "text": "QR Code Link to This Post 2 Handmade columns - marble based SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY - PLEASE CALL FOR PRICE & INFO MUST SELL!!!

Morgan Schneiderlin says he wants to prove a point against Apollon Limassol and has denied reports he was sent away from Everton's training ground for a perceived lack of effort last month. Morgan Schneiderlin admits he has a point to prove and is desperate to make the most of a \"fresh start\" under Sam Allardyce. \nThe Frenchman, who has been named in an experimental squad for the Europa League meeting against Apollon Limassol on Thursday, is focused on re-establishing himself as a regular starter for the Toffees. \nSchneiderlin is targeting the trip to Cyprus as a chance to impress new Everton manager Allardyce, who has not travelled , and the rest of his coaching staff ahead of Nissan Super Sunday's Merseyside derby. Liverpool vs Everton Get Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \n\"Since I (started to) play football, in every game you have something to prove,\" said Schneiderlin. \n\"That is part of being a football player. Every game you have to show what you can do and there is not going to be any difference (against Limassol). We are going to do our maximum to win the game. Everton look set to field a string of fringe players and youngsters as their Europa League campaign comes to an end at Apollon Limassol. \n\"It is a game for everyone to show themselves and prove they can play. Afterwards it is going to be the manager's decision. It's going to be a chance to get game time, the rhythm of playing, enjoy yourself and finish the campaign on a good note. You just have to give your maximum - that is all that you can control.\" \nThe former Manchester United and Southampton player also denied reports that he and Kevin Mirallas were sent away from Everton's training ground for a perceived lack of effort at the beginning of November, leading to the pair's subsequent absence from their 3-2 victory over Watford. Morgan Schneiderlin will aim to impress Sam Allardyce when the Toffees face Apollon Limassol on Thursday \nWhen he was asked for his version of the training ground incident, he said: \"I read about it in the newspaper and I was surprised as I could be because there was no incident. It was a surprise for me - I made a statement (at the time) on social media that it was fake news and not true. \u2014 Morgan Schneiderlin (@SchneiderlinMo4) November 6, 2017 \n\"That is the only thing I will say about it because I want to turn the page. It was not nice for me to see that but it is part of football and I have to deal with it.\" \n\"I want to prove (myself) in every game. Of course there is a new management team so it is a fresh start for everyone. I haven't had the chance to play the last two games but it is going to be up to me to show what I can do and that I can make a difference for the team.\" Derby Day is coming on Sky Sports, with Manchester United taking on Manchester City and Liverpool playing hosts to Everton.

Perfect for a bedroom.\nThe night light feature is nice as it has two brightness's and consists of a nice blue light that illuminates the room ,but not too bright as to be distracting.\nThe power cord is just short of 6 ft so you have lots of cord for placement choice.\nThe filter is located at the bottom and is easily accessed by flipping the unit upside down and giving the bottom a slight turn counter-clockwise to open .\nThe removal and installation of the filter is really quite effortless and can be done in seconds.\nOverall Levoit has done a great job in the units appearance, functionality and workmanship.\nBecause of its compact size and only 28 watts of power consumption this one will be going in my RV stars: 5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:17.010+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15101613, "moreResultsAvailable": 15101513, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640577010&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 374}
