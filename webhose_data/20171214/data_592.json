The British Punjabi!", "text": " \n \n \nBalbir Prithviraj Kapoor aka Shashi Kapoor was born in THE Kapoor clan which had greats like his father Prithviraj, brothers Raj and Shammi. The father had a towering personality both physically and by reputation! Raj Kapoor proved to be the showman par excellence and proved his mettle through his career. Shammi was Shammi who was years ahead of time, his flamboyance was ahead of many international stars! To shine amongst such personalities in the family is what shows how Shashi Kapoor was different! Shashi Kapoor was the debonair, handsome person with a personality not matching the film industry. In those days the filmy guys hardly completed school but Shashi had picked elegance, sophistication and elan to match the international stars.\nSince Shashi Kapoor was a film personality, I am pushing videos of a couple of songs from his movies, though they are irrelevant, as is done in any movie!\nHere is one song from the movie Jab Jab Phool Khile!\nShashi as a human being was people\u2019s person. I had an opportunity to see him from about 10 feet distance a couple of times; once during the shooting of the film Chor Machaye Shor and another time when he was the chief guest for musical competition in Pune while I was in college. Both the times he never appeared to have airs of the film hero that he was! He appeared to be easily chatting and doing gapshap with people around.\nI have seen Devanand, Waheeda Rehman, Anil Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit, Sanjay Dutt and Rakesh Roshan from close quarters. But the smartness and elegance Shashi displayed probably only Waheeda came near to him! My friend and actor Dr. Mohan Agashe said, \u201cThe films did not and could not really capture the real handsome that Shashi Kapoor was!\u201d I am sure that when you see or meet someone in person energy oozes out of some persons. If a person is really a good person, there is some aura created; especially in case Shashi this happened as he was very good looking too! The slightly crooked teeth he had added to his personality!\nIn the decade of 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s the film actors did not have much education nor did they get opportunities for education. In spite of that Shashi had great sophistication and was a natural. Especially in foreign locale, his savoir faire (the ability to act or speak appropriately in social situations) was to be seen to be believed. According his costar Simi Garewal, she was always astonished to see Shashi at great ease in foreign countries. She has shared one story. They were in Italy in a restaurant for dinner. One lady saw them; she just left her husband in his seat and ran towards Shashi. It was a very embarrassing situation as husband came and there was a big shouting match between husband and wife. Shashi somehow was all sophistication personified and resolved the issue very smoothly. Still the wife gave him a flying kiss while going away! Shashi just chuckled!\nOne song from his movie Pyar Kiye Ja!\nShashi married Jennifer Kendal and she became his life\u2019s anchor! They had a great marriage and had three children. Jennifer\u2019s father and Jennifer were from Shakespeare drama school and Shashi could do things to his liking in their company. He did some of his semi art movies 36 Chauranghi Lane, Siddharth, Junoon during that phase. None of them of course made much money. He started Prithvi theater which he thought was his life\u2019s greatest achievement.\nTo make money he worked in typical Hindi films. He had a great partnership and camaraderie with Amitabh Bacchan. They did so many movies together that it was jokingly said that Amitabh had Shashi\u2019s power of attorney with him! \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u093e \u0939\u0948 ! This is the famous dialogue by Shashi from the movie Deewar! In commercial films this was during Shashi\u2019s peak. He did many films, danced and sang many songs but I am not sure that his heart was really in it! This is the commercial reality of his life. He looked a bit awkward while dancing and running around the trees.\nShashi also had humane side which was not known to many. Journalist Khalid Mohmad has shared a few gems. He would go for breakfast to Shashi\u2019s home, a typical British Breakfast courtesy Jennifer! Shashi made sure that guests preferences were perfectly managed, and bacon was never included! Khalid in his initial phase would be short of funds like everyone else. Shashi brought him a box full of socks from Harrods on his next trip to London! Shashi\u2019s driver\u2019s daughter got married in Nashik; due to prior shooting commitments Shashi could not attend it. Shashi arranged a reception for the married couple in Mumbai later at a suitable date!\nWhat will Shashi Kapoor be remembered for? His handsome looks, his sophistication, his humane nature? Or he will be remembered for his bright smile, fresh face? Or his persistence in running Prithvi theatre? Only time will tell!\nAdios Shashi, my friend! (Somehow, I always felt that he was a friend) I know you lost the zeal to live life after Jennifer died; she was your anchor and maybe you felt rudderless! Now that you two are joined together again, show HIM the Shakespeare walla! One question you never answered. Were your British or you were a Punjabi?\nLet me say al vida to you with a heavy heart and moist eyes!\n\n\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shashi kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balbir prithviraj kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohan agashe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chor machaye shor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waheeda rehman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siddharth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khalid mohmad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rakesh roshan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanjay dutt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madhuri dixit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer kendal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shashi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khalid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raj kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakespeare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adios shashi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prithviraj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chauranghi lane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shammi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anil kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waheeda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amitabh bacchan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "devanand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simi garewal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amitabh", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "shammi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nashik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:21.061+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f9e174de85cd6a65c75437dc1f814e4d6a03287f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWCcaE8CyNtfdYo_KrYdBa8VppyNPnV5SEWFlA_G497O6XRVyH_pjlt1NH2ZJOL.5c0Eg70eYzlbUL.a2VpjjQ3njU6rMNle8VLvm9LmUCPVoYvZhWapzcDCJcCzDpdLNiUAKkMEEc8Vcibg_uQTEwZA--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-womens-flat-shoes/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Flat Shoes -

This follows a similar expansion in the lineup of Mercedes-AMG and Audi S and RS models in recent years, with an accompanying uptick in sales performance. \nAccording to Autocar , this development is being spearheaded by the new G80 BMW M3 sedan and its G82 and G83 M4 coup\u00e9 and convertible siblings. \u201cAlong with the M5, the M3 is a crucial car for BMW M,\u201d said BMW M boss Frank van Meel. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the first fully-fledged M car but it continues to stand for everything the brand is based upon.\u201d \nSet to be unveiled at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show, it will ride on BMW\u2019s modular CLAR platform and utilise a greater proportion of aluminium and high-strength steel, plus a number of carbon fibre components to drop its weight below even the new 1,585 kg M3 CS , despite being larger than ever before. \nThe next BMW M3 is set to be lighter than even the current hardcore M3 CS \nContrary to earlier reports, the new M3 and M4 won\u2019t use a hybrid powertrain \u2013 instead, sources say they will continue to use the existing 3.0 litre twin-turbocharged straight-six, albeit with both mechanical and software upgrades claimed to boost power by nearly 10% to 465 hp \u2013 21 hp more than the outgoing model with the Competition Package and nine more than the CS. \nA six-speed manual gearbox will continue to be offered alongside a new eight-speed automatic, sources said, adding that the car will remain rear-wheel drive after plans to provide the M3 and M4 with the fully-variable all-wheel drive system from the new F90 M5 were nixed due to cost and weight concerns. \nThe new M3 and M4 will be part of the 26 new cars coming in the next two years, including 11 hardcore M models and 15 mid-range M Performance variants. The former will include M versions of the new X3 and X4 , along with the already-confirmed M8 and yes, the Z4 M, making a welcome return in the next generation. The M8, X3 M and Z4 M are all in the pipeline \nAlso slated for release are M Performance versions of the new X2 and X7 , along with next-gen 3 Series \u2013 taking on the upcoming Mercedes-AMG GLA 35, GLE 43 and C 43 respectively. Other models like M Performance 4 Series coup\u00e9, convertible and Gran Turismo (n\u00e9e 3 Series Gran Turismo) models are being considered but have yet to be green-lighted. \nMore track-biased models like the M3 and M4 CS are also being planned, with an M2 version coming next year with over 400 hp and various aerodynamic and weight-saving upgrades. On the other end of the spectrum is an M Performance version of the new front-wheel drive 1 Series said to be currently in early development, set to take on the Audi S3 and the upcoming Mercedes-AMG A 35 . \nSharing componentry with the X2 M Performance model, it is set to gain all-wheel drive and a hopped-up version of the ubiquitous 2.0 litre turbo four-cylinder engine, mounted transversely in a BMW M first.

Then, former BLACK PANTHER writer Christopher Priest will be joined by artist Mike Perkins for a story starring friend of Wakanda Everett K. Ross. And last but not least, the man behind \u201cWho is The Black Panther?\u201d and the director the recent film \u201cMarshall\u201d\u2014starring the MCU\u2019s T\u2019Challa himself, Chadwick Boseman\u2014will reunite with artist Ken Lashley for a sequel of sorts to their classic, \u201cBlack To The Future!\u201d \nWe reached out to each of these legends to pick their brains about coming to a character they left such indelible marks on. \nMarvel.com: What excited you most about returning to Black Panther? \nReginald Hudlin: When I was told that the book would feature me, Christopher Priest, and Don McGregor each doing Black Panther stories, it just felt historic. I knew I had to be a part of it. \nChristopher Priest: Nothing. Seriously, nothing at all. It was terrifying. \nMy original run, especially the Marvel Knights installments, have finally found an audience. When we were actually doing the book, we literally couldn\u2019t give copies away. There was enormous sales resistance and a lot of literal hate\u2014and threats\u2014from fans outraged that we gave Panther an iPhone. Seriously; there was this anti-tech backlash, \u201cpurists\u201d who, from what I could tell, were confusing Black Panther with Tarzan. Panther is not Tarzan. \nSo, in those days, I\u2019d spend a lot of energy engaging these fans and trying to please, please, sir, get them to go read FANTASTIC FOUR #52 and learn who Panther really is rather than who so many fans apparently believed he was\u2014some kind of caveman or maybe Ka-Zar. He\u2019s not Ka-Zar. He is ruler of one of the most technologically advanced societies in the world. Yes, dude, he can use an iPhone. \nDon McGregor: It was excitement I felt when [editor] Wil Moss first approached me about coming back to write the Panther after being away from T\u2019Challa for decades. I loved writing him, and I spent years with T\u2019Challa\u2019s voice in my head, trying to \u201chear\u201d not only him, but all the characters in Wakanda around him. \nI actually wrote that I was of the mind not to do it up on my Facebook page. I did not want to disappoint the readers who held such love for these characters, and how much, over the years, these stories had meant to them. The worst fear the storyteller can have, I suppose, is that you come back with a short piece and the reaction is \u201cMan, Don had it back then; he should have left it alone!\u201d But, when I wrote about it in the social media so many people responded that they wanted me to do it, I began to re-appraise accepting while I was visiting my daughter in California. \nMarvel.com: How do you feel about the character\u2019s growing pop cultural profile, with his appearance in \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d and now his own upcoming film? \nDon McGregor: I think it\u2019s terrific! The Panther has always been an important super hero in opening up the comics medium to the different kinds of characters and stories that can be told. I spent years of my life with him, so there becomes an intimacy of daily contact with each other, of staying open to what you can do as you continue to write the next issue. You often spend more time with the title characters of your series than you do with many of the people you know. It becomes a part of you, facing the next page, the next panel, trying to get it as right as you can in the moment you are creating it. \nI thought Chadwick Boseman [brought] the right combination of grace and momentum and solemnity and strength to The Black Panther that was always the way I saw him. I am so glad [Marvel staffer] Peter Charpentier made it possible for me to meet with Chadwick during the San Diego Comic-Con this last summer. \nChristopher Priest: Well, I certainly think it\u2019s great. Chadwick Boseman\u2019s end-of-innocence portrayal of a young T\u2019Challa elevated the game for African\u2014and African American\u2014super heroes. \nReginald Hudlin: I remember all the Black Panther scripts that had been developed over the years. Almost all of them horrible. There were drafts where he grew up in housing projects in America with no idea of his royal heritage. Just ghastly perversions of the original concept. \nSo, when then-Executive Editor Axel Alonso and I sat down to talk about what was originally conceived to be a [limited series], I wanted to tell the story right. I didn\u2019t know if there would ever be a movie, but I wanted to create a document that would tell fans who he was and be a blueprint for what a movie should be. I haven\u2019t seen the film, but looking at how Klaw is portrayed and the inclusion of characters I created like Shuri, it looks like that is the case. Black Panther Annual #1 cover by Daniel Acuna \nMarvel.com: Are there differences to how you approach the character now versus your original run on the book? \nDon McGregor: Surely. You don\u2019t have to do months of research to write a 12 page story as compared with a nearly 200 page graphic novel like \u201cPanther\u2019s Rage.\u201d Back when I was first given the Panther to write there were multiple decisions that I had to make before I wrote one finished page. I not only read the comics; I had to research everything that would create the intricate details of Wakanda. Jack [Kirby] and Stan [Lee] had established it, but it was more a concept in those early stories, since they had a lot of characters with the Fantastic Four to interact with the Panther and whatever super villain they were fighting. \nIt was during those initial weeks that I discovered not one story had ever had anything to do with Ramonda, the Panther\u2019s mother, and I decided then that I would not mention her during \u201cPanther\u2019s Rage,\u201d that this would be one big complete story, and then I would do a story dealing with South Africa and Apartheid. This would become \u201cPanther\u2019s Quest,\u201d a story of a son, T\u2019Challa, searching for his mother in an oppressive, racist regime, and how difficult such a place could make on the emotional turmoil of a son searching for a mother he has lost since childhood, a human theme I hoped everyone could relate to, and care about. As you can see, I was already concerned about where T\u2019Challa\u2019s life would go after \u201cPanther\u2019s Rage,\u201d and before I wrote Book One of that series, I needed to know I had somewhere to go as a writer that would challenge me, but also make sure I was not writing the same story issue after issue. \nChristopher Priest: Well, yes, I suppose. When I was writing the character 20 years ago, the mission was simpler: this is a story about a guy you think you know but you\u2019ve, in fact, got him all wrong. Skip ahead 20 years, and now everybody is in on the joke. Reader expectation is different. Marvel Knights readers expected an overly serious homily on African culture, so we played against those expectations. Today\u2019s audience already knows T\u2019Challa is a capable\u2014and deadly\u2014adversary and technological genius, so I can\u2019t write those \u201cI can\u2019t believe he took out Mephisto with one punch!\u201d stories because, today\u2019s audience knows he can. \nReginald Hudlin: Some fans on my web site asked me what story I would write if I ever came back to the character. There are a few I have in mind, but my favorite is a big epic story called World War Wakanda. It would be one of the big companywide crossovers. I only had six pages to tell my story, so I did an epilogue where you get glimpses of the result of the story It also functions as a follow up to the \u201cBlack to The Future\u201d story I wrote for the very first BLACK PANTHER ANNUAL . \nMarvel.com: What do you think makes Black Panther such an iconic figure? \nDon McGregor: I suspect many people love the idea of a character who can move with such power and grace and [certainty], and look absolutely terrific doing so! But, I have the feeling, also, for many people that they admire and want a leader who truly does want to represent as many of his people as he can, and doesn\u2019t merely luxuriate in his power and abilities. I suspect we wish there were politicians that acted as honorably and with concern about all the people in their land. \nReginald Hudlin: He\u2019s the African equivalent of Captain America. In the same way Cap embodies all that is good about America, The Panther symbolizes all that is great about Africa. \nChristopher Priest: He\u2019s the black guy. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s be honest. He\u2019s the black guy. And he\u2019s not angry, he doesn\u2019t use slang or \u201cEbonics,\u201d he pulls his pants up, he keeps his word. Black Panther shames us\u2014all of us\u2014by his nobility. He may well be the single most noble guy on Earth. Do your best. Keep your word. It\u2019s all anyone can ask of you. \nT\u2019Challa\u2019s, like, the last noble man on earth. I am by no means anywhere near that noble, but I aspire to be well, if not good, at least as good as I personally can manage. That\u2019s the best any of us can do.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar\u2019s Fine Gael party surged into an 11-point lead in a poll on Thursday, gaining credit for the government\u2019s Brexit negotiating stance and indicating its recent near-collapse had not hurt his popularity. Ireland's Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar looks on at a news conference at Government Buildings in Dublin, Ireland December 6, 2017. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne Varadkar has played a key role in negotiations over Britain\u2019s withdrawl from the European Union this week, insisting that a tentative deal struck on the Irish border on Monday must be fulfilled if talks are to move onto the next phase, as London wants. That was in sharp contrast to a week earlier when his deputy prime minister had to resign to avert a government collapse and election before Christmas, an episode that members of Fine Gael feared would damage both the party and its leader. Yet support for Fine Gael rose by five points to 36 percent in the Irish Times/MRBI poll, while fellow centre-right rival Fianna Fail has fallen four points to 25 percent since October. The left-wing Sinn Fein party was unchanged on 19 percent. The most recent survey taken by another polling company, conducted during the government crisis, showed that the two main parties were almost neck and neck. The number of undecided voters was far higher in the MRBI sample. Satisfaction with the government also rose by five points to 41 percent in Thursday\u2019s poll, the highest level achieved by any government in almost a decade. \u201cToday\u2019s poll proves that timing is everything,\u201d said MRBI director Aisling Corcoran. \u201cInterviewing took place on Monday and Tuesday against the backdrop of Brexit negotiations and the government has been credited with approaching the negotiations with clarity and determination.\u201d Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Angus MacSwan", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leo varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aisling corcoran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/clodagh kilcoyne varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angus macswan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "padraic halpin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "government buildings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters staff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish times/mrbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sinn fein", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:24.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40cb817a8f3cc2b8d8c74bd46feb2573bfd045fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlRNQbuGr0BZgw0Oep68YAT", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ -
