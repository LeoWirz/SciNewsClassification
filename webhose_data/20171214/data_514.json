The study is a key step in preparation for CE-marking and European launch of the kit in early 2018. \nIn June 2017, Agendia announced an extension of its relationship with Agilent Technologies Inc. to develop an RNA sequencing-based version of its existing microarray-based MammaPrint and BluePrint tests. \nAdding the MammaPrint BluePrint Kit to Agendia\u2019s portfolio will enable cancer centers to run the tests on their existing next-generation sequencing (NGS) instruments in their own laboratories. Performing the test locally offers greater access so that more patients can benefit from the personalized treatment that these tests enable. \nThe study will involve UZ Leuven processing breast tumor samples from patients enrolled in the study using the NGS-based MammaPrint BluePrint Kit. Their results will be directly compared with those from the currently marketed MammaPrint microarray-based test, performed at the Company\u2019s Amsterdam CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory, to demonstrate the comparability of the two technologies. \nDr. Marjolaine Baldo, Commercial Vice President, EMEA at Agendia, said: \u201cUZ Leuven is one of the largest and most prestigious academic centers in Belgium and we are very pleased to have such a well-respected partner working alongside us to co-validate the performance of our decentralized kit. This is an exciting time for Agendia as co-validation is one of the final steps to complete before we launch our CE-marked MammaPrint BluePrint Kit in 2018. We look forward to providing both centralized and decentralized services, offering clinical labs, physicians and patients more choice in how they access these important tests.\u201d \nProf. Dr. Giuseppe Floris, Breast Pathologist at UZ Leuven, said: \u201cIt is a real honor for us to be part of this technological advancement of the MammaPrint and BluePrint tests to NGS. This validation study is fully in-line with the molecular diagnostic strategies promoted by UZ Leuven in recent years. It has been great to see the enthusiastic acceptance of this project by all colleagues in genetics, medical oncology, oncologic surgery, gynecology, the multidisciplinary breast center and pathology, and this will be instrumental for the positive results of this endeavor. We at UZ Leuven are very excited for the possible implications of the success of this challenge, especially because eventually it will improve the treatment of our breast cancer patients.\u201d \nAbout MammaPrint\u00ae MammaPrint is an in vitro diagnostic test, performed in a central laboratory, using the gene expression profile of breast cancer tissue samples to assess a patients\u2019 risk for distant metastasis. MammaPrint is cleared by the US FDA and carries the CE Mark, enabling the use of the test in the European Union. MammaPrint is indicated for use by physicians as a prognostic marker only, along with other clinical-pathological factors. The test is not intended to determine the outcome of disease, nor to suggest or infer an individual patient\u2019s response to therapy. \nAbout Agendia Agendia is a privately held, leading molecular diagnostics company that develops and markets genomic diagnostic products, which help support physicians with their complex treatment decisions. Agendia\u2019s breast cancer tests were developed using an unbiased gene selection by analyzing the complete human genome. Our offerings include the MammaPrint\u00ae 70-Gene Breast Cancer Risk-of-Recurrence Test, and the BluePrint\u00ae Molecular Subtyping Test that provide deeper insight leading to more clinically actionable breast cancer biology. \nIn addition, Agendia has a pipeline of other genomic products in development. The company collaborates with pharmaceutical companies, leading cancer centers and academic groups to develop companion diagnostic tests in the area of oncology. \nFor more information on Agendia or the MammaPrint and BluePrint tests, you can visit Agendia\u2019s patient site at www.KnowYourBreastCancer.com or the corporate site at www.agendia.com . \nFollow Agendia, Inc. on Facebook , Twitter , or LinkedIn to keep up-to-date with the latest news. \nContacts \nAshley Tapp / Lynne Trowbridge / Samantha Cheung+44 (0) 20 7866 7855 This email address is being protected from spambots.

Our previous paper showed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) played a crucial role in L-selectin- and PSGL-1-mediated F-actin redistribution and assembly during neutrophil rolling on E-selectin. However, it is not clear whether L-selectin and PSGL-1 induce other similar physiology events by PI3K. Here, we investigated the possibility of PI3K linking the signaling pathways of L-selectin and PSGL-1 to IL-18 transcription. We first demonstrated that L-selectin and PSGL-1 stimulation upregulated IL-18 transcription level in Jurkat cells. Then we found that PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced L-selectin- and PSGL-1-induced mRNA upregulation of IL-18 in Jurkat cells. Transfection of phosphatase and tensin homolog expressing plasmid inhibited the transcription level of IL-18. Therefore, PI3K is a signal linker between L-selectin and PSGL-1 in IL-18 transcriptional activation at the promoter level. To our knowledge, this is the first time to directly link PI3K to L-selectin- and PSGL-1-mediated IL-18 transcription, providing a foundation for intervention of PI3K-related inflammation.\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2iys6lu\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "jurkat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:18.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0815751e4f47f47b5108888b53f4c7e141278bb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IWMXfKGdnychxaebg8xzPyv5bwrUClHCccGdf6Hw_ZkhRlCw4QExVdKMYKjOf_FS5temJ6J0Bop51Rtbw.m1Bln7KLaI3n1dc.TEcwWJxSrCYl7e5dLVvE", "site_full": "english.republika.mk", "site": "republika.mk", "site_section": "http://english.republika.mk/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Republika Online", "title": "Final conference of programme for (self)employment of single mothers", "title_full": "Final conference of programme for (self)employment of single mothers", "published": "2017-12-07T10:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "MK", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://english.republika.mk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/132964395.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 98849, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0815751e4f47f47b5108888b53f4c7e141278bb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IWMXfKGdnychxaebg8xzPyv5bwrUClHCccGdf6Hw_ZkhRlCw4QExVdKMYKjOf_FS5temJ6J0Bop51Rtbw.m1Bln7KLaI3n1dc.TEcwWJxSrCYl7e5dLVvE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ana Cvetanoska", "published": "2017-12-07T10:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "Final conference of programme for (self)employment of single mothers", "text": "  \nFinal conference of EU-funded project \u201cProgramme for (Self) Employment of Single Mothers\u201d, implemented in Skopje, Bitola and Stip over the past year, will be held on Thursday. \nThe programme, implemented by the Business Confederation of Macedonia, Association of Business Women, and Institute for Management Support, was intended for preparation and enhancement of competence of women-single mothers on the labor market. \nTraining on development of business skills and vocational training were held over the course of the project.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gruevski", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "business confederation of macedonia, association of business women", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute for management support", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skopje", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:18.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89d0deee9a16d8d750e61fdeab6eda37e751e481", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT7ylkjS96DJtGy5_xNWbwwfPG4wxPx.B5Eb6xaWk9dOOmE_odh1YjRzgg8xYujzOZz1_39s8yObltFP3h4x4h5Krh0h4q.zb1ogfkxqkxMkOzoAwile2jtNthrRlgLM2o1wo9P2KJFNdXX2z5Kr9cW", "site_full": "www.usnews.com", "site": "usnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.usnews.com/rss/usnews", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "U.S. News", "title": "Erdogan Greek Trip Gets off on Wrong Foot Before It Starts", "title_full": "Erdogan Greek Trip Gets off on Wrong Foot Before It Starts", "published": "2017-12-07T09:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://media.beam.usnews.com/d0/70febcbd90b406a8c99dd373ab31b3/tag:reuters.com,2017:newsml_LYNXMPEDB60J2:12017-12-07T074906Z_1_LYNXMPEDB60J2_RTROPTP_3_ISRAEL-USA-TURKEY.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1027, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 15, "comments": 0, "shares": 15}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89d0deee9a16d8d750e61fdeab6eda37e751e481", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT7ylkjS96DJtGy5_xNWbwwfPG4wxPx.B5Eb6xaWk9dOOmE_odh1YjRzgg8xYujzOZz1_39s8yObltFP3h4x4h5Krh0h4q.zb1ogfkxqkxMkOzoAwile2jtNthrRlgLM2o1wo9P2KJFNdXX2z5Kr9cW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "Erdogan Greek Trip Gets off on Wrong Foot Before It Starts", "text": "Erdogan Greek Trip Gets off on Wrong Foot Before It Starts Dec. 7, 2017, at 2:49 a.m. Erdogan Greek Trip Gets off on Wrong Foot Before It Starts Share Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan addresses members of parliament from his ruling AK Party (AKP) during a meeting at the Turkish parliament in Ankara, Turkey, December 5, 2017. REUTERS/Umit Bektas Reuters \nBy Michele Kambas \nATHENS (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan was due to arrive in Greece for a two-day official visit on Thursday, a trip designed to boost relations but exposing long historical grievances between the two old foes. \nErdogan was scheduled to meet with President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Thursday. On Friday, he was due to travel to northern Greece and visit the Muslim community there. \nBut even before he landed, he riled his hosts with suggestions of revisions to a 1923 treaty, the Treaty of Lausanne, which established the borders of Turkey and therefore of Greece. \n\"This is a treaty that encompasses the entire region and just because of that, I think during the course of time, all treaties need a revision, and Lausanne in the face of the recent developments needs make up, a revision if you will,\" Erdogan told SKAI TV and Kathimerini newspaper in an interview. \nIn swift rebuttal, Greece said the treaty was non-negotiable, and suggestions that it be revised were not conducive to attempts to build relations. \n\"The Greek government, and the Prime Minister, expect that his (Erdogan's) visit will build bridges, not walls,\" government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said in a statement. \nThe two NATO partners teetered on the verge of war in 1974, 1987 and 1996 over long-running disputes on ethnically divided Cyprus, mineral rights in the Aegean Sea and sovereignty over uninhabited islets in that sea. \nAlthough relations have improved, many Greeks believe Turkey has territorial aspirations against their country. Turkey has also accused Greece of harboring individuals involved in the coup attempt against Erdogan in July 2016. \nSecurity was tight for the visit and demonstrations in central Athens were banned. \n\"They (Greeks) should rest assured that the negative relations between Greece and Turkey are part of history,\" Erdogan said. \n(Reporting By Michele Kambas, editing by Larry King) \nCopyright 2017 Thomson Reuters .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erdogan greek", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michele kambas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitris tzanakopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexis tsipras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prokopis pavlopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "skai tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bektas reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ak party", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cyprus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lausanne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aegean sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:18.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "500c47d36e92c6dce4715a401a608af2681aef03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRMrJx0VZ2G71OKYjgrzmGu.axNMJk0HBU100vwvS2.bhavje8vy388WOaypbzOpVRXVKOmg.W_pKz6K.cGC5X8Hcn6oHZ8phLViiS8eB02tY.jUg4PF3Rq", "site_full": "developer.atlassian.com", "site": "atlassian.com", "site_section": "https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/feed.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Atlassian Developers Blog", "title": "Announcing the Atlassian platform for developers roadmap", "title_full": "Announcing the Atlassian platform for developers roadmap", "published": "2017-12-06T18:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2318, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 17}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "500c47d36e92c6dce4715a401a608af2681aef03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRMrJx0VZ2G71OKYjgrzmGu.axNMJk0HBU100vwvS2.bhavje8vy388WOaypbzOpVRXVKOmg.W_pKz6K.cGC5X8Hcn6oHZ8phLViiS8eB02tY.jUg4PF3Rq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ralph Whitbeck (https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/ff8afa2e9f1fc4051af59af098a23aab?s=200)", "published": "2017-12-06T18:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Announcing the Atlassian platform for developers roadmap", "text": "Announcing the Atlassian platform for developers roadmap \nDecember 6th 2017 Ralph Whitbeck in Developer Experience , Atlassian Connect , Atlassian Marketplace , Roadmap \nBeing an open company is core to our culture at Atlassian .

But if this goes through and Jackman's Wolverine isn't in the next Avengers movie I'm gonna throw things.\nI'd rather they recast Wolverine, if they use him at all. I don't want any of the characters from Fox (with the exception of Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and everyone in that movie, especially Colossus) to transfer over to the MCU. Jackman was a good Logan (though a bit tall and not quite as hairy, ugly, and gruff as he should be) but it's time to let it go. Halle Berry was ALWAYS an awful Storm and the one in Apocalypse was terrible, too.

They also said that the Yadav faction had on November 23 withdrawn their earlier plea on the same issue. \nTo this, senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Nizam Pasha, appearing for Rajasekaran, said the earlier plea was withdrawn as the poll panel had not given reasons for its decision in its earlier order of November 17. \nKumar and Yadav had parted ways after the former had decided to join hands with the BJP in July, triggering a battle for the control of the party. \nThe Sharad Yadav faction had earlier moved the high court against the EC\u2019s November 17 order which had ruled in favour of Kumar\u2019s faction with regard to which group was the real JD(U), but the poll panel had not given reasons for arriving at the decision. The poll panel gave a reasoned order on November 25. \nRajasekaran, in his plea, has sought the setting aside of the November 25 order of the EC. \nThe earlier plea was moved by Gujarat MLA Chottubhai Vasava, who was then the acting president of the Yadav faction of the JD(U). \nKumar\u2019s faction had told the court that its members have already filed nominations with the \u2018Arrow\u2019 symbol as the EC had ruled in their favour. \nFollowing the rift with Kumar, Yadav had claimed that by ending the alliance with Lalu Prasad Yadav\u2019s RJD and deserting the greater \u2018grand alliance\u2019, Kumar had gone against the party\u2019s national executive\u2019s decision to oppose the BJP. \nAs the rift widened, Yadav held a \u2018national executive\u2019 conclave of the JD(U) here where Vasava was appointed the acting president. \nVasava, who is also the Gujarat unit party chief and a six-term MLA, had approached the ECI staking claim over the party and its poll symbol \u2018Arrow\u2019. Yadav has all along maintained that the faction led by him was the real JD(U). \nThe EC, in its November 17 order, had said the group led by Kumar \u201chas demonstrated overwhelming majority support\u201d in the legislature wing as well as the majority in the national council of the party, which is the apex organisational body of the JD(U). \nHowever, Vasava\u2019s counsel had contended that the EC had relied on the \u201cdisputed\u201d election of the national council and said that the party led by Yadav was the real JD(U).

It celebrates the conception of Mary within the womb of St Anne and dates back to the seventh century for the Eastern Church and eighth century for the Western Church. \nTwo Franciscans helped develop the theology that Mary\u2019s Immaculate Conception was necessary to ensure Jesus\u2019 birth was also without original sin since children take on characteristics of both parents. Franciscan Father Don Miller noted in a FranciscanMedia.org reflection, that the angel Gabriel, speaking on God\u2019s behalf, addresses Mary as \u201cfull of grace.\u201d Her role in salvation history meant she had to be sinless from the outset. \nThe Catholic dogma that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was free from original sin from the moment of her conception and preserved from all sin throughout her earthly life was declared by Pope Pius IX in 1854. The feast is fixed nine months before the feast marking Mary\u2019s birthday on Sept. 8. Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception is the patron of the United States and 10 other nations in South America, Africa, Asia and Europe.

Activation of the IFN-\u03b3 and its downstream interleukin-12 (IL-12) pathway can correct these diseases. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a cytokine signaling inhibitor that blocks downstream pathways of IFN-\u03b3 by blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathways. Oxymatrine (OMT), a quinolizidine alkaloid extracted from the herbal medicine Radix Sophorae flavescentis , is used to treat allergic skin diseases in China. The non-cytotoxic concentrations of OMT in HaCaT cells were determined through 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were used to stimulate HaCaT cells, and OMT was added to this system with tacrolimus (FK506) as a positive control. The mRNAs of cytokines, MDC, ICAM-1, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, and IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFN-\u03b3R)\u03b1 were detected by RT-PCR. Western blot analyses were performed to assess activation of the MAPK (p38, Jun N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and Akt signaling pathways. OMT increased the mRNA levels of the IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3R\u03b1, reduced the mRNA levels of ICAM-1, MDC, and SOCS1. But FK506 increased the mRNA levels of IL12 and inhibited the expression of ICAM-1 mRNAs and had no effects on the IFN-\u03b3R\u03b1, MDC, and SOCS1 mRNA in HaCaT cells stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. Thus, the mechanisms through which OMT and FK506 ameliorate allergic skin diseases differ.\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2BHtnOL\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "downregulates mdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mdc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:19.056+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1032c330bd3d0d2d69552f17aab84a3c637baa80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED8VZnY.sAuGDQm.esCwmXxbR6hb5kDhnwrx.xXHZUclBHJ7pBKb.BlKMtk8yDHsdMybc5etz8CTobhs2OFMi3DEb8yEuoKC_x_HKh3lDoh6udBgk7zDid55BT2.QgwQ3a9fw9hUyJdyuV7uCes9dD5h", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/entertainment/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Entertainment links", "title": "(9828651) The X-Men and The Fantastic Four may become part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as early as next week", "title_full": "FARK.com: (9828651) The X-Men and The Fantastic Four may become part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as early as next week", "published": "2017-12-07T05:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 20, "participants_count": 95, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.044, "main_image": "http://img.fark.net/images/cache/orig/a/aG/fark_aGnInBK-ePbSoFPa5pD6MDvnGDM.jpg?t=_ihb4QZrmOZZ7OfA3NpzJQ&amp;f=1512968400", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3382, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ea9bbb7d6d1b196dffcaebeda519eac942ba6641", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED8VZnY.sAuGDQm.esCwmXxbR6hb5kDhnwrx.xXHZUclBHJ7pBKb.BlKMtk8yDHsdMybc5etz8CTobhs2OFMi3DEb8yEuoKC_x_HKh3lDoh6udBgk7zDid55BT2.QgwQ3a9fw9hUyJdyuap7G6w5G40ioO94HNhG4ko-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "RyansPrivates", "published": "2017-12-07T06:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "WilderKWight : HideAndGoFarkYourself: Fine.

The victims were in a Toyota Corolla, driven by an estate agent, Jerry Akinlabi, when the incident happened. Ogogo and Emeagwai are Akinlabi\u2019s girlfriend and friend respectively. Punch  Metro learnt that a team of five policemen, including Abua, had flagged down Ogogo at a checkpoint along Igbuzo Market. One of the policemen, identified as Nwokolo, was said to have demanded money from Akinlabi and the driver told him that he did not have N200 to give him. Nwokolo reportedly said he would take one of the N1,000 notes Jerry had on him. As Akinlabi drove off from the checkpoint, Abua reportedly shot at the car and bullets pierced the back of the vehicle, hitting Ogogo, who sat at the back seat. The bullet also grazed the back of Emeagwai, who was at the passenger\u2019s seat.  Akinlabi told a Punch correspondent that four cops, including the team leader, one ASP Akhabue, were detained by the police, while Abua evaded arrest.  He said, \u201cOn Sunday, November 17, 2017, I was driving to the Igbuzor Market and on getting to a checkpoint, I met the policemen. We knew one another some months ago when I had an issue concerning a property at the station. I sounded the horn to greet them, but they did not respond.  \u201cOne of them used his gun to hit the boot and I reversed. He said I wanted to beat the checkpoint. I told him that I assumed that they knew me very well and apologised. He demanded money. I wanted to give him N100 or N200, but it was N1,000 notes I had on me and I explained to him. \u201cHe said, \u2018Am I too small to collect N1,000?\u2019 When I declined to give him N1,000, he asked me to pull over, which I did. As the argument over N1,000 got heated, I entered my car and drove off. What I heard next was three gunshots aimed at my car. \u201cA bullet pierced into the car, hit my girlfriend\u2019s body, came out and hit my friend in the back.\u201d The 22-year-old indigene of Oyo State said he took the victims to a general hospital in Igbuzo, from where Ogogo was referred to the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba. He said he called a senior police officer at Asaba who notified the state Commissioner of Police of the incident. He said, \u201cThe CP and the DPO of the Igbozo Police Station came to the FMC and deposited N100,000, but I have spent much more than that. Meanwhile, the policeman who shot at us had gone to drop the gun at the station and fled.  The other four policemen were detained at the command headquarters. My friend and I wrote our statements there.\u201d Akinlabi explained that a police officer asked him to drop his car key to aid investigation. He added that he handed over the car key, but activated the steering lock because he suspected foul play. He said he met with the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Zone 5, Benin, Edo State, who assigned a policeman to take his statement, adding that the policeman came down to the police command, Asaba, the following day.  \u201cAs I was returning from Zone 5 on Monday, I received a call from the Investigating Police Officer at the police headquarters in Asaba and he asked for the steering key. The IPO and a policeman came down to the hospital and I told them I would have to look for the key when I got home. \u201cThe policeman sent from Zone 5 invited my friend to the police headquarters in Asaba to write his statement too. When he got there, he saw some policemen moving the car. He called to ask me if I gave them the key to unlock the steering and I said no. When I called the IPO, he confirmed what my friend said and he told me that there was no cause for alarm.\u201d He said the command returned his car washed, with the bullet holes on the vehicle covered and painted, lamenting that he had not heard from the command and zone 5. Akinlabi\u2019s girlfriend, Ogogo, who spoke to Punch Metro from the hospital, said she was on the telephone when the bullet hit her. \u201cThat was the last thing I remembered until I found myself at the hospital,\u201d she added. Emeagwai urged the police authorities not to sweep the case under the carpet, saying the policemen must be punished. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason for the shooting. I have been going to the FMC to treat the gunshot injury for about three weeks now. The policemen should not go scot-free.\u201d Harrison Gwamnishu, the Coordinator of Behind Bars, a rights group, which Akinlabi contacted on the matter, said the group would institute a legal action against the police. He said, \u201cWe want to charge the case to court as a civil matter. It is barbaric. Why did the police wash the bloodstains in the car and covered the bullet holes without the consent of the owner?\u201d The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Andrew Aniamaka, said the policemen would be brought to book if found culpable after investigation. He said, \u201cThe case is being investigated. However, our utmost concern is that the injured victim gets proper treatment.

The United States flew a B-1B supersonic bomber over South Korea on Wednesday in part of a massive combined aerial exercise involving hundreds of warplanes, a clear warning after North Korea last week tested its biggest and most powerful missile yet. (South Korea Defense Ministry via AP) The Associated Press \nBy KIM TONG-HYUNG, Associated Press \nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korea says a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula has become a matter of when, not if, as it continued to lash out at a massive joint military exercise between the United States and South Korea involving hundreds of advanced warplanes. \nIn comments attributed to an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman, North Korea also claimed high-ranked U.S. officials, including CIA Director Mike Pompeo, have further confirmed American intent for war with a series of \"bellicose remarks.\" \nPompeo said Saturday that U.S. intelligence agencies believe North Korean leader Kim Jong Un doesn't have a good idea about how tenuous his situation is domestically and internationally. The North's spokesman said Pompeo provoked the country by \"impudently criticizing our supreme leadership which is the heart of our people.\" \n\"We do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it, and should the U.S. miscalculate our patience and light the fuse for a nuclear war, we will surely make the U.S. dearly pay the consequences with our mighty nuclear force which we have consistently strengthened,\" the spokesman said. \nThe comments were carried by the official Korean Central News Agency late Wednesday, hours after the United States flew a B-1B supersonic bomber over South Korea as part of a massive combined aerial exercise involving hundreds of warplanes. North Korean propaganda is often filled with extreme claims and threats, and the spokesman's comments were consistent with the tone of previous statements condemning Washington and Seoul. \nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the Guam-based bomber simulated land strikes at a military field near South Korea's eastern coast during a drill with U.S. and South Korean fighter jets. \n\"Through the drill, the South Korean and U.S. air forces displayed the allies' strong intent and ability to punish North Korea when threatened by nuclear weapons and missiles,\" the South Korean military said in a statement. \nB-1Bs flyovers have become an increasingly familiar show of force to North Korea, which after three intercontinental ballistic missile tests has clearly moved closer toward building a nuclear arsenal that could viably target the U.S. mainland. \nThe five-day drills that began Monday involve more than 200 aircraft, including six U.S. F-22 and 18 F-35 stealth fighters. \nNorth Korea hates such displays of American military might at close range and typically uses strong language to condemn them as invasion rehearsals. It has been particularly sensitive about B-1B bombers, describing them as \"nuclear strategic\" although the planes were switched to conventional weaponry in the mid-1990s. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press .

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Al Franken (D-Minn.), a longtime ally in Washington, are pictured together in the Capitol in 2014. comments U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s long silence on her disgraced liberal colleague Al Franken is giving her opponents fresh ammunition and raises questions about her political judgment.\nWarren finally called on Franken to resign late yesterday \u2014 hours after many other Democrats in the Senate had urged the Minnesota senator to step aside, and just minutes before reports surfaced that Franken was quitting today.\nHer deaf ear on the sexual harassment allegations piling up against Franken gave weight to Republican claims that she\u2019s a politically expedient partisan, and could bode trouble for her re-election campaign.\nIt was a political blunder on her part, and goes to the heart of Warren\u2019s weakness \u2014 that she\u2019s great when it comes to attacking a Republican enemy, but challenged when it comes to thinking quick on her feet in an unscripted moment.\nWarren may have been too busy holding a live Facebook event with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to notice, but the latest allegation against Franken was the last nail in his coffin. A former congressional aide alleged Franken tried to forcibly kiss her in 2006, prompting the then \u201ccomedian\u201d to say, \u201cIt\u2019s my right as an entertainer.\u201d\nWhat a hoot, Al. You are definitely not good enough or funny enough.\nThe real death knell for Franken was when six female Democratic senators called on Franken to quit early yesterday afternoon. But Warren was not among that list of female senators urging him to go.\nBy 3 p.m., the head of the Democratic National Committee and more than half of Senate Democrats \u2014 a total of 28 \u2014 had put out statements calling on Franken to step aside.\n\u201cIt is clear that Al Franken has engaged in a pattern of egregious and unacceptable behavior toward women,\u201d Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), said.\nEven Warren\u2019s Massachusetts colleague, Sen. Edward Markey, was on the record giving Franken the heave-ho.\nBut still, no word from Warren.\nWhen Ed Markey beats you to the punch, you know you\u2019re behind the curve.\nIt wasn\u2019t until just before 4 p.m. that Warren\u2019s office, in a response to a question from the Herald, sent back a quick one-line statement: \u201cI think (Franken) should resign.\u201d Warren aides also said she told that privately to her colleague.\nFor Republicans, Warren\u2019s delayed response wasn\u2019t quick enough.\n\u201cFor weeks, Sen. Warren has refused to condemn elected officials in Washington and on Beacon Hill who are embroiled in sexual misconduct scandals simply because they are Democrats,\u201d said John Kingston, one of three GOP candidates running against Warren.\nKingston even highlighted the Franken issue in a digital advertising attack on the incumbent Democrat.\nRepublican Beth Lindstrom also joined in criticizing Warren for her failure to call out Franken.\nWarren and Franken are close allies and ideologically similar, but that\u2019s still no excuse for her looking the other way for weeks as new reports have surfaced about his alleged harassment of women.\nShe showed she can be politically vulnerable, and that should give Republicans some hope as they begin their uphill fights to unseat her.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "battenfeld", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "elizabeth warren battenfeld", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "liz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "elizabeth warren", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bernie sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed markey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maggie hassan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john kingston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward markey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dems joe battenfeld", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beth lindstrom", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic national committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beacon hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:19.085+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b1f41467dfb823a38a27d60e58ab3729cf5f80fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8xMR_zqDhVU24R8Gr303y2eFJY60f.Y2pR9MdD7GIkQfCCHN5L0lbPpGOB28QF21GTQc5d02fJti5TsTf9tEwKgAAkOaK1EH.s2kYw_AWhae7Qu3WnlozRV3HWib2ASgJKbsNQLdWKhp9JofulJjL3", "site_full": "www.juxtapost.com", "site": "juxtapost.com", "site_section": "http://www.juxtapost.com/feed/id/global", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Juxtapost - Recent Post Feed", "title": "\u00d0\u0161\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u20ac\u00d1\u2019\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00bd\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b0 \u00d1 \u00d1\u2019\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00be\u00d0\u00bc \u00c2\u00abschool, ideas, and notes\u00c2\u00bb", "title_full": "\u00d0\u0161\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u20ac\u00d1\u2019\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00bd\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b0 \u00d1 \u00d1\u2019\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00be\u00d0\u00bc \u00c2\u00abschool, ideas, and notes\u00c2\u00bb", "published": "2017-12-07T10:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://jp21.r0tt.com/t_03a46e60-db32-11e7-89d9-097978b00021.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1f41467dfb823a38a27d60e58ab3729cf5f80fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8xMR_zqDhVU24R8Gr303y2eFJY60f.Y2pR9MdD7GIkQfCCHN5L0lbPpGOB28QF21GTQc5d02fJti5TsTf9tEwKgAAkOaK1EH.s2kYw_AWhae7Qu3WnlozRV3HWib2ASgJKbsNQLdWKhp9JofulJjL3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "juxtapost.com", "published": "2017-12-07T10:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u00d0\u0161\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u20ac\u00d1\u2019\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00bd\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b0 \u00d1 \u00d1\u2019\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00be\u00d0\u00bc \u00c2\u00abschool, ideas, and notes\u00c2\u00bb", "text": " 48 Spd: 0.035261s  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:20.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a1a7903ffcce4883fd3d1aad5c199c50b1a6a31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWxDqguzhyfS0Nb_zkTFpDQ9mESuTtNOHDHZvZSosgqt3D7851MZP9LLOgvvVAh6ap.JV.JBbzpL2CJyJIsZFJM2j43K2n.DQ9.U7Bfc_iwLcz7xmFmebR_WlCFDly2teiayU2sqAF0KI-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-laundry-cleaning/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Laundry &amp;

Bering) \nExactly 39 men from St. Henry Parish in Buckeye and their relatives across the generations, got Advent started off on the right foot, literally, when they took \u201cA Walk to Bethlehem.\u201d Fr. Billy Kosco, pastor, organized the Dec. 2 pilgrimage aimed at strengthening teenaged men, young adults, fathers and grandfathers in faith and fellowship. \nThe men, aged 10 to 70, took a mile-and-a-half walk in the desert surrounding Our Lady of Solitude Monastery in Tonopah, stopping occasionally to reflect on the infancy narrative from Luke\u2019s Gospel. It was the second such journey in as many years. This slideshow requires JavaScript. \n\u201cWalking silently through the desert and meditating on scripture heightened my awareness of my personal relationship with Jesus,\u201d Ron Bohnlein reflected. \u201cThe crunching of the ground as I walked and the distant mountain vistas took me to the time when Mary and Joseph traveled to Bethlehem fully aware that God was physically with them.\u201d \nBohnlein said the experience brought joy to his soul. \nToward the end of the journey, the men prayed the Joyful Mysteries of the Rosary in the monastery\u2019s chapel, ate lunch and heard a short talk from one of the nuns juxtaposing her memories from a Holy Land trip with each man\u2019s personal journey toward salvation. \n\u201cI came away with a lasting knowledge that God created the beauty of the natural world and is present in everything we experience \u2014 even the simple act of walking across a desert,\u201d Bohnlein said.

(CNS) \u2014 Belief in that iconic Christmas figure, the rotund merry man with a bag full of presents, inspires thousands of children to write letters addressed to \u201cSanta Claus\u201d each year. \nSurprisingly, many of these wish lists actually do get delivered to Santa Claus. But rather than landing in a magical workshop at the North Pole, the notes wind up in a little Indiana town that bears the same name as the jolly old elf. \n\u201cWe have already answered 5,000 and we\u2019ll be getting more this morning,\u201d Patricia Koch, founder of the Santa Claus Museum and Village, told Catholic News Service Dec. 2. \u201cThey come from the USA and from all over the world.\u201d \nKoch and a dozen other volunteers work long hours to \u201chelp\u201d Santa answer the letters that find their way to the Santa Claus post office. Koch calls this letter-writing a ministry and is dedicated to keeping the spirit of Santa Claus, the person, alive. \n\u201cOur world can become very self-centered and commercialized,\u201d she explained, \u201cso I think Santa Claus has that spirit of love and forgiveness and peace and joy.\u201d Patricia Koch, founder of the Santa Claus Museum and Village in Santa Claus, Ind., holds a stack of letters to be mailed Dec. 2. As the only U.S. city named \u201cSanta Claus,\u201d the town receives, and replies to, letters from thousands of children each year. (CNS photo/Katie Rutter) \nThe town itself, with a population just over 2,400, seems to embody the persona of Santa Claus. Streets are named \u201cSleigh Bell Drive\u201d and \u201cCandy Cane Lane,\u201d or even \u201cMelchior,\u201d \u201cBalthazar\u201d and \u201cKaspar\u201d after the traditional names of the three wise men. Unsurprisingly, the Catholics of the town named their church after the man who inspired the myth: St. Nicholas. \n\u201cJust looking at his acts, we just see this kindness and seeing those who were less fortunate,\u201d said Fr. John Brosmer, pastor of St. Francis of Assisi Parish in Dale, which encompasses St. Nicholas Church and two other nearby worship sites. \nSt. Nicholas, also known as Nicholas of Myra, was a bishop in present-day Turkey who lived from about A.D. 280 to 343. He was the orphaned son of wealthy parents, and one ancient story claims that he threw bags of gold through the window of an impoverished family in the dead of night. \n\u201cIn later versions, he drops a bag of gold through the chimney where it lands in a stocking that was hung there to dry,\u201d explained Adam English, chair of the Christian studies department at Campbell University and author of the historical book \u201cThe Saint Who Would Be Santa Claus.\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s really memorable about it is that it\u2019s an absolutely ordinary act of charity, of goodwill. This is the kind of thing that anybody can do,\u201d English said. Young parishioners shake hands Dec. 2 with an actor portraying St. Nicholas, the namesake of their church. St. Nicholas Catholic Church in Santa Claus, Ind., hosted the visit from \u201cSt. Nick\u201d ahead of the saint\u2019s feast day, which is Dec. 6. (CNS photo/KatieRutter) \nThat simple act of generosity inspired generations of anonymous gift-giving. Givers attributed mysterious presents to St. Nicholas and passed his story from culture to culture. In the Netherlands, his nickname was \u201cSinter Klaas,\u201d which evolved to \u201cSanta Claus\u201d when Dutch immigrants arrived in New York. \nSt. Nicholas\u2019 identity was forever established as a \u201cjolly old elf\u201d by the famous poem \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas,\u201d penned by Clement Clarke Moore in 1822. \n\u201c(The poem) starts to change him from being a Christian bishop, stern and austere and presiding over the Eucharist, to being more of a gift-giver who\u2019s maybe more a magical creature,\u201d said English. \nToday, the familiar images of this magical man are recreated throughout the town of Santa Claus. Huge statues that adorn the main highway and the town hall depict a smiling, rosy-cheeked figure with a large bag of toys, his red coat and hat looking nothing like clerical garb. \nStill, for Santa enthusiasts, even this depiction echoes Christian beginnings that were simply transformed by American culture. \n\u201cI use the expression \u2018extreme makeover,\u2019\u201d explained Fr. Joseph Marquis, a Byzantine Catholic priest who runs the St. Nicholas Institute. His program, based in Detroit, teaches the saint\u2019s history to professional portrayers of Santa. \n\u201cThey took away his miter and gave him a triangular cap and his bishop\u2019s coat was shortened and lined with fur. The candy cane is an evolution from the crosier,\u201d Fr. Marquis said. Simon Phillips, 9, of Louisville, Ky., poses as Santa Claus during story time at the Santa Claus Museum and Village Dec. 2. The museum, a mainstay of the town named Santa Claus, Ind., celebrates the city\u2019s namesake all through December. (CNS photo/Katie Rutter) \nNicholas of Myra likely lacked the rounded figure characteristic of a diet of milk and cookies. His place in history would paint a stature hardened by persecution, perhaps even bearing the scars of torture. A contemporary of the emperor Diocletian, Nicholas lived through the most terrible persecution of the early Church and was himself imprisoned. \n\u201cWe know for sure his nose was broken,\u201d said Fr. Marquis, referencing historical research done on the bones of the saint. \n\u201cThey tortured his priests who were members of his flock to make him recant and he wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Fr. Marquis said. \nNicholas of Myra also was hailed as a defender of justice, which might have led to Santa\u2019s common question to young children, \u201cHave you been good?\u201d and the naughty-nice list that he must \u201ccheck twice.\u201d According to one legend, the bishop found out that a local judge had accepted a bribe and falsely condemned three men to death. \n\u201cNicholas ran to the spot and literally grabbed the sword out of the executioner\u2019s hand,\u201d related Fr. Marquis. \n\u201cHe pointed right at the guy for condemning them to death and the man actually confessed that he took money to condemn them,\u201d he said. \nSt. Nicholas Church hosted a visit from its namesake to anticipate his Dec. 6 feast day. A white-bearded man wearing a miter and long red robes made a surprise appearance at the Sunday Vigil Mass Dec. 2 and handed out ornaments to all the parishioners. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t get away from Santa Claus here,\u201d laughed Dcn. Jim Woebkenberg. \nThe voice of St. Nicholas likely pursues Catholics during every Sunday liturgy. Historical documents confirm that Nicholas attended the Council of Nicaea in 325. While his direct contributions, if any, are unknown, it was during this council that the Nicene Creed was written. \n\u201cYou have echoes of the voice of St. Nicholas every Sunday when we recite the creed, which for me as a big St. Nicholas fan, indebted to him for so many things in my life, that\u2019s important to me,\u201d said Fr. Marquis. \nSimilarly, every bright-eyed child who rushes to the Christmas tree Dec. 25 is indebted to this saint for the legacy of giving. But just as the town of Santa Claus stays on the map even after the holiday season, the local pastor said that the true spirit of St. Nick leads Catholics to generosity all year long. \n\u201cGrowing up as a Christian, you want to share your gifts you want to give of yourself,\u201d said Fr. Brosmer. \u201cThe true Christian is St. Nicholas, it\u2019s that generosity all the time.\u201d SHARE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "katie rutter catholic ne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clement clarke moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. nicholas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon phillips", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rutter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa claus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicholas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john brosmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marquis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patricia koch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph marquis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim woebkenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balthazar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diocletian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "myra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "campbell university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa claus museum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. nicholas institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa claus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic news service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. nicholas catholic church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council of nicaea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. nicholas church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa claus museum and village", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholics", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa claus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assisi parish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eucharist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ind.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north pole", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dale", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:21.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26a03343f1abc0f18d4794c615f57abfce944f52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qNkylAgmSpceJFIVb8MwCO4IwtXCDCiZ55zb1bYwQNRSOHG3KNQhuli4nRkEHVsErGTaAE8XwD_cHLneP_C5p6cpJ8TJsPev1IFqXUyY8Q_911Qo3GraGZt.NvtlJOIP.E-", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/india/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "India \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "Yashwant Sinha\u2019s protest for farmers issues an alarm bell for govt: Shiv Sena", "title_full": "Yashwant Sinha\u2019s protest for farmers issues an alarm bell for govt: Shiv Sena", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/02/sena3.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 106, "comments": 0, "shares": 106}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26a03343f1abc0f18d4794c615f57abfce944f52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qNkylAgmSpceJFIVb8MwCO4IwtXCDCiZ55zb1bYwQNRSOHG3KNQhuli4nRkEHVsErGTaAE8XwD_cHLneP_C5p6cpJ8TJsPev1IFqXUyY8Q_911Qo3GraGZt.NvtlJOIP.E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Yashwant Sinha\u2019s protest for farmers issues an alarm bell for govt: Shiv Sena", "text": "Mani Shankar Aiyar calls PM neech, Congress suspends him in damage control \nThe Shiv Sena on Thursday said the response garnered by BJP veteran Yashwant Sinha \u2019s agitation in Maharashtra over farmers\u2019 issues should set off alarm bells for the state government. The former Union minister, who has had frequent run-ins with the current BJP leadership, was detained on Monday evening while protesting outside the Akola district collector\u2019s office against the state government\u2019s \u201capathy\u201d towards the farmers of Vidarbha. \nShiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray had spoken to the 80-year-old leader over phone on Tuesday and discussed farmers\u2019 issues. \nSinha yesterday called off his three-day-old protest in Akola, saying Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had assured him that their demands will be met. \nThe Sena today noted that prominent leaders of the country had supported Sinha\u2019s agitation. \u201cWe (referring to Uddhav Thackeray) too spoke to Sinha over phone. The question is about farmers\u2019 life and death and thus not worrying about what will happen to power, we supported his agitation,\u201d the party said in an editorial in its mouthpiece \u2018Saamana\u2019. \nThe Sena said that Sinha was never a mass leader but a \u201cbureaucrat-turned-politician\u201d. \u201cYet, if farmers supported his agitation, it should ring alarm bells for the BJP and the government. The government should fulfil the demands of farmers of Akola while it has the time,\u201d it opined. \nSeeking to know what issues of farmers were resolved by the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in Maharashtra, the Sena claimed that farm loan waiver was announced by the state government only when the Uddhav Thackeray-led party pressed for it. \n\u201cHowever, in reality the government spent crores of rupees on advertisements even before the actual loan waiver was implemented, to gain credit. Like the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the loan waiver is also stuck in announcements,\u201d it quipped. \nThe Sena asserted that it will continue to demand implementation of recommendations of the Swaminathan panel, a complete loan waiver and minimum support price for farmers, because these were the promises, it claimed, on the back of which the BJP came to power. \nSinha also didn\u2019t have any new demands but only wanted old promises to be fulfilled, the Sena said, adding that the farmers stood with him because the \u201cdisappointed and victimised\u201d cultivators do not know what to do. \nQuestioning those criticising Sinha, the editorial said if the former Union minister was going against his own party due to his personal grudges, how could he get such a stupendous response in Akola. \n\u201cWhy did the chief minister and (revenue minister) Chandrakant Patil plead Sinha to take back the agitation? That was because this agitation could turn ugly and affect the upcoming Winter session of the state Legislature,\u201d it said.
