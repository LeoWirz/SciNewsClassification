After a 16-year slog through the courts , the project\u2019s developer, Cape Wind Associates, appears to have given up on its ambitious plans for a 130-turbine wind farm in Nantucket Sound off the coast of Cape Cod in Massachusetts. \nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a respite for William Koch (one of the two \u201cother\u201d Koch brothers ). Along with members of the Kennedy family, Koch has been a high profile organizer against the Cape Wind project. The federal lease for the wind farm is still in force, and the Bureau of Ocean Energy (BOEM) has in effect smoothed the way for other ocean energy projects to take Cape Wind\u2019s place. No more Cape Wind for Cape Cod\u2026 \nOne measure of the effectiveness of the Koch/Kennedy lobbying campaign is the passage of a new state \u201cenergy diversity\u201d law in 2016. The new law requires Massachusetts utilities to purchase 1600 megawatts in offshore wind energy capacity, which should be good news for Cape Wind. \nHowever, a carve-out was written into the law. Only wind farms located more than 10 miles off the coast of inhabited areas are eligible to bid on contracts to fulfill the 1600 megawatt goal. An additional requirement is that eligible wind farms must have acquired their federal leases through a competitive process after 2012. \nAs a pioneering offshore wind project , Cape Wind does not meet either of those requirements. It was the first offshore wind development in the U.S. to acquire a commercial federal lease but that occurred in 2010, before BOEM established a competitive bidding process for offshore wind all along the Atlantic coast. \nIn addition, Cape Wind\u2019s leased area is located within the 10 mile limit. \u2026but a wind energy phoenix could rise from the ashes\u2026 \nOne interesting twist is that Cape Wind\u2019s federal lease is in force until 2041. Although recent news reports indicate that the company is preparing to ask BOEM to rescind its lease, another possibility is that Cape Wind could transfer its rights to another developer. \nIf a transfer is not legally permissible, BOEM could open up the area to a new round of competitive bidding. That\u2019s a long shot considering that the winning bid will face renewed blowback from the Koch lobbying effort, but it could be a risk worth taking. \nThe 2016 state law simply sets a 1600 megawatt goal for offshore wind capacity. It does not appear to provide for sourcing restrictions once that goal is met. Massachusetts utilities may have trouble meeting the 1600 megawatt goal within the next year or so, but a slew of wind farms are in the pipeline all along the wind rich Atlantic coastline . \nMeanwhile, offshore wind costs are dropping globally as the technology improves. The increased offshore development activity also enables economies of scale to kick in throughout the supply chain. \nThat\u2019s all to the benefit of the next company to develop the Cape Wind site. In addition, the site\u2019s relatively close shoreline location could provide it with additional cost advantages over leased areas beyond the 10-mile limit. \u2026maybe! \nLast Friday the Cape Cod Times reported what seems to be the definitive word from Cape Wind : \u201cCape Wind has confirmed to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management that it has ceased development of its proposed offshore wind farm project in Nantucket Sound and has filed to terminate its offshore wind development lease that was issued in 2010,\u201d according to a statement sent to the Times by Cape Wind vice president Dennis Duffy. \nThat\u2019s quite a turnaround from just a few months ago. According to BOEM\u2019s website, last June Cape Wind Associates wrote to the agency requesting a two-year suspension of its lease. \nFor that matter, barely two months ago, on September 26, BOEM formally affirmed its support for the offshore wind project . \nLate last month the Koch-backed organization Alliance to Save Nantucket Sound filed an appeal of the BOEM decision, and that may have convinced Cape Wind to throw in the towel. \nThe appeal asks for the environmental review process to start from scratch due to a \u201cthe myriad of developments since the EIS was first issued in 2009.\u201d \nAlthough it\u2019s not quite what the Alliance had in mind, among those developments is an emerging generation of high efficiency, low cost offshore wind turbines, new methods for anchoring turbine platforms, and new devices that can harvest wave energy without spoiling the view from shore. Any or all of these factors could combine to attract another developer to the Cape Wind site. \nPresident Trump is known for opposing wind energy in general and offshore wind energy in particular , but under his watch the U.S. Department of Energy has continued to press forward with programs promoting U.S. wind development . \nAnything could happen, so stay tuned. \nImage: Simulation of one-mile view of Cape Wind turbines from boat via Cape Wind Associates.

He pleaded guilty in 2015, agreed to return US$600,000 and is now cooperating with the US government against the only three accused in the dock. \nTheir trial began last month. \nJose Maria Marin, 85, former president of Brazil\u2019s Football Confederation; former FIFA vice president Juan Angel Napout, 59, of Paraguay; and Manuel Burga, who led soccer in Peru until 2014, are charged with racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies. \nTordin said that at a lavish farm on a summer night in Uruguay, three other top officials, from CONCACAF, the football federation for North and Central America and the Caribbean, accepted nearly US$500,000 from Argentinian sports rights company Full Play \u2014 but the tournament never saw the light of day. \nAccording to Tordin, the deal was set up by him and Miguel Trujillo, a Colombian football consultant with links to Full Play\u2019s owners, Hugo and Mariano Jinkis. \nHis account matched Trujillo\u2019s, who earlier told the court that he helped set up bribes between Argentine sports marketing companies and CONCACAF. \nMassages \nTordin said that after lunching at the beach he, Trujillo, and CONCACAF bosses Alfredo Hawit, Rafael Salguero, and Ariel Alvarado returned to Jinkis\u2019\u201cbeautiful\u201d country house. \nThe aim was to \u201cconvince the (CONCACAF bosses) that Full Play could be the marketing arm of CONCACAF,\u201d he said. \n\u201cFull Play agreed to pay US$300,000 for the officials in exchange for them signing the document,\u201d said Tordin, adding Hawit, as president of CONCACAF, later said he \u201cdeserved\u201d US$150,000 more \u2014 bringing the total payment to US$450,000. \nLater in 2011, after a night of dancing and dining in Buenos Aires, the three CONCACAF bosses enjoyed a trip to an ultra-exclusive resort via private jet, Tordin added. \nHe also revealed hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes were paid via banks in Panama to former senior figures in Honduran, Costa Rican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan football. \nTordin said that he and Trujillo would sometimes exaggerate the amounts of the bribes to their bosses at events management company Media World, in order to keep a cut for themselves. \nAnother government witness was Nelson Sanabria, ex-assistant to Napout, a past president of the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL). \nHe told the court his former boss was fond of massages, manicures and pedicures \u2014 appointments arranged by his discrete chauffeur. \nThe three accused have pleaded not guilty. \nA total of 24 accused have already admitted their guilt in the case outlined in a 236-page complaint detailing 92 separate crimes and 15 corruption schemes to the tune of US$200 million. \nUS prosecutors announced the indictments on May 27, 2015, exposing a quarter-century of endemic corruption in the heart of FIFA, soccer\u2019s governing body.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fabio tordin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rafael salguero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nelson sanabria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mariano jinkis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manuel burga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trujillo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ariel alvarado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alfredo hawit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miguel trujillo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "napout", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juan angel napout", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose maria marin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tordin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massages  tordin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "football confederation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south american football confederation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us federal court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "media world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "concacaf", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uruguay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jinkis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buenos aires", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paraguay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:06.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd8088056e359bdfb83313882295d54ae3a0e415", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYBXhkF0p0kPmyFrLPKLX7tb", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp;

Clive Brunskill/Getty Images Liverpool trounced Spartak Moscow on Wednesday to secure a place in the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League for the first time since the 2008/09 season. A European campaign that started with a tricky play-off against Hoffenheim way back in August will now stretch into 2018, even if the Reds at times made heavy weather of qualifying from Group E. A cosy draw didn't look so comfortable after picking up just two points from their opening pair of games. However, Maribor were dismissed twice by a 10-0 aggregate scoreline, and despite a second-half collapse in Seville, Liverpool sealed top spot in style with a 7-0 triumph over Spartak at Anfield. The list of possible opponents in the next round includes reigning champions Real Madrid , last year's beaten finalists Juventus , Bayern Munich, Basel, Shakhtar Donetsk and Porto. While they wait to see who they are drawn against next Monday, Bleacher Report decided to look back at Liverpool's European season so far, ranking every player who has appeared in the competition for the club. B/R Football @brfootball 2017-12-6 22:32:25 20. Marko Grujic Midfielder Grujic was spotted on the field for all of six minutes, barely getting on prior to the final whistle in the first leg of the play-off in Hoffenheim before enjoying a slightly earlier introduction at home to Maribor. It appears that might be his only contribution in the competition this season, too. Klopp has said he is open to the idea of allowing the talented young Serb to leave on loan in the January transfer window, per James Pearce of the Liverpool Echo . 19. Dominic Solanke Signed from Chelsea in the summer, Solanke has shown promise in his brief appearances for his new club, including setting up the opening goal in the away win at Stoke City on his first Premier League start. However, he's barely had a chance in the Champions League to date. Like Grujic, the striker came off the bench away to Hoffenheim and also at home against Maribor. If Klopp has a fully fit squad to choose from, the 20-year-old could be nothing more than a spectator for the next round. 18. Simon Mignolet Mark Robinson/Getty Images Klopp's decision to rotate his goalkeepers came after Liverpool had qualified for the group stage. Before then, Mignolet was between the posts for both legs with Hoffenheim, conceding three goals over the tie. The Belgian did save a penalty away in Germany, guessing right to keep out Andrej Kramaric's weak spot-kick when the score was still 0-0, but he has since had to settle for being Loris Karius' back-up. Will the manager maintain the same policy further down the line, choosing to split playing time between the two? B/R Football @brfootball 2017-12-6 21:34:14 17. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Of the 127 minutes Oxlade-Chamberlain has played in the Champions League for Liverpool so far, all-but four of them came in the two lopsided games against Maribor. The deadline-day signing from Arsenal did open his account for the club when scoring in the 7-0 rout in Slovenia, coolly slotting home Daniel Sturridge's through ball. Oxlade-Chamberlain was signed with a long-term plan in mind\u2014while sporadically involved for now, things could easily be different by next February. 16. Joe Gomez Nathaniel Clyne's injury issues opened the door for Gomez to step in at right-back. More at home in the centre of the defence, the 20-year-old has had to learn on the job. He flunked his first test in the Champions League, as he was sent off at home in the 2-2 draw with Sevilla , while he was also part of the back four that failed to hang on to a commanding lead in the return fixture on Spanish soil. Even with a clean sheet to finish against sorry Spartak (which saw Gomez finish the game alongside Ragnar Klavan at centre-back), the England international doesn't have a strong case to crack the top 10. 15. Dejan Lovren David Ramos/Getty Images Lovren recovered from a shocking start to help Liverpool progress. His early error that gifted Sevilla the lead at Anfield didn't prove too costly in the end, but the team cannot afford similar mishaps moving forward. The Croatian has to be marked down for his involvement in the 3-3 result in the return fixture against the same opponents, too. While there were clean sheets against inferior competition, they count for little. 14. Daniel Sturridge As seems to be the case under Klopp these days, Sturridge played second fiddle to Firmino, though he still managed a goal and two assists during his limited time on the pitch in the Champions League. The England international came off the bench in five of the six group games, scoring the third and final goal at home to Maribor, but his brief cameos only added up to a lowly total of 83 minutes played. It will be interesting to see if Sturridge is still a Liverpool player by the time they next play in Europe. According to El Gol (h/t Harry Howes of the Star ), the Reds are in talks over a potential deal for the player to move to Real Betis in the next transfer window. B/R Football @brfootball 2017-12-6 20:40:43 13. Jordan Henderson Liverpool's two 7-0 victories in the group came without their club captain on the field. Henderson sat on the bench and watched on as his team-mates put Maribor and Spartak to the sword. Should the midfielder be worried by the team's performances without him? Not really, no. He should, though, be concerned how his presence on the field couldn't help stop the second-half slide at Sevilla. Henderson doesn't deserve the level of criticism he receives from some fans on social media\u2014but, as skipper, he also needs to exert greater influence over his colleagues when the going gets tough. 12. Alberto Moreno KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/Getty Images Now established as the first-choice left-back, Moreno has started every one of Liverpool's games in Europe. He's provided three assists in those appearances, demonstrating how he can make a difference in attack. And yet, despite all he's contributed to the campaign, it is hard to forget his meltdown away in Sevilla. Playing against his former club, the Spain international endured a nightmare return to familiar surroundings. After being at fault for two of the three goals Liverpool conceded, he was hauled off after 63 minutes. He didn't finish the emphatic victory over Spartak in the next game either, albeit his early departure on that occasion was down to an ankle injury. 11. Ragnar Klavan Klavan has experienced both ends of the spectrum in the Champions League. While the veteran centre-back kept a clean sheet on his first European start for the club, he was also a member of the back four who collapsed on Spanish soil, as Sevilla rallied to grab a point that had seemed so unlikely at the half-time interval. While he returned from illness to help secure qualification at Anfield, concerns over Klavan's lack of pace, as well as his inability to cope under pressure, is worrying ahead of games against stronger opposition. 10. Loris Karius A Champions League specialist, Karius has still yet to fully convince he has what it takes to establish himself as Liverpool's No. 1 in all competitions. Still, whoever starts between the sticks is too often let down by those playing in front of him. The German was left badly exposed in both outings against Sevilla but was a virtual spectator in the other games. There were some smart saves at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in particular, and he could do little about the three goals the visitors conceded after the break. Karius is a work in progress, though rustiness could be an issue early next year if he remains stuck behind Mignolet for domestic duties. 9. Georginio Wijnaldum Aitor Alcalde/Getty Images Wijnaldum is the footballing equivalent of a cheese and pickle sandwich. Neither are overly flash, but both do a job in terms of filling a hole. The Dutchman is a steady Eddie, a seven-out-of-10 type who Klopp clearly trusts in the big games. If there's one disappointment with the former Newcastle United player in Europe so far, it's his lack of impact in the final third. He registered just one assist, away in Sevilla, during the group games. 8. Joel Matip Matip played every minute of the campaign until a thigh problem ruled him out of the last two group games. Liverpool missed him away at Sevilla as well, as they fell apart after the break to let slip a 3-0 lead. While the Reds comfortably survived without the centre-back against a Spartak side who had seemingly failed to bother doing any research on their opponents, they will hope he is fit to feature in the next round. James Pearce of the Liverpool Echo reported Matip \"may not play again until January.\" With the last-16 ties taking place the following month, the defender is likely to slot straight back into the lineup once healthy. 7. Emre Can After scoring twice in the 4-2 home win over Hoffenheim in qualifying, Can was more often than not used in a defensive role in Group E. The only game he didn't start was in Sevilla, when his presence in front of the back four might have helped prevent the second-half rot setting in. By the time he was summoned from the bench, it was too late to stem the Spanish tide as Liverpool's lead was swept away in what was the definition of a game of two halves. The German is also pushed outside the top six due to picking up a careless yellow card in the final game, with his third booking in the group stage ruling him out of the first leg of the last-16 tie. Tut-tut, Emre. 6. Trent Alexander-Arnold DANIEL ROLAND/Getty Images Teenager Alexander-Arnold scored the club's opening goal in their European campaign, curling home a glorious free-kick to set Liverpool on their way against Hoffenheim. \"Well I have to say for an 18-year-old who has the balls to take a free-kick like that it is rather exciting and interesting for me than a little mistake he did,\u201d Klopp said in the aftermath, per Mark Critchley of The Independent. He also found the net in Maribor, once again demonstrating his attacking instincts. With Klopp opting for the more defensive-minded Gomez in both games against Sevilla, Alexander-Arnold's position is improved by his lack of involvement in the sloppy draws with the La Liga club. 5. James Milner JURE MAKOVEC/Getty Images Despite totalling just 252 minutes of action in the group stage, Milner managed more assists (five) than any other Liverpool player. In fact, according to UEFA.com , no one had more in the entire competition. His final tally was boosted by three against Spartak on Wednesday, all of them coming in the second half after he'd replaced the injured Moreno at left-back just before the break. In the games against Maribor, Milner captained the team from a midfield role. That versatility is useful for Klopp, yet it may take an injury crisis for the 31-year-old Yorkshireman to get a starting berth in the last 16. 4. Sadio Mane David Ramos/Getty Images Mane could easily have been ranked higher than fourth had a hamstring injury not sidelined him for the home-and-away fixtures against Maribor. Liverpool coped easily without him, yet the Senegalese missed the chance to fill his boots. Still, a tally of three goals in four appearances is impressive. Mane found the net twice in the second half of the thrashing of Spartak, including an acrobatic volley in front of the Kop straight after half-time. Perhaps overshadowed by the top three in this list, the 25-year-old still remains a pivotal part of Liverpool's newest fab four. No team will relish having to deal with the Reds' forwards in the knockout stages.

Moreno was withdrawn on the stroke of half-time for James Milner, and Klopp gave an update on the Spaniard after the match, per James Carroll of the Reds' official website: \"We had a little shadow on the night when Alberto Moreno needed to get substituted. It was a strange situation. He is a tough guy and if he cannot continue the game then you should consider it could be something serious. In the treatment room then, he was a little bit more positive, so maybe we are lucky and it's not too serious.\" Goal's Melissa Reddy also expressed her hope Moreno is not facing a serious problem: Melissa Reddy @MelissaReddy_ Alberto Moreno devastated to be coming off injured for #LFC, with James Milner replacing him. Hopefully it's a minor rather than a major issue. 2017-12-6 20:32:29 Aside from some high-profile mistakes in the 3-3 draw with Sevilla last month, Moreno has largely been much-improved this season after an unconvincing start to his Liverpool career. The left-back has perhaps stepped up his game having lost his place to midfielder Milner for large swathes of last season and seen Andy Robertson arrive in the summer. Robertson has impressed during some limited opportunities this season, having made just four appearances, but he's a strong back-up for Moreno if he does face a spell on the sidelines, while the versatile Milner remains an option, too. Liverpool's 7-0 win was the second time they have achieved such a scoreline in the Champions League group stage this year having done the same against NK Maribor, and they have been fairly prolific in the other four matches: B/R Football @brfootball 2017-12-6 22:32:25 Each of their front four got in on the scoring \u2014Philippe Coutinho bagged a hat-trick, Sadio Mane grabbed a brace and Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah netted once apiece \u2014and the team are becoming increasingly ruthless in front of goal after lacking a clinical edge at times earlier in the campaign. Despite topping their group, though, Liverpool can still get Real Madrid , Bayern Munich or Juventus in the last 16. Klopp isn't looking forward to the possibility of facing one of them, but he believes his side can cause problems: \" I don't think anybody is happy when they get us in the draw, so we will not be happy in the moment when we see who we will face in the next round, but we will be ready, that's for sure.\" The German added: \" If we perform like this tonight in these moments, if we are as clinical as tonight, but had with the same players situations where we didn't score. It's not a criticism but the past. If they perform like this then obviously 100 per cent [they are a threat].\" Former Manchester United star Roy Keane believes the Reds will find it much more difficult against one of the top sides, though, per ITV Football: ITV Football @itvfootball 'Lovely going forward but there will be tougher tests to come' Watch all the highlights from the @ChampionsLeague on @ITV now. https://t.co/GFlX4AUrcR 2017-12-6 23:15:33 There will be less to exploit going forward and the Reds' defensive issues will be far more exposed against one of Europe's elite, but Liverpool would equally represent a difficult draw for any side they might face. The Reds will no doubt be hoping to instead draw FC Basel, Shakhtar Donetsk or FC Porto, who \u2014while they should not be taken lightly \u2014will offer a more favourable route to the quarter-finals. The draw will take place on Monday, with the last-16 fixtures to be played in February and March.

The decision was taken after the world governing body ended its partnership with France Football . Things may have changed, but Ronaldo will still want to collect this prize for a fifth time; it would mean one more argument in his favour in the debate over who is the better player, Real's No. 7 or Messi. Ronaldo is widely expected to add to his four Ballon d'Or awards. GERARD JULIEN/Getty Images Ronaldo has the strongest case to win after his exploits last season. He came alive during the knockout phase of the Champions League, saving his best performances for the biggest games. Those games included the semi-final against Bayern Munich, during which the 32-year-old scored five goals over the two legs. He was also the catalyst in the final, bagging a brace to help beat Juventus. Ronaldo's influence was just as prominent as Los Blancos claimed their first domestic title since 2012. Of the other finalists, Messi is the most likely to deny the former Manchester United man after scoring 48 goals in La Liga and the Champions League. However, the Argentina international's case will be hurt by two things. Messi is in the running for a sixth award. Manuel Queimadelos Alonso/Getty Images First, Barca only won the Copa del Rey last season, so Messi doesn't have the silverware to back his case. Second, Ronaldo claimed this year's Best FIFA award, so his excellent season has already been recognised by one group of voters. Even so, it's not a formality that the Ballon d'Or will go to the player who won FIFA's award, according to Andrew Dickson of Sky Sports: \" Just because Ronaldo won The Best, it should not be taken as an indication he will collect the Ballon d'Or as well and the two prizes and wholly independent from each other. Indeed, several newspapers printed a leaked photograph earlier this month which appeared to show Messi on the front cover of the December issue of France Football being proclaimed as the winner .\" If Messi can't get past Ronaldo, Neymar might. The Brazil international swapped Barcelona for Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain in a world-record transfer this summer. Neymar has dominated the headlines since his move to PSG in the summer. FRANCK FIFE/Getty Images His terrific form since joining Les Parisiens, 15 goals and nine assists in just 17 starts, could endear him to sections of the voters. Messi and Neymar are strong contenders, but a season's worth of production and being rewarded with two major trophies means it has to be Ronaldo who scoops the big prize in Paris.

The Gunners boss described the Spaniard's situation as \"unbelievable\" and said there is no way the player will be able to return before February, per ESPN.co.uk's Mattias Karen : \" I sent him a message [after the surgery] and wished him well. He answered, 'Look I have to start again from zero,' basically. And it's very sad, honestly. What he has gone through, this guy, is unbelievable. \" It's really, really sad. But unfortunately, he has to start again from zero. That means if all goes well, he has to wait until he can run. And after, when he starts to run, it will at least take six weeks to come back to training. When he will be able to start to run again, I don't know. I hope [he will be back]. But certainly now, not before February. \" Cazorla's last appearance for Arsenal was back in October 2016 against Ludogorets Razgrad in the UEFA Champions League. In November of last year, Wenger described the problem as \" not a big injury, it's not an injury which will harm his future,\" per Metro 's Mark Brus . However, it could prove to be an injury that ends Cazorla's career at the Emirates Stadium, as his contract with Arsenal expires at the end of the season. A long-term favourite of the Emirates faithful, he continues to receive the support of Arsenal fans, per Karen: Mattias Kar\u00e9n @MattiasKaren 2017-11-29 20:48:26 But the Gunners have had to learn to cope without Cazorla, who will be 33 on Wednesday, for so long now that the news of his extended lay-off should have little impact on the team's form. It would be a major boost, though, were he to finally return to fitness at some point before the end of the season. At his best, Cazorla is arguably Arsenal's most influential central midfielder. When he was first sidelined last year, Ben McAleer of WhoScored.com examined how crucial his absence could prove given how important Cazorla was to Arsenal's creativity. The north London outfit have been able to adapt to life without the Spaniard in the side and have looked largely impressive this season, even in Saturday's 3-1 defeat to Manchester United , which ended a 12-game winning run at home in the Premier League. But news of Cazorla's latest setback will be met with huge disappointment at the Emirates, as he is a popular figure who could play a huge role in the side if he were fit.

Outspoken, not shy about anything and always pushing himself, sometimes it feels like Hux doesn\u2019t do himself any favours, but when the smoke clears his actions make sense to everybody else. \nI promise that I did try and photograph the Celica before now. In mid 2014 I went to a British Drift Championship round at Lydden Hill to shoot it, but Hux didn\u2019t qualify. I think that\u2019s just about the only time he hasn\u2019t, so it must have been me who jinxed him. It reminded me of when I shot his old Volvo , the year before, and he snapped the accelerator pedal clean off as we initiated into the first corner, for my first passenger ride. \nBack at Lydden, he was pretty deflated and I respected his decision to postpone the shoot, but funnily enough he won the first round of the 2016 championship at the same track. Just another indication that it wasn\u2019t quite the right time. \nAnother opportunity was at Ultimate Stance, an indoor show that we both attended in November of 2014. Stripped naked of its graphics, a lot of us thought this was the best incarnation of the Celica, an ultimate road and track warrior set up in a stealthy skin. But a revamp was due for the 2015 season and a big new sponsor meant Hux wanted maximum exposure for Ensinger who were coming on board. \nBut what about the build? That bit back at the start I got all in a flap about? Well, that\u2019s where Hux is really annoying, from a complete barn-find RA28 Celica to initiating his first drift took 11 weeks. Yup, that\u2019s not even three months and he runs a full-time race fabrication shop too. Voodoo, pure voodoo I tell you. Even more impressive when you realise the Celica needed three weeks of welding. Oh yes, this puppy was going to put up a fight. \nBut hang on, why get rid of the Volvo wagon (built in a similar amount of time) after just one season? \u201cFinancially I needed to put at least another \u00a36,000 in it to get the 600bhp that I really needed,\u201d said Hux. \u201cI\u2019d actually bought a twin-turbo 302 Ford in the States to fit, but for me that was getting out of hand and away from where I wanted to be car wise.\u201d \nHaving moved from his first drift car, a Ford Mk1 Escort estate to a KE70 Corolla, the appeal of a smaller car with bigger power kept bouncing around in Hux\u2019s head as he battled with the big air brake shaped Volvo he\u2019d built, \u201cWhen I got that in my head, I went back to a childhood dream. There was a drag Celica RA28 I followed that was called \u2018Tokyo Toy\u2019. It ran a Rover V8 and competed in some UK based drag series. That would have been in the late \u201980s.\u201d \nAnd this is where the real inspiration for all of this comes from, Brian Huxley, Mark\u2019s father. \u201cHe was a specialist in American and Japanese cars, so he had KE30s a KE70 pickup, loads of different stuff. His first drag car was a Mustang but maybe his most well known one was a KE25 Corolla, called \u2018Can Do Two\u2019, running a small block Ford.\u201d \nI know all this \u2018he had\u2019 stuff sounds like Huxley Sr. is out of the game, but, no. Right now, aged in his mid-70s, Brian Huxley has a \u201968 Mustang Fastback with a 514ci V8, that ran 9.11 at 149mph on the quarter mile back in the summer of 2016. This crossover between Japanese metal, drag racing, V8s and looking badass had to come from somewhere, right? Stripped & Gripped \nThe insane fabrication skills and love of drifting? Well, I guess they just came naturally. Enough of the bromance though, the initial build was good. I mean really good, and the sort of thing most of us would be happy with. It followed a couple of simple rules Hux works with; guidelines I guess you could call them, or a DNA that runs through all his builds. \nOne is it has to work , but not at the expense of making it look good, so form and function have to go hand in hand. Hux explains: \u201cI run a 15-inch wheel because it looks right, it\u2019s in proportion.\u201d Next up it has to be low, well not low, but Hux-Low. \u201cThe original vision in my head was to get the centre of gravity as low as possible. Ballpark figure was to get the roof lower than 50-inches, it\u2019s now 43-inches.\u201d \nThe Celica wasn\u2019t done as an easier option to the Volvo. \u201cIf I was going to build a car to win every round of a drift championship, I\u2019d be in an S13 with a 2JZ. But I\u2019m in it to be different. Plus smaller wheels equals cheaper tyres, and live rear axles means dialled grip.\u201d \nThere\u2019s another reason for not getting carried away with wide track front ends and big wheels for Hux, something anybody who knows him will know he\u2019s passionate about. \u201cDrifting came with style and I\u2019m all about that. I\u2019m just a hot rodder who loves drifting. If it didn\u2019t exist, I\u2019d probably be drag racing on the street somewhere.\u201d \nBut thankfully it does exist; the Celica is a considered mix of everything that went before it, combining all the knowledge means it now does it very well. The shell looks relatively standard, but there are subtle modifications and tweaks all over it. Hux fitting a new larger/deeper transmission tunnel from front to rear, with a five-linked 8.8-inch Mustang axle narrowed from 66-inches to 57-inches. Up front there\u2019s some AE86-based suspension that he bought before he even had the Toyota. \n\u201cI preferred the Celica because of the Mustang shape and the Camaro front end feel. I still think about Charger style flip around lights\u2026\u201d \nIt\u2019s such a good shape that really does combine so many different styling cues, but on a manageable, European taste scale. I mean, it doesn\u2019t have wide, in-your-face American proportions that can sometimes look out of place on UK streets. I\u2019ll get to the tasteful and very well considered additions to that slippery shape later on. I Just Wanna Go Fast \nSo, was it good to get back in a smaller car again after the Volvo? \u201cThe one thing that the Celica brings is the snappiness; judges want quick changes of direction. The Volvo was just laughter, the Celica is just like f**king shit. Ooh, f**king shit! The first time I drove it I was on the start line in the wet at Teeside [a UK drift track]. I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen, so I\u2019m going to go in flat out and find out. I thought that this can\u2019t be worse than the Volvo? Then, I missed the first clip, but when I was sideways I hit every other clip. Still to this day I\u2019ve never aligned it, I\u2019ve always set it up myself and thought that\u2019ll do.\u201d \nAfter a hit and miss first season with the build in 2014, Hux picked up a headline sponsor and then a couple more along the way. Avon tyres came on board in 2016 but he\u2019s enjoyed support from Forge Motorsport and Garrett Honeywell for two seasons now. Hux saying of the Garrett GTX3071R turbo, \u201cThey gave me two and the second one is still wrapped up in the van!\u201d \nPrior to Garrett getting involved the SR20 was producing around 300bhp. With a lower compression rebuild and more boost, now it makes 397bhp at 6,200rpm. \nForge may well be a global name, but they\u2019re local to Hux and recognise when somebody is worth getting behind. \u201cAlex from Forge came to the workshop. I gave them some drawings and they made it, we put them in the car and they worked straight away. To this day they go to hell and back to help me with brakes, silicon hoses, everything. They\u2019re the best.\u201d \nThat custom cooling set up in the rear is fed by these pillar-mounted intakes; if you\u2019re really keen on your American models you may recognise these as being sourced from a Mustang originally. No surprise there given what I\u2019ve told you already, eh? \nHere you can see them sitting above the now metal arch extensions, fresh for the 2016 season as Hux was fed up of destroying the fibreglass ones in battle or just through tyre-on-arch contact. So he hand-formed these and had them sprayed the same as the body colour. Remember that old crusty yellow arch picture way back up near the top? Well, now the arch goes through the swage line as it\u2019s been raised so much. Another reminder of that purposeful stance and the measures taken to achieve it. \nDon\u2019t worry, there are limits to the man\u2019s talents. \u201cThe only thing I didn\u2019t do was the paint and mapping,\u201d says Hux. Is that it? \nGetting the authorities fired up is another special skill Hux has, and I love the story he tells of when he decided to road register the Celica in 2016. Hux sounding genuinely surprised at the reaction he got as he recounts the event, \u201cI went to Martin Richards\u2019 (fellow drift competitor and all round good guy) from my house, but the usual route back to mine was closed so I had to drive back through my local town afterwards. I passed a copper and he looped around and closed the road behind me. I went about 300 feet and he pulled me over, then decided to tear me a new one.\u201d \nYou see, prior to that day when the tax had been paid and insurance cover sorted, the Celica had been off the road since 1989, in which time the UK registration system has been changed a few times, and the computer obviously hadn\u2019t updated the authorities with Hux\u2019s new found legal status. \u201cI told him his pen would run out of ink before he\u2019d finished his list.\u201d Futureproof \nWeirdly, Celica\u2019s have never proved that popular as drift cars. Which is odd given how popular the Toyota brand and AE86 is, with the Celica being a slightly larger brother to the legendary tofu delivery car. Hux does know of another RA28 though: \u201cIt\u2019s the HBO Celica from Japan, I think it competed in 2010, maybe? I think it was in D1, I\u2019d love to know more if somebody knows. I know it\u2019s on top of the office at HBO, but I don\u2019t know anything about what they\u2019re doing with it. I think it had N2 arches, it ran an SR20, with maybe a bit more power and on 16s?\u201d \nSo am I wrong to say this is the world\u2019s best Celica drift car? I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s certainly the finest RA28 drift car there is, and that\u2019s really something, isn\u2019t it? To say you\u2019ve built the best of something there is? Not that Hux would. In fact, he\u2019ll probably be annoyed that I\u2019ve said that. It certainly won\u2019t stop him beating on it, that\u2019s for sure. Search out Huxley Motorsport on social media (links below) for pics of the damage that\u2019s been fixed over the last couple of years. As an example, the fibreglass door skin was pulled clear off when it got impaled on a shotgun exhaust in 2015. \nAs I mentioned near the beginning of this story, there have been a succession of very cool, successful drift cars from Hux over the past few years, and although the Celica is pretty much his dream car, it might not come as a surprise to find out that he\u2019s got it up for sale. \u201cI can\u2019t twin turbo this, but I can a Mustang,\u201d Hux says. \nI respect him for that. Life is too short not to build all of the cars you can. \u201cPeople tell me it would be worth more standard, but you can\u2019t f*ck about with a standard car all your life.\u201d And let\u2019s face it, he wouldn\u2019t have come second in the 2016 British Drift Championship in a standard car, and he did do that in this Celica. Up against mega power, big wheeled machines. \nI can\u2019t build cars and that\u2019s how I became somebody who\u2019s owned a Volvo estate for 15 years. In fact, this almost makes me want to sell it and try to build something else\u2026 But then I remember that Hux has a habit of making it look easy. \nBut of course it\u2019s not, and as the old saying goes, \u201cIf it was easy, everybody would be doing it.\u201d \nAnd they\u2019re not, it\u2019s just Hux, doing his thing and long may that continue. However pothole-ridden, tired and painful the road is, you have to remember the ride is worth it when you\u2019re doing something you love. \nBryn Musselwhite", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garrett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark huxley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hux", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hux-low", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryn musselwhite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin richards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian huxley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "huxley motorsport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volvo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toyota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garrett honeywell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hbo celica", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "teeside", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lydden hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lydden", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:07.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d164eca392becf1cdd7da7cda8a4168baad76e4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQB_8h7JYcvCDxzCqhtGTtqt1KVKHMTx1BFEncZU64QJqPyQWUrhsx4KQlzZng7RzOA.xzmTXOlDI3dklCyAlkacG3LThe._ob8vDyHL..FA--", "site_full": "3dhaircut.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://3dhaircut.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HAIRSTYLE", "title": "All You Need To Know Concerning Botox Treatment Boca Raton", "title_full": "All You Need To Know Concerning Botox Treatment Boca Raton", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d164eca392becf1cdd7da7cda8a4168baad76e4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQB_8h7JYcvCDxzCqhtGTtqt1KVKHMTx1BFEncZU64QJqPyQWUrhsx4KQlzZng7RzOA.xzmTXOlDI3dklCyAlkacG3LThe._ob8vDyHL..FA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sabri Amina (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "All You Need To Know Concerning Botox Treatment Boca Raton", "text": "HAIRSTYLE Women.... Who made them? God must have been a... genius. Their hair. They say that the hair is everything, you know? Have you ever buried your nose in a mountain of curls, and just wanted to go to sleep forever? ~Bo Goldman, \"The Start of an Education,\" made popular by the movie Scent of a Woman All You Need To Know Concerning Botox Treatment Boca Raton By Kimberly Campbell Botulinum toxin also known as Botox, is a material that is commonly applied in the treatment of wrinkles, lines, and other skin appearance problems. It has been in existence for a long period of time mostly over a century. It has been used in both the medical and cosmetic industries. In the medical field, it has been used as a facilitator to certain surgeries like plastic surgery while in cosmetology as a face smoothening medium. This has made Botox treatment Boca Raton to become one of the most popular wrinkle treatment in the recent past. This compound has been applied in treating lazy eyes. This entails the elevation of the eyelids in some given way so that the eyes can easily open. There is a misconception on its use over a period suggesting that it causes muscle paralysis. Nevertheless, this remains untrue as the treatment is approved and scientifically tested to have no such side effect. The compound is normally packed in solid, powder or crystalline manner. When applied, the physician will use a certain liquid to dissolve it. This compound is dissolved so that it can be administered using injections. The target or areas affected are then injected with the compound. On the other hand, a variance is there between one physician and the other on the amount of liquid each uses when diluting the compound. When this compound is injected, its functionality is by blocking the contraction of the muscle nerves hence resulting in the relaxing of the wrinkles. At the same time, the compound should first be purified given that Botulinum toxin is actually poisonous. It is as a result of this that very small quantities of this compound is used during the treatments. Actually, when this compound is injected into the body face, the transmissions sent to the muscles are hijacked and blocked from reaching the destination. When they get paralyzed, the nerve will not fold through contraction because it did not receive the signal. This will mean the muscle will always stay intact without contracting. This compound has also been used for eye squint, leaky bladder, migraine pain reduction, sweating and other medical problems treatment. In fact, studies and research indicate that this compound can be used to administer treatment to more than twenty medical conditions. Most common conditions addressed include spasms affecting eyelids, shoulder, and neck, crossed eyes and hemi-facial problems including others. The first benefit attributed to the therapy is enhancing beauty and appeals. The texture, appearance, and tone of muscles that are treated with the administration of the chemical make a person appear more youthful in nature. It is as well effective in dealing with drooped eyelids and brow. This method is also widely used when it comes to addressing the excessive sweating problem. Excessive sweating is associated with embarrassments, low self-esteem and confidence more so if the sweat produces an odor. Additionally, the compound in its medical use has been used largely in migraine pain reductions as well as treating of bells palsy.

People say I'm ferocious. Wild. Dangerous. They're right. That's why I live on an island alone. The jungle is my home. My personal prison. Until she arrived. The moment her helicopter crashed on my land, everything changed. She's the only survivor ... And I'm keeping her locked up in a pit. It's been too long since I last touched a woman, especially one so beautiful. It makes me hunger for her. I want her ... So I'll keep her ... And I'll make her mine. LOCKED is a full length standalone, complete at 70000 words. No Cliffhanger. Bonus content included. \"A fast pace story full of adventure and heat .\" - Mary's Goodreads Review \"I ADORED Lock. He is all kinds of wild and savage \" - Books N Wine Blog \" Exciting, sexy and fun to read.\" - Lorrie's Goodreads Review \" A beautiful, compassionate story full of forgiveness.\" - Claudia's Goodreads Review \"It was like a modern day Tarzan , and he was one sexy jungle man!\" - Shelli's Goodreads Review \"He was hot. He was alpha. He was hung like a horse. \" - Between The Bookends He nods again and points at the shower. \u201cGo on then.\u201d \u201cWhat? Now?\u201d I say, looking down at myself. I\u2019m still dressed. \u201cI don\u2019t want my clothes to get wet.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cThen take them off.\u201d My lips part, but I have no idea how to respond. All I can do is stare in amazement. Did he actually just tell me to take off my clothes? \u201cWhat?\u201d I repeat, for clarification. \u201cTake \u2019em off.\u201d He\u2019s serious. He\u2019s dead serious, and that stern stare almost makes me want to do it. But no, my morals have to get in the way again. \u201cNo,\u201d I say, folding my arms. \u201cI\u2019m not going nude \u2026\u201d He frowns and shrugs again. \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d He seems genuinely disappointed as he turns back around again. As if he\u2019s upset that I won\u2019t try his makeshift shower even though I want to. I just can\u2019t \u2026 not when he\u2019s watching. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I say. He stops in his tracks and glances over his shoulder, waiting for more. \u201cBut you can\u2019t watch,\u201d I add. His shoulders rise and fall, and he gives me a quick nod. \u201cI\u2019ll be down there.\u201d He points at the small lake. \u201cIf you need me.\u201d \u201cYeah \u2026\u201d Wait, do I need him? No. Maybe. Fuck. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know anything anymore. I peek at the shower, but my eyes still revert to him. And they stay there \u2026 glued \u2026 because he\u2019s untying the rope around his waist. And the banana leaves drop to the ground. My eyes widen. Butt naked and in its full glory. Cheeks squeezed together, thighs muscular and thick. And an enormous dick dangling between his legs. I struggle to keep my tongue inside \u2026 struggle to even breathe properly. Until he glances my way. In shock, I quickly dive behind the wood and grasp my chest. As if that will help me from having a heart attack after being caught staring at a naked man. And what a man he is \u2026 Wow. I still can\u2019t get that image out of my mind, and I don\u2019t even wanna try. All I can do is grin as I start undressing, wishing I wasn\u2019t so easily persuaded to ogle a man because of his dick. But Jesus Christ \u2026 that dick. a Rafflecopter giveaway Clarissa Wild is a New York Times & USA Today Bestselling author, best known for the dark Romance novel Mr. X.

The Sky Blues are the favorites at $2.00, while a draw, which would be the third draw from the last four Sydney derbies, is at $3.40.The Wanderers will need to improve on their recent form if they are to get a result here. Last week's 2-0 loss to Brisbane Roar means that their winless run is now at seven games and sees them slide down to second last in the table.Speaking of Brisbane, they host the cellar-dwelling Wellington Phoenix on Saturday and have been assessed as $1.91 favorites to win their second match in a row, while the Nix are out at $3.50.Melbourne Victory came from two goals behind against the New Zealand club last weekend to win 3-2, which saw last season's runners-up move back into the top six.Victory host Adelaide United in the opening match of Round 10 on Friday night, and are expected to make it two wins in as many games against the Reds. The hosts are $1.91, while Adelaide are out at $3.60 .The other Victorian club, Melbourne City, are also favored to get the three points this weekend, when they host Central Coast Mariners on Sunday night.City scored a crucial away win against Newcastle Jets last week and are $1.80 to continue their good form against a Mariners side who've collected 12 points from nine games this season and sit just one place behind their opponents in fourth spot on the table.The Jets travel to Perth Glory in the late game on Saturday, where they've lost three of their last four matches.

Although he has just 699 yards in 12 games, putting him at risk of falling short of 1,000 yards on the season, Landry has caught a career-high six touchdown passes this term. While he may not catch as much hype as former LSU teammate Odell Beckham Jr., Landry has been a model of consistency since entering the league, and the 2017 season has been no exception. Apart from the first game of his career, in which Landry was held to zero receptions, he has logged at least three receptions in all but one game, a 2015 tilt against the Baltimore Ravens wherein he caught two passes. He has yet to finish a game with less than five receptions this season. In addition to being a steady producer on offense, Landry has been consistent with his availability. Heading into Week 14, the fourth-year wideout has not missed a game for the Dolphins. Landry will next take the field Sunday, when the Dolphins host the New England Patriots in an AFC East matchup.
