Updated: 4:54 AM EST Dec 7, 2017 Australia legalizes same-sex marriage {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! Updated: 4:54 AM EST Dec 7, 2017 CANBERRA, Australia (CNN) \u2014 \nAustralia's parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage Thursday after years of political jockeying and fierce public debate. \nCheers and applause broke out as ministers voted in favor of the bill following hours of debate and emotional speeches at Parliament House in Canberra. Advertisement \n\"This is Australia: Fair, diverse, loving and filled for respect for everyone,\" said an effusive Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, as he introduced the bill for a final vote. \n\"This is a great day, it belongs to every Australian.\" \nThe move follows a two-month national postal survey that showed 61% of more than 12 million respondents were in favor of marriage equality. \nThe country is now the 24th in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry, according to Pew Research. \nAustralia's first same-sex weddings will not take place until at least January, however, due to a longstanding requirement for all Australian couples to provide a full month's notice of their intention to get married. \nHistoric moment \nMarriage equality campaigners have fought for years for Thursday's vote. Though the bill was expected to pass into law without significant opposition, the lengthy legislative process was excruciatingly slow for the hundreds of advocates watching from the public gallery. \nAmong them was Christine Forster, the gay sister of Tony Abbott, the former Australian Prime Minister who has long been seen as the face of the \"no\" campaign. \nForster was joined in the public gallery by her partner, Virginia Edwards. They plan to marry next year, and Abbott has said he'll attend despite his personal views. \nAbbott and other conservatives proposed amendments to the bill to include further religious protections, all of which were voted down. \n\"These amendments are important and I stress they are not against same-sex marriage, they are simply in favor of the rights of religious organizations to keep doing what their doing,\" Abbott said. \nOpponents of the changes argued they would legalize discrimination against the gay community. The 500 or so people in the gallery were vocal in their disapproval of the amendments. They were warned multiple times that parliamentary rules prohibit them making noise and even applauding. \nAn emotional week \nAfter the bill passed the Senate last week, House proceedings kicked off with fireworks Monday when Liberal MP Tim Wilson surprised his colleagues by proposing to his long-time partner Ryan Bolger. \nThe next day, Liberal MP Andrew Wallace, who is a devout Catholic, shared with his colleagues how his gay daughter helped change his position on same-sex marriage. \n\"She said: Dad, in the years to come, my generation will look back and judge your generation about how you deal with the issue of homosexuality in the same way that your generation considered your parents' generation in the way that they dealt with our Indigenous people,\" Wallace said. \nFighting back tears, Liberal MP Sarah Henderson told the story Wednesday night of a close gay friend of hers who died months ago and who, in one of their last conversations, asked her to continue to push for same-sex marriage. \nSurvey says yes \nThursday's vote comes three weeks after Australia voted overwhelmingly to legalize same-sex marriage as part of a national postal survey lasting two months. \nUnder political pressure to find a solution, the ruling Liberal National Coalition government announced the non-compulsory survey in August, saying if the result was \"yes\" they would allow a free vote in Parliament. \nIn the end, 61.6% of Australia voted in favor of allowing same-sex marriage, with 38.4% saying \"no.\" \nAbout 12.7 million people participated in the survey, which had a response rate of nearly 80% -- which is considered very high. \nAustralians have long been in favor of same-sex marriage, with polling from as long as 10 years ago showing a majority support for legalizing marriage equality.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan bolger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pew research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal national coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:30.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "032c0fea0558a00bb995fc3b895574c9114a3919", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9R2KU4fwicuESWcKfWx8nhgmn1i7BR08P_KMRo7bEXEqH9gTKZUNmSejf4o1p.5P534l_KyMGAEtPDuDdhDc0C", "site_full": "www.coolstreaming.us", "site": "coolstreaming.us", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Live Show Channel (CN) in Live Streaming - CoolStreaming", "title_full": "Live Show Channel (CN) in Live Streaming - CoolStreaming", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.742, "main_image": "http://www.coolstreaming.us/cs1.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86824, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "032c0fea0558a00bb995fc3b895574c9114a3919", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9R2KU4fwicuESWcKfWx8nhgmn1i7BR08P_KMRo7bEXEqH9gTKZUNmSejf4o1p.5P534l_KyMGAEtPDuDdhDc0C", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Live Show Channel (CN) in Live Streaming - CoolStreaming", "text": "Live Show Channel (CN) - in Live Streaming Description Channel Watch in live streaming Live Show Channel from CN - in high quality.

AFP PHOTO In Summary Jurgen Klopp's side were 3-0 up inside 19 minutes on a night that saw their 'Fab Four' run riot -- Coutinho got his first hat-trick for the club, Sadio Mane scored twice and there was one each for Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah. Christiano Ronaldo scored his ninth in the competition this season in reigning champions Real Madrid's 3-2 win at home to Borussia Dortmund, becoming the first player to score in all six Champions League group-stage matches in a season while also equalling his Barcelona rival Lionel Messi's record of 60 group-stage goals in total. Advertisement \nPhilippe Coutinho's hat-trick inspired Liverpool to score seven in their win over Spartak Moscow on Wednesday as they joined Sevilla, Shakhtar Donetsk and Porto in qualifying for the Champions League last 16. \nThat quartet completed the line-up on the final night of group-stage action that was also notable for another Cristiano Ronaldo goals record in the competition.The Portuguese superstar scored his ninth in the competition this season in reigning champions Real Madrid's 3-2 win at home to Borussia Dortmund. \nIn doing so, he became the first player to score in all six Champions League group-stage matches in a season while also equalling his Barcelona rival Lionel Messi's record of 60 group-stage goals in total.Liverpool have also been prolific this season, and their demolition of Spartak was the second time they had won 7-0 en route to finishing top of Group E -- they beat Maribor 7-0 in October. \nJurgen Klopp's side were 3-0 up inside 19 minutes on a night that saw their 'Fab Four' run riot -- Coutinho got his first hat-trick for the club, Sadio Mane scored twice and there was one each for Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah.\"It's really difficult when we go to the next gear and use the space. It was nice to watch tonight,\" Klopp told BT Sport after guiding the Reds into the last 16 for the first time in nine years. \nAs a result, there will be a record five English clubs in next Monday's draw, and they will not be able to face each other.Spartak's defeat meant Sevilla were through regardless of their 1-1 draw with Maribor in Slovenia. Maribor captain Marcos Tavares scored the opener, with Paulo Henrique Ganso coming off the bench to equalise for the Spaniards. Spartak go into the Europa League. \nNapoli out Ukrainian giants Shakhtar are through to the last 16 in Group F at the expense of Napoli after beating Pep Guardiola's Manchester City -- who had already won the section -- 2-1 in Kharkiv.Shakhtar only needed a draw, but took all three points, with Brazilian duo Bernard and Ismaily getting their goals. \nBernard's opener was a beauty, but it was a mistake by City goalkeeper Ederson that allowed Ismaily to make it 2-0.Sergio Aguero's stoppage-time penalty handed a consolation to City, but this was their first defeat of the season and they have the Manchester derby this weekend. \nNapoli had gone in front early on away to already-eliminated Feyenoord through Piotr Zielinski, but Nicolai Jorgensen equalised. Jeremiah St Juste then made it 2-1 at the death for the Dutch champions after they had Tonny Vilhena sent off.\"Now we want to go as far as possible in the Europa League,\" Napoli captain Marek Hamsik told Mediaset Premium. \nPorto also knew a win would take them through in Group G and the two-time European champions ran riot against a hapless Monaco, hammering last season's semi-finalists 5-2.Vincent Aboubakar scored twice for the Portuguese club, with Yacine Brahimi, Alex Telles and Francisco Soares also netting.Monaco replied through a Kamil Glik effort and a Radamel Falcao header against his old club, while Porto's Felipe and Rachid Ghezzal for the visitors were sent off after an altercation in the first half. \nRB Leipzig were forced to settle for a Europa League spot in their debut European campaign.They lost 2-1 at home to group winners Besiktas, for whom Talisca scored a last-minute winner after Naby Keita had cancelled out Alvaro Negredo's early penalty opener. Leipzig had Stefan Ilsanker sent off.Real Madrid were already through before beating Dortmund in a Bernabeu thriller in Group H. \nBorja Mayoral put the holders in front and Ronaldo's stunning, record-setting strike came after just 12 minutes.Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a brace to haul Dortmund level, but Lucas Vazquez won it for the hosts as the Germans drop into the Europa League. \n\"The Champions League is a competition that I love to play and score in, as you can see,\" Ronaldo told UEFA.com.Group H winners Tottenham Hotspur eased to a 3-0 win at home to APOEL, with Fernando Llorente, Son Heung-min and Georges-Kevin N'Koudou scoring at Wembley. advertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ronaldo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "francisco soares", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roberto firmino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alvaro negredo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cristiano ronaldo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "piotr zielinski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marek hamsik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christiano ronaldo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ederson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yacine brahimi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stefan ilsanker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamed salah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naby keita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pep guardiola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex telles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fernando llorente", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radamel falcao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sadio mane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lionel messi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "klopp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamil glik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucas vazquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vincent aboubakar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "serdar tasci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "felipe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicolai jorgensen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coutinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paulo henrique ganso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremiah st juste", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippe coutinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcos tavares", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "son heung-min", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "talisca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georges-kevin n'koudou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fernando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jurgen klopp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergio aguero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachid ghezzal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tonny vilhena", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "champions league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham hotspur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "real madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maribor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dortmund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "napoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mediaset premium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "besiktas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "feyenoord", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "group h.  borja mayoral", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sevilla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borussia dortmund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monaco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europa league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bt sport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spartak moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apoel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "spartak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maribor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "napoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakhtar donetsk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leipzig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wembley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "slovenia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:30.053+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ccc8a92fe036eb2307e7d40f859e0780b40e69bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.872kszRdBGRWsV.vFAc91Q_CYeK_1k8icB8sCoY1ej3HrNzQviJXXJyGmAZX2x2oknWhffN6uIpwV1kBy9yVP2LzN7y5MztS.Jlau1EqwMa_TlAE6FPZ34APu3NGz4ItastV7Mc77k92heH3j2QkLKJp3qFcC_W8-", "site_full": "www.nykaa.com", "site": "nykaa.com", "site_section": "http://www.nykaa.com/brands/faces.html?dir=desc&order=popularity&root=bsearch_brand", "site_categories": ["style_and_fashion", "beauty"], "section_title": "Faces -

(Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press) \nChris Hall National Affairs Editor \nChris Hall is the CBC's National Affairs Editor and host of The House on CBC Radio, based in the Parliamentary Bureau in Ottawa. He began his reporting career with the Ottawa Citizen, before moving to CBC Radio in 1992, where he worked as a national radio reporter in Toronto, Halifax and St. John's. He returned to Ottawa and the Hill in 1998. Canada didn't sign a free trade deal with China, so what happened? \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau says he made substantial progress during his four-day trip to China even though he failed to secure an agreement to begin formal negotiations on a comprehensive trade deal with the world's second-largest economy. \nThose talks, specifically the failure to advance past the exploratory stages, dominated both his meetings in Beijing with senior Chinese officials, and his appearance in Guangzhou at the Fortune Global Forum, attended by some of the most powerful business leaders in the world. Canadian detained in China for 2 years urges caution on trade talks \nIt also dominated Trudeau's news conference with reporters before his return flight to Canada. \nThe prime minister acknowledged the difficulties dealing with a country that doesn't share the same commitment to democratic ideals. But when asked during an armchair discussion at the conference if that's generating pushback from Canadians, Trudeau said there are always challenges no matter who's on the other side of the table. China remains a big prize \n\"What Canadians expect as we engage with trade \u2014 and particularly a country as significant and as much of an economic powerhouse as China has become \u2014 is that they need to be assured that the values, the interests and the jobs Canadians hold dear are going to be compatible and fit within that trade deal.\" \nChina's economy dwarfs Canada and in 2017 is expected to grow at roughly double the pace. \nWith NAFTA talks stalemated over U.S. President Donald Trump's demands for major concessions, and the growing possibility that the deal might be scrapped, Canada is looking to diversify its trade relationships. Trudeau is given a tour of the Chen Clan Academy in Guangzhou. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press) \nThe Trudeau government already has a free trade deal in place with the European Union, but China remains a big prize. \nTrudeau acknowledged that concerns about China's human rights record, and its use of state-owned enterprises to invest heavily around the world, present challenges. \n\"That has particular implications when you have state-owned enterprises competing in the same sphere as private enterprises,\" he said. \"Any discussion on trade as we move forward needs to reflect on the challenges, the opportunities, the advantages and the inconvenience when two systems that are different are trying to collaborate so we can create benefits for both groups of citizens.\" \nTrade, while dominant, wasn't the only topic raised during the visit. \nTrudeau said he spoke to President Xi Jinping about the upcoming meeting that Canada is co-hosting in the new year with the United States to increase diplomatic and political pressure on North Korea. \n\"I had a good conversations with President Xi about this ... and I look forward to continuing conversations with our American partners who have a continued role to play in the peace process that we would like to see get underway in North Korea but we still have a lot of work to do before that.\" Detained wine merchant discussed \nThe prime minister said he also raised a number of cases involving Canadians who've been detained in China. \n\"Canadians expect that I stand up for them and I can assure you that I've raised consular cases with the leadership that I met,\" he said when asked what progress had been made in trying to win the release of Canadian wine merchant John Chang who's been jailed over a customs dispute. Trudeau stressed the benefits of liberalized trade throughout the trip. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press) \nHis daughter had urged Trudeau not to increase ties with China until her father is freed. \n\"I specifically brought up that particular case because I know it's one that Canadians are following very closely.\" Trudeau stressed Canada-China ties \nThroughout his visit Trudeau spoke of the shared ties between Canada and China, positioning them several times in the context of what he called growing populism and nationalism in other parts of the world. \nWhile he never mentioned Trump, he made it clear that Canada and China share a belief that openness and more liberalized trade around the world is an antidote to those forces. Free trade talks with China will not yet begin \n\"What we've actually seen over the past decades in many places is that people are wondering when the benefits are going to reach them. The middle class is stalled in a lot of Western countries and people are starting to withdraw their support for pro-growth policies,\" he said at the conference. \n\"And that's when we start seeing the spikes in nationalism and protectionism.\" Report Typo or Error Send Feedback \nTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

It sounds like your frontal brain got damaged. Even though that may not be the area of impact, the impact would have bounced your brain back and forwards in your skull and the bumpy nodules on the inside of the front of your skull may have damaged your frontal brain. The frontal brain is responsible for the symptoms your describe of memory and emotion etc. I would suggest that you ask your GP for a referral to a neuro psychologist who will do cognitive testing which will identify what area of your brain are not perhaps working so well and causing you the problems you are experiencing. Like you I have had problems with it all being treated as depression as the symptoms of a frontal brain injury/dysexecutive syndrome do overlap. It was only after numerous antidepressants that actually made things worse that professionals have started to accept that its the frontal brain injury.

I went to a few of their events in my first year but stopped going due to a combination of schedule conflicts and because I thought that they took the Bible too literally. I remained on their email list, so I knew that SCF had intentionally chosen to stay affiliated with Intervarsity after the organization had fired someone for being in an LGBT relationship. I assumed that SCF itself was not that conservative, but it turns out, I was wrong. \nI am a Christian, and I am viscerally opposed to SCF\u2019s stance. I might not be the world\u2019s best Christian\u2014I certainly don\u2019t attend church often enough, and I certainly am a sinner (as all of us are)\u2014but I know in my heart that SCF and Intervarsity\u2019s actions towards LGBT students are not what Jesus would do. As I reflected on the piece, I wondered to myself: What if Jesus went to Swarthmore? \nJesus accepted those who were marginalized by society. He hung out with tax collectors, lepers, and a Samaritan woman. In the case of the Samaritan woman, Jesus spoke to her and shared His Word with her, even though Jews didn\u2019t associate with Samaritans. Jesus also rebuked leaders who were too caught up in petty rules and expressed that what comes from the heart is more important, \u201cJesus replied, \u2018And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? For God said, \u2018Honor your father and your mother\u2019 and \u2018Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.\u2019 But you say that if a man says to his father and mother, \u2018Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God,\u2019 he is not to \u2018honor his father\u2019 with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition,\u2019\u201d (Matthew 15: 3-7). Jesus spent time with folks from marginalized backgrounds, not those who were caught up in the laws and rules. I see a parallel: Jesus would spend his time with Swatties of marginalized backgrounds, but wouldn\u2019t be an SCF leader. The same Jesus that said, \u201cA new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another,\u201d (John 13:34). Therefore, he would not be a part of a group that makes LGBT students feel unwelcome. \nThere is a troublesome contradiction in SCF\u2019s policy. There are many ways to interpret the passages in Leviticus that appear to condemn homosexuality, with key words having five to six different possible translations that change the meaning of the passages. The New King James Version, The New International Version, and the King James Version all translate the passages differently. SCF and Intervarsity are choosing to interpret the text in the most conservative way that excludes LGBT people. Reading the Bible in this way and not allowing room for interpretation or context is a political act and a statement on their beliefs. \nThe Bible also says that women should not speak in church, \u201cAs in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?\u201d (1 Cor. 14:33-36). SCF allows women to be leaders, so why draw the line at homosexuality? \nThe Bible also tells us that Jesus came to Earth and was crucified to fulfil the requirements of the Law for his believers, \u201cknowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified,\u201d (Galatians 2:16). The denomination I practice, United Methodist, preaches grace by faith alone, meaning that it is the belief in God and Jesus, and not good works that gets a person to heaven. Christianity does not require strict adherence to the laws outlined in Leviticus, Christ came here to fulfil them for us. I\u2019m not a theologist, but the Bible is clear that Jesus\u2019s purpose, the reason he was born and the reason he died, was for our sins and so that the only law that was required was this: \u201c\u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.\u2019 The second is this: \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no commandment greater than these,\u201d (Mark 12:30-31). \nThere is no love more powerful than the love that Jesus has for us. Jesus loves all of us, no matter who we are or what our sexual orientation is. SCF\u2019s exclusion of queer students in leadership position seems to go against what the Bible says about judging others, \u201cDo not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you\u201d (Matthew 7:1-2). \nI highly doubt that if Jesus went to Swarthmore He would support SCF\u2019s exclusionary practices.

For many, the World Cup is more than just a soccer tournament. Because it is the most watched sporting event in the world, the tournament provides a platform for cultural expression, and for a nation to represent itself in front of the entire world. \n\u201cThe tournament has a way of enabling citizens to puff out their chest; of giving them license to say \u2018this is our team\u2019 and having some pride in their nation, and no other sporting event does that because no other sport truly embraces so many people from every corner of the globe,\u201d explains Nigel Reed, a soccer journalist for CBC Sports. \nDuring the selection show for the 2018 edition of the World Cup, the 32 qualified teams were drawn into eight groups of four teams. The teams were chosen from four pots based on their October 2017 FIFA rankings. Pot one contained the seven highest ranked teams in the tournament, plus the tournament host, Russia, pot two consisted of the next eight teams in the ranking, and so on. Each group received one team from each pot. \nIn addition to the mandatory placement of Russia into Pot One, the draw conditions stipulated that no group could include more than two UEFA (European) nations or more than one team from CAF (Africa), CONCACAF (North and Central America and the Caribbean), CONMEBOL (South America), OFC (Oceania), or AFC (Asia). \nThis year\u2019s draw produced many interesting results but surprisingly no clear \u201cgroup of death.\u201d A group of death is a group in which the number of strong teams is greater than the number of qualifying places, meaning at least one strong competitor will be eliminated. In the 2014 World Cup, the United States was drawn into the group of death along with Germany, Portugal, and Ghana. \nBelow is a breakdown of the eight groups from this year\u2019s draw. \nGroup A: Russia (#65 in the FIFA rankings), Uruguay (17), Egypt (30), Saudi Arabia (63) \nThe 2018 World Cup will kick off June 14th with an uninspiring matchup between the two lowest ranked teams in the tournament, Russia and Saudi Arabia. In the tournament\u2019s weakest group, a strong Uruguay attack featuring world-class strikers, Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez, is expected to lead La Celeste to the Round of 16. The second spot in the knockout stages will likely be determined in a three-way battle between the host nation, Russia, playing for the pride of an entire nation, an underrated Egyptian team starring, Mohamed Salah, one of the world\u2019s most in-form players who currently plays for Premier League giant, Liverpool FC, and the little known Saudi Arabia squad. \nPrediction: 1 st place: Uruguay, 2 nd place: Egypt, 3 rd place: Russia, 4 th place: Saudi Arabia \nGroup B: Portugal (3), Spain (8), Iran (34), Morocco (48) \nGroup B will likely come down to a battle between the reigning European Champions, Portugal, and the 2010 World Cup Champions, Spain, although Morocco should not be underestimated having gone undefeated in its qualifying group. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal\u2019s 32-year-old star striker and one of the best players in soccer history, will be especially motivated as this could be his final chance to take home the World Cup crown. However, I believe Spain\u2019s balanced attack and strong defending will propel the La Roja over the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o . \nPrediction: 1 st place: Spain, 2 nd place: Portugal, 3 rd place: Morocco, 4 th place: Iran \nGroup C: France (7), Peru (10), Denmark (19), Australia (43) \nFrance will be licking their chops with this favorable draw. Peru, although highly ranked, lacks the star quality to compete with France, and Denmark is too reliant on star Christian Eriksen. However, expect a strong battle for second place between Peru and Denmark, two nations that play with a lot of heart and grit. Australia, already the weakest team in the group, is currently without a coach and will find it hard to adapt to a new system before the tournament begins. \nPrediction: 1 st place: France, 2 nd place: Denmark, 3 rd place: Peru, 4 th place: Australia \nGroup D: Argentina (4), Croatia (18), Iceland (21), Nigeria (41) \nThe closest group to a \u201cgroup of death,\u201d Group D features four highly competitive teams. Lionel Messi, the world\u2019s best player, leads an Argentina team that should claim the group. Croatia, Iceland (the smallest nation to ever play in the World Cup with a population size of around 330,000), and the best pot four team in the tournament, Nigeria, will duke it out for the second place in the knockout round. \nPrediction: 1 st place: Argentina, 2 nd place: Croatia, 3 rd place: Nigeria, 4 th place: Iceland \nGroup E: Brazil (2), Switzerland (11), Costa Rica (22), Serbia (38) \nNeymar and Brazil will roll through this group in an attempt to recover from their 7-1 loss to Germany on home turf in the semifinals of the 2014 World Cup. The Switzerland \u2013 Costa Rica match will likely determine the second team through to the Round of 16. Will the creativity of Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri propel the Swiss through to the next stage, or will the strong goalkeeping and leadership of Real Madrid star Keylor Navas lead Costa Rica to yet another World Cup upset? \nPrediction: 1 st place: Brazil, 2 nd place: Costa Rica, 3 rd place: Switzerland, 4 th place: Serbia \nGroup F: Germany (1), Mexico (16), Sweden (25), South Korea (62) \nGroup F is a strong group, but one that the reigning World Cup champions and current top ranked, Germany, should have no trouble navigating. Mexico cruised through qualifying using a rotating squad, but will face a difficult test in Sweden, which defeated 2006 World Cup Champions, Italy, in a playoff without their star striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who retired from international soccer in 2016. \nPrediction: 1 st place: Germany, 2 nd place: Mexico, 3 rd place: Sweden, 4 th place: South Korea \nGroup G: Belgium (5), England (12), Tunisia (28), Panama (49) \nGroup G should be a two-way shootout between Belgium and England. Belgium has put together its best squad in history, but will have its hands full with a strong England team trying to put past World Cup failures behind it. Expect Tunisia and Panama to put up good efforts, but the two nations will likely be relegated to fighting it out for third place. \nPrediction: 1 st place: England, 2 nd place: Belgium, 3 rd place: Tunisia, 4 th place: Panama \nGroup H: Poland (6), Colombia (13), Senegal (32), Japan (44) \nGroup H is the most open group of the draw. Despite being a top seed, Poland lacks technical quality outside of striker Robert Lewandowski. Colombia will hope to repeat its 2014 World Cup heroics on the back of Radamel Falcao, and Lewandowski\u2019s Bayern Munich teammate, James Rodriguez. Senegal\u2019s hopes rely on raw talent and the extreme athleticism of Liverpool star Sadio Mane. Even Japan, featuring Shinji Kagawa and Keisuke Honda, is a threat to move on to the next round. \nPrediction: 1 st place: Colombia, 2 nd place: Senegal, 3 rd place: Poland, 4 th place: Japa \nGroup L (not an official group): Chile (9), Italy (15), Netherlands (20), USA (27) \nThis group of nations will be extremely disappointed to have missed out on the 2018 World Cup. Italy is a 4-time World Cup champion and has not missed a World Cup final since 1958, Chile is a 2-time defending Copa America champion, the Netherlands were World Cup runner-ups in 2010, and the United States missed the finals for the first time since 1986 despite the rapid emergence of 19-year-old wunderkind Christian Pulisic. \nRegardless of how the groups pan out, the 2018 World Cup will without a doubt be full of upsets and emotion. Some stars will emerge, others will crumble, and nations will battle for one of the most coveted titles in the world", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

December 7, 2017 in Campus Journal by Willa Glickman \nGiven that I am at a time in my life when almost any moment could be productively spent chipping away at a tall stack of obligatory and enlightening readings, and more often than not I am sitting in a library while a staggering number of nationally- and internationally-acclaimed publications wait at my fingertips, a mere keystroke away, I was surprised to find myself spending hours reading articles with headlines like \u201cThe Great Meal Swipe Debate of 2017\u201d from the student newspapers of colleges I do not attend. \nBefore the beginning of this year, I admit I was not a particularly regular reader of \u201cThe Phoenix\u201d. I took note when the opinions section would get heated, and I was fortunate to have arrived at Swarthmore in the last year in which it was still possible to wander into a dorm room lounge and hear a stranger reading aloud, with mingled admiration and amusement, the latest intricate, verging-on-the-incomprehensible, Flaubert-and-George-Lucas-reference-riddled arts section review by Erik Myers \u201915. However, I found it difficult to cultivate an interest in staying abreast of campus news when the news outside Swarthmore seemed so much bigger and more pressing. \nYet after recently signing on as a Campus Journal writer, I developed an appreciation for the work at \u201cThe Phoenix\u201d that is carried out each week and for the craft of student journalism in general, from making connections in order to stay informed on administrative politics, to engagingly framing events that may have audience attendance in the single digits, to the basic gumption of approaching strangers for their opinions and finding the exact questions that will draw them out. \nI became interested in how other publications tackled these issues and started reading around, focusing mostly on the newspapers of other small liberal arts colleges. I wanted to see how they managed to keep small-pond news feeling fresh and got strangely sucked in. Each paper had a distinct editorial voice and its own set of well-worn inside jokes, conveying a sense of the cozy insularity and sometimes comically self-perpetuating culture that gives ea small school its particular stereotype. \n(By way of example, one need look no farther than the opening of our own Erik Myers\u2019 2014 review of a performance by the Yellow Stockings theater group to get the flavor of a paradigmatic Swarthmorean: \u201c If you look deeply enough into the rabbit hole, the stained glass windows, the use-value of Essie Mae\u2019s, the dubious exchange-value of its meal credits, across the picturesque courtyard at the weary door of the Intercultural Center, up at the exaggerated Gothicity of its bell-tower, and finally down into the bright fluorescent-lit basement, at the Kitsch, the condoms and the candy that go for sale next to monolithic stacks of often unbearably dense and inapplicable textbooks, Swarthmore\u2019s Clothier Hall and Shakespeare resemble something like a Church and its Pope, or a couple-centuries-old theology, a religious institution in any event suddenly reinvigorated by the always threatening, dramatic, sometimes even godless gestures of its students. Heidegger says that places teach us more about phenomena than people do.\u201d) \nHowever, the consistent coverage across publications of racial discrimination, sexual assault, and insufficient mental health resources, both through investigative reporting and thoughtful op-eds, reveal the ways in which campuses are as fractured as they are insular. Not all campus news is small, even if it\u2019s playing out on a small stage. \nInterested to learn more about the daily workings of student papers and the experience of those who run them, I contacted Kenyon\u2019s \u201cThe Kenyon Collegian\u201d and \u201cThe Student Life\u201d, the joint newspaper of the Claremont Colleges (a five-college consortium consisting of Pomona, Claremont McKenna, Scripps, Harvey Mudd and Pitzer). The editors-in-chief of both publications responded nearly within the hour, testifying to the well-oiled professionalism of their respective journalistic machines, and agreed to speak over the phone. \n\u201cThe Collegian\u201d caught my eye with its clean format and extensive arts coverage, unsurprising given Kenyon\u2019s reputation for creative writing. When I first encountered the paper, the front page was sporting an interview with Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, author of the \u201cNew York Times\u201d bestseller \u201cBrooklyn\u201d. Gabrielle Healy, the editor-in-chief, said that this piece was part of a popular feature called \u201cOn the Record\u201d in which the paper interviews speakers who come to campus, which can be more engaging than just publishing a review of the talk. \nThough Healy stressed that Kenyon is a small community and Gambier, Ohio a small and isolated town (a village, in fact, with a population of 2,390), she said that the newspaper is rarely short for content, largely because of the staff\u2019s involvement across varying aspects of campus life. One news editor is the president of a sorority and reports on Greek life, another is a member of the cross-country team, and another is \u2013 shockingly \u2013 a math major. \n\u201cMost of us are humanities majors,\u201d Healy admits, \u201cso he\u2019s able to touch an area we don\u2019t always get to.\u201d \nHealy uses her connections with professors as an important way to source stories \u2013 after signing up for a dance class for the first time, the paper\u2019s coverage of dance events increased because she asked the professor to let her know about anything notable coming up. The editors also have a standing weekly meeting with the president of the college, which allows them to stay abreast of administrative politics, and Healy said that the paper is established enough that sources will often reach out to them when they hear something newsworthy. \n\u201cThe Collegian\u201d embraces its circumscribed range by keeping its editorial content intentionally focused on Kenyon. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a symbiotic relationship between the news and opinion sections,\u201d said Healy, meaning that each week the staff will publish editorials on the paper\u2019s most newsworthy items. The paper also publishes op-eds on national news but ensures that they always have relevance to local topics. \n\u201cIt\u2019s unique to Kenyon that we try to keep editorial content localized,\u201d Healy continued. \nThis immersion in the local is a function of Healy\u2019s belief that because the community is so small, the importance of \u201cThe Collegian\u201d as a resource is particularly great. \n\u201cOur job is to inform and engage the Kenyon community, to represent its diversity, to tell stories that aren\u2019t being told. At least in Gambier, we\u2019re the only paper in town,\u201d she said. \u201cI think doing the news is a public service, I really believe that.\u201d \nShe is particularly proud of publishing stories that might not have otherwise come to the campus\u2019s attention, such as a story that they broke after a receiving a tip-off that a Kenyon alum had been named an executive at the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank. It was summer and they were not publishing a print edition, but were able to get the word out online and generate attention in the alumni community. \nLiam Brooks, the editor-in-chief of \u201cThe Student Life\u201d, also believes that a primary function of his publication is its ability to provide a platform for conversations about topics that might otherwise fade from attention, often with measurable results. In the fall of 2015, a dean at Claremont McKenna suggested in an email that students of color \u201cdidn\u2019t fit the mold\u201d of the college, sparking large-scale protests and two hunger strikes, and resulting in the dean\u2019s resignation. Brooks says that while events transpired so quickly that the paper wasn\u2019t able to publish many op-eds on the subject, their news coverage made it possible for all the campuses in the consortium to be aware of what was happening at Claremont. They also leaked an internal report by administrators at Harvey Mudd about the overwhelming workload, which caused protests that ultimately led to changes in curriculum. \n\u201cWe were able to give context to things that otherwise might have been dismissed,\u201d said Brooks. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the most powerful thing we can do, to say hey, this thing is worthy of conversation.\u201d \n\u201cThe Student Life\u201d is the oldest student newspaper in Southern California, and is considered a fairly traditional publication among the generally far-left-leaning students of the Claremont colleges. By Brooks\u2019 account, while it is generally respected, it is sometimes critiqued for being \u201cbigger and older and slower\u201d and producing \u201cless radically progressive reporting\u201d than other, less official publications. However, it still has a more alternative feeling than \u201cThe Collegian\u201d, publishing headlines like \u201cThe Exploitative Politics of Thrifting,\u201d and \u201cFlavorful New Vape Trend Lights up 5Cs,\u201d and it hosts one of the longest consistently-running sex columns of any newspaper in California. \nBrooks says that while the paper is \u201cpretty open to radical opinions\u201d and is willing to publish conservative opinions \u201cwhen we can find them,\u201d generally the most controversy generated by the paper takes place not within the campuses but across right-wing media outlets, which occasionally will republish \u201cStudent Life\u201d content as an example of excessive left-wing sensitivity. When I spoke to Brooks, this had happened several days before with an op-ed they had published about access to the outdoors being a form of white privilege. \nThough Brooks says that the paper has no political bent and always presents facts impartially, he believes that student journalism performs a political service. \n\u201cI personally have tried to push the way we\u2019ve covered news to be a bit more adversarial than in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely see the role of the student paper as being inherently political in that we have to actively seek out truths and things that are not being told by administrators.\u201d \nHe noted that because private colleges are inherently promotional, it is important that student papers serve as a form of independent review. \n\u201cA lot of the media that college students consume about their campuses is going to be produced by those campuses,\u201d said Brooks. \u201cMagazines that get sent home to parents, posters about how great the school is \u2013 everything in your eyeline at campus has a vested interest in saying: these campuses are the best places ever, come here. That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t really like these schools, but it\u2019s pretty rare actually to get a different voice and a different narrative out there.\u201d \nBoth Healy and Brooks spoke about their time working for student publications as having completely transformed their college experience, and Brooks said that he is constantly aware of his role as editor and is always on the lookout for news. \n\u201cI think about the paper every day. I\u2019m always wondering if breaking news is going to happen right now. Whenever my phone buzzes I think, hey, is it something important?\u201d \nPerhaps it is this outlook that stuck with me most from these conversations: that to effectively participate in student journalism is to live in a state of deep engagement with all aspects of campus life \u2013 to attend events, to form relationships, to pay attention to policy changes, even if they seem mundane. It is a form of active listening and active questioning, a type of civic engagement that is vital to a community and, as these editors can attest, personally enjoyable, inside or outside the newsroom.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik myers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakespeare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "willa glickman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pitzer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colm t\u00f3ib\u00edn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heidegger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabrielle healy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey mudd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liam brooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claremont mckenna", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "scripps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "campus journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "essie mae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national policy institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercultural center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claremont colleges", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swarthmore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenyon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pomona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swarthmore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gambier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claremont", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:32.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fffad051a820e88a4aef768de587bf59dbcf429a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1Gvw_wg5L2gAmhkHGF8k.22", "site_full": "www.ozbargain.com.au", "site": "ozbargain.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.ozbargain.com.au/classified", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Classifieds -

Though there are still two different versions of this controversial bill in Congress, both have serious consequences that affect the college\u2019s budget, students, employees, and alumni due to an excise tax, repeal of the college\u2019s tax-exempt status, and a tax on graduate students\u2019 stipends. \nOne of the main parts of the bill that affects the college is the excise tax on college endowments. In the House version, the tax will apply to colleges that have an endowment of $250,000 or more per student. The Senate version has raised this to $500,000 per student, and according to vice president for finance and administration Greg Brown it applies to 27 colleges, including Swarthmore. \nEconomics professor John Caskey made some rough calculations of the financial effect of this tax. Since excise tax is 1.4 percent of the college\u2019s earnings from the endowment \u2014 approximately $100 million per year \u2014 the college would have to pay $1.4 million every year. This money would be cut from the college\u2019s operating budget, which is $163.3 million for 2017-2018. Over half of the college\u2019s budget comes from endowment income. \nBrown noted that one million dollars is about 20 scholarships, assuming they are $50,000 each. Caskey estimated that this kind of cut to the budget would be equivalent to letting about five professors go, which would also mean the loss of 16 courses per year. \n\u201cThis would hurt students,\u201d Caskey said. \u201cObviously, your selection of courses is smaller and the class size gets larger.\u201d \nAccording to Caskey, this could potentially affect prospective students\u2019 college selections of colleges, but since the college\u2019s competitors are facing the same tax, it will likely not make a difference. While the cuts to the budget would still be significant, Caskey said it is unlikely that the college would cut academics that severely. \nThe second part of the bill that would affect Swat is the removal of the tax-exempt status of colleges\u2019 bonds, which is only present in the House version. This part of the tax plan would not only apply to wealthy, elite colleges but every college and university in the country. This means that if the college borrows money at an interest rate of 3.0 percent without tax exemption, it would effectively be borrowing at a rate of 3.5 percent due to the added tax premium it would have to pay. Because borrowing would become considerably more expensive, the college\u2019s construction projects would be affected. \n\u201cThat costs a lot of money,\u201d Brown said, referring to the higher borrowing rate. \u201cThat\u2019s serious for us.\u201d \nUnlike the excise tax, which would take effect immediately, the consequences of the change of the tax-exempt status would take effect gradually because it only applies to new debt that the college will acquire. According to Caskey, the college\u2019s current debt is $250 million. \n\u201cIf you assume [the debt level] continues, the loss of the tax-exempt status of the college\u2019s bonds would probably raise the cost of the college\u2019s borrowing by about half a percentage point \u2026 Over time, gradually, that would end up costing the college about $1.25 million per year,\u201d Caskey said. \nIf the House bill passes, this cost would be in addition to the $1.4 million per year paid on the excise tax on the endowment. \nThe bill also increases the standard deduction, which is an amount of money that reduces a person\u2019s taxed income if they donate money to charity. Caskey explained that currently, the standard deduction is $6,350 ($12,700 for a married couple), but under the new law, it would be raised to $12,000 per person ($24,000 for a married couple). Because of the higher standard deduction, people are less likely to itemize their donations when filing taxes. This reduces the incentive for people who would otherwise donate to give gifts to the college. Caskey noted that the college \u201cis likely to see a decline in donations.\u201d \nThough he could not say for certain what the loss of money would be, he added that it is concerning to the college. \nThe combined effects of these parts of the bill would significantly impact the college\u2019s finances. Over time, 10 to 12 years from now, with the combination of the excise tax and the loss of tax-exempt status together, there would be about $2.5 million cut from the budget each year. Caskey suggested that the college might have to cut from academics, libraries, sports teams, or the Dean\u2019s office. Questions have also been raised about cutting financial aid from students. \n\u201cThe college doesn\u2019t want to do that, and they have a need-blind policy, but there are \nother ways they could do it while maintaining need-blind,\u201d Caskey said, though he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think the college is going to do that sort of thing \u2026 They could but they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d \nHowever, it is still undecided where the cuts would apply. \nBrown said, \u201cI haven\u2019t made any specific recommendations on that yet \u2026 If we\u2019re looking at several million dollars a year on a $160 million a year budget, we would have to look to slow down some of the things that we\u2019re doing. And based on our institutional priorities, make reductions in the budget \u2026 Right now, I think we\u2019re running fairly lean, so any cuts I think will be seen and will hurt.\u201d \nAccording to Brown, Swat currently gives its employees benefits that includes money for their children\u2019s or their own college education, but under the new bill, that money would be taxed. \n\u201cThat becomes taxable income for [employees] instead of a benefit. The word I would use for that is unfair, and I think it goes against the values of our institution,\u201d Brown said. \nA highly controversial portion of the tax bill is the new tax on graduate students\u2019 stipends, which has caused walkouts at universities across the country. This tax would affect recent Swat graduates who are pursuing their Ph.D.s or any current Swat student who would like to obtain a Ph.D. in the future. \nRaehoon Jeung \u201917, who is getting his Ph.D. in bioinformatics and integrative genomics at Harvard Medical School, said many graduate students are concerned about this change. Currently, graduate students receive a stipend for doing work, but it is not equivalent to a job because students don\u2019t actually see the money and don\u2019t get any significant savings from it. \n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, we would be paying around $10,000 extra tax per year if the bill passes. Then, I will no longer be self-sufficient \u2026 If the analysis that I read in articles are accurate, the impact is very severe. We would go from being barely self-sufficient to being reliant on loans or help from parents as in college,\u201d Jeung said in an email. \nJeung also said that had he known about the tax bill before attending graduate school, it would likely have changed his mind about getting a Ph.D., and he believes that it will influence students who would have otherwise attended graduate school. \n\u201cWith this new plan in effect, the opportunity cost for choosing to go to graduate school [for a Ph.D.] is too high. During the 5-6 years, we are foregoing chances to earn more money, and now we would also be accumulating debt,\u201d he continued. \nThis development is concerning to the college\u2019s administration as well. \n\u201cFor our government to basically say that furthering your education and furthering our ability to create the scholars who are going to come up with the solutions for future problems is very short-sighted,\u201d said Brown. \u201cIt will discourage smart people from going to graduate school, who should go to graduate school. And it will discourage creativity and entrepreneurship.\u201d \nThe college administration views the new tax bill as a serious threat to the college\u2019s educational mission. On Nov. 13, President Valerie Smith sent out an e-mail to students outlining the damages that the new bill would inflict upon the college. \nIn the letter to politicians in Washington that she added to the e-mail, President Smith wrote: \n\u201c The cumulative result of these tax changes will be losses in jobs and national economic health; educational access and quality; innovation and discovery; and American global competitiveness \u2026 This will directly harm students and their families.\u201d \nFor many students on campus, the larger aspects of the bill would affect their family\u2019s finances. According to Brown, about one-third of students from the class of 2021 who receive financial aid \u2014 56% of the class \u2014 come from families who earn $60,000 or less per year. \n\u201cAlmost a third of our financial aid students come from families who are in that lowest income bracket. And yes, I think they would be harmed by this bill,\u201d said Brown. \nHe also cited another part of the House version of the bill that is damaging to Swarthmore students\u2019 ability to pay back loans. \n\u201cStudent interest is no longer deductible, so if you borrow for your education, you currently get a tax deduction for paying back that loan. Under this proposal, you wouldn\u2019t get that,\u201d he said. \nWithin student political groups on campus, there is also opposition the bill, particularly on the part of the Swarthmore Democrats, which held a flash phone bank on Tuesday to contact Pennsylvania representatives in Washington. \n\u201cThe tax plan is ridiculous,\u201d Abby Diebold \u201920, \u201cBasically the entire Democratic party is aligned with Swat Dems in this instance.\u201d \nDiebold also said that while she wouldn\u2019t characterize the parts of the bill such as the excise tax that target wealthy, elite schools like Swat as \u201canti-intellectual,\u201d the effects on higher education are a problem. \n\u201cI think that our biggest issue with [the bill] is that academic institutions are the only corporate-type organization that is not having their taxes cut \u2026 taxes on the endowment and higher institutions are going up, and that doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Diebold said. \nJorge Tello \u201919, the new president of the Swarthmore Conservative Society, said that though there has not been a formal meeting to discuss the club\u2019s position on the bill, opinion among the members seems to be mixed. Some, like Tello, oppose elements of the bill such as the excise tax while some support it in its entirety. Tello said that he doesn\u2019t see enough strong arguments for the excise tax. \n\u201cPersonally I\u2019m against it as well,\u201d he said. \u201cI think my main concern with it is that I don\u2019t understand what the main purpose of taxing endowments is because \u2026 I think there\u2019s better ways to achieve [helping low income students], like possibly setting a percentage of the endowment that they have to spend on [those students]. Because that was one of the main arguments for it, that it would use more of its endowment on helping low income students.\u201d \nCaskey said that though he is personally against the excise tax, which specifically targets wealthy schools, he can\u2019t find a strong enough argument against it. \n\u201cWe\u2019re an extremely privileged place \u2026 Is it unfair that we have to reduce our privilege?\u201d he said. \nThough it is true that the college is a privileged institution and will remain privileged compared to other colleges, there are other elements of the bill, particularly the House version, that will have a significant effect on the college\u2019s finances as well as on current students and alumni. If the bill passes with any of these changes to the taxation of higher education, Swarthmore and its students will likely have to face financial problems, whether they are personal or in the college\u2019s budget.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john caskey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abby diebold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caskey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jorge tello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raehoon jeung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valerie smith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard medical school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diebold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swarthmore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swarthmore conservative society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swarthmore democrats", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:32.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fffad051a820e88a4aef768de587bf59dbcf429a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1Gvw_wg5L2gAmhkHGF8k.22", "site_full": "www.ozbargain.com.au", "site": "ozbargain.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.ozbargain.com.au/classified", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Classifieds - OzBargain Classifieds", "title": "[Xbox One - Digital] Xbox Store Sale: Cuphead $25.45, COD: WWII $82.96, Observer $26.77 + More", "title_full": "[Xbox One - Digital] Xbox Store Sale: Cuphead $25.45, COD: WWII $82.96, Observer $26.77 + More - OzBargain", "published": "2017-12-07T12:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.057, "main_image": "https://files.ozbargain.com.au/n/51/348051x.jpg?h=8f2d7bf6", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10489, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "80bd58430cd112453c8d739f15f6dfa79f7b33ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1Gvw_wg5L2gAuNcy6j1yBgPaAgwiEGBkiJhkIdZrTI.qA--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "SpottyMoose", "published": "2017-12-07T12:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Unannounced because it's not much of a sale\u2026", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:32.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f53ff6da174cdeefaf8f202c3523810d5d248c5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoC4aR_aDlQRkmRnV3QThtvZ8kxfxVMtxHZ6fx_MTUvpCemNJRJ7ge36lnrtWV8a2gXPtAwhG_BN_qGvxpLbWGWtzebXu0J8P16Ao1W4EeJVw--", "site_full": "swarthmorephoenix.com", "site": "swarthmorephoenix.com", "site_section": "http://swarthmorephoenix.com/feed", "site_categories": ["education", "college_life"], "section_title": "The Phoenix", "title": "Into the Archives: Apartheid Divestment, part II", "title_full": "Into the Archives: Apartheid Divestment, part II", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://swarthmorephoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1385736_1428742394014117_1463113845_n.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f53ff6da174cdeefaf8f202c3523810d5d248c5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoC4aR_aDlQRkmRnV3QThtvZ8kxfxVMtxHZ6fx_MTUvpCemNJRJ7ge36lnrtWV8a2gXPtAwhG_BN_qGvxpLbWGWtzebXu0J8P16Ao1W4EeJVw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shreya Chattopadhyay", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Into the Archives: Apartheid Divestment, part II", "text": "  Into the Archives: Apartheid Divestment, part II Published on December 7, 2017 in Campus Journal / Columns / Into the Archives by Shreya Chattopadhyay \nLast CJ issue, I wrote about an exchange between 1985 Swarthmore grad Perry Chang and then-president David Fraser about the college\u2019s policy on divestment from Apartheid. This week, I\u2019d like to dig a little into what that process actually looked like. \nBefore the college came to the decision to divest in 1986, it adhered to the \u201cSullivan Principles,\u201d a set of rules enacted by an African-American minister Leon Sullivan on the board of General Motors. GM was one of the largest employers of black South-Africans in Apartheid South Africa. The principles, which were originally created in 1977 and slightly amended in 1984, were as follows: Non-segregation of the races in all eating, comfort, and work facilities. Equal and fair employment practices for all employees. Equal pay for all employees doing equal or comparable work for the same period of time. Initiation of and development of training programs that will prepare, in substantial numbers, blacks and other nonwhites for supervisory, administrative, clerical, and technical jobs. Increasing the number of blacks and other nonwhites in management and supervisory positions. Improving the quality of life for blacks and other nonwhites outside the work environment in such areas as housing, transportation, school, recreation, and health facilities. Working to eliminate laws and customs that impede social, economic, and political justice. \nEventually, however, the principles came under fire as perpetuating an inherently oppressive system, as opposed to ending it. \nOn December 7, 1985, 41 students and one member of the faculty sat-in on the the Board of Manager\u2019s meeting to protest the college\u2019s policy of continued investment in companies doing business in South Africa. In a Board of Managers document from March 3, 1986 \u2014 the day divestment was finally agreed-upon by the Board \u2014 titled \u201cBackground on Swarthmore College, Endowment and Divestment of South African-Related Stock\u201d outlined the process of the college\u2019s transition from the Sullivan principles to divestment. \n\u201cThey ringed the room, made brief speeches and then sat on the floor. Board Chairman Eugene Lang told them that the meeting would not be conducted in their presence. Discussions failed to resolve the impasse, and at 12:30 p.m. the meeting was adjourned,\u201d the document read. \nOn December 11, 1985, students conducted a similar sit-in, this time in president David Fraser\u2019s office. \n\u201cAt noon on Wednesday, December 11 , 1985, 6 students entered President David Fraser\u2019s office for a sit-in, although the President was out of the country for three weeks. The students demanded total divestment of stocks in companies doing business in South Africa, increased efforts to recruit black students, increased efforts to recruit black faculty, and the appointment of black faculty to important committee and professional positions. Between 3 and 40 students rotated in the President\u2019s office for the next nine days, leaving the office on December 19 around 3 p.m.,\u201d the document continued. \nFrom student, alumni, and social pressure \u2014 as exhibited by Chang\u2019s letter and many others \u2014 the college eventually decided to pursue full divestment. \nAs of the day the college finally divested, $42.5 million of the college\u2019s $195 million endowment was invested in 41 companies doing a fraction of their business in South Africa. However, this number had been decreasing for a while. \n\u201cUnder the direction of the Board of Managers, the College has monitored its investments since 1978. To date, Swarthmore has sold over $3 million of South African-related stock, in four separate divestments. ln each case, the Board advised its investment counselors to sell the stock because the companies involved did not convince the College that they were conforming to the Sullivan Principles, which set forth goals for the equal treatment of workers of all races,\u201d the document continued. \nIn a memo dated that same day, Vice President and Treasurer of the board Loren Hart announced the board\u2019s decision to fully divest. \n\u201cAt the meeting on Saturday, March 1, the Board of Managers decided to move toward total divestment of stock in companies which do business in South Africa following a plan to be presented at the May meeting of the Board. Since the plan is not yet developed, we cannot now estimate precisely the impact of divestment on the endowment and, hence, on endowment income available for next year\u2019s budget,\u201d Hart wrote. \nHart and other board members were concerned with the impact of divestment on the community as a whole. \n\u201cThis uncertainty, combined with the Board\u2019s considerable concern the large amount of endowment income we need to balance next year\u2019s budget, has forced us to cut next year\u2019s budget by $300,000 (1%) from the amount previously discussed,\u201d Hart continued. \u201cThe cost is to be borne approximately equally by the whole community: from faculty and staff, in Iower than expected compensation; from students, in lower financial aid; in lower departmental budgets; and lower major maintenance expenditures.\u201d \nIndeed, while the decision to divest had much support, it was not without setbacks. According to a letter from Ken Landis \u201948, former Vice President, by April of 1988 the college had lost $1,300,000 in its efforts to divest. \n\u201cIf extrapolated, this would mean total divestment would cause the College to lose each year the price of building a new Performing Arts Center or twice the cost of running our financial aid program,\u201d Landis wrote to 1982 alum Dana Lyons. \nThe college crafted a plan to manage the losses over time, but it also emphasized that the goal was not to extend the losses for generations. \n\u201cThe Board has cons\u00edstently expressed its concern that future generations at swarthmore not bear the costs from divesting. We now deduct 300,000 from the operating budget each year \u2014 to cover losses incurred by this process. Thus, it is the current students, parents, faculty, and staff who are shouldering the financial responsibility for the change,\u201d Landis wrote in another letter in 1989 to two alums. \nIt\u2019s true, the students of the time did shoulder the financial responsibility for the charge. But they did also enjoy the moral responsibility of pressuring their own institution to help undermine an explicitly racist regime. By 1991, a year after the college fully divested, Apartheid was over \u2014 at least in a codified sense. \nDesmond Tutu said of Apartheid, \n\u201c In South Africa, we could not have achieved our freedom and just peace without the help of people around the world, who through the use of non-violent means, such as boycotts and divestment, encouraged their governments and other corporate actors to reverse decades-long support for the Apartheid regime.\u201d \nThat\u2019s a legacy of which Swat should be proud of being a part. Sacrifices were made, from an institutional point of view; faculty and staff took pay cuts, financial aid took a hit, projects were not enacted. But the sacrifices did work, and the success of Apartheid divestment serves as a reminder that collective action and institutional accountability is not only possible, but powerful.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ken landis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perry chang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dana lyons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eugene lang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loren hart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shreya chattopadhyay  last cj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leon sullivan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "landis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david fraser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "desmond tutu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sullivan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "general motors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sullivan principles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board of managers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swarthmore college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swarthmore", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "apartheid south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:32.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34cf696ae4759da2340425baf5251979d2379ddc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxUl5XaPQ9WeJOesupv5r.j7uf8R2dSY2JK8Iu5YeVC.7Pl9_taeCmCZgtIL_Wfci1eQYt7DIMpYg--", "site_full": "f30.bimmerpost.com", "site": "bimmerpost.com", "site_section": "http://f30.bimmerpost.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=412", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "UK - BMW 3-Series and 4-Series Forum (F30 / F32) | F30POST", "title": "Tyre wear", "title_full": "Tyre wear", "published": "2017-12-06T13:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.bimmerpost.com/bpfb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21282, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8cd78b0f1234ac7dc51f8ed68eebafa643c595ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxUl5XaPQ9WeJOesupv5r.j7uf8R2dSY2JK8Iu5YeVC.7Pl9_taeCmCZgtIL_Wfci1Ws3RtVChQi8BKWkFEARLJ", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "goodbyalfa", "published": "2017-12-06T14:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The heavy engine is over the front wheels, and every time your turn the wheel, you are gentle scrubbing the tyres.

However, Christian students on campus as well as other members of the Swarthmore community are calling for change and alternatives. \nThe Campus Reacts \nImmediate reactions to the article, entitled \u201cSwarthmore Christian Fellowship Has a Sexuality Problem,\u201d written by Eduard Saakashvili \u201917, included the writing of queer-affirming chalk messages in front of Parrish Hall such as \u201cGod made me gay,\u201d \u201cLove is never a sin\u201d and \u201cGay love is holy.\u201d The Interfaith Center issued a statement on their Facebook page, writing, \u201c The Interfaith team would like to extend compassion to all those who have been hurt. The Interfaith Center is a queer-affirming space that condemns bigotry of any kind and aspires to offer religious traditions as an avenue for healing and liberation.\u201d Joyce Tompkins, Director of Religious and Spiritual Life at the college, feels that the policy is problematic for all members of the campus community, including alumni she has spoken with since the article\u2019s publication. \n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about having a group on campus that discriminates, I\u2019m concerned about the hurt that\u2019s been caused to many, many students, both those who identify as queer and those who are allies, and also students who\u2019ve been part of SCF and found a Christian home there,\u201d Tompkins said. \nIn addition, multiple memes and contentious comment threads were posted in the Facebook group \u201cSwarthmore Memes for Quaker teens.\u201d Katherine Ham \u201918 posted a meme along with a link to an Intervarsity web page listing literature about homosexuality, such as Ex-Gays? A Longitudinal Study of Religiously Mediated Change in Sexual Orientation. September Sky Porras \u201920 posted two memes. \nAccording to SCF co-president Michael Broughton \u201919, who was quoted in the Voices article, students have not directly approached him to discuss their views on the policy. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit frustrating to only hear secondhand about a controversy that I\u2019m supposedly at the center of,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d really like to engage honestly with people about the issue, but at the moment it\u2019s hard to tell who\u2019s ready for those kinds of conversations. The chalkings made it clear that the issue is on a lot of people\u2019s minds, but again since I haven\u2019t had any direct encounters about it, it\u2019s hard to gauge how the campus is truly feeling.\u201d \nBroughton emphasized that the policy has been in effect since before any current SCF leaders were students at Swarthmore. \n\u201cTo my knowledge, it was first enacted by members of SCF leadership toward the end the 2014-2015 school year, and was in full effect by the following school year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be noted that everyone involved in making the policy has since graduated; subsequent leadership teams have maintained it.\u201d \nBroughton is one leader who chose to maintain the policy for the 2017-2018 school year along with fellow co-president Emily Audet \u201918, as they explained in the Voices article. \nEffects of the Policy \nThough the campus community knew little about the policy until the publication of the Voices article, the policy has affected Christian life for a long time, according to Kyra Harvey \u201919, an active member of SCF during her freshman year who chose to leave the club. \n\u201cI think part of what\u2019s so difficult about this situation is that it hasn\u2019t just been an issue because of this article and now people are like, \u2018OMG, SCF is very conservative,\u2019 but I think the Christian community has been split because of this issue before this even happened, since my freshman year, and that\u2019s been really sad and difficult. I don\u2019t think it was a good policy to begin with because it was so divisive.\u201d \nJasmine Betancourt \u201920, who was also an active member of SCF as a freshman, said that the policy influenced her decision to participate less because she supports queer pride. \n\u201cIt did make me feel excluded,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s why I dropped my involvement this year.\u201d \nSCF leaders typically hold a meeting during which they disclosed the details of the policy in the spring of each year, during the interview process for students interested in leadership positions. For Harvey, the policy was part of the reason she chose to end her involvement with SCF, after being an active member during her freshman year. \n\u201cThey have a lot of good events and things, but ever since my freshman year when they told me about that leadership policy, it hasn\u2019t been the same,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cAnd the way that it was done too\u2013they gave me a book that supported that idea about homosexuality and I think it looked a little too much like, \u2018Oh you\u2019re wrong and here\u2019s the reason why,\u2019 and that just doesn\u2019t feel good when you\u2019re part of a community.\u201d \nAccording to Betancourt, the policy has directly affected SCF membership. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been told from upperclassmen and alumni that SCF used to be a very vibrant club, but since this new policy was put in place, active involvement has dwindled,\u201d Betancourt said. \u201cMost of the Christians on campus that I know are frustrated with SCF leadership policies and their conservative interpretation of the Bible. It is clear that their position on homosexuality has brought a lot of pain to the LGBTQ+ community and has made several members who celebrate queerness feel excluded from the group.\u201d \nTara Cannon \u201920, who identifies as Christian and hoped to participate in Christian life at the college when she arrived, stated that the group\u2019s interpretation of the Bible discouraged her from joining the group. \n\u201cOverall I just didn\u2019t feel that\u2026I just didn\u2019t feel welcome,\u201d she said. \u201cI just heard that they were a lot more conservative than the majority of the campus.\u201d \nSCF and the Voices article \nThough many students have expressed feelings of hurt after learning of SCF views from the Voices article, some hope that it will positively impact the college\u2019s religious community. \n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a new issue, and each time we try to have a conversation about it, it kind of goes back under the rug,\u201d Tompkins said. \u201cAnd what I\u2019m hoping is this time, it won\u2019t go back under the rug and we\u2019ll actually all talk about this and especially address some of the hurt that\u2019s been caused over the years.\u201d \nBetancourt expressed a similar desire for dialogue surrounding the club\u2019s position on homosexuality and their implementation of the policy. \n\u201cThe Voices article made me really happy,\u201d Betancourt said. \u201cIn the time I was there, there was very limited conversation. I hope that it pushes the leadership to be more open and engaged.\u201d \nDuring the week following the article\u2019s publication, SCF leadership set aside time during the weekly Bible study to take questions and inform students and about the leadership policy, similarly to the meeting that typically takes place in the spring. \n\u201cAfter the article was written, SCF had an opportunity to discuss leadership policies earlier in the year with students who wish to apply or fill out a form for leadership,\u201d Sawyer Lake \u201920, part of SCF as a leader of Tuesday night Bible study, as well as an officer of Swatties in Service, said. \nThe purpose of the meeting was to make sure students within the group were clear about the policy. According to Broughton, the article has prompted internal discussion about the function of the SCF at the college as well as its leadership. \n\u201cWe will also continue to strive to be a community that serves God, studies his word, and expresses biblical love in every way possible \u2013 that has always been our mission, which we have no plans to ever change,\u201d Broughton said. \nHowever, Lake indicated that these discussions may not be related to possible changes in the leadership policy or SCF\u2019s affiliation with Intervarsity. Intervarsity is a national Christian college group that shares the group\u2019s views on homosexuality and that provides resources such as connection with their area coordinator, retreats with other schools, and conferences. \n\u201cI have not heard anything where SCF is planning to change leadership policies or change relationships with Intervarsity,\u201d Lake said. \u201cAs far as I know, everything related to Intervarsity with SCF and leadership policies will remain the same.\u201d \nWhat\u2019s next? \nThe varied and emotional responses to the policy and the history of the club include varied opinions from students like Betancourt and Harvey on how best to move forward towards their ideal Christian community. \n\u201cWe should have a very interconnected faith community across religions,\u201d Harvey said. \n\u201cI really hope that this can be a catalyst for growth in the Christian community and the greater community in terms of dialogue\u2026I hope that it\u2019ll make the faith community stronger in terms of diversity.\u201d \nAccording to Betancourt, the allocation of resources and funds (outlined further in the Voices article) complicates possible changes in the relationship between Intervarsity and SCF. \n\u201cI think that being associated with the organization that opposes the celebration of queerness is definitely very bad and it\u2019s problematic and people shouldn\u2019t have to be associated with that organization but at the same time\u2026they have a lot of resources and people who come in and staff from Intervarsity that you can talk to,\u201d Betancourt said. \nHowever, Harvey feels that given the theological positions of SCF leadership and the timing, redacting the policy is not the best course of action at the moment. \n\u201cI don\u2019t actually think that right now, in this environment, that changing anything would be good for SCF,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cI think the policy probably should have never been implemented in the first place, but as a leader I don\u2019t know what I would do. I think that it\u2019s a really difficult place that these people are in, trying to make these decisions.\u201d \nHarvey also feels that the damage done by the policy cannot be easily reversed. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know what changing the policy would do, I don\u2019t know if it would bring those people back,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s already something broken and I don\u2019t think pretending it didn\u2019t happen would fix anything.\u201d \nIn contrast, Betancourt feels strongly that SCF can and should revisit the leadership policy. \n\u201cBecause SCF has genuine, loving, compassionate people in their fellowship, I think the group has a lot of potential for becoming a truly welcoming, safe space for all students,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in order to do so, they must change their leadership policies to be reflective of the essential Christian values that encourage fostering love, peace, and respect in the community.\u201d \nAnother option on the table for Christians at Swarthmore is revitalizing the Progressive Christians group, which recently merged into the Swatties in Service group. Tompkins supports student-led change in this respect, asserting that neither administration nor the Interfaith Center can rectify the damage she feels that the policy has caused to the community. \n\u201cSo the Progressive Christian group has kind of ebbed and flowed over the years,\u201d Tompkins said. \u201cRight now it\u2019s mostly a service group, but I would love to see it revived with student interest. [We need] a more neutral space for students to talk about these challenging issues and look at how we can move forward and have a space for students who want to be more theologically progressive, but I do think the impetus has to come from students.\u201d \nThe role of administration has been minimal with the Christian Fellowship because there is no hired Christian advisor, though Tompkins helps organize some events, especially with Swatties in Service. The Muslim Student Advisor and Jewish Student Advisor positions are new to the Interfaith Center this year. \n\u201cThe administration is aware of the stir that the article caused, and we have been in regular contact with them since its publication,\u201d Broughton said in an email. \nSwarthmore Christian Fellowship is funded in part by the college. As of publication, it remains uncertain what action the college will take in response to the content of the Voices article; the Phoenix will publish a follow-up article in the spring.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bayliss wagner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jasmine betancourt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joyce tompkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael broughton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyra harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katherine ham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sawyer lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tara cannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tompkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eduard saakashvili", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emily audet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broughton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "betancourt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "scf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interfaith center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swarthmore voices", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swarthmore memes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swarthmore christian fellowship", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quaker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intervarsity", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "parrish hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swarthmore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:32.040+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fffad051a820e88a4aef768de587bf59dbcf429a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1Gvw_wg5L2gAmhkHGF8k.22", "site_full": "www.ozbargain.com.au", "site": "ozbargain.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.ozbargain.com.au/classified", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Classifieds -

Well, folks, I\u2019m here to tell you it\u2019s as real a thing as you and me, and it\u2019s affected almost every sophomore I\u2019ve talked to right here on our beloved campus. I did not believe in this terrible syndrome until this semester, though everyone warned me about it. I thought, in the classic, know-it-all Swattie way, that I was much too smart to fall into such a slump, that I was too driven and dedicated to reach such a lack of motivation and energy. However, as tends to occur, I was wrong. \nComing back to Swarthmore after your first year is pretty much impossible to do without slumping. Slumping is when sophomores hit peak procrastination and can\u2019t find any kind of motivation to do their work. Although they know that it\u2019s of absolute importance to get cracking on their assignments, they just can\u2019t find any way to get it done. It\u2019s hard to return from a summer of minimum wage jobs and plenty of relaxation time to hours of essays and problem sets. It hits you as soon as you come back, with deadlines looming immediately ahead of you. The fear of failing and not having the stellar grades you\u2019ve always wanted is sitting in the back of your mind at all times. And this is the best part: as soon as these extreme feelings hit you, they stay with you for the entire semester. There\u2019s never a break, not even when it\u2019s technically break, because there is simply no way to forget about all the essays and all the responsibility left back in the academic buildings. \nIn addition to the typical stress of Swarthmore, sophomores are required to choose a major, and it feels like such a make-or-break decision. It\u2019s as though the rest of our very long lives is dependent on this one decision (which it\u2019s definitely not \u2013 you can change your major several times after your first decision!), and all we do is stress and freak out about it until we somehow manage to make a decision. Personally, I remember switching my projected major about seven times in just the short summer between freshman and sophomore year. This led to drastic amount of stress; however, it feels nice to have started figuring it out. After that, it seems that everyone starts comparing inadvertently, creating cliques dependent on who\u2019s majoring in what, trying to find common ground with people we may or may not even have known about before this very trying year. \nWell, now that I\u2019ve got one semester of this terribly long year (almost) under my belt, I can feel myself starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Yes, I know, we\u2019ve got another entire semester left, with four to five new classes that are sure to kick our asses, but it\u2019s spring semester. Everything is better in the spring semester. Not only are we moving towards warm weather, but there\u2019s spring break and the wild trip that may entail, as well as the end of the semester which promises sun and relaxation for, like, three months. And for some of us, it even means going abroad and getting to avoid Swarthmore for an extra six months! \nSo yes, the sophomore slump sucks a lot, and getting through it may take all the sanity you have left in your being, but it gets better if you just choose to look at the bright side of it all (as long as the whole jaded junior concept isn\u2019t a thing).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "giorgia piantanida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swattie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "swarthmore", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uncategorized", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swarthmore", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:32.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fffad051a820e88a4aef768de587bf59dbcf429a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1Gvw_wg5L2gAmhkHGF8k.22", "site_full": "www.ozbargain.com.au", "site": "ozbargain.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.ozbargain.com.au/classified", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Classifieds - OzBargain Classifieds", "title": "[Xbox One - Digital] Xbox Store Sale: Cuphead $25.45, COD: WWII $82.96, Observer $26.77 + More", "title_full": "[Xbox One - Digital] Xbox Store Sale: Cuphead $25.45, COD: WWII $82.96, Observer $26.77 + More - OzBargain", "published": "2017-12-07T12:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.057, "main_image": "https://files.ozbargain.com.au/n/51/348051x.jpg?h=8f2d7bf6", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10489, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2cb006203d759e88fab08bfe6c8e61d569cc3a70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1Gvw_wg5L2gAuNcy6j1yBgPatNBabhC.wg0e.ldq4aWrQ--", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "hakkenaidos", "published": "2017-12-07T12:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "sorry who voted this up?

The group debated passing an amendment to keep the election within the group but scrapped it after there were not enough senators present to hold a vote. \nSGO did pass a key amendment on Sunday which allows the Senate to vote on impeachments and constitutional amendments. Previously, these powers were held only by the Executive Board, which includes the committee chairs and co-presidents. The co-presidents and the Executive Board have been allowing the Senate to vote on amendments for the past two semesters, despite this process being unconstitutional. \n\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d said co-president David Pipkin \u201918. \u201cThey were pretending that the amendment passed last year \u2026 It put me in a bind at the beginning of this year because they amended the constitution, but they didn\u2019t keep records of who voted, so I didn\u2019t know what amendments actually passed and what didn\u2019t pass.\u201d \nMembers also debated whether a special election following the resignations of three representatives should be held internally, or should be school-wide. The constitutional review committee proposed an amendment that would have made the special election internal, with only current SGO candidates eligible to run and vote. However, since three-fourths of SGO members were required to hold a vote, the amendment could not be voted on. \nCo-president David Pipkin said that that the group would be instituting a policy next semester making some of the weekly meetings mandatory, and some \u201ccome when you can.\u201d He acknowledged that attendance was a problem but attributed it to the frequency of the meetings; members of SGO are theoretically only required to attend two meetings a month. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an irrational expectation for someone who signed up to do half as much work to be doing as much work as I\u2019m doing,\u201d said Pipkin. \u201cI think there are ways of reforming the requirements in which we can have enough attendance to hold votes but we\u2019re not making unreasonable demands on people\u2019s time.\u201d \nNagyon Kim \u201920 said that that the attendance problem deals a serious blow to SGO\u2019s credibility with the student body. \n\u201cEvery member of SGO was elected for a reason. They were elected by the student body, and they signed up to become public servants,\u201d said Kim. \u201cIt reflects poorly on SGO as a whole because if you\u2019re not showing up to the meetings, then that\u2019s less representation for whoever you represent in the SGO meetings.\u201d \nAccording to Kim, the student body perceives SGO to be ineffective. \nHe said, \u201cI can definitely say that SGO, in terms of public perception, lacks legitimacy, and I think it\u2019s our job as SGO to build on that legitimacy so that other student groups can look to us as a resource.\u201d \nSam Wallach Hanson \u201918 is one of the students running for co-president in the special election and released his platform online this past Tuesday. The platform, according to Hanson, is a satirical play on the ineffectiveness of the body. To the question, \u201cWhy do you want to be SGO co-president?\u201d Hanson responded, \u201cWell, I\u2019m taking three credits next semester, so I\u2019m mostly just looking for something to fill my spare time.\u201d \nHanson said he thought the tone of the platform would resonate with students. \n\u201cI think the fact that the joke is funny at all says something about the way SGO has functioned on campus for the last few years and the way we perceive student government here.\u201d \nOne of the reasons for this negative attitude, according to Gilbert Orbea \u201919, leader of the constitutional review committee and another candidate for co-president, is that the student body doesn\u2019t realize how much power SGO has. He emphasized that the group has affected student life in ways that many don\u2019t even realize, and that it has followed through on ideas gathered from student surveys. \n\u201cRealize that we actually do have power. We have a big budget; we can make projects and initiatives happen. If you come to us with plans, with an idea, and you say, \u2018Goddammit, I want to get this done! I\u2019m a student here; this matters to me,\u2019 we\u2019ll do it.\u201d \nSGO has a total budget of $23,000. As of now, it has spent a total of $3,746.74. Also, SGO has allocated $4,000 to the student organizations committee and the Hackathon. That $4,000 allocated to student orgs has been technically \u201cspent,\u201d but no groups have applied to use that $4,000 yet. The $4,000 is used to fund student groups that pop up after the spring chartering process. T he money spent on this semester\u2019s Hackathon has not yet been accounted for by SBC. \nNancy Yuan \u201919, the current class of 2019 senator and another co-president candidate, believes that the discontent with SGO is because people have asked for changes that have not been enacted. \n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of discontent even within SGO itself, and that\u2019s also probably a reflection of the general student body\u2019s attitude as well \u2026 They see that it\u2019s been a semester and there hasn\u2019t been sweeping changes, so I think part of that is understandable because this year SGO started late, but at the same time there\u2019s some certain changes that people have asked for and haven\u2019t seen happen,\u201d Yuan said. \u201cSo even people within SGO are trying to question [the situation], because we\u2019re all volunteering our time to do this, and they\u2019re wondering whether their time is worthwhile.\u201d \nDespite being unable to vote on whether to keep the election internal, the group debated the issue. One argument made during last Sunday\u2019s meeting was that because of the short notice, there would be low turnout for the election and students wouldn\u2019t have time to make an informed decision. \n\u201cI guarantee less than 30 percent of people are going to vote in this election,\u201d said Orbea, \u201cAnd somehow it\u2019s going to represent who\u2019s best among the student body to run SGO.\u201d The constitution requires 30 percent turnout in referendums, but the policy doesn\u2019t apply to special elections. \nDuring last Sunday\u2019s meeting, co-president Josie Hung argued that some members of the student body who aren\u2019t currently affiliated with SGO may be just as qualified as current representatives, if not more, for the open positions. \u201cBeing in SGO could be a lot of experience, but there\u2019s also experience that comes from working in different college committees, working in different fields, doing research or being in affinity groups,\u201d said Hung. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we should limit it to being in SGO this semester because frankly, we haven\u2019t done much yet.\u201d \nOrbea argued that experience in the organization is valuable in deciding who should take the seats. \n\u201cThey have been in SGO for months,\u201d Orbea said about current senators and executive board members. \u201cThey would know among SGO\u2019s member base who\u2019s best and most qualified, whereas the student body may not have that information readily available.\u201d \nYuan believes that although institutional memory is important to some positions, the election should still be open to students. \n\u201cI think that\u2019s how it should be, and I actually voiced this during the Senate meeting \u2026 This shouldn\u2019t be some exclusive club, it should be accessible,\u201d Yuan said. \u201cWe\u2019re the Student Government Organization, right? It\u2019s all about the students, so I don\u2019t think it should be kept within. Yes, it should be important for certain positions to have institutional memory, because you understand the organization\u2019s structures and how it runs, but that\u2019s not to say that someone with no SGO experience can\u2019t provide valuable insight.\u201d \nAccording to Yuan, SGO could be doing more for the student body than it currently is. \n\u201cWhen [the] school is handling situations with affinity groups or \u2026 certain incidents flare up, and that\u2019s adding extra stress to students, that\u2019s something that we can help with, but SGO has actually avoided doing because they didn\u2019t want to seem like they were taking sides or didn\u2019t want to seem like they were going to get into something that was too tough to manage,\u201d Yuan said. \u201cI think this shouldn\u2019t be something we\u2019re avoiding, because it\u2019s issues that have been affecting the wellbeing of students directly, then we should try to improve that.\u201d Senators also expressed concern about the likely situation that a member of SGO is elected co-president or chair of student life. In this case, the executive board would likely override the provision in the constitution that requires a special election when there is an open seat. \nSGO\u2019s main goals for next semester include ramping up communication with the student body as well as implementing its rewritten constitution, which has been reduced in length from sixteen pages to four.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yuan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilbert orbea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david pipkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pipkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josie hung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hackathon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orbea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy yuan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam wallach hanson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nagyon kim \u201920", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "executive board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rubin  swarthmore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "student government organization", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:32.053+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34cf696ae4759da2340425baf5251979d2379ddc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxUl5XaPQ9WeJOesupv5r.j7uf8R2dSY2JK8Iu5YeVC.7Pl9_taeCmCZgtIL_Wfci1eQYt7DIMpYg--", "site_full": "f30.bimmerpost.com", "site": "bimmerpost.com", "site_section": "http://f30.bimmerpost.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=412", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "UK - BMW 3-Series and 4-Series Forum (F30 / F32) | F30POST", "title": "Tyre wear", "title_full": "Tyre wear", "published": "2017-12-06T13:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.bimmerpost.com/bpfb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21282, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34cf696ae4759da2340425baf5251979d2379ddc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxUl5XaPQ9WeJOesupv5r.j7uf8R2dSY2JK8Iu5YeVC.7Pl9_taeCmCZgtIL_Wfci1eQYt7DIMpYg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "GOF_430d", "published": "2017-12-06T13:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "Tyre wear", "text": "The front off side on my ( 2012 ) 335i Sport went on the inside edge at about 18K miles, My tyre supplier says its a known fault with the older Bridgestones.

My closest friends in particular. As i have gotten older, ive always kept a friend at an arms distance. I dont allow them to know me and deep secrets because I dont want to be abandoned, rejected, unloved, and taken advantage of so what better way then to hide myself from all those fears, right? Not right. I have a friend that has always been so honest with everything and facts to prove it but for some reason i keep trying to find flaws so i can use that against him to prove that once again ive been played like a fool. Well because i have that tendency someday it will get old for him and not want to be my friend. And once again the fears start up again. Gosh, ang, you cant win can ya. But its ok, heres to finding out what i can do. Heres the thing, i have to love myself. Even though i may have an outer shell that is beautiful, the self esteem, confidence and self worth is no where to be found. So, i stood in front of the mirror today and spoke out loud about how i am beautiful, loved, kind, loving, strong, understanding, and a great friend. Yes, it seems very cheesy but i couldnt even get past i am beautiful without crying. Clearly i have some work to do. So, on a positive ending i hope to find trust after ive found loving myself.

Picture: Reuters \nTV star Simon Cowell was threatened by his neighbour during a row over parking. \nThe man angrily threatened to destroy the music mogul's fleet of cars, which sit in front of his luxurious London home, and shouted he'd \"had enough\" of Simon's behaviour during an incident on Tuesday night. \nREAD: Simon Cowell reveals he hijacked a bus when he was 12 \nThe neighbour - whose anger was somewhat defused by the police - subsequently told The Sun newspaper: \"I wrote a sign on my door saying, 'Please do not park in front of my house' and they still did it. But I'm always unhappy with Cowell - he's a t***. \n\"Who is he? Some prat - the 'X Factor' guy? I lost my temper last night and I'll do it again - do not park near my frontage. It happens every night.\" \nThe row took place after Simon's chauffeur was preparing to take the TV star to a Christmas party in his Rolls Royce. \nA number of other vehicles also pulled up in front of the house of Simon's neighbour, who then came storming out of his property to vent his frustration. \nIn a video of the incident, the man - who is in his 50s - is seen hurling abuse towards Simon's home, while he also threatened to attack his vehicles with a golf club. \nEyewitness Will Lloyd shared: \"I was gobsmacked. I have never seen anything like it. This bloke was properly furious. He was going crazy. \n\"He was facing Simon's house just screaming, 'I have had enough of Simon Cowell! Who does he think he is? I'll smash all these cars up.' \n\"It was scary - he was absolutely ranting while waving a golf club about. He started screaming, 'What is he even famous for?'\" \nThe police were eventually called to the scene after a security team failed to calm the situation. \nSimon, for his part, is said to have shrugged off the situation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "simon cowell", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cowell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will lloyd", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hollywood walk of fame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:34.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34cf696ae4759da2340425baf5251979d2379ddc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxUl5XaPQ9WeJOesupv5r.j7uf8R2dSY2JK8Iu5YeVC.7Pl9_taeCmCZgtIL_Wfci1eQYt7DIMpYg--", "site_full": "f30.bimmerpost.com", "site": "bimmerpost.com", "site_section": "http://f30.bimmerpost.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=412", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "UK - BMW 3-Series and 4-Series Forum (F30 / F32) | F30POST", "title": "Tyre wear", "title_full": "Tyre wear", "published": "2017-12-06T13:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.bimmerpost.com/bpfb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21282, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf7fd610471cf86c7d218fba411f56b627ce60c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxUl5XaPQ9WeJOesupv5r.j7uf8R2dSY2JK8Iu5YeVC.7Pl9_taeCmCZgtIL_Wfci1Ws3RtVChQiz_IpIwvUQQg", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "225", "published": "2017-12-06T08:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It's the tyres.

Picture: Bang Showbiz \nJohn Travolta's latest biopic based around the ill-fated mobster John Gotti has been dropped by Lionsgate just days before it's scheduled release. \nThe new film was set for release under the studio's Premiere banner later this month but now the project has been sold back to the production company Emmett/Furla/Oasis. \nNo reason has been given for the sale, however, according to Deadline, the producers have exercised the buy-back clause from the original contract. \nAnd it is also reported the film was set for a limited release but the producers wanted to widen the distribution. \nHelmed by Kevin Connolly, the biopic follows ill-fated mobster John Gotti (Travolta) who rises to the top of the New York underworld to become the boss of the Gambino crime family. \nThe FBI indicted members of Gotti's crew for selling narcotics and he took advantage of growing dissent over the leadership of the crime family. \nGotti feared he would be killed along with his brother and best friend by crime family boss Paul Castellano for selling drugs, so he organised the murder of the mobster in 1985 and took over the family shortly after. \nAs the leader of the most powerful, richest and largest crime syndicate in the world, the Gambino family made hundreds of millions of dollars each year from construction, hijacking, loan sharking, drug trafficking and prostitution and pornography. \nGotti was eventually arrested and incarcerated until his death from throat cancer in 2002 when he was 61. \nTravolta, 63, plays the famous mobster alongside his wife Kelly Preston as Victoria Gotti and Stacy Keach as Aniello Dellacroce. \nThe film is written by 'Haywire' and 'The Limey' scribe Lem Dobbs and 'The Accused' star Leo Rossi. \nAlthough originally set for a 2017 release, The Tracking Board report that producers will now seek new distribution and is like to hit be released in 2018 instead of December 15. \nWatch the 'Gotti' trailer below:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john travolta", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gotti", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lem dobbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin connolly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bang showbiz  john travolta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john gotti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly preston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leo rossi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stacy keach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aniello dellacroce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria gotti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gambino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul castellano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "travolta", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lionsgate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:34.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6dbe504984780b26c3e5d896206a78eb1041e2a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9tj.R1dPVNZf.dv7vkCN_Uxs4dmIbG4WoSCrrZGnRDcEYT63Yw0UImHCs.l5lqrY1TNAvn6EpEUE1Dcr9ul1stlh9_4fwxUyjwBhNgAU.znJDa3_RCrnTh", "site_full": "www.complaintsboard.com", "site": "complaintsboard.com", "site_section": "https://www.complaintsboard.com/bycategory/other.html", "site_categories": ["media", "shopping"], "section_title": "Other - Complaints and Reviews", "title": "SingTel - irresponsible way of handling, 949956", "title_full": "SingTel - irresponsible way of handling, Review 949956 | Complaints Board", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.complaintsboard.com/thumb.php?src=110991.jpg&wmax=200&ahmax=200&quality=90&crop=1&bname=110991", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6dbe504984780b26c3e5d896206a78eb1041e2a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9tj.R1dPVNZf.dv7vkCN_Uxs4dmIbG4WoSCrrZGnRDcEYT63Yw0UImHCs.l5lqrY1TNAvn6EpEUE1Dcr9ul1stlh9_4fwxUyjwBhNgAU.znJDa3_RCrnTh", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tingting Lim Alina", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "SingTel - irresponsible way of handling, 949956", "text": "dear\nI have made an online purchase and re-contract on 5th Dec 2017.\nhowever your online system has issue, the amount has been debited from my bank, yet no order has been updated at your end.\nI have called the customer service on 6th Dec 2017 twice, no one get back to me.\nI called again today. finally, they replied: Miss, due to technical issue, we can only do a refund then you may re-order. however refund will take 3-4 weeks!\nwhat is this?

Usually I prefer to be out and about seeing stuff on holiday!) so when Colour Collective came up with 'Battery Charged Blue' for their prompt, I decided to do something with a holiday vibe. I went with the Mediterranean rather than South East Asia, for the very simple reason that I didn't feel like drawing tricky palm trees. \n\nAny colour with a name like 'Battery Charged Blue' needs the zing of a contrasting colour, so I kept my palette very limited, with marmalade cats and terracotta roofs, and kept the saturation high. I've never actually been to the Mediterranean, but the photos always have gloriously saturated colours.  \nThis took 2 hours, tops. And as usual, I did it in Adobe Photoshop CC2017 on a Wacom Cintiq Companion 2.
