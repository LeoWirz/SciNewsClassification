Adventurers in jewellery and watchmaking, they travelled the world in search of new horizons, enticed by the lure of new experiences, techniques and materials. \nTheir concept of gentlemanly elegance was a modern one, encapsulating an art de vivre whose refined details and precious signatures have inspired the most high profile dandies on the planet, from Boni de Castellane and Jean Cocteau to Andy Warhol and Yves Saint Laurent. \nCufflinks appear in Cartier records as far back as 1859, and these accessories, indispensable to a gentleman\u2019s wardrobe, were re-imagined in thousands of workshop drawings throughout the company\u2019s archives. \nOver the years the themes changed with the fashions, from Russian-inspired guilloch\u00e9 enamel to striking colour combinations in emeralds and sapphires at the height of the Art Deco period. Creative exchanges saw Cartier set cufflinks with precious stones, or recast them as watches, winding crowns or compasses to be worn on the wrist. \nReflecting the Cartier style, they adopted iconic creations of the Maison such as the menagerie and the exposed screws of the iconic Santos watch. \nThe subtle art of Cartier jewellery is transposed into masculine ornaments by the clean lines, precious materials and craftsmanship of Cartier artisans. Glittering examples of a very special art, these bejewelled pieces dazzle with elegance in the sparkle of stones and precious detailing. \nCartier is exclusively distributed by Stores Specialists, Inc. and is located at Greenbelt 4, Rustan\u2019s Shangri-La, and Newport Resorts World.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jacques", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pierre", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cartier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy warhol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yves saint laurent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean cocteau", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "greenbelt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boni de castellane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stores specialists, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "louis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "art deco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newport resorts world", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:53.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1bc2d0a2b977bfc223b8f1715dadb6b4251288bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9EyDxNt2p_bu3CcytLi4ifQCviBZWF0_QNpXrlu2lR9NQ82rS3Ptay8EiAtbgVffw-", "site_full": "www.manilatimes.net", "site": "manilatimes.net", "site_section": "http://www.manilatimes.net/?feed=rss2", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Manila Times Online", "title": "QUALITY BRUSH UPS", "title_full": "QUALITY BRUSH UPS", "published": "2017-12-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://manilatimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MNL-Times_250-x-250-logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 43730, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1bc2d0a2b977bfc223b8f1715dadb6b4251288bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9EyDxNt2p_bu3CcytLi4ifQCviBZWF0_QNpXrlu2lR9NQ82rS3Ptay8EiAtbgVffw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Manila Times", "published": "2017-12-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "QUALITY BRUSH UPS", "text": "Boardroom Watch \nDenman Your crowning glory \u2013 your hair \u2013 deserves the best grooming aid, which means brushes from Denman.

You\\'ll see some epic views, journey through the beautiful surroundings, check out some some of the city\\'s cool events, and see the place come alive as day turns to night.\\\" -- I\\'ve been working on this project in my spare time between March 2013 and March 2014. One of the goals in the edit was to tell little stories using subtle interplays between shots, sometimes spanning over several shots. I love the richness and depth that time-lapse photography filmmaking provides, you always notice different things on subsequent viewings. The project has been a real labour of love and features over 100 location shoots, with around 9000 separate images used for the final edit. I spent countless hours in pre-production, location shooting, and post production. From travelling around locations with lots of motion control equipment -- to fine tuning, finessing, and polishing sequences to arrive at the final edit. Time-lapse filmmaking takes a great deal of patience and determination. If you enjoy the film and appreciate the time and effort, please show some love by giving it a like / social share (you can also find it on Vimeo here: http://vimeo.com/jbee/bristol) Please share it with your friends and family : ) -- Big thanks to Bristol\\'s own Phaeleh for producing incredible music such as \\'Journey\\' featured on this film.

It's a 2017, so no changes anyway, but finance rebates are $750 off, plus a 1.0% drop in rate. In Canada, you get the LED front head lights, which is what I wanted on the hatch anyway.\nNow, the only two colour choices I have, as there is only two in stock left... BLUE OR BLACK ??

He also read the agreement between the protesters and government which resulted in end of sit-in. \nReferring clause 3 of this agreement, he said that the government agreed to drop cases against the protesters and questioned as citizens\u2019 struggle for democratic rights fall within the scope of terrorism. \nBabar Awan sought the dismissal of terrorism charges against Imran Khan. Judge Shahrukh Arjumand said that the cases against the protesters were not all dropped and the accused are still seeking bail. \nOn the other side, the prosecution alleged that during the 2014 sit-in, Khan had told his workers to attack the Inspector General and lay siege to the Prime Minister House. \nHe said there are evidences that Imran Khan had incited his workers at the time and argued for action against the PTI chief under the Anti-Terrorism Act. \nAfter hearing the arguments from both sides, the court extended Khan\u2019s interim bail till December 11, 2017. \nCopyright APP (Associated Press of Pakistan), 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "imran khan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shahrukh arjumand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babar awan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asmat ullah junejo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irman khan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "atc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "anti-terrorism court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ptv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "secretariat police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "islamabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faizabad interchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamabad", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:56.037+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a32d89b63dd2c5b1cbc83fe85a4f2ce1c69c6aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm2a5NuMlSCIv1I8YIOIRZs9", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=moore", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "moore News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "The Latest: RNC resumes support of Roy Moore Senate campaign | Politics | postbulletin.com", "title_full": "The Latest: RNC resumes support of Roy Moore Senate campaign | Politics | postbulletin.com : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-12-05T01:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.129, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a32d89b63dd2c5b1cbc83fe85a4f2ce1c69c6aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm2a5NuMlSCIv1I8YIOIRZs9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Post Bulletin", "published": "2017-12-05T01:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Latest: RNC resumes support of Roy Moore Senate campaign | Politics | postbulletin.com", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on President Donald Trump's endorsement of Republican Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race (all times local): 9:35 p.m. The Republican National Committee is once again supporting embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore after President Donald Trump formally endorsed him Monday.

But the history I touch upon should be as equally fascinating. \u25cf Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/HistoryBuffsLondon \u25cf Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/HistoryBuffsNH \u00ad\u00ad", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rob ford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zagster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hypatia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "agora", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pontiac  construction", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "telecinco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "huntsville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rochester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pontiac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albuquerque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waterloo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zagster cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tallahassee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mass.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saginaw street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knoxville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lafitte greenway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new orleans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:57.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee6bbc0396b516f70af64c3ba88f2b11430f04e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVApD4O0EWvHlX7YKjkqQqIMGHg0J9oluEfVEQGL8EOwR2AsevXfC0RDdiP_lNVws9wGZsuXjqf6t8IJgX1jQlXe1Kb6ho7hq8cbWJ_FR7Es", "site_full": "www.expedia.es", "site": "expedia.es", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.es/Jerome-Hoteles.d119566.Guia-Viajes-Hoteles", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "110 Hoteles en Jerome, Sedona baratos con Expedia.es", "title": "Arizona Inn of Prescott Valley (Prescott,", "title_full": "Arizona Inn of Prescott Valley (Prescott, Estados Unidos) | Expedia.es", "published": "2017-10-02T09:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26131, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3057dc5c67a2bbc63a191dfaebce1e77f24e2357", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVApD4O0EWvHlX7YKjkqQqIMGHg0J9oluEfVEQGL8EOwR2AsevXfC0RDdiP_lNVws9wGZsuXjqf6t8IJgX1jQlXe1Kb6ho7hq53ddvh1oglI6_6oqlYjpz7QPoxNJnDYGIkLRwDKaRs6f0aI7iKnKpY-", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-14T23:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "El hospedaje era con desayuno incluido y no hab\u00eda desayuno", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 3.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:57.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee6bbc0396b516f70af64c3ba88f2b11430f04e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVApD4O0EWvHlX7YKjkqQqIMGHg0J9oluEfVEQGL8EOwR2AsevXfC0RDdiP_lNVws9wGZsuXjqf6t8IJgX1jQlXe1Kb6ho7hq8cbWJ_FR7Es", "site_full": "www.expedia.es", "site": "expedia.es", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.es/Jerome-Hoteles.d119566.Guia-Viajes-Hoteles", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "110 Hoteles en Jerome, Sedona baratos con Expedia.es", "title": "Arizona Inn of Prescott Valley (Prescott,", "title_full": "Arizona Inn of Prescott Valley (Prescott, Estados Unidos) | Expedia.es", "published": "2017-10-02T09:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26131, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cfffe29ae55eceeda74f9dee76c383dd342ca566", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVApD4O0EWvHlX7YKjkqQqIMGHg0J9oluEfVEQGL8EOwR2AsevXfC0RDdiP_lNVws9wGZsuXjqf6t8IJgX1jQlXe1Kb6ho7hq53ddvh1oglIiztljTX27tsyPJ0GdElgAnnd.OIh6DJuv4lrlCKrl44-", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-25T08:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Liked the room, bed, bath, etc. However, some small things were not guest friendly. 1.

On the other hand, Chrome for Android Oreo adds features like Smart Text Selection and a new modal Permissions dialog. \nFlags redesign The chrome://flags webpage gets a facelift with the new Material Design that helps users distinguish between Available and Unavailable in-development Chrome experiments. The feature has been previously used to enable and disable these beta experiments on the Web browser. There is also a new Search bar and a quick button to reset all experiments in one go. \nDevice Memory JavaScript API This feature has been added to help users on low-RAM devices . The API automatically detects the amount of memory in the device and can redirect to lite versions of websites in cases of high RAM usage; a great step in improving user experience. Chrome has been infamous, in the past, for consuming more RAM than other major Web browsers. \nSite Isolation Chrome 63 now lets you isolate certain webpages; content from them is rendered separately making sure that these pages do not share processes or cross-site iframes. This, obviously, comes at a cost: high memory usage. Google estimates that it will be 10-20 percent more than usual. \nTLS 1.3 Rollout TLS or Transport Layer Security is a protocol that configures secure communications for Gmail. The last update for TLS, version 1.2, came back in 2008, and Chrome 63 finally brings the latest in email security after a nine-year wait. \nSmart Text Selection Rolled out with Android 8.0 Oreo, Smart Text Selection is finally a feature in Chrome 63 for Android. Smart Text Selection recommends apps to users based on the text they select in any document, email or webpage. While the use case might be different from user to user, it is a really handy feature to have.

People from all over the world love to take pictures. When it comes to taking pictures, it is done by them all the time. With the introduction of smartphones and tablet PCs, people take pictures at home all the time. They use it on online social media sites and so on. If you have never had your photos done professionally then you should consider the Sunset Photography New England residents use.\n\nAnyone can go and have their picture taken. You don't need to be a special person or important person. A person can go to one of those photographers and ask to have the pictures done professionally. There should not be any delays and there shouldn't be any problems. So you can go and have this done if you've never done it before.\n\nThe pictures are taken by professional photographers. Professional photographers work in a studio where they have all the equipment and Lighting necessary to create absolutely beautiful photos. So if you want to have pictures that are good enough to frame and paste on your wall at home, and ones that you can post on your social media site, why don't you pay a visit to these photographers.\n\nYou can go to any of the studios in your area to have your photos taken. Would you like to have photos done in another type of setting or in a natural scene, or any other area that you have a passion for, you can always speak to the photographer and see if they will be able to accommodate you.\n\nMany parents choose to take pictures of their babies when they are only a few days old. This is completely normal and okay. So there is basically no right or wrong time to do it if you are much older and have never had that done now is a great time to start.\n\nParents always want to have pictures taken of their kids. Whether you are doing it alone or you're doing it with your family this is of sentimental value to you. You can choose to do it any way you like and the best part is that it is for keeps. If you are just doing this in order to make yourself happy and let yourself know that you have accomplished something then that is completely fine as well.\n\nSome of these photographers are quite affordable where others are quite expensive. The price also depends on the experience of the photographer. Ultimately you should make sure that you're getting your moneys worth out of your photos. You should be able to see exactly what you paid for and you should be 100% happy with the photos before paying any money to the photographer.\n\nSo when it comes to choosing a photographer it can be a challenge. Speak to people that have used these services before and ask them what they think of their photos.

A major fiber optic cable linking Zimbabwe to neighboring South Africa was damaged, causing temporary internet blackout, according to information gathered at the time of going to print. \nRetailers suffered a major setback as customers were unable to transact on point of sale (POS) machines, which require connectivity between banks. The situation has been exacerbated by the gradual shift witnessed in the country towards plastic money as the foreign currency shortages culminated into a cash crisis in recent years. \nAccording to industry statistics, cash accounted for less than 20 percent of transactions at conventional retail outlets across the country as of September 2017, the balance being POS payments and mobile money. Plastic and mobile money has become so popular to an extent vendors on street corners have POS machines while a great number accept mobile money. Corporates also struggled to communicate as emails and cellphones to landlines were also down. \nCompanies that heavily rely on the internet like the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority and Zinara, also faced problems serving clients. Despite the situation being out of internal control, major internet service provider TelOne apologised to its customers, assuring them of improved services. \n\u201cWe are currently running at 50 percent capacity at the moment after a cable was cut somewhere in South Africa. The 50 percent is coming from or link from Plumtree and Mozambique, but it will not be enough to service our clients.

Sambo Dasuki, challenging his alleged indefinite detention. Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd.) Former NSA The panel of five Justices, led by Dattijo Mohammed, gave the date after counsels to the parties in the case adopted their addresses. The ex-NSA had on June 15, 2016 at the Court of Appeal in Abuja, lost his bid to enforce his freedom after securing bails on all the charges against him. The News Agency of Nigeria, NAN recalls that Dasuki is standing trial for allegedly mismanaging 2.1 billion dollars meant for purchase of arms to fight the Boko Haram insurgents. Dasuki\u2019s counsel, Mr Joe Daudu, argued that the decision of the Court of Appeal was erroneous, adding that it was incumbent on the Supreme Court to restore the integrity of all courts. Daudu submitted that it was out of place for the court of appeal to scuttle the fundamental rights of a citizen after well-considered decisions of four courts that admitted the applicant to bail. He said that his client needed the bail to prepare his defence, adding that he could not have access to security documents while in detention. \u201cMy Lords, Dasuki is already being treated as a convict, even when none of the charges brought against him has been concluded. \u201cWe sincerely pray this esteemed court to do the needful by setting aside the decision of the lower court. \u201cWe also pray the court to momentarily halt the applicant\u2019s trial until the Federal Government obeys the bail order of court,\u201d Daudu said. Mr Rotimi Jacobs, counsel to EFCC, opposed the appeal, saying that it lacked merit and should be dismissed. He said the bail condition granted Dasuki was perfected on December 29, 2015.
