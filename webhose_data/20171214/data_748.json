Related Links 30 Undervalued Stocks \nSeth Sexton: Credit fundamentals in the basic materials sector have improved further over the course of this year as prices for many commodities continued their rise which began in the first half of 2016. This, coupled with efforts issuers made to deliver over the past 24 months, has strengthened credit profiles in the sector. \nThe improvement in credit fundamentals can be illustrated by the narrowing in credit spreads in the sector that has occurred over the last couple of years. The top line of this graph is the spread in basis points over U.S. treasuries for the sector. The basic materials index's credit spread rose to a recent peak of 436 basis points in February of 2016. This spread narrowed to 312 basis points a year ago and is currently at 131 basis points demonstrating market perception of the improvement in credit fundamentals. \nIn the metals and mining part of the sector, many issuers took aggressive steps to reduce debt balances that included asset sales and equity issuances. The debt reduction along with better prices for mined commodities and margins for metals has resulted in issuers being upgraded or possessing positive outlooks. \nThe chemicals portion of the sector remains stable as result of consistent demand and pricing. We expect continued stability unless a recession occurs. We also see the potential for M&A due to the consistent free cash flow profiles of many chemical issuers and the still low interest rates available to many corporate borrowers. \nThe ag part of the sector has been in the midst of a consolidation phase largely due to a weakening of fundamentals in the farm sector over the past few years. Still the outlook is stable despite the weakness due to the conservative capital structures of issuers in this space. \nFinally, building materials issuers currently enjoy strong demand fundamentals. We anticipate increased spending on infrastructure in the U.S. will support further growth for these issuers. \nIn summary, we expect credit fundamentals in the basic materials sector to remain solid near term given expectations of price strength of products sold in the sector. That said, a downturn will inevitably come, but fixed-income investors can take comfort in the fact that capital structures in the sector now are considerably stronger than they were 12 to 24 months ago.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sean sexton", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "seth sexton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:09.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "944d0144e7dc61e65812dfe1f21631d15eef4a9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4Q7OX0keOdOaksN2WCLH.p.O7rw1UEHCfSho..GPojCbYEUwMXEf8k6.W.6KmE1jROd40lCTi6JZsCOkOtpjlZGI-", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/San-Diego-Hoteis.d178304.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Condado de San Diego: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "The Westin San Diego Gaslamp Quarter:", "title_full": "The Westin San Diego Gaslamp Quarter: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-10-24T17:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee69b4d411fe9ebba528b08620ecb9a02b5994e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4Q7OX0keOdOaksN2WCLH.p.O7rw1UEHCfSho..GPojCbYEUwMXEf8k6.W.6KmE1jROd40lCTi6JZslV8m.YLvg6dlbLBWFjoR2xtCsqO5VFHbpWyBPvAPPWs-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-24T04:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Had a bad experience at check in, rude staff, honestly shocked", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 1.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:09.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f942a7937fb5f879a927bcab54d58928e3610e23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr5io1HWu7R0GwbQvbgh9OCLAFhX7tZzi4X2OuKdQXcuxOWuxEDk02y.wCdHkhceoYuiuBayc0reCEgxNZKYwSf", "site_full": "thereformedbroker.com", "site": "thereformedbroker.com", "site_section": "http://thereformedbroker.com/comments/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Comments for The Reformed Broker", "title": "fortunately\u2026", "title_full": "fortunately\u2026", "published": "2015-01-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "http://ep60qmdjq8-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/thumbnail.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89657, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8543a8f499bff076733fbc4d3edf24ec63cc2041", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr5io1HWu7R0GwbQvbgh9OCLAFhX7tZzi4X2OuKdQXcuxOWuxEDk02y.wCdHkhceoYuiuBayc0reI3m11I67bgF_iNBFSgWMOFKMzxF86GTMQ--", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "vacancy in haryana", "published": "2017-12-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "vacancy in haryana\n[\u2026]please pay a visit to the web-sites we follow, which includes this one, as it represents our picks from the web[\u2026]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:09.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "24e114626e5d1f3bc64d420fef98251dbba4e875", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.9XAbvbC6QPe5WoZjI2Ith7J6QMVtxm1P8ob9HstzZfIae4Y5BW7_oCG4pG6hkYc-", "site_full": "www.dirtrider.com", "site": "dirtrider.com", "site_section": "http://www.dirtrider.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["entertainment", "sports"], "section_title": "Dirt Rider", "title": "40th Dakar Rally -

Really. \nAccording to a Repucom (acquired by Nielsen Sports in 2016) study, the Dakar Rally is considered the second-largest motorsports event in the world with a 77-percent awareness factor. Formula 1 leads by a healthy margin with 90-percent global awareness; however, none of the other top \u201cevents\u201d are stand-alone races\u2014they\u2019re all race series. \nThat\u2019s the primary reason Honda redirected its off-road racing budget a few years ago, pulling support from its Baja program and instead pouring it (and more, of course) into a new rally effort. (It\u2019s claimed that most casual fans around the world don\u2019t understand long-distance American-style desert racing where teams of riders take turns getting a machine from start to finish whereas in rallies it remains one rider, one bike for a more challenging adventure, romanticized or not.) \nSo, with less support for Baja-type races, there\u2019s been increased effort to get Americans to join in the rally raid fun. The French, of course, created the Dakar Rally and have always dubbed that type of competition \u201cmarathon rally raid\u201d while Americans especially just call it rally. It\u2019s sort of like the motorized version of cycling\u2019s Tour de France in that it\u2019s a multiday stage-type race but with tricky navigation thrown in. \nAmericans have competed in rallies in the past, of course, with the Chris Blais, Johnny Campbell, Quinn Cody, Scot Harden, Paul Krause, Danny LaPorte, former Cycle World and Dirt Rider editor Jimmy Lewis, Larry Roeseler, Dan Smith, and the late Chuck Stearns among the earliest big-name US adopters. \nThe 2018 Dakar rally will have 14 race days and one rest day. \nHonda Racing Corporation \nFor how dominant Americans were in Baja and desert racing in North America, however, rally success eluded them. LaPorte (the 1982 World 250cc Motocross Champion) earned second place behind legendary French rider St\u00e9phane Peterhansel in 1992 at the longest-ever Dakar, taking three weeks to traverse the nearly 8,000 miles from Paris to Capetown, South Africa. Blais (third in 2007) and Lewis (third in 2000) were the only other American podium finishers at Dakar. \nThen in the lead-up to the 2013 Dakar, the KTM factory team drafted the late Kurt Caselli for its squad and he won two stages, thereby landing himself a full-time role with the team. In Argentina later that year, he became only the third American to overall a rally and was poised to make a good run at Dakar 2014, but, of course, he died while leading the 2013 Baja 1000. \nThat brings us to Dakar 2018 where three high-profile Americans will line up in the motorcycle classes on works bikes: Ricky Brabec for the factory-backed Monster Energy Honda team in his third Dakar; Mark Samuels on a works CRF450 Rally but for a satellite Honda team; and Andrew Short on a factory Rockstar Energy Husqvarna FR 450. This will be the first Dakar for both Samuels and Short. \nWith that in mind, we sat down and chatted with each of them to learn more of their vision of the biggest off-road race in the world and their respective roles in it. \nMark Samuels got hooked on rallies a few years ago and has worked quietly in his spare time to become proficient in that genre. \nMark Kariya Mark Samuels \nBest known as a Baja racer, Mark Samuels is a recent convert to rally sport, having secured a berth at Dakar 2018 by winning the Dakar Challenge portion of the 2017 Sonora Rally in Mexico. \nEven before that, though, he reveals he\u2019d developed a passion for rallies: \u201cHonestly, this has been a huge goal for the last three years that I\u2019ve kind of focused on. [In 2016] I went and did [the] Sonora Rally [in Mexico]. I didn\u2019t know anything about rally; I just knew I wanted to do it! \n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any practice doing it. I went and rode with Ricky [Brabec] and kind of saw how it all worked before I went. \n\u201cI had a lot of fun doing that so I started riding [rally stuff] a little bit more, and then [in 2017] I went back to Sonora Rally and had a better understanding. So I\u2019ve kind of had my sights set [on Dakar] for three years, and for the last two years I\u2019ve been slowly working on it.\u201d \nSamuels finished the 2017 Sonora Rally second overall behind Ricky Brabec, winning the Dakar Challenge and free entry into Dakar 2018. As far as he was concerned, he was committed then. \nHe followed that by riding the NORRA Mexican 1000, but that was the extent of his rally racing as he then had to focus the rest of the year on the SCORE World Desert Championship where his team ultimately finished second. It wasn\u2019t the end of rally training, however, as he reveals, \u201cShorty (Andrew Short) and I did a lot of training together with Scotty Bright. [We] pushed each other and we both really want to go to Dakar [in 2018]. Shorty got a really cool deal, and I got a pretty cool opportunity myself.\u201d \nThe bike Samuels used to win the Dakar Challenge portion of the 2017 Sonora Rally (right) wasn\u2019t much more than his CRF450X Baja pre-runner with the requisite \u201ctower\u201d to house all the navigation instrumentation required. \nMark Kariya \nIndeed he did. While Samuels won\u2019t be on the factory Monster Energy Honda Team squad like Brabec, he\u2019s been granted the opportunity to use the same hand-built works bike. \n\u201cI\u2019m not on their team, but they\u2019re helping me out and giving me a bike and helping me do it,\u201d Samuels explains. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool and quite an honor. \n\u201cAfter I won the Sonora Rally [Dakar Challenge], I went to American Honda\u2014[my contacts Motorcycle Sports Manager] Sam [Mishima] and [Motorcycle Sports Supervisor] Brandon [Wilson] at American Honda\u2014and told them I\u2019d won that, that this was something I\u2019ve really been wanting to do. Sam stepped out for me and talked to HRC , Taichi [Honda who] runs the rally team at HRC in Japan. He was pretty open to help me out with giving me a bike to use and parts. I get to rep all my own sponsors [on the] graphics and they\u2019re going to kind of overlook [any competing ones], and I\u2019ll help them test some stuff while we\u2019re there. It all worked out from American Honda reaching out for me.\u201d \nSamuels adds, \u201cI\u2019ll be under the MEC team; they\u2019re from Argentina and that\u2019s who Honda trusts with their bikes, so they have a relationship [already established] and that\u2019s what HRC wanted me to do. So HRC will help me look over the bike every day, but everything\u2019s going through the MEC team.\u201d \nAs this is written, Samuels has very limited time on the bike, but he notes that it\u2019s much faster than his Baja-spec CRF450X due to the twin-cam, six-speed engine and doesn\u2019t feel obscenely rotund despite carrying 9 gallons of fuel in its four tanks. \nMark Samuels is one of two high-profile American rookies. Shown here is fellow Honda racer Brabec at the event in 2017. \nHonda Racing Corporation \nBy now, of course, just about everyone who follows desert racing knows about the finish of the 2017 Baja 1000 where the Samuels team came from about 30 minutes down early on to pass the Francisco Arredondo team and beat them to the finish, only to be penalized 30 minutes and set back to second due to Samuels\u2019 finishing rider, Ian Young, getting over-exuberant at the finish, crashing, and injuring bystanders. (The Arredondo team would\u2019ve won the championship by finishing second anyway.) \nBut Samuels says that had no bearing on getting a seat on the HRC CRF450 Rally. \u201cAmerican Honda was really cool about it. We won [unofficially],\u201d he insists. \u201cWe worked our butts off to get back into the lead and win that. It was definitely an unfortunate finish and it sucks that happened, but they were very, very cool about it and they understand how racing is. [The 1000 finish] hasn\u2019t jeopardized anything.\u201d \nWith a comparative veteran like Brabec living not too far away, Samuels has a valuable resource at his disposal and he\u2019s making the most of it. \u201cI look forward to [December], trying to pick his brain and trying to get help from him and Johnny Campbell. As we go [to Dakar], it\u2019s cool to have another American over there on a Honda. I hope over the next couple weeks [testing] with HRC and all them being over here, Ricky and I can put some time in before we head over for the actual Dakar.\u201d \nAs one of a number of first-timers from many countries, Samuels naturally is somewhat anxious to see what challenges he\u2019ll face in South America. \nMark Samuels will be on the factory Honda HRC rally bike, but not on the same team as fellow American Ricky Brabec, seen here. \nHonda Racing Corporation \n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about that a bunch!\u201d he admits. \u201cI think dunes are going to be very difficult, but realistically I think just the day-in, day-out\u2014that\u2019s what I\u2019m curious to see how that is and mentally how draining that is. \u201cWith navigating that much, obviously I\u2019ve done days like that in a row pre-running for the 1000 in Baja and stuff like that, but with navigating, I think it\u2019s going to be a different ballgame. I don\u2019t really know exactly what to expect and I don\u2019t think really anyone does their first time.\u201d \nThat stems in part from a lack of awareness in the US of what rally is all about, and Samuels acknowledges that explaining the sport is almost as challenging as the racing. \u201cThem actually, truly understanding what the navigation consists of [is the biggest hurdle],\u201d he begins. \u201cYou try to explain [that] you have your [odometer], you have your cap heading (in degrees on a compass), and you have your instructions [on the roadbook]\u2014and you have to read all this [at speed]. For it to actually make sense to them, I feel like a lot of them don\u2019t know until you actually ride it. \n\u201cEven for me, I didn\u2019t truly understand it until I did it.\u201d \nAnd what are the goals Samuels has set for his first Dakar? \n\u201cMy goal going in is, I believe, a top 10,\u201d he shares. \u201cWith a strong, solid ride, I believe a top 10 [is realistic]. My goal is just to get through to the rest day halfway through because the first five days from the little studying I\u2019ve done so far is going to be very difficult just getting out of Peru. That\u2019s going to be a huge check off my list during the race. \n\u201cI know I\u2019ve got good skill and good speed on the bike for racing,\u201d Samuels concludes, \u201cbut navigating is another aspect and that could trump the skill and speed that I have. But I feel pretty strongly that if I\u2019m inside the top 15, then I\u2019ll be happy, but my goal is to be top 10.\u201d Andrew Short \nFollowing his retirement from the professional motocross circuit two years ago, Andrew Short landed a job as \u201cbrand ambassador\u201d for Honda. As such, it relieved him of the pressure that accompanies racing and allowed him to do a lot more off-road riding as well as testing and development work for Honda\u2019s MX team. \nSigning a two-year contract with the Rockstar Energy Husqvarna Factory Racing rally team got Andrew Short to the 2018 Dakar Rally. \nFuture7Media \nSo it came as a surprise to many when the Europe-based Rockstar Energy Husqvarna Factory Racing rally team scooped him up in 2017, giving him a rare open slot on one of the top teams in the business. Shorty would be on the full works FR 450 Rally for two years alongside experienced teammate Pablo Quintanilla, who would successfully defend his FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship title later in the year, and Pela Renet, who spent most of 2017 recovering from injury. \nThe first question on everybody\u2019s mind seemed to be, \u201cWhy?\u201d Followed quickly by, \u201cHow?\u201d \nShort begins, \u201cFor me it was a surprise as well. I was really happy with where I was. It was a good position to transition away from racing motocross and Supercross , and during that time I found a passion for rallies. So for me, [the Husqvarna deal] was the opportunity of a lifetime and a dream come true. \n\u201cIt didn\u2019t really make sense and a lot of people ask why, but for me, I followed my heart and didn\u2019t want to have any regrets when I get older. For me, it seemed like a massive adventure and challenge that I wanted to try and pursue. \n\u201cIt probably made more sense from a business standpoint to stay where I was, and there were a lot of great people and a good group to work with there. But for rally, this is the best opportunity and the best team. The KTM group, they\u2019ve won Dakar for the last 16 years in a row, so for me to be around those people and learn from them and be a part of their group was a huge opportunity. For me, it\u2019s going to accelerate my learning for rally racing and Dakar. \nShort will start his first Dakar aboard a works FR 450 Rally just like his teammate, two-time FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Champion Pablo Quintanilla. \nCourtesy Rockstar Energy Husqvarna \n\u201cOnce I started doing rally, people knew [I wanted to do Dakar one day] and I\u2019d been asking the Honda guys quite often for a while, actually, and got to hang out with [the Honda rally] guys and ride their bike a little bit. For me, once I did the Sonora Rally in March [2016], I was hooked. From that point on, I wanted to do it. \n\u201cOne of the riders for Husqvarna\u2014Pela\u2014he was injured in Chile and that\u2019s what brought up the opportunity for me. It\u2019s unfortunate\u2014I\u2019ve heard great things about him; he\u2019s a good person. But it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s going to [be back racing] soon\u2014for sure for this year\u2019s Dakar he\u2019s out\u2014so that\u2019s what brought the opportunity for me.\u201d \nComing from a successful career in motocross and working as a liaison between riders and engineers as part of his brand ambassador role with Honda, Short comes into rally raid with a somewhat different outlook when it comes to bike setup, even though factory-prepped CRF450Rs are obviously going to be different than his new FR 450 Rally. \n\u201cThe riding and the racing is natural for me,\u201d he notes. \u201cThe speed, I don\u2019t think, is a big issue. I think I have the technical skills and whatnot. Some of the high-speed stuff, for sure there\u2019s some adjustment just with how fast everything\u2019s coming at you. \n\u201cBut in terms of the technical side [of riding rallies], I feel like I\u2019m there. But navigation and the experience that these [other] guys have, their skills there are second to none and they\u2019re the best in the world for a reason. \n\u201cFor me, I have to be patient and not ride over my head and make a mistake and get hurt because I won\u2019t ever learn [that way] and I\u2019ll never get to where I want to be. So for me, I have to ride a little below my normal speed, I would say, or I have to back it off a bit just so I don\u2019t make a huge mistake. \nAndrew Short, here during a team photo shoot, is a racer at heart whether the crowd surrounds him in a supercross or he\u2019s crossing through three countries. \nFuture7Media \n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong! There\u2019s always risk, but for me, the biggest gains I can make at the moment are working on my navigation skills and the thought processes that you have to go through as you\u2019re reading the roadbook as the race unfolds. For me, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself and get injured at first. My main goal is to finish Dakar this year and not worry about the speed so much and then hopefully with the experience and the navigation skills, they hopefully improve the following year. I\u2019d love to be able to push and try to compete at the top level.\u201d \nThat\u2019s the carrot for Short and he insists that paying dues by being a \u201cwater carrier\u201d for Quintanilla (or anyone else) is not in his future. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really cool about the team I\u2019m on: Almost all the people on bikes who are competing in Dakar besides the factory guys, they\u2019re almost all on KTMs or Huskys. The bikes are basically the same, so for our team, until the very end, I think everyone\u2019s kind of for themselves. \n\u201cObviously, the greatest thing about the rally community is I feel like all the guys help each other, especially the Husky and KTM group. Everyone\u2019s an open book. It\u2019s completely different than motocross or Supercross. It\u2019s so refreshing to be around a mindset of the racers who are like that. It\u2019s completely different than what I\u2019m used to. \n\u201cObviously, at first, you want to help your teammate and you want to be there, but I think it\u2019s different than the Honda team where I feel like they\u2019re all working for one person and I think they have limited opportunity\u2014that\u2019s kind of the perception. \n\u201cI\u2019ve learned where the KTM team, everyone\u2019s doing their best until the end [then guys who aren\u2019t going for the win might work for a teammate going for a good result]. Hopefully, they don\u2019t need that [kind of assistance], but I think everybody needs it at some point. \n\u201cNaturally, as the race unfolds you\u2019ll know your position and where you\u2019re at and you\u2019ve got to help your teammates, no matter what.\u201d \nWith only the Sonora and Morocco rallies under his belt, Short acknowledges his lack of experience, but feels he\u2019s learning quickly. \nAndrew Short is going to Dakar to race for the win, not as a support rider for Quintanilla. \nFuture7Media \n\u201cA sense of navigation, you can go learn in the desert as long as you have the right equipment, but the hardest thing for me to learn is the etiquette and the event computer as well. Even from lining up, it\u2019s not like you line up at a starting gate and go. I\u2019m so used to racing in a one-dimensional way where now there\u2019s a whole process on when you enter the starting area, what time you go, all these things\u2014speed zones, waypoints, all that stuff with the event computer is really difficult to learn. For me, I\u2019m most thankful to have the experience from Morocco to learn at a World rally how all that works. \n\u201cSonora is what got me hooked. It has a similar device but not on that same level. But it was so much fun and the atmosphere was cool where Morocco was a little more serious on how they do all that stuff. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a little different [than the Mexican desert at Sonora] when you\u2019re riding through a town [in Morocco] and you\u2019re \u2018racing\u2019 and there are speed zones and whatnot, penalties, and learning all that. If I learned all that at Dakar, I think I\u2019d be at a severe disadvantage, so for me to have that opportunity and go [to a World rally first] and learn was awesome.\u201d \nNaturally, the rest of the Rockstar Energy Husky crew tries to help him whenever possible. The key thing? \u201cJust take it one step at a time, is what I get from the big group,\u201d he answers. \n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome because Pablo, my Husqvarna teammate, he won the championship for the World rally series. Just to be even in his room watching how he does his roadbook and how he prepares, simple things like packing his stuff in his jacket to different lenses, sleeves, and what to wear\u2014all these little tricks of the trade. To see that is cool. \n\u201cToby [Price] and Matthias [Walkner] and Antoine [Meo] and all those guys have been awesome and Laia [Sanz]. They also have some other riders who are mechanics as well\u2014they\u2019re really fast\u2014and they also have a Junior-[class] rider, Luciano Benavides. It\u2019s a big family so there\u2019s a lot of people to learn from and a lot of people to push from. It\u2019s cool just to watch and visually learn. Instead of asking questions, it\u2019s almost better to see how they approach it, from how they do the roadbook to how they load it to how much fuel they put in their bike\u2014simple things like that you never think of until you get out there and experience it.\u201d \nThe 2018 Dakar route stars in Lima, Peru and finishes in Cordoba, Argentina. \nFuture7Media \nGiven his newness to the sport, how would Short explain rally to someone who\u2019s a dirt rider but hasn\u2019t been exposed to it? He begins, \u201cNobody hardly knows about it in North America and it\u2019s amazing how big it is [everywhere else]. \nFor me to describe it to moto friends or people who don\u2019t know about it, it\u2019s kind of like the Tour de France on a dirt bike with navigation. It\u2019s more of an endurance race and an adventure, and you\u2019re by yourself and it\u2019s day after day. \u201cIt\u2019s cool because as a moto guy, you see the same thing day after day, lap after lap. As a professional it\u2019s pretty monotonous, but obviously it\u2019s really enjoyable and fun, especially the racing aspect and the venues and the stadiums. It\u2019s a blast! \n\u201cRallies, you\u2019re in remote areas. You have to really concentrate on where you\u2019re at and what you\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s cool because you\u2019re in the zone or the moment for hours on end. \n\u201cFor me, it was addicting; I love riding so it was the ultimate adventure and style for what I love to do. I feel if more people knew about it\u2014especially Americans\u2014they would fall in love with it. Kind of like when Lance [Armstrong] started doing well at the Tour de France, it seemed like [cycling] kind of took over in this country and people bought bicycles and it just kind of exploded.\u201d \nPressed to think what advice he as a newbie might give to another newbie like Mark Samuels, Shorts laughs, \u201cI should be the last person to be listening to! For me, I\u2019m in the same position as him. I\u2019m super thankful and excited to go, but I\u2019m also very green and I think that\u2019s an advantage and a disadvantage. I think when you don\u2019t know what to expect, you can just keep moving forward and riding; you\u2019re just kind of going for it. \n\u201cAt the same time that experience can definitely be helpful. I think it\u2019s going to be really tough for both of us, and for both of us to just enjoy it for what it is and to get [to the finish] is a huge accomplishment and to make the most of it. Anything can happen at that race and if you can make it to the end, that\u2019s a big accomplishment. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m shooting for. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s the same.\u201d Ricky Brabec \nWith two Dakars and rallies in Africa and South America under his belt, Ricky Brabec is the most experienced of the three highest-profile Americans to line up at the start in Peru. That, of course, means more pressure to do well. \nSeen here at the team photo shoot in Spain a few weeks before sending all vehicles to France for the long trip to Peru, Ricky Brabec has two Dakars and a stage win to his credit on a relatively short r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \nMonster Energy Honda Team \nHe remembers Dakar 2017 well: \u201cI\u2019d gone into it kind of knowing what to expect. Eventually, that led to a stage win, which was awesome and gave me a confidence boost. Then, unfortunately, I dropped the bike in some rocks and sticks, and I punctured the radiator, which took me out of the rest of the rally with only two days left. \n\u201cThe rest of 2017, I did the Ruta 40, Sonora Rally, and the [OiLibya] Morocco Rally, along with Vegas to Reno as a test on the bike. I learned a lot. It\u2019s always good going to Argentina to do the Ruta 40 because the Dakar goes through Argentina, so it\u2019s a really good experience to go out there and do that race. \n\u201cIn Morocco I did well. It was my first-ever [FIM Cross-Country Rallies] World Championship podium so that\u2019s a good confidence-booster, and I think that\u2019s good going into Dakar. I hope to carry the speed into 2018.\u201d Asked to explain his stage win at Dakar 2017, Brabec admits, \u201cThe [stage] win for me was definitely not expected. From the [rest of the] team, I\u2019m not sure [if they expected it]\u2014probably not. I\u2019m new compared to those guys; they\u2019ve been doing it for a while. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really [due to] a different strategy. There was one area where I could see where it was confusing. I was following the cap. I went more to the right where people were going more to the left, and I think going to the left was the wrong way to go because\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure what happened! I just went to the right and I had a smooth run the whole way, so I think that\u2019s where I gained all the time. I think more to the left was [where] the camel grass was; it looked like the right direction, but I think once you went up [the trail] a little bit further, the road just ended and there was camel grass. I think that slowed everyone down.\u201d \nThe 2018 Dakar will have plenty of sand for the opening five days. Here Brabec seems to be having fun in it during the 2017 event. \nHonda Racing Corporation \nInterestingly, Brabec\u2019s first year aboard the CRF450 Rally saw him fairly constrained when it came to setting the bike up to his preferences: \u201cI tend to set my rally bike up [now] like how I would set up a Baja bike just because the rally is really fast roads\u2014sometimes really fast and choppy\u2014so I want my bike to work like a Baja or hare & hound-style bike because that\u2019s what I\u2019m comfortable with riding. So when I hit something big or it gets a little bit choppy, I know how the bike\u2019s going to handle. \n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what [the other guys] do to [set up] their bikes! All I know is, for me, it\u2019s not safe to ride one of those bikes because they have all rebound in the back and super-stiff forks. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re thinking. I tried to ride the bike and every time I rode it in 2016, I was crashing all over the place because the bike was pitching me off. It was like trying to ride a bull.\u201d \nThat changed in 2017 and the team agreed to let Brabec do more than just personalize ergonomics, giving him the freedom to also personalize suspension, something that\u2019s ongoing to suit conditions: \u201c\u2026stiffer compression for when the bike\u2019s full [of fuel] and also the first six stages this year are sand dunes so it\u2019s the same style Baja specs [I would run] but a little bit stiffer just for the sand dunes to stay up in the stroke because the sand makes [suspension] softer, really.\u201d \nHe continues to further reveal minor improvements the 2018 Dakar bike has over the 2017 version: \u201cThe only thing we really put on our bikes is a speed-control button for the 30-kilometer and 50-kilometer (per hour) sections; that\u2019s really the only change. \n\u201cFor myself, I\u2019m going back to normal handgrips like an A\u2019ME grip [that I use on my regular bikes] basically is what I\u2019m going to be running instead of the [fatter, softer] foam ones. I think it\u2019s a little bit easier to hold onto [regular-size grips] than the foam [ones] because the foam is squishy so you don\u2019t know how tight you\u2019re really holding on. Then, if you get a little handlebar shake, the foam isn\u2019t really grippy so it just moves around in your hand.\u201d \nRicky Brabec won Stage 7 during the 2017 race. \nHonda Racing Corporation \nWith five riders on the Monster Energy Honda Team, one might think the newer guys like Brabec would be relegated to the role of \u201cwater carrier\u201d as was common in the African Dakars. That apparently is no longer the case, at least in Brabec\u2019s opinion. He flatly declares, \u201cMy role on the team is, I\u2019m a racer! There\u2019re times when you need to be a water boy, but I\u2019m there to freaking race\u2014I\u2019m not there to babysit someone.\u201d \nAfter two Dakars, Brabec is fairly familiar with life in the nightly bivouacs, which are basically large pit areas/small cities\u2014another aspect unique to rallies. Unlike the \u201cold days\u201d when everyone stayed in tents in the bivouacs, most of the better-funded teams are able to follow the race in small motorhomes or\u2014occasionally when close enough to civilization\u2014rent rooms at a nearby hotel. There are also what are termed \u201cmarathon\u201d stages where only the riders stay\u2014always in tents\u2014and they alone can perform any maintenance or repairs. No mechanics or team allowed for recommendations. \n\u201cIt\u2019s camp for the night; it changes every single day,\u201d Brabec describes. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely out in the open. It\u2019s like going [to camp out at local riding areas] Lucerne [California] or Dumont [California] or Pahrump [Nevada]. It\u2019s a moving city for the 15 days. It\u2019s pretty rough sometimes. Sometimes it\u2019s freaking super hot and the bivouac could be on asphalt, which makes it way worse. Or it could be on a grassy field and we could get six inches of rain. Every day\u2019s different. \n\u201c[In 2017] we had two \u2018marathon\u2019 stages which is basically you race all day and you sleep out in the middle of the desert with the other racers. There\u2019re no mechanics, no support. There\u2019re no extra parts. There\u2019re no tools (except what the rider carries). It\u2019s just whatever you can get in your jacket or on your bike for the two days, basically. \nThe lone American on the team, Brabec has a different style and bike setup than his teammates. \nMonster Energy Honda Team \n\u201c[The officials] give you a little duffel bag [at the end of the marathon stage\u2019s first day, the halfway point] that has a towel, sweats, a jacket, a pair of socks. Then you get a little hygiene pack, like when you go on the airplane for long flights. \n\u201cThey have all the food ready to go so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re leaving you out there high and dry. It\u2019s just that you don\u2019t get to see your pit crew or you don\u2019t get a nice motorhome to sleep in, nice new parts on your bike\u2014you have to make your bike (including the tires) last for two days. They have showers; it\u2019s nothing super special, but it\u2019s enough to rinse you off and make you feel better. \n\u201cYou can work on the bike yourself. If you need parts or if your teammate needs parts, you\u2019ve got to discuss what position you\u2019re in and hopefully you or the other person is willing to help you out with parts and give you parts off their bike. But you can\u2019t have the organization [or anyone else] bring parts [into the marathon bivouac] for you. Whatever\u2019s on your bike is all you have.\u201d \nAsked to identify the most difficult thing about trying to explain rallies to the average dirt rider, like the others Brabec points to the navigation aspect. \nThere will be two marathon stages in 2018; back to back days without overnight team support. \nHonda Racing Corporation \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain because there\u2019re GPSs, there\u2019s your roadbook, there\u2019re three freaking types of waypoints! Explaining a waypoint that has an arrow pop up [on your instrumentation] is real easy to explain because, obviously, you get close enough to it, an arrow comes up, and you\u2019ve got to follow the arrow. Once you hit the waypoint, the arrow goes away so now you\u2019ve got to change your direction and hopefully you\u2019re on the right mileage. \n\u201cBut then there\u2019re waypoints with no arrow [that comes on] and you have to get within 90 meters [before the tracker gives confirmation beeps]. So there are waypoints with [an] arrow that make it a little bit easier, then there are waypoints without arrows that makes it really super difficult to [find]. \n\u201cI guess explaining the GPS and how it works while you\u2019re racing [is the hardest thing to describe] because if you tell people you have a GPS on your bike, they\u2019ll go, \u2018Oh, why don\u2019t you just follow the line?\u2019\u201d \nFinally, as the most experienced of this trio of Americans, if asked, what advice would he offer to Dakar first-timers? Want more news like this? \nSign up to receive our newsletters and never miss an update! By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy . \nThe 2018 Dakar begins on January 6 and goes until January 20. \nHonda Racing Corporation \n\u201cThe only thing I can say is, I hope you\u2019re ready to ride 15 days in a row\u2014with no sleep!\u201d Brabec answers only half-jokingly. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realize also\u2026people who have normal jobs, go, \u2018Oh man, I would ride dirt bikes every day if I could!\u2019 \n\u201cBut in reality, there\u2019s me and [a small number of others in the world] who do ride dirt bikes for our living, and it\u2019s not as easy as people think. It\u2019s a job. We get up and we go to the gym, we train, we work our asses off, we ride, we do motos\u2014but it\u2019s not a cakewalk by any means. It\u2019s really tough and it gets to you. It\u2019s hard on the body and mind, for sure. \n\u201cThen the Dakar, you get 15 days of racing and you\u2019re waking up at 3:00 a.m. to do it, so it\u2019s tough. The Euros, they don\u2019t like to go to bed \u2019til really late, but here at home I go to bed at 9:00. [At Dakar], I try to go to bed by 9:30 and hopefully asleep by 10:00, but sometimes there\u2019re nights where you\u2019re not getting in bed until 11 o\u2019clock because of roadbook issues; the organization has meetings because they\u2019re changing roadbooks. It\u2019s not just going to sleep, waking up, and racing. You\u2019ve got to work on your roadbook; you\u2019ve got to make sure it\u2019s spot-on because if it\u2019s not good, then obviously you\u2019re going to have trouble the next day.\u201d Tags:",

More >> Scientists   \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

More >> Scientists   \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

More >> Scientists   \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

Reporters from Minnesota Public Radio News did not attend because the meeting was declared off-the-record, but compiled an account from employees who did attend. \nMPR News reports McTaggart said he alone made the decision to break with Keillor, who retired as \"Prairie Home\" host last year. Keillor told the Star Tribune he touched a woman's bare back as he tried to console her, and that he apologized. MPR has not given details of the allegations. \nIn response to the MPR News report, Keillor attorney Eric Nilsson issued a statement early Thursday. \n\"We are aware of allegations against Mr. Keillor by only one individual,\" Nilsson said. \"We trust that Mr. McTaggart will set the record straight in this respect to avoid any misperceptions on that point.\" \nNilsson says Keillor wants a swift resolution of the matter and \"with it expects a full restoration of his reputation.\" \n\"The Prairie Home Companion\" continues with Keillor's hand-picked successor, mandolinist Chris Thile.

All for Juan, Juan for All Problem Solving Kalyeserye. \n\nEat Bulaga ! is a local noon-time variety show in the Philippines produced by the Television And Production Exponents Inc. (TAPE) of Malou Fagar and Tony Tuviera. The program is the longest-running variety show on Philippine television. It also holds the Philippine record of all-time number of live TV episodes. pinoy ako tv the show is aired on GMA Network at 12pm on Weekdays and on Saturdays. The show is broadcast from TAPE Studios at the Broadway Centrum in Quezon City. The show\u2019s main hosts are Vic Sotto, Tito Sotto and Joey de Leon.Production Specialists, Inc., a company owned by Romy Jalosjos, brought the idea of creating a noontime show for Radio Philippines Network (RPN). Antonio Tuviera, who was working for the company, thought that the comic troika of Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto and Joey de Leon, better known as TVJ (who had gained fame through GMA Network's Discorama and as pinch-hitters for Student Canteen, but subsequently left both), would be the perfect hosts for the new program. At a meeting at the InterContinental Manila parking lot, Tuviera made the offer to them; they accepted.\n\nDe Leon coined the title of the show: Eat represents lunchtime while Bulaga (which means \"to surprise\") represents their plan to fill the show with big surprises. The title is also a play on two children's games: Eat is the transliteration of It from the game Tag while Bulaga refers to Peek-a-boo!. Because of this, the slogan \"Hangga't May Bata, May Eat Bulaga!\" (\"While There Are Children, There will be Eat Bulaga!\") was coined, also by de Leon. Vic Sotto, on the other hand, composed the theme song.\n\nEat...Bulaga! premiered on July 30, 1979. TVJ, along with Chiqui Hollman and Richie Reyes (a.k.a. Richie d' Horsie) were the original hosts. During its first few months on the air, the show was in danger of cancellation. Not only did it face competition against the longest-running noontime show at that time, Student Canteen, it also lacked advertisers. In addition, TVJ did not receive their salaries for six months.\n\nEat...Bulaga! slowly gained top-rating status in 1980 after the introduction of the segment \"Mr. Macho.\" Production Specialists soon handed production to Tuviera's TAPE, Inc.

During sampling after Tropical Storm Irene (September 4th, 2011), the discharge varied from 1870 to 2050 cfs during the period of sampling (10 am\u20135 pm), well above the long-term average (Fig. 2). This corresponds to flow-duration percentile value of 20.26% based on over 36,000 data points of daily average discharge measurements. While well below flood stage, these BMS-354825 concentration values represent the near peak values in \ndischarge (\u223c1990 cfs) during the storm \u223c4\u00d7 greater than discharge volumes typical for this time of year and this sampling event is taken to approximate high flow conditions. The May\u2013August records for 2012 (Supplemental Table 5) prior to the baseflow sampling event indicate that both Massena and Saranac Lake rainfall totals were lower than average by 3.19 and 5.18 in., respectively, in agreement with the low discharge values measured in the Raquette River at Piercefield during this period. Daily records for August 2012 (Supplemental Table 4) indicate that very little rain fell in Saranac Lake or Massena from the 18th of August until the sampling date of August 27th, 2012. An exception is 0.17 in. of rain that fell on August 23rd in Massena. This lack of precipitation occurred in addition to what was a very dry spring and summer and, as noted above, the summer rainfall Olaparib purchase total was several inches below normal at both \nlocations (Supplemental Table 5). The mean daily discharge for USGS gauging station at Piercefield, New York on August 27th, 2011 was 568 cfs (Fig. 2). The mean discharge 6-phosphogluconolactonase above is based on a minimum of 104 years of record keeping. The discharge recorded at the gauging station on August 27, 2012 ranged between 140 and 120 cfs during our sampling trip that occurred between 11 am and 6 pm on that day. Compared to a long-term discharge average (568 cfs) this represents very low flow in agreement with precipitation records \nsummarized above and drought conditions noted that summer (Fig. 2). This corresponds to a flow-duration percentile value of 98.65% based on over 36,000 data points of daily average discharge measurements. Thus sampling on August 27th, 2012 is taken to approximate baseflow conditions within the Raquette River drainage basin. Of the 69 elements (Supplemental Tables 4a and 4b) routinely reported during standard ICP-MS analysis of dilute natural waters only Al, Ba, Ca, Cl, Fe, K, La, Mg, Mn, Na, Nd, Rb, Si, Sr, Y, and Zn were detected at all seventeen sampling locations during at least one of the two sampling events (Fig. 3; Table 1; Supplemental Table 6). Some of the lower solubility trivalent cations (e.g. REE3+, Al3+, Fe3+; Taylor and McLennan, 1985) were not detected any of the baseflow sample locations, but were detected in all of the stormflow samples.

Thanassis Stavrakis AP Photo Turkey's Erdogan arrives in Athens for official Greece visit By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press December 07, 2017 01:56 AM ATHENS, Greece \nRecep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Athens Thursday for the first official visit to Greece by a Turkish president in decades, with Greece hoping the trip will help improve often frosty ties with its neighbor and NATO ally. \nErdogan was greeted by an honor guard at the airport and headed to central Athens, laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier before talks with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and other officials. On Friday, he travels to northeastern Greece to meet with members of the country's Muslim minority. \nSecurity was tight in the Greek capital, with roads shut down and demonstrations banned in the center of Athens. \nOn the eve of his arrival, Erdogan alarmed Greek officials by saying in an interview with Greece's Skai television that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which determined current Greek-Turkish borders among other issues, should be \"updated.\" Never miss a local story. Sign up today for unlimited digital access to our website, apps, the digital newspaper and more. SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"In fact, all agreements (pacts) in the world should be updated with the passage of time,\" Erdogan said in the interview. \"Lausanne too, in the face of all these developments, is in need of an update. This update would be beneficial not only for Turkey but also for Greece.\" \nErdogan has made similar comments in the past about the peace treaty, which set the borders of modern Turkey, but his repetition on the day before his arrival in Athens came as an unwelcome surprise to his hosts. \nHis comments \"raises serious concerns and questions,\" Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said in a statement. \n\"The Greek government and the prime minister want his visit to be a reason to build bridges, not to raise walls.\" \nTzanakopoulos said respecting the treaty is \"the exclusive and non-negotiable foundation on which the honest cooperation of the two countries can be built.\" \n\"Comments regarding its revision do not contribute to the climate we are trying to build in our relations and in the region,\" he said. \nThe refugee crisis will be high on the agenda of talks with Erdogan, as Greek islands have been the gateway into Europe for migrants crossing from the Turkish coast. Regional relations, energy and business ties, Turkey's stalled bid to join the European Union and longstanding disputes such as Turkey's territorial claims in the Greek Aegean will also be discussed. \nOne of the current thorny issues to be raised will be the case of eight Turkish servicemen who have requested asylum in Greece following last year's failed coup in Turkey. Ankara has demanded their extradition, a request rejected by Greek courts on the grounds they could not be guaranteed a fair trial in Turkey. \nThe move infuriated Erdogan, who said in his Wednesday interview that his country's judicial system is \"the best in Europe.\" He said Tsipras had promised to return the servicemen in \"15 to 20 days\" after they flew to Greece in a military helicopter. \n\"That is what he said. But unfortunately right now they are still in Greece,\" Erdogan said, adding that the servicemen should have been handed over before Greek courts became involved. \n\"If you leave it up to the judiciary there will be no result,\" he said. \"In order to facilitate the work of the judiciary you must first, as the government, take the necessary measures before you assign it to the judiciary.\" \nErdogan's visit comes as his country finds itself increasingly isolated on the international stage, and his comments will be closely watched for signs he might try to improve some of Turkey's international relations, particularly with the EU. \nTurkey's ties with the EU, and with several European countries, deteriorated significantly following Erdogan's post-coup crackdown. Tens of thousands of Turks have been fired from their jobs, and tens of thousands more have been imprisoned on accusations of being linked, however tenuously, with Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Islamic cleric that Erdogan blames for masterminding the coup. \nOther than Greece, Poland is the only other EU country to have invited Erdogan to visit since mid-2016. \nHistorical tensions between Greece and Turkey, which have brought the two countries to the brink of war on three occasions since the 1970s, remain. Decades-old thorny issues include territorial disputes in the Aegean, the Muslim minority in northeastern Greece and the continued occupation by Turkish troops of northern Cyprus. \nTension between Ankara and Washington has also increased recently, particularly over the New York trial of a Turkish banker over alleged transactions with Iran.

Matt Bevin's administration can determine if the decision to remove it was legal. \nThe plaque is attached to a 15-foot (4.5 meters) marble statue of Jefferson Davis, who was born in Kentucky and was president of the Confederacy during the Civil War. \nEfforts to remove the statue have been ongoing for years, but they gained momentum following the 2015 racially motivated killings of nine people at an African-American church in South Carolina. \nThe state commission that governs the statue voted to keep it in 2015. But earlier this year, following violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the commission voted to remove the plaque that says Davis was a \"hero, patriot, statesman.\" Never miss a local story. Sign up today for unlimited digital access to our website, apps, the digital newspaper and more. SUBSCRIBE NOW \nAt the time, state officials said the plaque would be removed in a few days. But on Wednesday, Historic Properties Division Director Leslie Nigels said the legal department at the Finance and Administration Cabinet was doing research \"to make sure that we were absolutely within our rights to remove the plaque.\" \n\"There is a possibility that it may be something that the legislature will have to address,\" she said. \nShe said the plaque will stay at least until the commission's next scheduled meeting in February. \nState and local governments across the country have been removing Confederate monuments in recent years following the racially motivated violence in South Carolina and Virginia. In Kentucky, the statue of Davis in the Capitol rotunda has been a flashpoint given its prominent location. \nThe statue has been in place since 1936, paid for by $5,000 in public money authorized by the state legislature and private donations raised by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. \nKentucky did not secede from the Union during the Civil War. But it was filled with Confederate sympathizers who attempted to establish a Confederate government in the western part of the state. \nKentucky has wrestled with its history since the Civil War. In addition to Davis, the Capitol Rotunda includes a statue of Abraham Lincoln, who was also born in Kentucky. The Lincoln statue came first. \nThe original plan, according to the Kentucky Historical Society, was to have the Davis statue back-to-back with Lincoln, with Davis facing south and Lincoln facing north. But that plan was abandoned because the statues were too heavy to be that close together. \nThe Davis statue has been the source of political controversies. When he was running for governor in 2015, Matt Bevin was one of the first Republicans to call for the statue to be removed from the Capitol and placed in a museum. \nBut earlier this year, Bevin said removing the statue would set a \"dangerous precedent.\" Bevin has said decisions about the Davis statue should be left up to the commission because \"no one individual should be making these decisions.\" \nA spokeswoman for Bevin did not respond to a request for comment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jefferson davis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "matt bevin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leslie nigels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bevin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abraham lincoln", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mobile & apps file", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united daughters of the confederacy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "administration cabinet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky historical society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam beam associated press", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol rotunda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlottesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankfort ky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankfort", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky state capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:12.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b7ed8735e6e5cf3b923b40fe895c94ba6860591", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6jsyG1oTKZY0r0LUdMqyrWFeZFu.EiF776lwvjcYgTiSTmj6RX.Eq10end3yk3XkcUxMOSWBLcazLJEDklqqt2Vi2hRhKy2WzcYgvrA7oi2gTyHh8.rTqS0WxV8LzJDBX1x7w01rYyg--", "site_full": "www.johnlewis.com", "site": "johnlewis.com", "site_section": "https://www.johnlewis.com/browse/women/womens-watches/pmwatches/_/N-2ubtZ1z13ysxZ1z13yrgZ1z05fa0Z1z13r3rZ1z140riZ1z13zbqZ1z13xrvZ1z1411iZ1z13zgyZ1z13toxZ1z13zhtZ1z14071Z1z13sfbZ1z13z4eZ1z141gc", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Armani Exchange | Casio | CLUSE | Women's Watches | John Lewis", "title": "Radley RY2288 Basket Dog Stitch Leather Watch, Taupe/Multi", "title_full": "Buy Radley RY2288 Women's Basket Dog Stitch Leather Strap Watch, Taupe/Multi | John Lewis", "published": "2016-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.033, "main_image": "https://johnlewis.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/233873563?$preview$", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2411, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a2e03ff01e4da4b463bfb86b01d5a579b1015a32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6jsyG1oTKZY0r0LUdMqyrWFeZFu.EiF776lwvjcYgTiSTmj6RX.Eq10end3yk3XkcUxMOSWBLcazLJEDklqqt2Vi2hRhKy2WzcYgvrA7oi2gTyHh8.rTqS0WxV8LzJDB.0labl6jnkJRnpO9vCenh", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "mintzu", "published": "2017-11-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Nice design and cute look.

Kirsty Wigglesworth AP Photo Ireland's government expects UK to make new Brexit proposal By DANICA KIRKA Associated Press   3 MINUTES AGO LONDON \nIreland's government expects the U.K. to make a new Brexit proposal by Friday as officials in London struggle to resolve issues surrounding the Irish border that are stalling talks over Britain's departure from the European Union. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to persuade EU leaders to declare that sufficient progress has been made on divorce issues, including the Irish border, when they meet next week in Brussels so talks can move on to trade and future relations between the two sides. Business leaders warn further delays will hurt companies as they plan for the future. \nIreland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said late Wednesday he hopes May will submit a new offer \"tonight or tomorrow.\" Disagreements over rules governing the border between the Republic of Ireland, which is a member of the EU, and the U.K. province of Northern Ireland derailed an earlier proposal. \nExisting rules allow people and goods to pass freely between the Republic and Northern Ireland with no border checks. Ireland wants to preserve the current arrangements, which have eased tensions along the border. May is struggling to balance those demands against the concerns of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to support her government in Parliament.   \nVaradkar said Wednesday that avoiding a hard border remains his \"absolute red line.\" \n\"We will not loosen our position,\" he told Ireland's Parliament, the Dail. \"We will stay very firm.\" \nThe British and Irish prime ministers discussed the Brexit impasse in a phone call Wednesday, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. \nMay's office said she and Varadkar are \"working hard to find a specific solution to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland,\" which have triggered a crisis in Britain's divorce negotiations with the European Union.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "leo varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirsty wigglesworth", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brexit proposal mobile & apps britain", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic of ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london  ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "photo ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:12.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d8afa9babe7ff6433adb756019c4832e3d06d50b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrDDXJn73SpMcsjoRYNY6xTMeEwylL70rnips.R1M41m56I6Ba3ErtbNenLWcFY5tUPk2CBF1RXFOQ5b70vh1unF8sp0C8CHztpiH81s3b0.w--", "site_full": "speeddatingusa.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://speeddatingusa.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Speed Dating USA", "title": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 dating advice", "title_full": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 dating advice", "published": "2017-12-07T12:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8afa9babe7ff6433adb756019c4832e3d06d50b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrDDXJn73SpMcsjoRYNY6xTMeEwylL70rnips.R1M41m56I6Ba3ErtbNenLWcFY5tUPk2CBF1RXFOQ5b70vh1unF8sp0C8CHztpiH81s3b0.w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dating Akuten (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 dating advice", "text": "dating advice Direktuppdatering \u22c5 7 december 2017 WEBB Dating Advice From The Perpetually Dateless: Issue 2 Odyssey Dating can be a struggle at any stage in your life.

Douglas C. Pizac, File AP Photo Where protected lands stand after national monument review By BRADY McCOMBS Associated Press December 07, 2017 01:43 AM UPDATED 1 MINUTE AGO SALT LAKE CITY \nPresident Donald Trump ordered U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke earlier this year to conduct an unprecedented review of 27 monuments established by former presidents over more than two decades on lands and waters revered for their natural beauty and historical significance. \nZinke said Tuesday that he's confident the president will follow his recommendations, which include calls to reduce two other monuments in the U.S. West and to modify rules at six others. He also has said he's recommending the creation of three new monuments. \nZinke released his full report Tuesday, which was previously leaked. Here's a breakdown of Zinke's recommendations: \n___ Never miss a local story. Sign up today for unlimited digital access to our website, apps, the digital newspaper and more. SUBSCRIBE NOW \nMONUMENTS TO BE DOWNSIZED \nTrump will shrink Bears Ears National Monument by about 85 percent to 315 square miles, divided into two separate areas. He plans to downsize the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by nearly half to 1,569 square miles, divided into three areas. \nTribal and conservation groups are suing to block those cuts. \nZinke also advised trimming Gold Butte in Nevada and Cascade Siskiyou in Oregon, but the president hasn't announced final decision on those monuments. \nZinke said Tuesday the cuts at Gold Butte would mainly come around a water district that shouldn't have been included in the boundaries. He said he recommends making clear that hunting and fishing are allowed and asking Congress to approve a co-management plan to allows Native American tribes to help run the monument. Gold Butte protects nearly 300,000 acres of desert landscapes featuring rock art, sandstone towers and wildlife habitat for the threatened Mojave Desert tortoise and other species. \nZinke declined to specify how many acres he wants to remove from monument status, stressing that the administration is working with Nevada's governor and congressional delegation to find a solution. \nSimilarly, Zinke declined specifics on Cascade-Siskiyou, which protects about 113,000 acres in an area where three mountain ranges converge. Changes will center on recent expansion of the site, which was first created by Clinton in 2000. Much of the additional land is on private property, while some is on land previously designated for timber production, Zinke said. \n___ \nNO DOWNSIZING, BUT RULE CHANGES \nZinke proposed more access for people and industry and other changes at six monuments: \n\u2014 Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks and Rio Grande Del Norte, New Mexico: Modifications will be made to protect the long-standing culture of grazing and ensure hunters and fishers don't lose access, Zinke said. At Organ Mountains, the U.S. Border Patrol will do a border-safety assessment to give Zinke a list of possible improvements to ensure they can do their job. He will also request congressional authority to give tribes co-management. \n\u2014 Katahdin Woods and Waters, Maine: Zinke said he wants to allow more trees to be cut in some parts by a National Park Service company, and not commercial logging, to make the forest healthy by thinning and landscape improvement. He also wants to ensure that \"traditional uses\" like snowmobiling and hunting are taken into account in a management plan. \n\u2014 Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, Maine: Allow commercial fishing in the first marine monument in the Atlantic Ocean. \n\u2014 Pacific Remote Islands, Pacific Ocean: Allow commercial fishing within the marine monument that covers nearly 87,000 square miles (225,330 square kilometers) near Hawaii. \n\u2014 Rose Atoll, Pacific Ocean: Allow commercial fishing in the 13,500-square-mile (34,965-square-kilometer) marine monument around the Rose Atoll in American Samoa, a U.S territory. \n___ \nZinke didn't suggest changes to 17 other monuments in seven states and the Pacific Ocean: \n\u2014 Arizona: Grand Canyon-Parashant, Sonoran Desert, Vermilion Cliffs and Ironwood Forest. \n\u2014 California: Sand to Snow, Mojave Trails, San Gabriel Mountains, Berryessa Snow Mountain, Giant Sequoia and Carrizo Plain. \n\u2014 Colorado: Canyons of the Ancients. \n\u2014 Idaho: Craters of the Moon. \n\u2014 Montana: Upper Missouri River Breaks. \n\u2014 Nevada: Basin and Range. \n\u2014 Pacific Ocean: Marianas Trench southwest of Guam and Papahanaumokuakea near Hawaii. \n___ \nNEW MONUMENTS \nZinke also recommended Trump create three monuments, including one in his home state of Montana: \n\u2014 Badger-Two Medicine in an area within the Lewis and Clark National Forest in northwest Montana. Zinke said he sees a great opportunity to help generate some income for the locals and foster more cultural understanding by creating a monument in a sacred place for the Blackfeet Nation. He said he would request congressional authority to give the tribe co-management. \n\u2014 Medgar Evers' home in Jackson, Mississippi, where the first field secretary for the NAACP was assassinated on June 12, 1963. Evers organized boycotts over segregation during the civil rights movement. \n\u2014 Camp Nelson near Nicholasville, Kentucky, which was established in 1863 as a 700-bed Union Army hospital, supply depot and recruiting center for African-American troops in the state.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "douglas c. pizac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 rose atoll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan zinke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zinke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 medgar evers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 katahdin woods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose atoll", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mobile & apps file", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "escalante canyons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackfeet nation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brady mccombs associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. border patrol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northeast canyons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mojave trails", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national park service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naacp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ancients", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clark national forest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "union army", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "upper gulch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicholasville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organ mountains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san gabriel mountains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonoran desert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrizo plain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camp nelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ironwood forest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific remote islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio grande del norte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "papahanaumokuakea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samoa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cascade-siskiyou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berryessa snow mountain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idaho", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:12.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26cda99d55175038bff304e84e41bf0353e067b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg89DMtBNnmFX0KthAiYDMCbkg7CKDxbuz3m1guIGAtMu5UN3y9t_IUEz9WwcjvyFf4AM.HaJxcBURTpDx80USj1.8ldxWGB2E8-", "site_full": "www.mohamedsemboja.me", "site": "mohamedsemboja.me", "site_section": "http://www.mohamedsemboja.me/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Semboja, Mohamed Jumanne", "title": "Ghanian President Nana Akufo-Addo: Africa's march of democracy hard to reverse -

It reinforced its refusal to join a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. \nHowever, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear that he doesn't want a new election, and Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz reversed course. \nAt a previously scheduled party congress Thursday, Schulz is seeking members' approval for a resolution approving talks on \"whether and in what form\" the Social Democrats can support a new government.
