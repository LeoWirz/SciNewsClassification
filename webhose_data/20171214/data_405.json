So, despite only having 3 hours of sleep between arriving at the hotel, we were deprived an extra 1/2 hour of sleep because of the shuttle schedule.

They argued that the vending machines were not \u201ctheir\u201d business. This is disrespectful customer service, and so unfortunate that it occurred to this guest over only a few dollars. Eventually they agreed to refund the guest (perhaps they realized they had an audience of guests waiting to take the 6am shuttle to the airport?).... and finally at 6:30 we were able to load our luggage into the shuttle to head to the airport. Apparently we could have had more sleep after all. Room was clean, but nothing special. Fulfilled our needs of getting a few hours of sleep after a full day of flying.

So we looked at the many ways you interact with videos to identify the top trending videos that everybody was talking about in 2017,\u201d YouTube Canada spokesperson Nicole Bell explained in an email. \u201cThe final list is then ranked by views.\u201d\nThe list includes some of the most talked about moments put to video this year, such as \u201cWoman interrupted during BBC Interview\u201d (#6), a comedic take on how a busy mom would have handled things if she was in the same spot as Robert Kelly, the professor who was interrupted by his two young children during a live interview with the BBC.\nThe list also includes rapper Eminem\u2019s freestyle cypher tearing into Donald Trump (#2), the adorable moment when a young child stole Prince Harry\u2019s popcorn (#7), and a duo\u2019s mission to compare a $1 donut with a $100 donut (#9).\nAs usual, a number of animal videos made the list this year, including an epic battle between a moose and a wolf (#5) caught by a drone camera in Northern Ontario and a livestream of a giraffe giving birth to a calf named April at Animal Adventure Park in New York (#3).\nTopping the list this year was another animal-related video \u2013 a frightening moment caught on camera in Richmond, B.C. when a sea lion dragged a little girl into the water . The girl was pulled out of the water almost immediately and was ok, but the video continues to elicit gasps from millions of viewers.\nIn addition to the top trending videos in Canada, YouTube also compiled a list of the top music videos Canadians watched on the service.\nInternational hits such as Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cShape of You\u201d (#2) and Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d (#6) did well.\nBut nearly half the videos on the list feature Canadians. They include \u201cReminder\u201d by The Weeknd (#7), \u201cStay (Lyric Video)\u201d by Zedd and Alessia Cara (#8), \u201cThere's Nothing Holdin' Me Back\u201d(#10) by Shawn Mendes and \u201cI'm the One\u201d (#3) which features Justin Bieber.\nSmashing records as the most viewed video in the world is the music video for the ubiquitous Luis Fonsi hit \u201cDespacito\u201d (#1). The video has 4.4 billion views and counting worldwide. While Bieber recorded a version of the song, it was actually the video for the original Spanish version that broke records.\n\u201cThis is THE music story of 2017 on YouTube - it was the first video in YouTube history to surpass 3 billion views, and it broke the record for the most-viewed video of all time on YouTube,\u201d Bell said. \u201cIt\u2019s now at 4.4 billion views. The video has propelled Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee to international stardom and multiple Grammy nominations - if it wins song of the year, it will make history as the first non-English song to win that honour since the 1960s.\u201d\n\u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d nabbed spot #1 on a list of top movie trailers on YouTube Canada this year.\n<br />\nIt was followed by trailers for \u201cIt\u201d and \u201cThor: Ragnarok,\u201d both of which went on to be hits at the box office.\nWhile millions flock to YouTube to watch music and video clips, advertisers have also been working hard to create ads that people would actually want to keep watching instead of skipping through.\n\u201cThe YouTube Canada Ads Leaderboard showcases the most creative ads that Canadians chose to watch during the year, determined by an algorithm that factors in audience engagement (watch time, likes, shares), video views, and audience retention (how much of a video people watched),\u201d Bell said. \u201cIn addition, we factor in organic versus paid views.\u201d\nAds for Chevrolet Canada, SickKids, WestJet, Coca-Cola Canada and Nintendo managed to do a good job of holding eyeballs online this year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/dz_errIBq3Y", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/zB4I68XVPzQ", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ojvk-4IcOE", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/pMDtibc13fc", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/h--P8HzYZ74", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/kJQP7kiw5Fk", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/JGwWNGJdvx8", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO6qs83CHpc", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/v7MGUNV8MxU"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ed sheeran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zedd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince harry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taylor swift", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin bieber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicole bell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bieber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luis fonsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shawn mendes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alessia cara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eminem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chevrolet canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coca-cola canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nintendo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westjet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube canada ads leaderboard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube canada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ontario", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richmond", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:45.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9023c2b5135d568478d4835c0b38726298443c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9aRTYqMl0LbYN3Vdy63c90iHMd.HRAqpQARTpOXdnp.3YAG8uytpcv9SMn5FoOH3JtU0PUM.5wPM9ZzjfO1pn4GyiSDr.eRBIqMgPUFm9pF4Zc68y3k3Dh", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/reviews/country/vn.en-gb.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Vietnam Hotel reviews | Booking.com", "title": "112 Hotel Sapa Horizon Hotel", "title_full": "112 Verified Hotel Reviews of Sapa Horizon Hotel | Booking.com", "published": "2014-04-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 74, "participants_count": 73, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://t-ec.bstatic.com/static/img/facebook-image-else/566c7081f1deeaca39957e96365c3908f83b95af.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 105, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da3cbc6503f1fa7cf7aaf98666ab9820a35333bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9aRTYqMl0LbYN3Vdy63c90iHMd.HRAqpQARTpOXdnp.3YAG8uytpcv9SMn5FoOH3JtU0PUM.5wPM9ZzjfO1pn4GyiSDr.eRBIqMgPUFm9pF7mTv5rSTaj90KKbZBQSQpLX29V5fFB9Ru5pXslFngS0uQQ3M_kuL0s-", "ord_in_thread": 74, "author": "Nicholas", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Spacious and comfortable rooms, wide variety of food on...\"", "text": "Spacious and comfortable rooms, wide variety of food on offer for breakfast.

I am using an MCP3008 ADC to read a photodiode, and will also add a temperature sensor on too. I am using the following code to print out the readings every second in Python 3.4.2. \nCode: Select all import spidev from time import sleep #First open up SPI bus spi = spidev.SpiDev() spi.open(0,0) # Initialise what sensor is where lightChannel = 0 tempChannel = 1 sleepTime = 1 def getReading(channel): # First pull the raw data from the chip rawData = spi.xfer([1, (8 + channel) << 4, 0]) # Process the raw data into something we understand processedData = ((rawData[1]&3) << 8) + rawData[2] return processedData while True: data = getReading(lightChannel) datatemp = getReading(tempChannel) sleep(sleepTime) print(data , datatemp , time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')) When I run the code I get three columns, printing out values every second. My question is: How can I get this code to run and automatically print to a csv. or txt. file? I have seen a lot of stuff online about file = open(\"blah blah\") but when I run the code, the created txt. file is always empty. Any help would be much appreciated!

In the eyes of the layperson, our current lack of understanding could easily be mistaken for a personal lack of command of the laws of physics. Yet, the truth is that even these laws are having a hard time withstanding the mind-boggling properties of black holes. \nPhysicists' debates around black holes have never been so lively. Whilst we have come to know more about how large and dense a black hole can be, how it absorbs matter down to its event horizon or how it progressively evaporates to ultimately vanish, some of the most important questions surrounding such objects are still open. \nThere are, for example, the questions of how a supermassive black hole equivalent to the mass of millions or billions of our sun can be created, or how binary black hole systems affect matter surrounding them. Then, there is of course the more fundamental question of what a black hole is actually made of, or even how it affects the matter in its vicinity when it\u2019s not close enough to be absorbed. \nBut beyond their own physics, black holes are also a central stage for one of the most exciting questions physicists have yet to tackle: the reconciliation of general relativity \u2013 Einstein\u2019s theory explaining gravity \u2013 with quantum mechanics, which explains the other three forces of the universe. Doing that would create a long sought-after Theory of Everything (ToE) \u2013 the Holy Grail of physics. And to get there, one has to resolve the black hole information paradox, which is pretty much the embodiment of the existing conflict between the two laws. \nOther topics in this edition include the following highlights: New, tumour-specific therapy for colorectal cancer patients Reframing the EU\u2019s commitment to human rights How to increase support for new power lines For successful river basin adaptation planning, just add stakeholders Next-generation marine sensors to protect the world\u2019s oceans Looking to the future through the first autonomous artificial iris Emergent behaviour from collective systems underpins the success of \u2018smart networks\u2019 A modular solution for quick, efficient and secure EU border security More than the sum of their parts: expanding the scope of particle accelerators \nThe Research*eu Results Magazine is the main source of information for all findings related to EU-funded science projects.

But President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear he doesn't want a new election, and Schulz reversed course.\nSchulz told Thursday's previously scheduled congress that the leadership's plan for talks, which he hopes to start next week, \"takes no option off the table\" and wouldn't automatically lead to a coalition.\n\"We don't have to govern at any price, but we also shouldn't want not to govern at any price,\" he said. \"What is important is what we can implement.\"\nSchulz has promised a ballot of the party's entire membership on any coalition deal with Merkel's Union bloc. On Thursday, leaders agreed also to hold a party congress to consider whether to move on from exploratory talks \u2014 if they are successful \u2014 to full coalition negotiations.\nIf no coalition is agreed upon, that would leave only a minority government or a new election as options. Merkel has said she is \"very skeptical\" about leading a minority government, which hasn't yet been tried in post-World War II Germany.\nSchulz, however, made clear that some form of support for a minority conservative government is very much an option for his party.\n\"I give you this promise: we will explore every path,\" he told delegates.\nIn his speech, Schulz listed center-left priorities such as equal treatment for men and women in the labor market and a relatively liberal approach to immigration, rejecting the idea of a cap on the number of refugees allowed into the country.\nThe former European Parliament president called for a eurozone budget to boost investment and growth in Europe, and a European finance minister who would curb \"tax dumping.\"\nHe also advocated aiming for a federal \"United States of Europe\" by 2025, and argued that countries that don't sign up to a treaty establishing a federal setup should then automatically leave the European Union.\nMerkel gave a skeptical response when asked at a separate event in Berlin about Schulz' push for a federalized Europe. She said she would concentrate on securing greater cooperation on economic, security, defense and other issues by 2025.\nThe Social Democrats have been part of Germany's government for 15 of the past 19 years \u2014 twice joining a \"grand coalition\" under Merkel, from 2005 to 2009 and again from 2013 until now.\nBut the party suffered historically poor election results after both Merkel coalitions, with support slumping to a post-war low of 20.5 percent in September.\n\"The renewal of the Social Democratic Party will happen outside a 'grand coalition,' or it won't happen,\" said the leader of its youth wing, Kevin Kuehnert.\nDelegates later re-elected Schulz as party leader. Schulz, who ran unopposed, won some 82 percent support \u2014 short of the unanimous backing he received when first elected in March.\n\"I hope that, on the basis of this result, better times will come,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "martin schulz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "merkel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "andrea nahles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angela merkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "markus schreiber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank-walter steinmeier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schulz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerhard schroeder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "spd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "social democratic party", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ap german social democrats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social democrats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social democrat", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gallery berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "creek fire smothers lake view terrace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sfgate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oakland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russian hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bay area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa rosa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:47.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "20b0173633697944199bd2871397dc728ec3cd71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_dvLC2mBgywGmTY_Y.NzfwE-", "site_full": "forums.d2jsp.org", "site": "d2jsp.org", "site_section": "http://forums.d2jsp.org/forum.php?f=178", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Hardcore - Americas Trading - d2jsp Forum", "title": "Puzzle Rings Special", "title_full": "Puzzle Rings Special - d2jsp Topic", "published": "2017-12-06T20:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46006, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f964785706a891a03610ceefa64da5e663aec001", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_dvLC2mBgywGTJ8f3G3YdC8GuWzFtnUpdA--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "SuperrHcc", "published": "2017-12-06T21:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: Nah I just refused to do it for you.

She thought a minute and said 30-30 and 7MM was about the same and would call them second, thought another minute and said 243 and 7mm-08 finished out the list. According to her, these six calibers accounted for about 90-95% of the deer hunting ammo sold, at this store.\nNow remember, this is for hunting white tail deer, where I live in the south, mostly woods, probably not many shots over 100-150 yds.

If I could find a better cartridge for a first big game rifle, they would get that instead. But I can't.\nI don't know of any other cartridge that offers the flexibility the .30-06 offers. Yes, there are perhaps better choices if you only plan to hunt small southern or coastal deer. Or only grizzly. There is a much greater variety of ammunition available for the .30-06 than there is for most other cartridges. If any cartridge can match the variety, it may be the .308 Win, but even it falls short when the yardstick is the breadth of application. For the .30-06 you have factory ammo options from 55 grain .22 Accelerator loads to full diameter loads from 100 grains to 220 grains. For the handloader, there are all kinds of other alternatives. Midwayusa lists 297 .308\" bullets, 96 .264\" (6.5mm) and 90 .277\" bullets.\nSome would argue a .308 Win will do everything .30-06 can do. Close, yes, everything, no. FWIW, I did recommend a 308 Win for Daughter #1 when it was time for her to buy her rifle.\nLast edited by Coyote_Hunter; Yesterday at 07:22 AM .

It fluttered around me like a newborn butterfly and settled in a corner of my heart. I held my breath, afraid to exhale, for fear it would slip out, never to be found again. Buy MISTS OF THE SERENGETI (Paperback) \nFIRST 6 STAR RATING OF THE YEAR \nIf you\u2019ve been looking for a story that will sweep you away, one that you will feel with all of your heart and soul, one that will take on a journey unlike any you\u2019ve been on, one that\u2019ll break your heart and then put it back together, then this is the book for you!!! From the moment I heard about it, I knew I had to read it. And now, having finished it, I can say with full certainty that THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. Leylah Attar\u2019s breathtaking writing depicts vivid imagery with evocative prose that immerses you in the story and makes you feel every moment in your heart. Reading this book was a reaffirmation in everything that makes me love reading. It is a profoundly beautiful and unparalleled reading experience that I can\u2019t recommend highly enough! \nOnce in Africa, I kissed a king\u2026 \n\u201cAnd just like that, in an old red barn at the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro, I discovered the elusive magic I had only ever glimpsed between the pages of great love stories. It fluttered around me like a newly born butterfly and settled in a corner of my heart. I held my breath, afraid to exhale for fear it would slip out, never to be found again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nWhen a bomb explodes in a mall in East Africa, its aftershocks send two strangers on a collision course that neither one sees coming. \nJack Warden, a divorced coffee farmer in Tanzania, loses his only daughter. An ocean away, in the English countryside, Rodel Emerson loses her only sibling. \nTwo ordinary people, bound by a tragic afternoon, set out to achieve the extraordinary, as they make three stops to rescue three children across the vast plains of the Serengeti\u00e2\u0080\u0094children who are worth more dead than alive. \nBut even if they beat the odds, another challenge looms at the end of the line. Can they survive yet another loss\u00e2\u0080\u0094this time of a love that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bound to slip through their fingers, like the mists that dissipate in the light of the sun? \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSometimes you come across a rainbow story\u00e2\u0080\u0094one that spans your heart. You might not be able to grasp it or hold on to it, but you can never be sorry for the color and magic it brought.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nI found myself smiling so often as I read, not because of what was happening in the story, but from the sheer joy of reading such a beautifully written book. Over and over again, I\u2019d read a certain passage and just stop, take a deep breath, highlight it, and then read it again \u2014 savoring the words. It usually takes me a couple hours to read a book, but it took me almost three days to read this one because I tried to read it as slowly as I could \u2014 I wasn\u2019t just reading this book, I was experiencing the story. I believe that it\u2019s a reflection of an incredibly perceptive author when they not only weave together a great story, but also show a keen understanding of human nature through their words. \nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unspoken rule about how long you can stare like that at another person. No one says it, but we all know it. There is the quick glance we give to strangers, the acknowledgement we exchange with people we know, the private joke, the silent acceptance, the lover\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gaze, the parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concern. Our eyes are always different, always speaking. They meet and look away, a thousand nuances expressed without words. And then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this. Whatever was passing between Jack and me in the middle of that ancient caldera. Perhaps it was because we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know exactly where we fit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 two people bound by a sunny, tragic afternoon, retreating from the edge of attraction \u00e2\u0080\u0094 lives that were oceans apart, breaths that lingered in the space between. \nI\u2019ve been asked a lot what \u2018kind\u2019 of book this is. It feels wrong to try to label it but I can tell you that this book fully fits the definition of a Romance genre novel (complete with an ending that\u2019ll make your heart soar), but it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s a love story set against a backdrop of a devastating loss, an exhilarating journey, and a thrilling race to save a group of endangered children. It\u2019s a story of loss and love, courage and sacrifice, and the full circle of healing. But ultimately, this is absolutely a breathtakingly beautiful romance unlike any other I\u2019ve ever read. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is he now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntimidating. Sad, angry, bitter. I think he might have a death wish. He was standing under a tree in the storm, by his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grave, like he wanted to be struck down right next to her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a thousand lives, I would die a thousand deaths to save her. Over and over and over again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nIt was barely a brush, but his entire body tightened in reaction. I felt the quieting of his breath on my face, the jolt of his thigh against my body, the crackle of awareness where his bare arms touched mine. I felt the kind of chemistry I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been holding out for, the kind that ignites all your senses, so that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more alive in that one second than in all the moments, in all the days before. \nLosing someone you love tunes you in to the fragility of life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of moments and memories and music. It makes you want to embrace all the foolish, inarticulate longings that pull at your heart. It makes you want to grasp un-played notes of un-played symphonies. Perhaps that was why Jack and I clung to that moment, eyes locked, breaths stilled, listening to something that only we could hear, something that lived in the fleeting space between hello and goodbye. \nAs someone who has never visited Africa, I loved seeing the continent through Rodel\u2019s eyes. And despite the intensely emotional backdrop to this story, and the beauty of the culture, I also found myself chuckling over and over again. \nTo his credit, Jack kept a straight face. I ripped into the biscuits before he got in the car. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a fan of the local cuisine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a fan of roasted entrails, local or otherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nBut on a more serious note\u2026 Certain scenes just gave me these full body CHILLS !!

"December 6, 2017 \nSo Strange: Woman gives birth to a giant tumor she thought was a baby {PHOTOS\\VIDEO} \u2022\u2022 \nA mom of two was forced to give birth to a huge tumor on the toilet after her \u201cbaby\u201d turned out to be cancer. \nLauren Knowles during treatment for her molar pregnancy. \nLauren Knowles was over the moon when her pregnancy test read positive. \nBut when the then-27-year-old noticed heavy spotting at seven-and-a-half weeks, doctors sent her for a scan. \nThe mom, who lived in the UK at the time, was heartbroken to discover the baby she thought she was carrying was actually a tumor growing in her womb. \nShe was diagnosed with a molar pregnancy, a cluster of cells known as gestational trophoblastic disease. \nAnd tests revealed Knowles\u2019 mass was cancerous. \nDespite surgeons removing most of the tumor and undergoing grueling chemotherapy and hair loss, Knowles\u2019 tumor returned and continued to grow at an alarming rate. \nKnowles started chemo straightaway, in a bid to keep her disease at bay. \nBut five months later, while she was in the hospital and suffering agonizing stomach cramps, she got the urge to push. \nMoments later, she gave birth to her tumor, which was the size of a large pear. \nKnowles, who now lives in Perth, Australia, said: \u201cThe tumor grew in my womb the same way a baby would, the same hormones were produced and my pregnancy tests always came back positive.\u201d \n\u201cThere was no way I thought it was cancer, but after I started bleeding, I had further tests when I was seven weeks pregnant.\u201d \nKnowles\u2019 scan, which turned out to be gestational trophoblastic disease \n\u201cI lost all my hair and five months after starting treatment, I gave birth to the mass in the toilet,\u201d Knowles recalled. \n\u201cIt was the same size as a baby at 17 weeks, so it was a big tumor to push out with no assistance.\u201d \n\u201cI was so relieved when I saw the tumor down the toilet as I knew my ordeal was finally over.\u201d \nKnowles, now 29, was warned by doctors she may struggle to conceive again after the tumor damaged her womb. \nBut she was delighted when she became pregnant with Indi, now 10 months, a year later. \n\u201cAfter all my treatment, the light at the end of the tunnel was falling pregnant with Indi,\u201d she said. \nThe first sign something was wrong was heavy spotting, but having had the same thing when pregnant with her son Charlie, 5, Knowles wasn\u2019t too worried. \nBut it came as a huge shock to be told the baby she thought she was expecting was actually a tumor. \nKnowles said she had never heard of a molar pregnancy before her ordeal. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know what that was, so they gave me a fact sheet \u2014 as I was reading it, my heart just started to sink,\u201d she said. \n\u201cMy tumor was cancerous, so I started a low-dose chemotherapy treatment, but the tumor kept growing back.\u201d \nIt was while pushing her son Charlie on the swings in the park that Knowles realized something was wrong. \n\u201cI looked down and saw there was blood everywhere,\u201d she said. \nShe was rushed to the hospital and had six rounds of very-high-dose chemo, which caused her to lose her hair in a week. \nAfter five months of treatment, Knowles\u2019 health continued to deteriorate during April 2015. \nIt was then, after suffering severe cramps, that she ended up pushing out the mass on the toilet. \nKnowles, a full-time mom, said: \u201cI had a very strong pain in my stomach, so I got up and took my hospital drip to the toilet.\u201d \n\u201cWhen I was sitting on the toilet, I felt myself having to push and it was very painful.\u201d \n\u201cAfter the pain, I stood up and looked down the toilet and saw a massive dark mass in the pan.\u201d \n\u201cA massive sense of relief came over me \u2014 I felt so thankful that the tumor was finally out of me.\u201d \nScarred by her ordeal, while she was pregnant with Indi, Knowles was \u201cterrified\u201d she would have another molar pregnancy. \n\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to enjoy the feeling of carrying her,\u201d she said. \nBut at their first scan, Knowles\u2019 sheer relief at hearing Indi\u2019s strong heartbeat left her in floods of tears. \nIndi was born five weeks early by emergency C-section but was healthy and \u201cabsolutely perfect,\u201d Knowles said. \nShe added: \u201cI want to give people hope that even in the worst scenarios, what seems impossible is still possible while raising more awareness to molar pregnancy.\u201d Advertisements Rate this: This information is free, share with friends and family. \u2022 Reach More Than 50 Thousand Nigerians Daily, Advertise With Us, Call or Whatsapp
