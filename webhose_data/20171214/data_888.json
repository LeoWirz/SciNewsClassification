The show is based on the Lethal Weapon films which starred Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. It combines action and drama with friendship and humour as it follows classic cop duo Riggs (Clayne Crawford) and Murtaugh (Damon Wayans), who are working a crime-ridden beat in modern-day Los Angeles. Murtaugh has everything to live for, Riggs has nothing to lose, and in the series one finale, Murtaugh found out just how much Riggs was willing to sacrifice in pursuit of the drug cartel that he believes is responsible for his wife\u2019s death. \nSeries two finds the pair up to their same tricks, with Murtaugh attempting to steer clear of the demons that haunt his partner, while navigating some challenging times at home, alongside his wife, Trish (Keesha Sharp). And even though Murtaugh seeks support in Riggs, he realises their partnership is still a volatile roller coaster ride. \nWatch FOX\u2019s 10 things to know about Lethal Weapon season 1 video below: \n\nThe Lethal Weapon season two premiere is titled El Gringo Loco. Murtaugh follows Riggs down to Mexico, where he plans to avenge his wife\u2019s death and finish off Tito Flores (Danny Mora) once and for all. Once back in the States, they have a few people to answer to during the ongoing investigation around Flores, including Murtaugh\u2019s family. Meanwhile, Captain Avery (Kevin Rahm) is questioned by Internal Affairs about the integrity of his department. \nOther cast members set to return include Chandler Kinney as Riana Murtaugh, Dante Brown as Roger Murtaugh Jr., Jordana Brewster as Dr. Maureen \u2018Mo\u2019 Cahill, Michelle Mitchenor as Sonya Bailey and Johnathan Fernandez as Scorsese. \nEF Television will be covering the show with recaps and previews each week featuring clips and images from the episodes.

Jane (Jaimie Alexander) struggled with a secret from her past while the team had to try and prevent an international crisis. \nIf you\u2019re not up to date with Blindspot and like to avoid spoilers we suggest you don\u2019t read any further. \nThe previous episode also revealed that while the information about having a daughter was news to Jane, Weller (Sullivan Stapleton) had known for six months. Also we found out that what happened in Berlin was that he met Jane\u2019s daughter who is called Avery. \nThe promo trailer for episode 6 teases \u2018What else is Weller hiding?\u2019. Surely he can\u2019t have even more secrets from Jane, or can he? \nIn the promo Weller is heard to say \u2018When she finds out the truth, it will destroy her\u2019. That hints that he does indeed know more and that he\u2019s only keeping it secret as he thinks he\u2019s protecting his wife. \nWatch the Blindspot 3\u00d706 promo trailer below: \n\nHere\u2019s the official synopsis of Blindspot 3\u00d706 Adoring Suspect: \nThe team goes undercover on a movie set to stop a terrorist plot with unlikely backers. Roman blackmails Weller with a horrible secret about Jane. \nTune in to Sky Living HD at 10pm on Monday to see the episode.

It leads to causualisation of workers. This is why we must continue to fight against privatisation of our public institutions. This undeniably calls for the overhauls of our strategies to strengthen us for an integrative perspective in the industrial revolution.

Well, the verdict\u2019s in . Russia can start looking for the nearest Goodwill bin.\nThe IOC has banned Russia from the Games. Russian athletes deemed untainted by doping will be allowed to compete, but only under a neutral flag, not a Russian one. They won\u2019t wear their spiffy new uniforms, instead relegated to outfits branded with the acronym \u201cOAR,\u201d Olympic Athlete from Russia. If they win a medal, they\u2019ll hear the Olympic anthem, not Russia\u2019s. Russia\u2019s medal count at Pyeongchang can already be put into the record books: zero.\nIt\u2019s a punishment unprecedented in the history of the Olympics, and one that IOC officials said fits the unprecedented scale of Russia\u2019s cheating. It\u2019s also the right move. The ruling strives to preserve the integrity of the Olympic movement, an ideal that for years has been battered by bribery scandals, runaway commercialization, and, of course, doping. Many times we\u2019ve called upon the IOC to get tough with Russia, and this ruling has the right amount of hurt to it.\nThe impetus for the IOC\u2019s ruling Tuesday was the avalanche of evidence that Russian athletes benefited from a state-engineered doping program at the Winter Games that Russia hosted in Sochi in 2014. The cheating methodology had a whiff of le Carre . Russian athletes were given steroids stirred into either Chivas or vermouth. Russian intelligence agents helped swap out tainted urine samples with clean urine samples obtained from the athletes months earlier. The urine sample exchanges were done at night at an Olympic testing laboratory, through a small cutout in the wall.\nRussia at first denied everything, then tried to blame it all on Grigory Rodchenkov, the Russian anti-doping director who carried out the doping program at the behest of his bosses. Before the Summer Games in Rio, he blew the whistle on what happened and fled for the U.S. Since then, investigators have confirmed the allegations. A handwritten journal kept by Rodchenkov provided even more proof, the New York Times reported , and showed that the man behind the scheme was Russia\u2019s sports minister at the time, Vitaly Mutko.\nThe IOC had banned Mutko from the Games in Rio, and has since called the diary \u201csignificant evidence.\u201d Part of the IOC\u2019s ruling bans Mutko from the Olympics for life. How did the Kremlin handle Mutko after Rio? It made him deputy prime minister.\nThe IOC\u2019s decision Tuesday represents the most forceful message yet that it won\u2019t tolerate Russia\u2019s reliance on cheating to win. The Olympics\u2019 governing body could have taken one step further and banned all athletes with a Russian address, but leaving room for Russians who don\u2019t cheat is fair and appropriate. Excising Russia\u2019s national identity from the upcoming Olympics has sizable heft as a message to Moscow.\nFROM AN EDITORIAL IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.johnlecarre.com/", "http://1871.tm.zedo.com/v1/de0b1340-9167-4a0d-8f46-f1a0d7761ce3/atm.js", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/sports/olympics/russia-doping.html", "http://1871.tm.zedo.com/v1/de0b1340-9167-4a0d-8f46-f1a0d7761ce3/tm.js?data="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "grigory rodchenkov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mutko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodchenkov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vitaly mutko", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "international olympic committee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ioc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyeongchang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sochi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:07.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f846dd0b20d8c7b21541b58e4110afdd015691f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPGE0d_vEiJfpceNs.Lt.tCkGjJG5M.Wc1E9oWsuwDjaayq_qZnYYIZzE.YIsfgIF0QgQnrO_onPBygg6VmXsHpT4y.KLd9crtz9qzgP_IjI9q0D9nBFizpw--", "site_full": "www.military-technologies.net", "site": "military-technologies.net", "site_section": "http://www.military-technologies.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["table_tennis_ping_pong", "financial_news", "finance", "sports"], "section_title": "MilTech", "title": "Cynopsis Announces Webinar on Getting Maximum Impact from Experiential Marketing", "title_full": "Cynopsis Announces Webinar on Getting Maximum Impact from Experiential Marketing", "published": "2017-12-07T10:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f846dd0b20d8c7b21541b58e4110afdd015691f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPGE0d_vEiJfpceNs.Lt.tCkGjJG5M.Wc1E9oWsuwDjaayq_qZnYYIZzE.YIsfgIF0QgQnrO_onPBygg6VmXsHpT4y.KLd9crtz9qzgP_IjI9q0D9nBFizpw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rony Delucia", "published": "2017-12-07T10:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "Cynopsis Announces Webinar on Getting Maximum Impact from Experiential Marketing", "text": "Source: imported from this press release .

polling station in Bhaktapur on the outskirts of Kathmandu on December 7, 2017. Nepal\u2019s troubled south voted on December 7 in historic elections many hope will bring much-needed stability to the desperately poor country, but which have been marred by violence and fears of ethnic tension.<br />/ AFP PHOTO / PRAKASH MATHEMA \nNepal votes Thursday in the final round of historic parliamentary elections aimed at drawing a line under years of conflict and political turmoil in the Himalayan country. \nThousands of police and soldiers have been deployed in the capital Kathmandu and the volatile southern lowlands for the vote after pre-election violence that has left one dead and dozens injured. \nIt is the second phase of a watershed election for national and provincial parliaments under a new constitution that represents the culmination of the transition from feudal monarchy to federal democracy following a brutal civil war that ended 11 years ago. \n\u201cI\u2019m feeling very happy to cast a vote because it can change the future of our country, which we are expecting,\u201d said Kathmandu voter Samita Joshi. \n\u201cAs a young person I think that it will bring hope and opportunities.\u201d \nMore than 12.2 million people are eligible to vote in the elections, the first phase of which passed off peacefully last month. \nBut the south is home to a mosaic of ethnic minorities who say the constitution leaves them politically marginalised, a cause that has sparked bloody protests in recent years. \nPolitical analyst Chandra Kishor Jha said violence could return if the promises of a fairer distribution of power were not met under the new federal system. \n\u201cIf they cannot fulfil their promises then the groups that have been part of the struggle will not stay quiet. There is possibility of conflict again,\u201d he told AFP. \nThe vote will establish the country\u2019s first provincial assemblies, devolving power away from a top-heavy central government that has cycled through 10 leaders in the last 11 years. \nThe newly-elected assemblies will be tasked with naming their provinces, which are currently referred to by number, as well as choosing capitals and negotiating budgets with Kathmandu \u2014 all sensitive considerations that could rekindle tensions in the ethnically-diverse south. \n\u2013 Politically marginalised \u2013 Years of political turbulence have hampered development in the impoverished Himalayan nation, which is still recovering from a powerful earthquake that hit more than two years ago, killing 9,000 people and destroying over half a million homes. \nIt took nine years after the end of a decade-long civil war to agree to a new constitution. The charter adopted in 2015 mandated a sweeping overhaul of Nepal\u2019s political system to give greater autonomy to the provinces. \nBut it also sparked deadly protests in the south by ethnic minority groups who say it leaves them politically marginalised, and have demanded it be changed. \nThe communist CPN-UML party is expected to sweep the polls, buoyed by its alliance with the main Maoist party comprised of former rebels who fought government forces for a decade. \nBut the nationalist CPN-UML has strongly opposed amending the constitution to address the demands of ethnic minorities that it views as being more closely aligned with India. \nMany in the southern lowlands share close linguistic and cultural ties with Indians across the border. \nNepal\u2019s powerful neighbour to the south has long played the role of big brother in the landlocked country. \nBut in recent years Kathmandu has played diplomatic ping-pong with its two large neighbours, India and China, who use big-ticket infrastructure projects to vie for influence. \nCounting of ballot papers from both phases of the elections will begin once polling stations close at 5:00 pm (1115 GMT). Results are expected in the next few days.

They were in a public restroom and the man cut his hair short while the older woman destroyed his phone. There was no information on who they were but they were obviously in trouble and the woman appeared to have sustained an injury, maybe a gunshot or stab wound. \nWatch the Blindspot 3\u00d705 promo trailer below: \n\nAt the FBI, Patterson (Ashley Johnson) had been looking into the new information Jane (Jaimie Alexander) received about having a daughter that she gave up for adoption. There wasn\u2019t much to go on but the evidence seemed to suggest that it was true. Jane struggled to believe it and wanted Patterson to find more proof. Weller (Sullivan Stapleton) did his best to comfort her. \nZapata (Audrey Esparza) went to talk to Reade (Rob Brown) about why he lied to her. He said he hadn\u2019t but she revealed that she saw him leaving with Assistant Secretary of State West (Nicholas E. Calhoun). When she asked why he refused to give up the information, what is he hiding? They were interrupted when Patterson solved another tattoo. \nShe had discovered that Jane had a series of numbers and letters on her spine. As an ex-cop, Zapata recognised the format and it pointed to an evidence box from over 20 years ago. Weller and Jane decided to go and collect the box to check it out. Zapata wanted to go as well but Reade put her on paperwork duty. \u00a9 Warner Brothers Entertainment, Inc \nAt the warehouse, Weller and Jane found two Russian guys already there. When challenged they attempted to flee and burn the place down. Weller killed the guy he was chasing but Jane arrested hers. When they tracked down the box they discovered it was full of untested rape kits and Jane was furious. \nLater Patterson discovered that New York state had passed legislation to test the backlog of untested kits. They conclude that the Russians must have been trying to destroy evidence that implicated someone powerful in a crime. \nPatterson was also handed some new evidence related to Stuart\u2019s murder. The Coastguard had recovered his phone on the shores of the Hudson. Patterson was excited to see if should could extract any information until Reade suspiciously told her not to spend too long on it. Reade definitely knows more than he\u2019s letting on. \u00a9 Warner Brothers Entertainment, Inc \nWeller and Jane interrogated the Russian they captured but he refused to cooperate. Weller tried a bluff that more of his friends had been captured and were willing to help. It worked and he gave up the bank details of how he got paid for the job. \nThe evidence led to show that King Ivan of Kazarus, who died recently, had raped a woman named Yasmine. Her son Vanya was the rightful heir to the throne but the King\u2019s brother wanted him dead. \nPatterson discovered that Vanya was a student at NYU, and Zapata had evidence that they were on the run. Congressman Matthew Weitz (Aaron Abrams) turned up and gave extra info on King Ivan. Patterson worked out that Vanya had a girlfriend and intercepted a message between the pair. This let her identify Vanya\u2019s location. \u00a9 Warner Brothers Entertainment, Inc \nWeller and Jane went to investigate and explained to Vanya that they were there to help and protect them. They got his mother to a hospital but the hitmen after them turned up. Weller and Jane killed some of them before managing to flee with Vanya and his mother. The hitmen used a spike trap to stop their car and then launched an assault. Weller and Jane managed to fight the hitmen off. They took Vanya and his mother to the FBI. \nElsewhere in the episode, Roman (Luke Mitchell) contacted Jane to taunt her some more about the baby. He hummed a tune he said she used to sing and it jogged Jane\u2019s memory of it being true. Jane had the FBI try and trace the call. He told her that their mother Shepherd had made her give it up and her highschool boyfriend was the father. He hung up before the call could be traced. Jane told Weller she needed answers from Shepherd. \nPatterson spoke to Zapata to tell her that she couldn\u2019t find anything on Stuart\u2019s phone. Zapata suggested they bluff about finding something to try and draw out whoever was covering it up. Patterson agreed. \u00a9 Warner Brothers Entertainment, Inc \nThey planted fake data from the phone on one of the servers. Patterson got a hit that someone was accessing it. When she investigated the evidence pointed at Reade logging on and deleting the data. Further investigation showed that someone had used Reade\u2019s login from a computer within the FBI when he was out of the office. More analysis revealed that it looked like Director Eleanor Hirst (Mary Stuart Masterson) trying to frame Reade. They took it to Reade but he didn\u2019t want to hear it. \nWeitz reported to the team that King Ivan\u2019s brother had been executed and that the region was destabilised. The region wanted the rightful heir, Vanya, back to lead. Weller and Jane spoke to him and he said he wanted to try and make things better for people. \nAt the end of the episode, Jane decided she didn\u2019t want to find her daughter as it could ruin her life. A flashback to six months earlier revealed what happened in Berlin. Weller was there looking for Jane and found a young girl named Avery who was also looking for her. When he asked her how she knew Jane she told him that Jane was her mother. It looks like Weller is playing a dangerous game keeping secrets from Jane. \nLet us know your thoughts on Blindspot season 3 so far in the comments below. \nBlindspot season 3 continues Mondays at 10pm on Sky Living.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yasmine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blindspot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivan of kazarus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary stuart masterson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew weitz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sullivan stapleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashley johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eleanor hirst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaimie alexander", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patterson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shepherd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron abrams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inc  weller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weitz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "audrey esparza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zapata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicholas e. calhoun", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "state west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warner brothers entertainment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shepherd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hudson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reade", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:08.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "805e21457ad94124d696a83108c5282269d48013", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUYnYX.EWCvSktGXgTgjHhmKpughZLW7B0SXJiT2gFdsRW1C1yIJVhIRgCvXMp9NDniT1EUsfeyRpQBH2_m5vqO", "site_full": "nalert.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://nalert.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Newsalert", "title": "Bitcoin Blasts Through $15,000", "title_full": "Bitcoin Blasts Through $15,000", "published": "2017-12-07T12:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "805e21457ad94124d696a83108c5282269d48013", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUYnYX.EWCvSktGXgTgjHhmKpughZLW7B0SXJiT2gFdsRW1C1yIJVhIRgCvXMp9NDniT1EUsfeyRpQBH2_m5vqO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Steve Bartin (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Bitcoin Blasts Through $15,000", "text": "Bitcoin Blasts Through $15,000 https://t.co/iPlvIgTv4s \n\u2014 zerohedge (@zerohedge) December 7, 2017 \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:08.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b60590fe9b4ce1e7f2524a693a8950fe33c7c35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROWjYmaxKpXA_oJsy06NUqWJ3FixknpxAp6JcbKOprlP_bOkhoSFHUm5hPFShWJquXlk5mkN31AN9K3O9TStqNUJP.WWvZyeO0NAkeHigMlOW", "site_full": "www.telegram.com", "site": "telegram.com", "site_section": "http://www.telegram.com/living?template=JSON&mime=json&c=25&start=1", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "'A Taffeta Christmas' at Calliope 8-10", "title_full": "'A Taffeta Christmas' at Calliope Dec. 8-10 -

Mutual fund companies often party with third-party distributors with various fees and provisions involved with the partnership. BREAKING DOWN 'Third-Party Distributor' \nA third-party distributor partners with an investment company to sell mutual funds. Third-party distributors typically have comprehensive domestic and international sales teams in place to distribute the investment company\u2019s mutual funds. Distributors also have a broad sales network and expertise in mutual fund distribution. \nThere are numerous fees associated with partnerships between third party distributors and mutual fund companies. The distributor usually receives sales charge commissions for selling the investment company\u2019s mutual funds as well as a portion of the trailer fees associated with the fund. A mutual fund\u2019s operational fees will also include a marketing expense paid to the distributor. A 12B-1 fee is the primary fund fee associated with the marketing and distribution of the fund. The 12B-1 fee is an annual marketing and distribution fee paid to the distributor Role of Third-Party Distributor \nThird-party distribution partnership agreements vary across the industry. Many third-party distributors also provide a range of services that support mutual funds. \nAs a distributor, the firm works with the investment company to build a marketing plan for distribution of the mutual fund. Third-party distributors typically employee distribution representatives with global distribution networks. They can be responsible for selling individual funds and working with brokerages to ensure the distribution of funds through electronic brokerage trading platforms. \nIn some cases, a company may build its own third-party distribution unit to partner with the investment company for distribution of mutual funds. Independent distributors also exist with a range of service offerings for mutual fund companies. Examples of Third Party Distributors \nEaton Vance and Vanguard are two mutual fund companies who have built distribution units for selling mutual funds. Eaton Vance Distributors serves as the distributor for Eaton Vance mutual funds. The Vanguard Marketing Corporation is the distributor for the Vanguard mutual funds. \nALPS Distributors is one of the mutual fund industry\u2019s leading independent distributors. ALPS provides distribution and broker dealer services for a wide range of mutual fund companies. Its clients range from startups to large, well-established fund companies. It has expertise in distributing a wide range of product types including open-end funds , closed-end funds, unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds and private placements.

Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama for The Washington Post and The New York Times. Today, he regularly covers Trump as the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times.\nBaker visited the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library on Wednesday for a book signing and guest talk. His newest book details Obama\u2019s time in the White House. He said covering Obama is starkly different from covering Trump.\n\u201cBoth presidents are interesting in different ways,\u201d Baker said. \u201cIf Trump is the guy who doesn\u2019t hold anything back, then Obama is the guy who doesn\u2019t show us a lot.\u201d\nWhile previous presidents stuck to daily agendas, Baker said Trump\u2019s Twitter communications are unpredictable.\n\u201cFrom a journalist\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s great because we have a window into his mindset that we\u2019ve never had with any of his predecessors, but it also means that you never know where the news is going to go,\u201d Baker said.\nTrump created unexpected headlines by calling Jerusalem the capital of Israel on Wednesday. Baker, who has covered the Middle East extensively and was the first American newspaper journalist to report from rebel-held northern Afghanistan after 9/11, explained that this is the first time a U.S. president has declared this. Trump\u2019s statement could create more tensions in the region, Baker said.\n\u201cBoth the Israeli and Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital,\u201d Baker said. \u201cJust declaring Jerusalem the capital without saying anything about what Palestinians may do is a very volatile act.\u201d\nBut within the White House, Baker said, tensions have also grown with the FBI investigation about the Trump administration\u2019s ties to Russia. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security advisor, plead guilty of lying to FBI investigators. Baker, who has also previously written about Putin and Russia, said this could be a turning point in the months-long investigation.\n\u201cA guilty plea by a national security advisor is a big deal,\u201d Baker said.\nBaker said the news has definitely shaken up the White House.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a paranoid atmosphere,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThere are White House aides that will tell you they are worried their colleagues are wearing wires.\u201d\nDealing with the dramatic Russia investigation and political polarization may prevent the White House and Washington, D.C., from addressing policy issues like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Baker said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think President Trump wants DACA to go away,\u201d Baker said. \u201cI think he would just assume there would be a law he can sign that puts a DACA-type program into place, but the Democrats and Republicans aren\u2019t working very well together right now.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s critiques of news-media, including The New York Times, have become well-known. But Baker said past presidents have also disliked journalists\u2019 coverage of the White House.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our job to be popular,\u201d Baker said. \u201cBut you know, in the end, I\u2019m not worried about name-calling. \u2026 Our job is to be professional, independent observers and reporters.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter baker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael flynn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george w. bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyndon b. johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york times white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deferred action for childhood arrivals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump\u2019s twitter communications", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:08.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d15875bc4231a37e5422c22de8449f427875a93e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8mlMJfaioPfS.8die_lFIAAreTpPYkM_N149.Jk3eUkhRiY5KxmB7MqaRtdIRbfkOrVym6bFxEcmLROR66zkh5ydxPARMVm7MhrWpgVJTA1IaHXNv9gmAAI3mAcHkmUtI-", "site_full": "www.entertainment-focus.com", "site": "entertainment-focus.com", "site_section": "http://www.entertainment-focus.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Entertainment Focus", "title": "Chase Rice Borderline London live review", "title_full": "Chase Rice Borderline London live review", "published": "2017-12-06T15:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.entertainment-focus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chasericefeat2017oct.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d15875bc4231a37e5422c22de8449f427875a93e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8mlMJfaioPfS.8die_lFIAAreTpPYkM_N149.Jk3eUkhRiY5KxmB7MqaRtdIRbfkOrVym6bFxEcmLROR66zkh5ydxPARMVm7MhrWpgVJTA1IaHXNv9gmAAI3mAcHkmUtI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Laura Cooney", "published": "2017-12-06T15:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "Chase Rice Borderline London live review", "text": "Chase Rice Borderline London live review 0 Shares Broken Bow Records 0 Shares \nIt\u2019s safe to say that Chase Rice has been on a bit of a rollercoaster ride over the last few years. After shooting to fame following an appearance on Survivor, co-writing Florida Georgia Line\u2019s monster hit Cruise and scoring a number one album with 2014\u2019s Ignite The Night, he split with his label and moved away from the \u2018bro-country\u2019 tag. Now he\u2019s back with his first album in three years, Lambs And Lions, and has made the trip over to the UK to play a series of sold-out shows. \nRice walked on stage to huge cheers and, after a few minutes waiting to get his guitar, launched into Do It Like This from Ignite The Night. The song\u2019s driving rocky rhythm worked nicely with the gravelly edge to his voice and he showed that he\u2019s a decent guitar player too. Right from the off he was joking with the crowd and had them completely in the palm of his hand as they sang along to every single word. He then went into How She Rolls, with its quick lyrical delivery and good imagery that highlighted his skills as a songwriter. \nThroughout the set Rice mixed songs from across his career, with an early focus on the party tracks. He consistently encouraged the audience to join in \u2013 not that they needed it! \u2013 and came across as very relaxed on stage, regularly breaking off to chat about his experience of touring the UK. I also liked his decision to perform \u2018just him and a guitar\u2019 as it gave a different spin to those songs, such as bringing out the rockier aspects on 50 Shades Of Crazy and a stripped-back version of Gonna Wanna Tonight that allowed the richness in his voice to come through. \nHowever I felt Rice really shone in the slower numbers. In particular he showed great control in the emotional Three Chords And The Truth, brought out his gentler, sweeter side on Eyes On You and showed some serious vocal power on Carolina Can. It\u2019s clear these songs mean a lot to him and I felt that they worked really well in the intimate setting of the Borderline. \nRice finished the performance with his version of Cruise, adding a soulful yet still rocky edge to the song, before going into a rock-and-roll influenced take on Ready Set Roll. After rapturous applause from the audience and demands for one more song, he came back out to perform Everybody We Know Does. The simple arrangement allowed his voice to really stand out and he hit some huge notes towards the end! \nOverall I enjoyed Rice\u2019s show but wasn\u2019t quite as blown away as I\u2019d expected to be. I\u2019d been interested to see how he would balance the different styles of his two previous albums and think that an acoustic solo set was a great way to do that. However, I felt we only got flashes of the more mature, personal side of him that comes through on Lambs And Lions, and I would have liked to see more of that. He repeatedly promised to come back to the UK next year with a full band show though, so I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll get to hear some more of those songs then. That said, he had strong vocals and great stage presence, as well as keeping the crowd\u2019s energy up throughout and ultimately put on an excellent show. It won\u2019t be long before he\u2019s selling out much bigger venues here so I\u2019d recommend catching him when he\u2019s back next year. \n\nSet list: 1. Do It Like This 2.

Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test Associated Press Thursday, December 07, 2017 Credit: The Associated Press In this Nov. 21, 2017 photo provided by the Montefiore Health System, Dr. Tova Koenigsberg at The Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York shows an example of a traditional mammogram scan. U.S. health officials are beginning a huge study to compare traditional mammograms with 3-D versions, to see if the newer choice might really improve screening for breast cancer. (Montefiore Health System via AP) comments WASHINGTON \u2014 A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray \u2014 and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer.\nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year?\nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat \u2014 overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment.\nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms \u2014 known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" \u2014 with standard two-dimensional digital mammography.\nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers.\n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most.\nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices.\n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\"\nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM?\nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.)\nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40.\nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram.\nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening.\nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS?\nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2014 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer.\nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts.\nHOW TO DECIDE?\nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer.\nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image.\nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2014 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2014 that overdiagnosis problem.\nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost.\nTHE NEW STUDY\nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year.\nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare.
