joined UNESCO\u2019s list of \u2018intangible heritage\u2019. \u2013 AFP photo \nNaples\u2019 pizza twirling joined UNESCO\u2019s list of \u201cintangible heritage\u201d Thursday, securing the coveted status alongside a host of cultural treasures including a Saudi art form traditionally practised only by women. \nThe art of \u2018pizzaiuolo\u2019\u2014 which has been handed down for generations in the southern Italian city \u2014 was given the nod by the UN cultural body\u2019s World Heritage Committee, who met on the South Korean island of Jeju. \nIt comes after some two million people joined a petition to support Naples\u2019 application, according to Sergio Miccu, head of the Association of Neapolitan Pizzaiuoli \u2014 no doubt buoyed by his offer of complimentary pizza if the age-old culinary tradition joined the prestigious list. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll be giving out free pizza in the streets,\u201d Miccu earlier told AFP. \nThe custom goes far beyond the pizzaiuolo\u2019s spectacular handling of the dough \u2014 hurling it into the air in order to \u201coxygenate\u201d it \u2014 to include songs and stories that have turned pizza-making into a time-honoured social ritual. \n\u201cVictory!\u201d Maurizio Martina, Italy\u2019s minister for agriculture, food and forestry, wrote on Twitter. \u201cAnother step towards the protection of Italy\u2019s food and wine heritage.\u201d \nAlfonso Pecoraro Scanio, a former agriculture minister who attended the proceedings in Jeju, said in a video posted on Twitter: \u201cLong live the art of Neapolitan pizzzaiuolo!\u201d \nThirty-four candidates were seeking to join the list of intangible heritage, created in 2003 mainly to raise awareness, although UNESCO also sometimes offers financial or technical support to countries struggling to protect their traditions. \nThe list already included more than 350 traditions, art forms and practices from Spain\u2019s flamenco dancing to Indonesian batik fabrics, to more obscure entries such as a Turkish oil wrestling festival and the Mongolian coaxing ritual for camels. \nSaudi Arabia was among those celebrating on Jeju, claiming the tag for Al-Qatt Al-Asin \u2014 elaborate interior wall paintings traditionally done by women. The art, which promotes solidarity among women, is handed down through observation. \nBangladesh claimed victory with its tradition of Shital Pati, an intricate weaving craft using strips of green cane to produce mats and bedspreads. \nAnother winner was the traditional horseback game of Kok Boru in Kyrgyzstan, where players score points by putting a goat\u2019s carcass in an opponent\u2019s goal \u2014 though modern day games now replace the dead animal with a mould. \nAn array of traditions struggling to survive will also be given special support after being placed on an \u201curgent safeguarding list\u201d. \nThese include a whistled language that developed in Turkey as a way to communicate across steep mountains and rugged topography but is now being threatened by mobile phones. \nMorocco will also get help to protect Taskiwin \u2014 a martial dance that developed in the western High Atlas mountain range and involves shaking one\u2019s shoulders to the rhythm of tambourines and flutes. \nUNESCO said globalisation and young people\u2019s rejection of traditional heritage had driven the practice \u201ccloser to oblivion\u201d. \u2013 AFP Share this", "highlightText": "",

Its defining feature is a military expansion, ordered by the United States president and conducted by the Pentagon. Underlying it is Trump\u2019s fusion of elements from the strategy of his two predecessors, George W Bush and Barack Obama. A recent, low-profile Pentagon document  gives  a hint of the US\u2019s current projection of military power: The U.S. has 8,892 forces in Iraq, 15,298 troops in Afghanistan and 1,720 in Syria, for a total of 25,910 troops serving in the three war zones as of Sept. 30, according to DoD. The figures were released to the public Nov. 17 as part of DoD\u2019s quarterly count of active duty, Reserve, Guard and civilian personnel assigned by country by the Defense Manpower Data Center\u201d (see Tara Copp, \u201c 26,000 troops total. .\u201d,  Military Times , 27 November 2017). The total figure alone is much higher than previous numbers. But by itself, it is misleading in that the United States Defense Department normally excludes two further categories of troops: those rotating for short periods and, of far  greater  significance, many of the  special forces . These are waging much of the combat in all three theatres \u2013 Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. That means the true number is probably close to, or even over, 30,000. To this could be added troops involved in operations across the Sahel, Somalia or Yemen. A new era is opening almost by stealth. Its defining feature is a military expansion, ordered by the United States president and conducted by the Pentagon. Such indicators give only part of the picture. Another is a Pentagon request for $143 million to expand its operations at the Azraq base in the Jordanian desert, the largest single overseas financial  commitment  now being considered. This base has been key to operations in Syria and Iraq, and been used by other states including the Netherlands and Belgium. So just as the  wars  in Iraq and Syria are supposed to be winding down after ISIS\u2019s much-vaunted defeat, t he  Pentagon  wants to go the other way and prepare for yet more conflict in the region. A growth in overseas bases, such as a huge one for surveillance drones costing $100 million in  Niger , fits the trend. All this must be seen in the  perspective  of the sixteen years of \u201cwar on terror.\u201d  Again, troop numbers are a signal if not the whole story. In 2007-08, at the height of George W Bush\u2019s campaigns, close to 200,000 US troops were in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even as Barack Obama started to withdraw troops from Iraq, he was \u201csurging\u201d them in Afghanistan: an extra 30,000 troops by 2011 took the US total in that country to around 100,000. That short-term policy failed in its aim of forcing the Taliban to the negotiating table, and most troops had been withdrawn by the end of his second term in 2012. In parallel, Obama was moving rapidly towards \u201c remote warfare \u201c. This relied much more on strike-aircraft, armed-drones, and special forces \u2013 all involving far fewer \u201cboots on the ground\u201d. Now, the Trump wars era  brings  a reconfiguration: plenty of remote warfare and far more military personnel abroad. Bush was all about crushing al-Qaida and similar groups, as well as regime termination; Obama  moved  more towards \u201cshadow wars\u201d at a much lower intensity, if still controversial. Trump, in combining these, is going back to the future. \nThe Egyptian parallel \nPresident Donald Trump greets Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi as he arrives at the White House, Monday, April 3, 2017, in Washington. (AP/Andrew Harnik) Destroy your opponents; forget the sixteen years of failed wars; do not try to understand where these enemies are coming from, and why they retain support. If these tenets guide Trump\u2019s  approach , Abdel Fattah al-Sisi\u2019s regime has followed them in Egypt\u2019s  arena . The Trump wars era brings a reconfiguration: plenty of remote warfare and far more military personnel abroad. Since al-Sisi became president after ousting Mohamed Morsi\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood  government  in 2013, his forces have pursued a tough line against any kind of religious-based dissent. The Islamist-linked rebellion in northern Sinai was a prime target. The terrible attack on the Al-Rawda mosque in northern Sinai on 24 November, which killed 305 people, is the latest  incident  in this escalating conflict. The immediate  response  to the massacre was air-raids by strike-aircraft, which the insurgents would have expected and taken precautions against. But the problems in Sinai go much  deeper  than al-Sisi\u2019s policies, damaging as these are. This part of Egypt has long been neglected and marginalized. Its younger men are particularly angry that the oil and tourism industries  bring  local communities little or no benefit. Thus, the now dispersed ISIS leadership see al-Sisi\u2019s Egypt in general and Sinai in particular as fertile ground. For the movement, Cairo\u2019s policy of hardline suppression could  hardly  be better. An objective view of Sinai\u2019s recent decades suggests that the chances of Sisi\u2019s approach working are close to zero. So the comparison works in reverse . For al-Sisi, read Trump \u2013 on a much bigger scale. This may still be an early stage of the Trump wars era. An increase in the worst excesses of the post-9/11, such as rendition and torture, can be expected as problems multiply. Clear indications of new thinking remain scarce. \u201cLiddism\u201d still rules. It is better to be prepared for the long haul. \nPaul Rogers  is a professor in the  department of peace studies  at Bradford University, northern England.

At any stage of their development they pose a threat to the safety of individuals they target. As fascism gains momentum it becomes a threat to society in general. If national leaders open the doors of political power to fascists, disaster results. Authoritarian nationalists, like those currently in charge of the United States federal government, may ultimately support fascists if they believe doing so will benefit their political position. Fascism must be fought with strategic consideration to effectively disrupt fascist organizing and disrupt fascist narratives. \nFascism is a particular kind of violent authoritarianism. It promises a radical transformation of society based on particular national and racial symbols, mass mobilization against internal and external enemies, the command of a charismatic leader who gained his position through struggle, and a violent vanguard. Fascists\u2019 enemies are those they blame for weakening their concept of the nation. They typically say the nation is weakened by class conflict associated with socialists, by individualism associated with liberals, and by internationalism associated with both. Fascist movements find some combination of political minorities to target, whether they be Slavic, Jewish, black, or LGBT people. Fascists usually present their nation or race as the victim of a serious injustice that can be redeemed through some kind of conquest. Fascism can be described, as Hitler did, as National Socialism. The word \u201cnational\u201d is an important modifier, as fascist solidarity is neither rooted in economic class nor international in nature, but is instead exclusively national and designed to cut across class lines and embrace hierarchy. In power, fascists keep intact the economic elites whose politics and ethnicity they can accept, and make few changes to property relations. \nUnder fascism, the individual has no liberties and is totally subordinate to the dominant community. Some individuals will have the opportunity to substitute their lost liberty with a sense of personal empowerment gained by participating in fascist violence and domination. For others, the role of enemy is assigned to them. With a totalitarian spirit, fascism seeks to invade and control spaces of private activity that it does not suppress. Typically it prescribes relatively strict roles for men and women of the nation. Always, fascism is against democratic government, and it only uses parliamentarians as allies when they are useful in consolidating power. Usually passion and will, especially as embodied by the leader, are emphasized over intellect and reason. Despite its propaganda of order and precision, fascism is disorderly and violent. \nIn European history, conservative political elites, attempting to gain mass support and keep the political left out of power, helped fascists come into national leadership. A fascist movement with the momentum of success is always a political threat, because fascists will attempt to create the conditions in which political power will be made available to them. Fascist movements without political power are still public safety threats, as they will build their organization through violence against marginalized people.[1] \nWe should not pretend that a movement based on committing recognized crimes against humanity is just another political movement in the marketplace of ideas. We should not expect that people who join a movement with a history of violence at its core want to hold peaceful rallies. We should not accept the pretensions of caring for free speech from people who routinely threaten critics , deny access to the tools of free speech to outspoken women and people of color, and cheer for those who murder opponents . Fascists use the tools of free expression to attack the freedom of expression of their opponents, whether with threats of violence, swarms that render social media difficult to use, or violent actions committed by people gathered under cover of a political rally. \nFascists invaded Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017. They opened with a torchlight rally, where they chanted slogans lifted from Nazi Germany as well as their own anti-Semitic slogans. When they encountered actual peaceful demonstrators they struck them with torches, spilling lighter fluid on them . The next day, fascists launched a gang assault on a black man before being chased away and threatened clergy people taking a peaceful stand before antifa drove them off . After a fascist sped his car into a crowd like an ISIS terrorist, the excuses came out, as did celebrations of the murder of Heather Heyer , complete with the misogyny that often accompanies such displays of lacking virtue . When fascist organizing is effectively disrupted, it becomes more difficult for fascists to commit violence. \nThe reason fascism must be treated differently than other forms of tyranny is the centrality of violence to the fascist project. While it would be a disaster if authoritarian communism, for example, took national political power, communists are less likely to rely on violent movement building, and communist regimes did exist for decades while doing things that did not center around totalitarian violence. Communist governments killed millions of innocent people, but Soviet arms also blocked genocides. It is also highly unlikely that authoritarian communism would get close to political power in the United States any time soon. \nIt is worth noting that authoritarian communists have not been the most reliable allies against fascism. The USSR and the international Communist movement were important, though meddlesome, allies to the Spanish Republic in its fight against fascism, and the Soviet people fought relentlessly after Nazi Germany invaded their country in 1941. However, in 1939 Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , effectively making Communists loyal to Stalin temporary friends of Nazi Germany. The Pact enabled Hitler to begin his race war in Eastern Europe and even divided the spoils of conquest between the two countries. [2] In the early postwar Soviet Union, the anti-Semitic term \u201c rootless cosmopolitan \u201d was a powerful label used by the regime, which sounds more than a little reminiscent of the authoritarian right\u2019s railing against \u201cglobalists\u201d who are predominantly Jews. \nFascism\u2019s position must be located relative to authoritarian nationalism. Although Donald Trump encourages fascists and has employed fascists like Stephen Bannon and Sebastian Gorka , he himself has not organized a genuine fascist movement. His administration can be characterized as kleptocratic authoritarian nationalism that feeds on bigotry that it encourages. \nVladimir Putin\u2019s government is perhaps a model of kleptocratic authoritarian nationalism. While Russian authorities are soft on vigilantes and Cossacks taking matters into their own hands, and a motorcycle gang with ties to Putin sometimes operates as paramilitaries or propagandists, Putin does not have an official paramilitary force as a true fascist would, and it appears that he would rather have a population acquiescent than mobilized. Russian government agents promote fascist activity in the West, even pushing fascist narratives on social media, but Putin must publicly distance himself from anyone soft on the symbolism of Nazi Germany. \nOne could say that there is a spectrum of authoritarian nationalism with Trump at one end and Hitler at the other, but it is more instructive to see them as two distinct movements with an important relationship. This is a crucial distinction to make. The authoritarian nationalism of Trump has already caused massive damage to political culture in the United States and by itself poses a greater threat to marginalized people than presidential administrations of recent history. Trumpism must not sink deep roots into society. At the same time, it would be dangerous if outright fascism became more associated with the currently dominant force in the Republican Party. This becomes more obvious as fascists try to present themselves as \u201cnormie\u201d Trump supporters, and portray anti-fascists as out to beat up anyone who voted for Trump. While Trump appropriates the style and language of fascism and his politics helps fascism grow, he has not fully embraced fascism \u2013 at least not at this time. He has not created a paramilitary vanguard that answers to the leader and his ideals of national renewal do not reach as far into personal life as true fascists would. \nA well-functioning republican government should be able to fend off a fascist movement, but authorities cannot be trusted to fight fascism on their own. As Mussolini\u2019s fascist movement was gaining strength, some local police and military commanders provided arms and vehicles to his squads, and sometimes police officers even joined their raids. [3] In more recent times, there is abundant evidence that Golden Dawn, Greece\u2019s fascist movement, draws a disproportionate level of support from police officers . \nFascists in Italy and Germany needed to make alliances with political elites to gain access to national leadership.[4] While one could argue that this makes it important to not offend political elites at times of crisis with further disruptions, a more valuable lesson is that it is important that elites are shown that the public will tolerate no alliance with fascism, that the public has the means and will to prevent such an alliance from being effective, and that fascists will not bring about any order in society. \nA fascist movement gaining momentum will continue to create disorder and use bold lies to blame violence on its adversaries. When fascists do not face effective opposition, they look like the winning side. Mass action may be needed to embolden people resisting fascism and to create political, social, and economic consequences for those who enable fascism. At the critical moment, if the authorities fail or refuse to suppress fascist violence, a popular mobilization must be ready to defeat fascism. \nIt is important to not feed the narrative that fascists create. To say \u201cdon\u2019t give them attention\u201d is mistaken. It is not attention that fascists crave, but power. The marginalized people that fascists attack will not be able to ignore them and without an attentive public fascists can become the enforcers of unscrupulous authorities. \nFascists like attention when it means they can demonstrate power. When they face consequences for their actions, they do not like it. Giving fascists attention does not always mean giving them power. Supporting the narrative they want makes them powerful. Not mounting an effective opposition makes them powerful. \nWhen thousands marched in Boston against fascists on August 19, it was clear who was the powerful side. However, not two weeks later, fascists and their sympathizers rallied in Berkeley, and despite the thousands who rallied against them, the authoritarian right managed to score a public relations win primarily by manipulating the narrative on social media. Their narrative was then picked up by mainstream media and pundits. Unfortunately, it appears that many American pundits are more ready to believe that antifa will beat up random people they don\u2019t like the look of than it is for them to believe that actual fascists are marching in the street and targeting people for violence. [5] \nWhen no pretext for fascist violence can be found, fascists and their propagandists will not hesitate to invent one. World War II began with the Nazis creating a fake Polish attack to justify their invasion.[6] The propagandists of the authoritarian right have made up stories about anti-fascists, including fake plans to stab Trump supporters, and a fake assault on a woman in Berkeley. They have also tried to portray rioting crowds of authoritarians as if they were peaceful protesters. \nAnti-fascists should be prepared to counter fascist narratives, including by the use of social media actions. The general public should acknowledge that social media has been weaponized by authoritarians and accept responsibility for checking and curating content in their feeds. Journalists should recognize the danger of false equivalencies and uncritical reporting. \nIt is important to build formal and informal organizations to occupy the political space that fascism wishes to capture. A focus on inclusive community building, including organizations with a militant defensive stance, can remove some of the draw from far-right organizations that support fascists. It is also valuable for some anti-fascists to be receptive \u2013 but very cautiously so \u2013 to people who defect from fascist organizations. \nAnti-fascists should be proud. We may claim liberty as our heritage and anti-fascism as part of that history. \nFor radicals, the anti-fascist heritage can be found among the proud fighters in the hills of Spain and Italy, battling fascism in the time of its rising. American anti-fascists can look to the army of black and white soldiers of the Civil War era that became a force of liberation for the former slaves in its path, many of whom would put on its uniform and pick up a rifle. We can see how the gains made in the army\u2019s wake were battled by the partisans of the Confederacy, some of whom would ride in white uniforms and hoods and become a proto-fascist movement, and we can see how the fight has continued . For many of us, we can boast that our grandparents fought fascists across Europe and there is no way we are going to let a bunch of Nazis terrorize our streets. \nRegardless of our relatives or birthplace, we can look to the heroes who fought against fascism and to the casualties and survivors who must have wondered what else was possible. We can examine the people who bear guilt for the crimes of history and the people who tried to look the other way. We can see all this and declare where we will stand. The defense of inclusive liberty, reason, and the space needed to improve society is an important mission for those who wish to see a greater future. \nAn effective defense against fascism includes holding massive street rallies, organizing defensive formations, engaging in information warfare, exposing known fascists and fascist violence, providing other paths for disaffected people, strengthening the resolve of the general public to oppose fascism, and blocking fascists from opportunities for political power. It is a massive undertaking with multiple roles. It\u2019s fully justified by the threat posed by fascism at all levels of its political development. It is urgent and requires broad participation at a time when fascists have openings to power, as people in power are conspicuously lacking in their opposition to fascism and conspicuously disdainful of the restraints that liberal democracy would place on the exercise of authority. \nNotes and References: \n[1] Examining the actions of fascists is the best way to understand fascism.

View Full Text Single-arm trials can leave you hanging Depending on the study restraints and goals, not all clinical trials include a randomized placebo group. This is often done to minimize risk to patients but can also impair interpretation of the results. When Sneller et al . embarked on their therapeutic HIV vaccine trial, they chose to include a placebo group to get a better understanding of how their vaccine affected viral rebound upon therapy interruption. The vaccine itself generated minimal T cell activation and did not induce protective responses. Somewhat surprisingly, a proportion of individuals in the placebo arm demonstrated sustained viral suppression, although they were no longer being treated. These results suggest that any future HIV intervention trials would benefit from the inclusion of a placebo arm. Abstract Despite substantial clinical benefits, complete eradication of HIV has not been possible using antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone. Strategies that can either eliminate persistent viral reservoirs or boost host immunity to prevent rebound of virus from these reservoirs after discontinuation of ART are needed; one possibility is therapeutic vaccination. We report the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a therapeutic vaccine regimen in patients in whom ART was initiated during the early stage of HIV infection and whose immune system was anticipated to be relatively intact. The objectives of our study were to determine whether the vaccine was safe and could induce an immune response that would maintain suppression of plasma viremia after discontinuation of ART. Vaccinations were well tolerated with no serious adverse events but produced only modest augmentation of existing HIV-specific CD4 + T cell responses, with little augmentation of CD8 + T cell responses. Compared with placebo, the vaccination regimen had no significant effect on the kinetics or magnitude of viral rebound after interruption of ART and no impact on the size of the HIV reservoir in the CD4 + T cell compartment. Notably, 26% of subjects in the placebo arm exhibited sustained suppression of viremia (<400 copies/ml) after treatment interruption, a rate of spontaneous suppression higher than previously reported. Our findings regarding the degree and kinetics of plasma viral rebound after ART interruption have potentially important implications for the design of future trials testing interventions aimed at achieving ART-free control of HIV infection.
