I felt bad for architects that were highly educated, with subsequent loans, and working a lot of overtime but not being compensated for it.\nI'll stick with IT, even though that has its own issues.\nIt sucks that this may be happening in farming, which isn't a 'sexy' industry like architecture or film, but our greater society as a whole seems more cutthroat and bargain-driven these days.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:38.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "026878033d0725fd1e841dfd07e9db712bcbfc9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vICvFC2R3yo5rYLKcsHvc4YxkSLJkokbcspO0OvBF_GL1IFnfAfbPGG7Zv8dspuPxK4QRgFX99z_5Wug4QU0DjdwqGiG4zdW.FrS1DrkI.PIrjU_UwfXe6okVfOutGTaZAICuIqn1c6atE_ukVUTrlAiOj9j1UsbLXX8YxuiLIg--", "site_full": "www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk", "site": "wiltsglosstandard.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/uk_national_news/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "business", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard | National News", "title": "Scout Association-linked Gilwell Oak named UK\u2019s tree of the year", "title_full": "Scout Association-linked Gilwell Oak named UK\u2019s tree of the year", "published": "2017-12-07T09:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/resources/images/7151197/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "026878033d0725fd1e841dfd07e9db712bcbfc9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vICvFC2R3yo5rYLKcsHvc4YxkSLJkokbcspO0OvBF_GL1IFnfAfbPGG7Zv8dspuPxK4QRgFX99z_5Wug4QU0DjdwqGiG4zdW.FrS1DrkI.PIrjU_UwfXe6okVfOutGTaZAICuIqn1c6atE_ukVUTrlAiOj9j1UsbLXX8YxuiLIg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "Scout Association-linked Gilwell Oak named UK\u2019s tree of the year", "text": "Scout Association-linked Gilwell Oak named UK\u2019s tree of the year Gilwell Oak was named Tree of the Year (Woodland Trust/PA) 0 comments \nAn oak deeply rooted in the folklore of the Scouting movement has been crowned the UK\u2019s tree of the year. \nThe Gilwell Oak, which sits in the heart of Gilwell Park in Epping, Essex, beat off competition from across the country to win the coveted Woodland Trust prize. \nScout Association founder Robert Bayden Powell championed the tree in 1929 as a metaphor for the growth of the youth organisation. \nIt was eulogised as a lesson to young scouts that big things are possible from modest beginnings, according to the group. \nChief scout Bear Grylls hailed the victorious oak as an \u201cunbending symbol\u201d of the Scouts\u2019 desire to \u201cchange the world for the better\u201d. \nWith 26% of 7,000 votes cast by the public, it conquered 10 contenders in the English tree of the year category \u2013 including Parliament Oak in Nottinghamshire, where King John is thought to have summoned Parliament in the 13th century. \nIn a showdown with the finest trees of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the Gilwell Oak again triumphed, following deliberations by a panel of experts. \nIt will now serve as the UK\u2019s candidate for the European Tree of the Year contest, due to be held in 2018. \nBear Grylls, the renowned survival expert who is currently the association\u2019s chief scout, said: \u201cThe Gilwell Oak has been the backdrop to hundreds of courses in which thousands of volunteer leaders have been inspired and motivated to change young people\u2019s lives in the UK and across the world. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the unbending symbol of Scouting\u2019s desire to change the world for the better.\u201d Gilwell Oak was named Tree of the Year (Woodland Trust/PA) \nAlthough Gilwell Oak\u2019s image is intertwined with the Scouts\u2019 wholesome reputation, a murkier past is shrouded by its form. \nDick Turpin, the notorious highwayman who terrorised 18th century England, is said to have sheltered beneath the tree\u2019s boughs as he prepared to ambush stagecoaches, according to the Woodland Trust. \nDespite this, the influence of the Gilwell Oak on the work of the Scouts has endured in modern times \u2013 with the \u201cwood\u201d badge for scout leaders named after it. \nSome of the movement\u2019s earliest adult leader training courses took place beneath the tree\u2019s branches, the Scouts said. \nOriginally, wooden beads carved from the oak\u2019s windfall branches were presented to participants. An aerial image of the oak tree at the Scout Association\u2019s Gilwell Park in Chingford (Woodland Trust/PA) \nFirst founded in 1907, the Scouts grew into the biggest co-educational youth movement in the country, now boasting more than 400,000 members. \nBeccy Speight, Woodland Trust chief executive, said: \u201cOur competition aims to highlight and celebrate our country\u2019s remarkable trees, and to ultimately ensure they are given the recognition and protection they deserve. \n\u201cThe passion shown by the people who nominated trees, and the way the public get behind them in the voting process shows how much of an inspiration trees are to people.\u201d \nGilwell Oak will also receive a \u00a31,000 tree care award as part of its prize. \nWinners of the title in other parts of the UK were the Erskine House Tree in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the Big Tree is Kirkwall, Scotland, and The Hollow Tree in Gnoll Country Park, Wales. \nVoting for the European Tree of the Year will open in February 2018, the Woodland Trust said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scout association-linked gilwell oak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beccy speight", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert bayden powell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grylls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilwell oak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dick turpin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gilwell oak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woodland trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollow tree", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "essex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scout association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament oak", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woodland trust/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woodland trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirkwall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gnoll country park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belfast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nottinghamshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chingford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilwell park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:38.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe3e1c521000fb25e65775fb639510c44390fb15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAigrhyXKH8m1ElSEg7.3iBkY-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/na---mobile-app", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "Missing sent emails", "title_full": "Missing sent emails - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fc345f4b3d752309399546e599b28269b2f9a9ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAigrhyXKH8m1EwNGeHyYEl.ACHLTfWMhkTg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Regina - Community Specialist", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi there,\nWelcome to the Gmail Help Forum!\nI understand that you are not able to view sent emails of a particular period of time.

Nevertheless, the LG V30+ is the latest trump card that LG India is preparing for. When it comes to a smartphone, you would probably take 5 names before you think of LG and hopefully, the team is planning to change the trite. Launched in August at IFA 2017, the phone is the true successor of LG V30 variant and comes with an almost bezel-less design with a robust back panel. At the front, you will get a 6.0\" (18:9) QHD+ OLED FullVision Display. Thanks to its pixel density of 538ppi and HDR10 support, the display technology has received an upgrade. A couple of software tweaks worth mentioning includes a Floating Bar which can be disabled for your needs and the \"Cine Effect\" video recording facility that helps you capture a high-quality video with 211% more saturation. Talking about its hardware, the LG V30+ comes with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC synchronized with 4GB of LPDDR4x RAM. Storage wise, it is way more than enough with its 128 GB inbuilt storehouse and a 2TB external storage expansion option. Of course, a little more than its predecessor this one houses a 3,300 mAh battery. LG V30+ \u200b However, this gadget is mostly famous for its dual rear camera set up which has now become a trend in costly phones. With a couple of 16MP + 13MP, the first one offers standard-Angle Lens with a f/1.6 aperture and 71-degree field of view. The second one, however, gives 120-degree wide-angle lens and f/1.9 aperture. On the flip side, the phone is glued to a 5MP sensor available with Auto Shot, Gesture Shot, Gesture Interval Shot Gesture View, Beauty Shot, and other picture modes. Equipped with some standard connectivity options such as Bluetooth 5.0, USB Type-C, and Wi-Fi the phone features Fingerprint scanner, Voice ID, Face ID and other security systems. The phone runs on Android 7.1.2 Nougat with an overlay of UX 6.0+.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "lg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lg india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ifa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:38.039+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a76a45e9fada3b146e1537d53e74a34a5d863da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRl0ag0_0_NV5JUvpIgx.9gPcowcFBvjYw8Pc9hpfFYQ6QXF8zM0Lz1Yl0MO87B0gY.5DbOi3lYh_GOSSOzeGc.fGwnlaCneP_IApfHRXBV9g--", "site_full": "newyork.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist new york | for sale search", "title": "2009 Toyota Camry Se (Fully Loaded) (Brooklyn) $8500", "title_full": "2009 Toyota Camry Se (Fully Loaded) (Brooklyn) $8500", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_2B2ldIaZsUN_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a76a45e9fada3b146e1537d53e74a34a5d863da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRl0ag0_0_NV5JUvpIgx.9gPcowcFBvjYw8Pc9hpfFYQ6QXF8zM0Lz1Yl0MO87B0gY.5DbOi3lYh_GOSSOzeGc.fGwnlaCneP_IApfHRXBV9g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "2009 Toyota Camry Se (Fully Loaded) (Brooklyn) $8500", "text": "  Up for grabs is one of a kind Toyota Camry 2009 Toyota Camry Se 67,245 Miles LOW MILES ! 3.5 V6 Engine Car has angel headlights with a crazy entertainment system !

Okay in theory it does potentially solve the so-called problem of lagging PC sales. But is even that really a problem?\nFirst off let me state that I don't even see PC sales as lagging. The term PC originally meant a Personal Computer, and it was only through massive efforts by both Microsoft (windows) and Intel (x86) that we consider a x86 computer running a version of windows a \"PC\". IMHO they're all PC's just different form factors with different abilities.\nThe reason that the traditional desktop/laptop is losing ground to smartphones is that they're just too powerful for what the majority of people would use them for and smartphones are just too convenient to use. Add to that the fact that the traditional form factors have reached the point where they're a commodity good with razor thin margins dealing with a highly saturated market that currently consists of replacement sales and it isn't hard to see why traditional PC sales are stagnating.\nMicrosoft was right that they needed to compete in the smartphone market when they first produced Win8, they just didn't understand a couple of things. First they're the new guys in that market (even with the fact they'd been in it for a long time) and would be fighting the dominate players, so they needed to do things better than the competition or they'd lose. And their desktop users were not a resource they could leverage into windows smartphone customers. But they ignored both, and tried to foist a touch centric OS on desktop users thinking they'd buy into the ecosystem and get all Win8/RT devices. And we all know the results to that one right?\nThis is just MS thinking the samething. That we'll flock to a Windows ecosphere because it's a familiar name. It's not going to happen. If MS wants to (and it's a big if since they're so far behind the pack) become a dominate player in the smartphone market place they have to give consumers real valid reasons to abandon Apple and Google products. They need to build the brand loyalty of Apple products which you can't do overnight, or the value of Google products which will initially cost money, potentially a lot.\nMicrosoft ( and RIM as well) sat on it's ass like the proverbial frog in the sauce pan making great margins on niche' products well Apple sewed up the high end and Google gobbled up everything else. All these efforts are too little too late and won't amount anything more than a pathetic fart in a hurricane IMHO.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:39.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9fb24389fd4760d6fcf1f9e49db1d703e553551a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZCsA_k4VMfUL", "site_full": "news.ycombinator.com", "site": "ycombinator.com", "site_section": "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Hacker News", "title": "Scudo Hardened Allocator", "title_full": "Scudo Hardened Allocator | Hacker News", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2232, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8195a2a1d6440d1e1ec702e6b1a47ada5d4b5f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZOdFRDZ1naPXT.2exL83E_I-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "jchw", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "As long as results are different on every application run and app crashes when there's a mismatch, you don't need anything as strong as SipHash since your previous guesses don't narrow options for your future attack attempts.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:39.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "593db43e6bade9702ca92f446091da2b76d67eb1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZHEgEvvnzIdy", "site_full": "news.ycombinator.com", "site": "ycombinator.com", "site_section": "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Hacker News", "title": "Block-Sparse GPU Kernels", "title_full": "Block-Sparse GPU Kernels | Hacker News", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2232, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9228490287cc9ae6dc7a4119d7efe3ea19742db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZP2v1BzISBAUORWonklGP.M-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "singularity2001", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Interesting research; I would have suspected that there would be a snowball effect where those minuscule weights add up to significant changes in the end, but seems not.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:39.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b606317abccd86e4efd0542b4abc32ee780b1ff9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZKwWqy8_PLsI", "site_full": "news.ycombinator.com", "site": "ycombinator.com", "site_section": "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Hacker News", "title": "The suicide rate for farmers in the U.S. is more than double that of veterans", "title_full": "The suicide rate for farmers in the U.S. is more than double that of veterans | Hacker News", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 251, "participants_count": 151, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.797, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2232, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aac9467cf669714d9ab2759872f7213f9dda3e15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZLidC7Oqcj9yWBVQ8NL.pfo-", "ord_in_thread": 239, "author": "Analemma_", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Which only works until someone like Amazon comes around.

She' s not a good actress so the praise that she is some kind of goddess is ridicoulous, she is not funny, she is not smart, she' s decent looking but not an otherwordly beauty, she is as average in everything as it comes. All of her career so far was 100% Hollywood hype, and that disappears soon no matter what happens to the subject in question. The fact that she seems to be incapable of shutting up and that she makes terrible decisions in her private life (that she gleefully shares with the public as if they were from the mind of a genius) and her career doesn' t help either.\nThis was bound to happen. Every actor in Hollywood has highs and lows: in Jennifer' s case, the highs didn' t depend on her but on Hollywood shamelessly selling her as the it girl.

companies conducting illegal money lending activities using fake money lending licences, purportedly issued by the central bank. \n\u201cThese fraudsters aim to deceive the public to believe that they are licensed money lenders and to lure the public to make initial payments for various purposes related to the loan, such as administrative expenses, stamp duty and legal fees,\u201d BNM said in a statement. \nBNM clarified it does not issue money lending licences and explained that in fact, the money lending business is governed under the Moneylenders Act 1951 and administered by the Ministry of Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government. \nHence, members of the public were reminded to be vigilant of any person or parties who claim to be licensed by BNM. \n\u201cThey (the public) are advised to refer to the list of institutions that are licensed or approved under the laws administered by Bank Negara Malaysia, before entering into any business or investment transactions,\u201d the

Yes. https://talk.newagtalk.com/forums/thread-view.asp?tid=746371&pos... Again, not picking on you but you seem to be asking a serious question. You have been quite bullish corn quite often most of the later part of this year. I think I understand where you\u2019re coming from and I think you are justified being bullish and I think it\u2019s unwise being bearish where we are now but the thing is, if you get the timing wrong, but the eventual price right, you\u2019re still wrong. From the way you\u2019re looking at it, you\u2019re still right because you\u2019ve got a long term plan and have positioned yourself to be able to wait it out. And yes, it\u2019s going to likely hit that target you\u2019re searching for before it makes significant new lows. So you\u2019ll be right. But from the way most other people are looking at it, you\u2019ve been wrong over and over. You say buy now and the market does not go up tomorrow or next week or next month and in that time you have several other posts saying don\u2019t go short, don\u2019t give up ownership, etc etc. Well, it just sounds wrong to most people. For month after month the market has not done what you said it would do. You know it hasn\u2019t made significant new lows. You know we\u2019re just basically still in the bottom of the trading range and maintaining ownership has cost little or nothing but that guy in August who read your post and had a 50K bushel bin full of old crop is probably getting pretty weary of waiting for you to be right. So yeah, maybe you\u2019ve called it right, but the timing has proven you wrong, even if for the way you market, you\u2019re still right. Eh. Impossible to explain on here. But yes, you were that hard to understand, just like I probably am now: ).\ndpilot. This is why I won't post next years crop nor any after. I am not correctly explaining my thoughts though I really think its people not taking the time to actually read what I said... regardless, language is a horrible way to express the mind but its best we have.\nbasically back in November of 16 I had posted to sell everything projected grown at a time beans were 10.35. I did not get my target hit and as beans hung around 10.30 for far longer than I thought they should have it became clear that we would have better opportunities to price our crop probably after harvest.\nthat is all I know. that is all I know in a trade. entrance and a target. in between here and there I have little idea whats going to happen which is why its important to frame the trade and leave it. the market makes a very convincing point often during a trade that you are wrong but in the end your read is usually not as bad as it appeared mid trade. So ya posting a multi annual projection on market talk with the patience of a month or two is now a known mistake. Yes in between last spring and this fall I thought price was going to continue on through the sell zone thought it didn't... but all of that is \"mid trade\" and its sole purpose is to convince me that my read was wrong and shake me off before my target is reached.\nI have hardly talked about corn due to me not growing any and I really didn't address it much this year... if addressed... all my actual targets were for 2017 crop in 2018 spring/summer as my 2016 crop was pre priced.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:39.056+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f748212436cb7a922dc4a41017353042919286ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU44gDoGu1KNLMS6vXZff_lnAnYnkw04JG1NxZc._ynEAnoyctZq1YYeZMOkLw7F1LooejqaYd3D4czcpHPuG09wnq.jXKDfCRqw-", "site_full": "longhovinhlong.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://longhovinhlong.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Long H\u1ed3 V\u0129nh Long", "title": "Th\u01a1 Tranh: \u00c1o T\u00edm Ng\u00e0y X\u01b0a", "title_full": "Th\u01a1 Tranh: \u00c1o T\u00edm Ng\u00e0y X\u01b0a", "published": "2017-12-07T11:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f748212436cb7a922dc4a41017353042919286ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU44gDoGu1KNLMS6vXZff_lnAnYnkw04JG1NxZc._ynEAnoyctZq1YYeZMOkLw7F1LooejqaYd3D4czcpHPuG09wnq.jXKDfCRqw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "koala le (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Th\u01a1 Tranh: \u00c1o T\u00edm Ng\u00e0y X\u01b0a", "text": "\nTh\u01a1: Cao Linh T\u1eed  \nTh\u01a1 Tranh: Kim Oanh \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kim oanh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cao linh t\u1eed   th\u01a1 tranh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:39.068+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "343181fd0ee6e0c4e057aaddd2e1670e1352637f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8mVVPX3tlR.Hj25Z1HTqsC0anr2JCyXzipDtluQ7v6H7cAF1dm_Vq.", "site_full": "www.ifljapan.com", "site": "ifljapan.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "", "title": "Japanese threesome - I Fucking Love Japan", "title_full": "Japanese threesome - I Fucking Love Japan", "published": "2017-12-07T10:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.887, "main_image": "http://cdn.ifljapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/japanese-threesome_01-5.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "343181fd0ee6e0c4e057aaddd2e1670e1352637f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8mVVPX3tlR.Hj25Z1HTqsC0anr2JCyXzipDtluQ7v6H7cAF1dm_Vq.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "Japanese threesome - I Fucking Love Japan", "text": "\u00a9 2017 All models on IFLJAPAN.com adult site are 18 years or older.

It perhaps outshines rivals in its class because it\u2019s portable, lightweight design and does everything a laptop can without the bulk. But most of all, it has Microsoft\u2019s logo stamped on it, a brand that is bound to give customers that reassurance when investing in a Windows machine. The only major flaw with the Surface Pro, however, is that it costs an arm and a leg if you want some decent specs, with some prices going up as far as a grand. But if you\u2019re desperate for a Surface and don\u2019t have the cash to splurge, there is another way. The Linx way. The Linx 12\u00d764 is basically a cheaper imitation of the Surface Pro, and comes in at a fraction of the price. For just \u00a3299, in fact. But does it perform as well? Read our review below and we\u2019ll tell you! Design We shouldn\u2019t really need to tell you much about the Linx 12\u00d764\u2019s design. Why? Because you know it very well. Yes, it\u2019s just like Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro, just not quite as nice. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad though. It\u2019s chiefly made of plastic, yes, but it feels sturdy enough. At just over 10mm thick, the Linx 12\u00d764 isn\u2019t the slimmest 2-in-1 we\u2019ve ever got our mitts on by a long shot, but it is still light enough to slip into a rucksack and not make it too heavy to carry for substantial distances, weighing 1.7kg with the keyboard attached. Speaking of which, the Linx 12\u00d764\u2019s keyboard is designed very similarly to Microsoft\u2019s but doesn\u2019t feel anywhere near as high in quality. Its back is covered by a gross pseudo-leather material that collects dents and dints far too easily, and it\u2019s not very stiff considering it\u2019s meant for typing on. It does, however, do the job you\u2019d expect of it, with travel being sufficient enough to allow you to use comfortably on for a decent day of work. Like the latest Surface Pro devices, the Linx 12\u00d764\u2019s kickstand allows the tablet to sit in almost any position and in our tests it rested well at any angle without slipping, even when applying pressure to the screen. It does feel a little flimsy, however, and we feared a drop at an awkward angle could easily result in the Kickstand breaking off altogether. \nDisplay The Linx 12\u00d764 has a 12.5in screen offering 10-point multi-touch with a 16:9 aspect ratio and default full HD resolution of 1920\u00d71080. We were pleased with the quality of the full HD display in general, with text and images appearing bright and vibrant, with little pixelation around text on close inspection. The size is also rather substantial for a device at this price point, which is always a plus. \nTouchscreen operations were generally responsive, but there were instances when some commands were not registered and we would need to touch the screen again to get it to detect the command. This perhaps has mainly to do with the size of the icons displayed, due to the high resolution. \nThe accelerometer works very well too, and flips from portrait mode and back to landscape mode fairly rapidly when the tablet is turned from either position. \nThose conscious of smudge marks should be aware that the Linx 12\u00d764 does attract its fair share of smears and marks when being heavily used. However, with the brightness setting on full, it doesn\u2019t fail to deliver great brightness and clarity, even when working in very bright conditions such as outdoors. The only problem with this is that it will drain the battery rather quickly. Nevertheless, performance in this area isn\u2019t too bad, as we will discuss in more detail later on. Performance The Linx 12\u00d764 tackles everyday tasks with ease. It runs the latest Windows 10 operating system (OS), and our review model was powered by Intel Atom x5-Z8350 Quad Core CPU running at 1.84GHz alongside 4GB LPDDR3 SDRAM and Intel integrated graphics. This offered more than enough power to watch full HD videos with downloads running in the background and several webpage tabs open. While multitasking, we encountered no lag problems and generally the 2-in1 was very responsive to commands. \nUnless you\u2019re using it for gaming on high graphics settings then you\u2019re not going to notice much lag. Both touchscreen and non-touchscreen operations were fluid, with the Linx 12\u00d764 responding very quickly to commands. However, graphics performance is a different story altogether. Our GeekBench benchmark score of 872 (single-core) and 2181 (multi-core) proved that the Linx 12\u00d764 is not a tablet that\u2019s built for high-end benchmarks. The Intel integrated graphics ensured that Linx 12\u00d764 struggled to make it through the benchmark itself, with its Micro USB charger not even being able to keep the device fully powered throughout, meaning the battery was dipping even when it was plugged in. This tablet is definitely not made for high-performance. But as far as video playing and word processing goes, you\u2019re laughing. Especially at this price point. Battery life Powered by a 9000mAh, 3.7 V Lithium-ion battery, the Linx 12\u00d764 is touted as lasting for seven hours on one charge. We found it lasted for a little less than promised at roughly 5 hours and 30 mins of uninterrupted use on full brightness while connected to WiFi. Our testing included word processing, watching video, music listening and general web browsing without letting the screen turn off or go into power-saving mode. This is not a tablet that\u2019s built for benchmarks, at least on the high end. The Intel integrated graphics limped their way through (most of) 3DMark, and the CPU took a languid wander through Cinebench and Geekbench \u2013 and, all the while, the X64 plugged in. Connectivity and storage Storage is perhaps where the Linx 12\u00d764 is let down the most. If you\u2019re needing a dedicated machine for working and whatnot, then its 64GB of inbuilt eMMC storage will not cut it. The good news, however, is that this can be expanded via microSD, As for connectivity, the Linx 12\u00d764 boasts just one lonely USB 3.0 slot, one Micro USB port and a Micro HDMI output for connecting it up to a larger display or TV. This is probably average connectivity options for a portable device of this kind, but we would have liked to of seen a Type-C charge port instead of the MicroUSB, not only for convenience but because it makes it feel rather dated. In Short If you set your expectations low and don\u2019t assume that \u00a3300\u2019s worth of portable computing is going to offer you everything you need from a laptop, then the Linx 12\u00d764 could be the right device for you. Especially if you\u2019re on a budget. It might not feel the most premium out there, of course, but if you basically just need something to work on while travelling, that can handle basic web browsing, video streaming and word processing ten the Linx 12\u00d764 is a great, flexible device for the price. And better still, if you look around now you will probably be able to find it cheaper from online retailers. A win, win situation for anyone who could afford to fork out more than \u00a3700 for a Microsoft Surface Pro. The good Good quality HD screen, keyboard cover included, decent battery life.

The 3 Series has often been a Motor Trend favorite, but considering how much more emphasis BMW has placed on luxury over sport for the midsize 5 Series, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. Likely debuting as a 2019 model in sedan form with 4 Series variants to follow, keep reading for our best guesses on what to expect for the 2019 BMW 3 Series. \nPhotos of the outgoing 3 Series and camouflaged next-gen 3 Series are pictured below Lighter Weight \nThanks to a move to BMW\u2019s flexible KLAR architecture that also underpins the new X3 crossover, the 2019 3 Series could drop a few pounds compared to the current car. That\u2019s a change that should benefit drivers across the expansive 3 Series lineup, from the entry-level successor to the 320i all the way up to the next M3 and M4. More Power? \nAlong with a slight reduction in weight, the 2019 3 Series should also see a bump in power for the 340i model that might be renamed M340i. The current 340i makes 320 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque from a turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine, but we expect a 2019 M340i model to match the 2018 X3\u2019s 355 hp and 369 lb-ft. We\u2019ve tested a 2016 340i with a manual transmission accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds (BMW estimates 4.9 seconds for the manual and 4.8 seconds for the automatic) and expect the 340i\u2019s successor to dip closer to 4.5 seconds. \nA plug-in hybrid model will also return, though BMW will probably want to transition some of those customers to an upcoming four-door inspired by the fully electric i Vision Dynamics concept . Want a Manual? \nIf you\u2019re the type of driver who still wants a manual transmission, you\u2019re probably not buying a luxury sport sedan, but BMW will be happy to oblige if that\u2019s important to you. Although a six-speed manual is currently available on the 320i, 330i, 340i, and M3, BMW might restrict the do-it-yourself option on the 2019 3 Series to one or two variants so that Audi doesn\u2019t own those bragging rights alone among top-rated competitors\u2014the A4 2.0T with all-wheel drive is offered with a six-speed manual. As for the extremely entertaining Alfa Romeo Giulia, the automaker doesn\u2019t currently offer a manual transmission. At a launch event for the Giulia, in explaining why there was no option of a manual transmission in the U.S., Alfa Romeo cited extremely low take-rates for manuals as well as the expensive nature of getting the additional variant emissions-certified. \nMost 3 Series models will probably use different versions of an eight-speed automatic. In a review of the new 2018 X3 M40i, we said the eight-speed feels \u201c alert and responsive .\u201d And in that eight-car comparison that included a 330i, despite the issues we had with the BMW, we appreciated its \u201clinear acceleration, minimal turbo lag, and excellent transmission programming.\u201d An Interior More Befitting That Price Tag \nPart of what sank the 2017 BMW 330i in that eight-car Big Test comparison was an interior that hadn\u2019t aged well compared to some of the other competitors we tested at the same time and the average materials quality. We\u2019re hopeful here. We described the new 2018 X3\u2019s interior as \u201cplush and premium\u201d\u2014a noticeable step up from the cabin of the cheap-feeling outgoing car. BMW\u2019s 10.0-inch central screen will likely be an option on higher trims, and the car will also offer a digital instrument cluster display. As for the Gesture Control feature that has been spreading around BMW\u2019s lineup, just keep in mind the gimmick is actually useful when you want to skip ahead to the next track (but otherwise not worth paying extra for). Will It Get Bigger? \nWe hope not. In that eight-car comparison, the 3 Series was lauded for its interior comfort and decently sized rear seats. The new 2018 X3 is longer and a little wider than its predecessor, but we hope the 2019 3 Series won\u2019t get bloated. Instead, a lighter-weight and similarly sized car that handles better and is more connected to the road sounds like a better focus to us. Then again, a slightly larger 3 Series might make sense to BMW if, despite the SUV-crazed automotive market, product planners decide there\u2019s still enough of a gap at the bottom of its lineup for a 1 Series four-door or 2 Series Gran Coupe . Currently, the 320i base model and X1 crossover are the only four-door BMWs available for under $40,000. Will the Coupe and Wagon Return? \nBefore the 6 Series lineup added a Gran Turismo model, it discontinued the coupe model. We wonder what BMW will decide to do with its U.S. lineup for the 3 and 4 Series, specifically with the 4 Series coupe and 3 Series wagon. BMW\u2019s 3 Series wagon is refreshingly offered without a crossoverlike visual appearance package, but the automaker also has the 3 Series Gran Turismo for customers who want more cargo-carrying capability. Aside from the 3 Series sedan and the possibility of a 3 Series Gran Turismo and 4 Series coupe, the lineup will also likely include a 4 Series convertible and 4 Series Gran Coupe (a stylish four-door). Radical New Styling! \nJust kidding\u2014thanks to a handful of extremely well defined brand-design traits that we\u2019ve seen for decades across the lineup including the Hofmeister kink and dual-kidney grille, the new 3 Series will clearly resemble the 5 Series and 7 Series but with some important detail changes to give the car its own identity. Most Importantly \u2026 \nWe hope BMW will make the new 3 Series fun to drive. Sure, some buyers in this segment might only be looking for a well-respected badge and isolated driving experience, but the current segment benchmark manages to be fun to drive, capable, quick, and efficient while not beating up the driver over every road imperfection.
