Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

The nomination confirms months of speculation about his likely ascension to the post in a move that holds significance within the context of the evolution of Indonesia\u2019s military as well as the country\u2019s politics. \nAs I have noted before, Tjahjanto, who was just sworn in as air force chief earlier this year, had served previously as the Indonesian Defense Ministry\u2019s inspector-general and, prior to that, he also served as military secretary, the National Search and Rescue Agency\u2019s director for operations and training, spokesman for the Air Force, and the commander of an airport in Malang, East Java. \nTjahjanto has risen quickly within the military ranks in recent years and was already said to be Jokowi\u2019s preferred candidate to replace the current commander of the Indonesian military (TNI), general Gatot Nurmantyo. Nurmantyo is no stranger to controversy, with recent incidents seeing him complicate military ties with Australia and the United States abroad as well as courting nationalists and Islamists at home (See: \u201cOld Shadows in New Australia-Indonesia Spat\u201d). Nurmantyo was officially set to retire next year following the end of his term in April, and speculation continues about his future political ambitions as Indonesia prepares for elections in 2019 \nOn Monday, House deputy Speaker Fadli Zon confirmed that the House of Representatives (DPR) had officially received a letter from Jokowi on the appointment of Tjahjanto as TNI commander, after which it was handed over for processing and deliberation. Tjahjanto\u2019s nomination will require a fit and proper test by parliament, a process that is expected to be completed quickly within the next few weeks before it breaks for recess. \nIf it occurs as planned, Tjahjanto\u2019s quick ascension from air force chief to military chief would be in line with traditional practice, whereby the Indonesian military chief position has rotated between the army, navy, and air force in a move to reverse the traditionally dominant role of the army (though Jokowi had departed from this by electing Nurmantyo to the post, since he replaced Moeldoko, who was also from the army). \nTjahjanto, unlike Nurmantyo, is not known to harbor major political ambitions, and having such a figure as military chief could be useful for Jokowi as he prepares for reelection in 2019. Some of Nurmantyo\u2019s recent antics raised concerns about civil-military relations and growing religious extremism in the country, and Jokowi himself has had to occasionally weigh in (See: \u201cThe Trouble With Indonesia\u2019s Ahok Test\u201d). Tjahjanto is also a known quantity given his longstanding relationship with Jokowi and usually operates without drumming up the kind of controversy Nurmantyo sometimes stirs. \nIn commenting about his selection of Tjahjanto, Jokowi suggested that he would further the transition of the TNI to a professional force. Though it is far from surprising that Jokowi would speak highly of his own pick for the post, Tjahjanto has indeed made a series of statements as air force chief around the need to eradicate corruption and to ensure transparency and proper oversight in the procurement of equipment, which remain key challenges for the Indonesian military.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "moeldoko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "widodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fadli zon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gatot nurmantyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hadi tjahjanto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tjahjanto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jokowi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nurmantyo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "indonesian defense ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national search and rescue agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "air force", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tjahjanto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jokowi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:32.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "206f6ac4c578172d540f58c9079306435d339098", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Qb6m4ieU938XRp29sGltiwzMMrNxtArRWARCZtHRlvZKbp1Io6jAV0_PKOEl6faKVBNQobyRUqbvnmSFGt7nlS3uSbRma2xc-", "site_full": "www.deccanherald.com", "site": "deccanherald.com", "site_section": "http://www.deccanherald.com/rss/news.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Deccan Herald - News", "title": "2 murder accused walk free after cops fail to trace lone eyewitness", "title_full": "2 murder accused walk free after cops fail to trace lone eyewitness", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.deccanherald.com/page_images/original/2017/12/07/646785.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14842, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "206f6ac4c578172d540f58c9079306435d339098", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Qb6m4ieU938XRp29sGltiwzMMrNxtArRWARCZtHRlvZKbp1Io6jAV0_PKOEl6faKVBNQobyRUqbvnmSFGt7nlS3uSbRma2xc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Press Trust of India", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "2 murder accused walk free after cops fail to trace lone eyewitness", "text": "2 murder accused walk free after cops fail to trace lone eyewitness Press Trust of India, New Delhi, Dec 7 2017, 12:38 IST The court noted the police's submission that the witness was a vagabond and hence summons could not be served.\nTwo men accused of brutally killing a person in Delhi have been acquitted by a local court after the police failed to produce the lone eyewitness.\nSpecial judge Narinder Kumar absolved the accused of the offence of murder and said the prosecution could not secure the presence of the 16-year-old eyewitness on whose statement the case was registered.\n\"Despite efforts, the prosecution could not secure the presence of prosecution witness...A fresh process was issued and directed to be served.

\nJamie Oliver has refused to be drawn into a war of words with fellow celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay as he opened up about their recent feud. \nThe broadcaster said he is not interested in \u201cpersonal spats in public\u201d with someone he claims he barely knows any more before comparing him and Ramsay to Finding Nemo characters Nemo and Dory. \nIt comes after Ramsay hit out at Oliver earlier this year after the latter was reported to have said \u201che\u2019s got four kids and I\u2019ve got five kids and I don\u2019t want to be slagging off some kids\u2019 dad on telly\u201d, suggesting that as both chefs were parents, they should not be squabbling in public. Jamie Oliver (Matt Crossick/PA) \nBut Ramsay, 51, read the remark differently, telling Radio Times magazine his younger rival had been judging the size of his family. \nRamsay\u2019s wife Tana suffered a miscarriage with the couple\u2019s fifth child last year. \nAsked about the spat, Oliver told the Radio Times: \u201cI don\u2019t want to put petrol on the fire, but it\u2019s kind of interesting, isn\u2019t it? \n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a fish tank, there should be plenty of room for Nemo and Dory,\u201d he said before clarifying that Ramsay would be Nemo. Celebrity Chef Gordon Ramsay (Adam Davy/PA) \nHe added: \u201cWhat I said was fairly grown-up and reasonable.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t think he liked me taking the high ground. I think that\u2019s basically it. So, I\u2019m going to take the high ground now and say I wish him all the best, and all success. \n\u201cGood luck to him. But we have both got kids, and I don\u2019t know what sort of example we\u2019re setting if we\u2019re arguing like we\u2019re in the playground,\u201d Oliver said. \nHe also addressed Ramsay\u2019s accusations that he had \u201clabel-slapped\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s by taking part in an advertising campaign with them. \nOliver said: \u201cThat\u2019s a strong thing to say. I didn\u2019t \u2018label slap\u2019 at Sainsbury\u2019s. \n\u201cMy job with Sainsbury\u2019s was to promote British and fresh produce, and take a business that was in bad times to good times, which I did. \n\u201cAnd I haven\u2019t really squirrelled away money, so I\u2019m not some cocksure dude with a bank full of cash. I\u2019ve always invested it in ideas or people.\u201d Radio Times cover (Radio Times) \nThe full interview is in this week\u2019s Radio Times.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gordon ramsay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie oliver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian west/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oliver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt crossick/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramsay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nemo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam davy/pa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sainsbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radio times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:32.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ee88c8fbd6c3b9f1c2de04482f05796cd358eb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacVZh1lswKv6hxXa.xCvxE_8WRh64WCQ1e2USq3FITnbrSQZyIPjHJJrHUKMaU9oWQ", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/phones", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Phones - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "Official Infinix 24hrs Support (14)", "title_full": "Official Infinix 24hrs Support - Phones (14) - Nigeria", "published": "2017-12-06T11:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7053dacfd356e624134f6ededbe1a4196d15b250", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacVZh1lswKv6hxXa.xCvxE_8WRh64WCQ1e2USq3FITnbrSQZyIPjHJJn5_MJ7KCfVoaGpcgZOGr0w-", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "dreydoe", "published": "2017-12-06T11:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "XIcywongh :\nI will send a message to you l will be expecting..Thanks", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:32.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "617fd98e182bf8f56833f2f04cb6696570a873e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTxQ8NicDTbzaIYmE1FGGnWsv5JqZV4MJbr66d6jZi5GHSg1_iaocVgWL6Qah0P3hpHvWIogikF9Z_iAQG_L1qM3tdy6_etLFbvhrDseplA9jkHwb8Mb69Hg9D6SlIDFV.pefmNuM0j_g--", "site_full": "androidforums.com", "site": "androidforums.com", "site_section": "https://androidforums.com/devices/motorola-moto-g5-plus.6525/", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "Motorola Moto G5 Plus | Android Forums", "title": "Loose USB Cable Charging Connections on 2 NEW Moto G5 Plus Phones", "title_full": "Loose USB Cable Charging Connections on 2 NEW Moto G5 Plus Phones - Motorola Moto G5 Plus | Android Forums", "published": "2017-11-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://androidforums.com/styles/android/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6959, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85533e44825ac560fa7f5c25da3542b0fdfe475b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTxQ8NicDTbzaIYmE1FGGnWsv5JqZV4MJbr66d6jZi5GHSg1_iaocVgWL6Qah0P3hpHvWIogikF9Z_iAQG_L1qM3tdy6_etLFbvhrDseplA9jkHwb8Mb69Hg9D6SlIDFV.4sdNutyBB0lcMhINv31w6", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "IWant2Believe", "published": "2017-11-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The cell phone, the USB cable, charger, the tool to open the SIM card tray, ect were ALL brand new in a a sealed box from Motorola for both phones.

The Apprentice candidates (L-R) Harrison Jones, Jade English and Sarah Lynn (BBC) \nThe teams had to select their designer, plan and organise a catwalk show while also putting together a magazine cover to amplify their sales campaign. \nBut project manager English failed to impress with her choice of high-end designer, and she was also criticised by her team mates and Lord Sugar for not managing to get more than a 10% commission agreement on sales and for missing out on a discount for buyers. \nJones, who was fired first in the boardroom, was described as merely an \u201cassistant\u201d by Lord Sugar\u2019s aide Karren Brady, and the Apprentice boss himself said he could not see what the business hopeful had done throughout the task. \nVitality ended up with a commission total of just \u00a31,101.50 compared to Graphene\u2019s \u00a34,362.80 for their ethical fashion range for men. Team Vitality (BBC) \nEnglish said she thought the task had been \u201cgoing quite well\u201d throughout \u2013 despite getting in a muddle over the designer\u2019s name \u2013 and that it was only when she went into the boardroom to face the music that she realised she might be in trouble. \nShe told the Press Association: \u201cI knew there had been a few things here and there, but generally I thought it was going pretty well. \n\u201cThen I got into the boardroom and it was like\u2026 \u2018OK, this happened and that happened\u2019 and I was thinking, \u2018oh, this isn\u2019t looking great\u2019. \n\u201cBefore I went into the boardroom there were two people that definitely had to leave, because you have the final five, but then he fired Harrison and waited for a little bit with me and I thought that maybe there\u2019s a final six this year, maybe I\u2019ve got away with it. \n\u201cBut then Lord Sugar was like, \u2018Jade you\u2019re fired too\u2019.\u201d Jade English (BBC) \nPR and marketing manager English said that she hopes \u201ceverything happens for a reason\u201d, although winning a chance to become Lord Sugar\u2019s business partner was \u201cso close, yet so far\u201d, and that she is \u201cgutted\u201d. \nJones shared a similar sentiment, and said that while he is also disappointed to be out of the running, \u201cloads of good stuff has happened, so I\u2019m happy\u201d. \nHe defended his part in the challenge, despite being criticised by Lord Sugar, Brady and his team mates for not taking part in the negotiations or selling, and said: \u201cI didn\u2019t think that (it was my time to go), everything I had to do, I did do. \n\u201cWhen they first said what the task was, I knew that either Jade or Sarah should take the reins when it comes to picking something or talking about women\u2019s fashion, that they\u2019d probably be able to do better than me. Harrison Jones (BBC) \n\u201cBut I never thought during the task it was my time to go, I thought we had a chance at winning \u2013 so it was still a shame and a shock when we didn\u2019t, and when I got fired.\u201d \nThe sales executive said he knew that Lynn would continue through to the final five because she is \u201ca very strong candidate\u201d. \nLynn joins Elizabeth McKenna, Joanna Jarjue, James White and Michaela Wain in the next episode, which will see them face the brutal interview round. \n:: The Apprentice continues on BBC One at 9pm on Wednesday.", "highlightText": "",

deliver improved performance in entry-level smartphones \nHSINCHU, TAIWAN\u2013 December 7, 2017 \u2013 MediaTek Inc. today announced that it is a System-on-Chip (SoC) partner for providing Google\u2019s Android TM Oreo (Go edition) software to smartphone makers, and after a deep collaboration with Google, MediaTek\u2019s MT6739, MT6737, and MT6580 SoCs, among others, now have board support packages available to run Android Oreo (Go edition). Google collaborated with MediaTek to ensure that Android Oreo (Go edition) works well on its line of processors, enabling a faster time-to-market mechanism for device manufacturers, and ensuring a quality Android smartphone experience that is both secure and affordable for devices with 512MB to 1GB of memory. This marks one of the first times that entry-level SoCs are ready to be used shortly after the latest version of Android, in this case Android 8.1 Oreo, has been released to the Android Open Source Project. \nWith Android Oreo (Go edition), Google has optimized its OS platform, first party apps and the Google Play TM Store to improve the capabilities of entry level devices. Limited processing power and storage are top pain points for entry-level device users. Android Oreo (Go edition) was created to not only address these issues, but to also ensure that the devices are secure and that users have more control over data usage. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages the existing Google Play Store ecosystem to deliver apps that run smoothly on low memory devices. This improves the overall user experience with, and support for, devices that have 512MB to 1GB of memory, which results in significant bill of materials (BOM) cost savings. These savings enable device makers to provide the 400 million users who buy entry-level smartphones every year, a better option. \n\u201c Entry-level devices are the gateway to the internet for many people, and we want to make sure everyone has a great experience when they use these devices, \u201d said Sameer Samat, VP of Product Management, Android & Google Play. \u201cWe\u2019re excited that Android Oreo (Go edition) will significantly improve storage, performance, data management, and security.\u201d \n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement builds upon our existing work with Google, including our recent collaboration on Google\u2019s GMS Express to speed up the certification process,\u201d said TL Lee, General Manager of MediaTek\u2019s Wireless Communication business unit. \u201cWith Android Oreo (Go edition), we are partnering with Google to tackle the performance challenges of lower memory phones, improving the user experience of entry level smartphones for consumers in key markets across India, the Middle East & Africa, Latin America and South East Asia.\u201d \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages MediaTek\u2019s acclaimed turnkey references and chipsets that are designed specifically to reduce product development time and compliance testing. A wide range of MediaTek SoC\u2019s supports Android Oreo (Go edition), including the MT6739 and MT6737 for 4G devices, as well as the MT6580 for 3G devices. This gives device makers the range of capabilities they need to develop devices for specific price points and markets. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) smartphones powered by MediaTek will be available in world-wide market by Q1, 2018. \nFor more information about the program, please explore: https://www.android.com/versions/oreo-8-0/go-edition/ \n*Google, Android, and Google Play are trademarks of Google LLC. \n### \n\nAbout MediaTek Inc. \nMediaTek Incorporated (TWSE: 2454) is a global fabless semiconductor company that enables 1.5 billion connected devices a year.

Austin loss. Cory Diaz/The News-Star Louisiana Tech junior guard Derric Jean (1) looks to pass the ball against Stephen F. Austin Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017 at the Thomas Assembly Center. (Photo: Donny Crowe / LA Tech Communications) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE RUSTON -- For schools like Louisiana Tech and who they're able to schedule, building and maintaining a strong RPI arguably may be one of the toughest challenge it has. Eric Konkol's team entered Wednesday night's home showdown with Stephen F. Austin with a top-20 RPI at 20. With the Lumberbacks picked preseason to win the Southland Conference and make the NCAA Tournament for the fourth straight season, the Bulldogs (6-2) getting a non-conference victory over them could hold a lot of water come March. Unfortunately similar to its last opportunity last week in Tuscaloosa against a top-25 ranked Alabama for an early season RPI-boosting win, Louisiana Tech fell short as SFA's Kevon Harris drove past Jacobi Boykins for the go-ahead score with 4 seconds remaining. Sophomore point guard Daquan Bracey couldn't get a 3-pointer to fall on the ensuing possession and the Lumberjacks (8-1) held on for the 85-83 victory at Thomas Assembly Center. More: Louisiana college basketball showing signs of rising The Bulldogs let a late, second half lead slip away at Alabama and were ahead, 75-72, with 2:54 to go versus SFA, but let another lead go for the second time in three games. \"Our saying is always have poise down the stretch, we just try to have poise down the stretch,\" Boykins, Louisiana Tech senior guard, said after the game. \"It's a team game, but I take it all on me. It was my fault. My defense was terrible the whole entire game. I just got to do better from a defensive standpoint. I felt like we did good offensively, but it just came down to defensive stops and I did terrible.\" Despite being one of just 13 teams in the nation with at least 23-plus wins in each of the last five seasons, Tech has dropped key games non-conference games that would bolster their resume for the NCAA tourney selection committee. Stephen F. Austin entered the game with an RPI of 135. \"I really don't get too far ahead of myself with things like that,\" Tech men's hoops coach Eric Konkol said after the game. \"This was an opportunity for us to play a very good team, it's why we scheduled it. We're always searching for games like this. And we missed this opportunity. For us now, we've got to review the type, we got to look at the things we've got to get better at and that's got to be entirely our focus.\" The Bulldogs will get an even better shot, their last chance, at improving their resume Dec. 16 in Austin against the Texas Longhorns (6-2), whose RPI currently is 56. Harris the Hero SFA's Kevon Harris' game-winning bucket was just one of 11 made field goals for a game-high 27 points. The sophomore guard almost had a perfect game, going 11-for-12 from the field, made all three of his 3-point attempts and went 2-for-2 at the line. 10 to close the first 20 Trailing 38-29 with less than 3:30 left in the first half, Louisiana Tech went on a key 10-0 run to take a one-point, 39-38 lead into the break. Junior guard Derric Jean scored his six of his 16 points during that stretch. DayDay All Day Tech sophomore guard and preseason All-Conference USA selection Daquan Bracey scored 10 of his team's first 14 points of the game, helping the Bulldogs build an early, 19-12 advantage. Bracey finished with a team-high 19 points and eight assists in 35 minutes. Untimely turnovers Bracey assisted on eight made shots, but the sophomore also coughed up the ball five times for the game. As a team, Louisiana Tech had 17 turnovers, nine of those coming in the second half some at critical points that the Lumberjacks converted into points. With the game tied at 49, the Bulldogs gave it away on three straight possessions and SFA notched four points to take a 53-49 lead. Tech wouldn't lead again until a 3-pointer from Bracey, giving his team the lead, 77-74, with 3:40 left. Misleading stats Any other time Tech shoots 54 percent from the field (25-of-46) and 61 percent in the second half, it will more than likely win. But SFA offered up 22 more shots than the Bulldogs and made half of its 68 total field goal attempts. Louisiana Tech plays again Saturday at home versus Jackson State (2-6) with tipoff scheduled for 6 p.m. CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE From The USA TODAY NETWORK These sites are part of the USA TODAY NETWORK.

08:52:34 Back to Donald Trump World Home \nUpdate 9.50am: The top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas has called for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nIsmail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip and called the US decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries\". \nHe has said the uprising should begin on Friday, the Muslim holy day. \nMr Haniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nHamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. \nBut Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. \nIsrael has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \nEarlier: Palestinians protest after Donald Trump's decision on status of Jerusalem \nSchools and shops have closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians protested against President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centres at noon on Thursday. \nMr Trump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of US policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. \nIn recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Mr Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \nMeanwhile, Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Mr Trump of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" with his decision on the holy city. \nMr Erdogan also compared Mr Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Mr Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nMr Erdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace\". \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right', he is mistaken.\" \nMr Erdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ismail haniyeh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haniyeh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:34.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c4aa4d01aa0d8ad514e5274bfbcedec7bba577f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Qb6m4ieU938XRp29sGltiwzMMrNxtArRWARCZtHRlvapLJoXxjRcU83Rj_c2YdABvWeRy0azKwNw_k8cifZPj9LUyB2EptSw-", "site_full": "www.deccanherald.com", "site": "deccanherald.com", "site_section": "http://www.deccanherald.com/rss/news.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Deccan Herald -

Nick Sutcliffe, ATLAS Institute, University of Colorado Boulder Lila Finch teaches a Luminous Science class. \nThese activities, collectively called Luminous Science, guide middle and high school students through the process of designing and building dynamic sculptures that visualize biochemical processes from live data streamed from sensors in a nearby hydroponic classroom garden. \nFinch began her work by building her own hydroponic garden and a nine-foot illuminated tree sculpture, where beautiful art meets practical function. In her curriculum, students build and paint wire and paper sculptures of their own design and illuminate them from within using strings of LED lights connected to tiny microbit microcontrollers. They wirelessly link these microcontrollers to data streams from nearby gardens and program LEDs to artfully reflect the biochemistry of plants in the garden. \nFor example, when there\u2019s plenty of light and plants are photosynthesizing, a student might program some part of his or her sculpture to twinkle with white light. When water is low, a thirsty plant might be depicted with reds and purples. When water, temperature, and light are optimal, a sculpture might display vibrant blues or greens, or pulse between the two. \nIntegrating Skillsets \nRecent research by Burning Glass and Oracle Academy shows that computer science skills aren\u2019t just for software engineers. Yet computer science, art, and biology are usually taught as separate disciplines, with students developing separate skillsets and identities for participation in each, Finch says. \u201cI believe that learning about each subject can be enhanced by integrating all three,\u201d she says. Nick Sutcliffe, ATLAS Institute, University of Colorado Boulder Lila Finch built a nine-foot illuminated tree sculpture to help visualize biochemical processes. \nThe rationale goes something like this: Coming into the experience, students may identify more with art than science, or vice versa, but for them to succeed in this program, they need to perform across all three domains. Artists must understand the related biochemistry and programming skills to achieve the aesthetic they\u2019re after, while budding biologists must master the necessary code and artistry for their sculptures to exhibit their nuanced understanding of the biochemical processes at play. \nDoes It Work? \nIt\u2019s still early days for Finch\u2019s research: She\u2019s collaborating with six different teachers to implement Luminous Science in their science, art, and computing classes. \nSince the project\u2019s kickoff this fall, hundreds of students in two different schools have produced a range of beautiful creations, and the anecdotal evidence suggests that offering different avenues for computer science engagement can help extend participation in, and passion for, the field among girls and other underrepresented populations. \nAs Finch gathers empirical data as part of her doctoral research, her lens will be tightly focused on how students bring their scientific-artistic-computational ideas to life, and what they learn in the process. Analyzing all this information will guide iterative improvements to the curriculum and programmable tools used in the project. \nLuminous Science is a project of the Laboratory for Playful Computation , directed by me at the University of Colorado Boulder\u2019s ATLAS Institute . It is funded by a gift from Oracle Academy . \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:34.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b645601a0581cb47ab7b6965fca98c86331b17df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlCLnAeBaFCdAHzjcatXz7kgANPpC_R70UbwCOWVYM2_cVCI7326VfcA9DtDt.MQsmBPUGq7DR6ItEiL4RRNX19AY1xV0HRWM-", "site_full": "evansville.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://evansville.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist evansville | personals search", "title": "You host I suck - m4m (Evansville)", "title_full": "You host I suck - m4m (Evansville)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b645601a0581cb47ab7b6965fca98c86331b17df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlCLnAeBaFCdAHzjcatXz7kgANPpC_R70UbwCOWVYM2_cVCI7326VfcA9DtDt.MQsmBPUGq7DR6ItEiL4RRNX19AY1xV0HRWM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "You host I suck - m4m (Evansville)", "text": "age: 50   Like the title says.

These include standard drop-in deal trays, operable interior/exterior cash trays , custom trays, and prefabricated deal trays with integrated bullet traps or other anti-ricochet features. True Bullet Resistant Drop-in Cash and Deal Trays Some manufacturers choose to only offer non-rated deal trays. They line these with bullet-resistant fiberglass, and then presume a certain UL-rating based on how much fiberglass they\u2019ve packed into the tray. Total Security Solution never assumes a rating. They rely on all 18-gauge (or higher) steal reinforced construction to make their rating. Once designed, a nationally recognized testing laboratory independently verifies the performance of every UL-rated TSS component built. TSS components are recognized for being substantial; consider their standard Level 3 door: Rated to stop three shots from a .44 Magnum pistol, but will easily take over 100 shots from a variety of pistols and rifles without a dimple on the protected side. For enhanced security, customers might opt for a bullet trap- or anti-ricochet -style trays. In a bullet trap tray, the 18 gauge steel tray is backed with an additional welded armor plate frame. Instead of deflecting a shot, this high-security tray is designed to allow the bullet to pass through the finished outside surface. It then catches and retains the bullet safely inside the armor-plate frame. Alternately, a customer might prefer a slimmer \u201canti-ricochet\u201d tray. These have a special flat-bottomed scoop profile. This shape makes it much less likely that an armed assailant might score a lucky \u201cbank shot\u201d and injure someone behind the bullet proof glass. High-Quality, Bulletproof UL-Rated Cash Trays Anyone with an arc welder and a little training could slap together a steel deal tray. But that\u2019s not how you get smoothly functioning\u2014let alone good looking\u2014results. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that goes into making a tray that looks good,\u201d TSS CEO Jim Richards points out, \u201cblending the steel\u2019s grain at the joints, avoiding overheating and discoloration\u2014there\u2019s a big gap between \u2018good enough\u2019 and really good.\u201d Even if that tray looks good, it might not function well. \u201cIn the best case, every welded joint is a possible point of failure. Sloppy technique makes that worse, and runs the risk of unpredictably weakening the metal elsewhere in the tray. Either way, a homemade tray isn\u2019t going to have been rigorously UL-tested. It really is a gamble.\u201d TSS always minimizes joints. Instead of welding, they fabricate deal trays from one single sheet of stainless or armor plate steel whenever possible. Over the course of decades they\u2019ve developed a specialized hydraulic press break and a set of production processes that allow them to use this superior fabrication method and offer competitively priced high-security trays without resorting to offshore manufacturers. Jim Kirby of Custom Metal Products has worked extensively with high-quality steel doors and framing for security-conscious customers. After working with TSS to outfit a law-enforcement training facility, he noted: \u201cOur client was extremely happy with the finished product. I heard at least three times from one of our in-house engineers how beautiful [these deal trays] were. I\u2019ve been working with this engineer for six years, we\u2019ve seen a lot of metal; it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever described a product this way.\u201d Fast Delivery, No-Nonsense Customization TSS can accommodate cost-conscious customers with standard needs (e.g., ticket offices, gas stations, check cashers) or do custom projects. They regularly produce trays with custom dimensions or shapes in order to accommodate unique conditions. (E.g., broad and deep trays that allow late-shift motel receptionist to pass guests towels, scooped lock-cover trays for independent and compounding pharmacists, etc.) Most importantly, they do it all without busting the budget or adding weeks to a project\u2019s lead time. \u201cWe\u2019ll supply whatever you need,\u201d Jim explains. \u201cWe don\u2019t limit ourselves to trays, or what we can personally build on site. For many applications, we find that the best solution might be one of the styles of pre-fabricated Shure deal drawers we keep on hand. But you aren\u2019t limited to what\u2019s mass produced. We\u2019ve designed, engineered, and fabricated a lot of very application-specific trays, drawers, and custom package passers over the years. When I was first starting out, I used to build long, narrow interlock passers for passing pizza boxes and cabinet-sized passers for pawn shops\u2014and then there was the \u201c Texas Blood Box \u201c. These are the sorts of jobs where we distinguished ourselves early on, the kind that most interest us: The challenges. Give us what you\u2019re trying to achieve, and what the limitations are, and we can work within those confines.\u201d Categories", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim richards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim kirby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shure", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ul-rated standard cash trays", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "no-nonsense customization tss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "custom metal products", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:34.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c4aa4d01aa0d8ad514e5274bfbcedec7bba577f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Qb6m4ieU938XRp29sGltiwzMMrNxtArRWARCZtHRlvapLJoXxjRcU83Rj_c2YdABvWeRy0azKwNw_k8cifZPj9LUyB2EptSw-", "site_full": "www.deccanherald.com", "site": "deccanherald.com", "site_section": "http://www.deccanherald.com/rss/news.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Deccan Herald - News", "title": "Rajasthan: Muslim man hacked and set on fire alleging 'love jihad'", "title_full": "Rajasthan: Muslim man hacked and set on fire alleging 'love jihad'", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.deccanherald.com/page_images/original/2017/12/07/646780.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14842, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "500b62fa4feac91d2a526710faf27dbe371535bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Qb6m4ieU938XRp29sGltiwzMMrNxtArRWARCZtHRlvapLJoXxjRcU83Rj_c2YdABvWeRy0azKwNw_k8cifZPjK3EQITbaeh3Ct1y17yhKpQ--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "agni786", "published": "2017-12-07T09:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "This crook maasturbates and up-votes himself up his asss. .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:34.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c4aa4d01aa0d8ad514e5274bfbcedec7bba577f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Qb6m4ieU938XRp29sGltiwzMMrNxtArRWARCZtHRlvapLJoXxjRcU83Rj_c2YdABvWeRy0azKwNw_k8cifZPj9LUyB2EptSw-", "site_full": "www.deccanherald.com", "site": "deccanherald.com", "site_section": "http://www.deccanherald.com/rss/news.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Deccan Herald - News", "title": "Rajasthan: Muslim man hacked and set on fire alleging 'love jihad'", "title_full": "Rajasthan: Muslim man hacked and set on fire alleging 'love jihad'", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.deccanherald.com/page_images/original/2017/12/07/646780.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14842, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "761eb2e9a7e5b9634b82f2767776438e82731e20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Qb6m4ieU938XRp29sGltiwzMMrNxtArRWARCZtHRlvapLJoXxjRcU83Rj_c2YdABvWeRy0azKwNw_k8cifZPjK3EQITbaeh3rmKgUulaD9w--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Kittu", "published": "2017-12-07T09:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "bow bow bow barking dog...go complain DH....stupid mindless dog", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:34.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93a78a549fee108847f004cb8fe5874a30598600", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.y73yIunbVrstk3E2M4Z6WRW.l9Y8eWn33K1X_DnPmVHz_86ND5GKK_S3FUUJ.zyCBjD3kqsetHN3vjjHn3wZ5MGG.rOdSsVXIwtrzM5z_SJLIES2PrJoNJPNfr51YY6Ym8D7pHdzTg02t7I_kL2CZZHMTf6AFyrR9eeHE9a.V8BBz5Im4ZUhWkW2Xo4FSGqgfRC2wzu2W71PnfUKU2tZi9H14MktIPXxSwOdofqV2wQ--", "site_full": "www.burytimes.co.uk", "site": "burytimes.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.burytimes.co.uk/leisure/showbiz/rss/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Bury Times | Showbiz News", "title": "Will Bury actor Jamie Lomas survive in the latest creepy crawly filled I'm a Celebrity...

He then went on to become his sire's first Group winner less than a month later when victorious in the G3 Maribyrnong Plate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Australia's first major test for two-year-olds.\nTwo further Group winners in Believe'n'Succeed and Wilander , plus Stakes-winning duo Sugar Babe (also placed at G2 level that season) and Outdo saw Exceed And Excel crowned Champion first-season sire.\nMeanwhile, his first northern-hemisphere crop were also beginning to make their presence felt, as Flashmans Papers landed the coveted Listed Windsor Castle Stakes at Royal Ascot, followed by victory in the G2 Lowther Stakes for his daughter Infamous Angel .\nBigger and better was yet to come and Exceel And Excel reached a new high in February 2009, when Reward For Effort powered down the Caulfield straight to land the Blue Diamond and become his sire's first G1 winner.\nHelmet was the next outstanding two-year-old for his sire, winning at the highest level not once but twice during his juvenile campaign, with front-running victories in both the G1 Sires' Produce and G1 Champagne Stakes.\nHelmet went on to win the G1 Caulfield Guineas in record time at three and is now making his own name as a sire on the Darley roster in both Australia and Europe.\nHelmet was one of three G1 winners for Exceed And Excel that year, with smart sprinter Margot Did landing the Nunthorpe in the UK, while his smart son Excelebration continued his upward curve when winning the Prix du Moulin.\nExcelebration was a miler of the highest class, adding two further G1 victories to his record the following year. Racing during Frankel's era, he would surely have another three G1 wins to his name had he not gamely taken on one of the world's greatest racehorses throughout his three and four-year-old campaigns.\nThe following season and this time closer to home, two of Exceed And Excel's juvenile daughters began to make their presence felt on the Australian turf.\nBoth Overreach and Guelph had placed in Stakes contests on their racecourse debuts and the progressive pair were soon to take the 2012/13 two-year-old racing scene by storm.\nOverreach added her first Black Type win in the Widden Stakes, which was to become the first of three consecutive wins at Stakes level for this outstanding filly. A four-and-a-half-length romp in the G2 Reisling Stakes followed, propelling her to favouritism for the world's richest race for two-year-olds, the Golden Slipper.\nOverreach duly obliged in the Slipper, cruising clear inside the final furlong to provide Gai Waterhouse with her fifth winner of this historic race and cement her own position as Champion two-year-old.\nExceed And Excel recorded a truly remarkable feat that day at Rosehill, also siring the second and fourth-placed horses in Sidestep (who would later be named Champion two-year-old colt) and the aforementioned Guelph.\nJust a week after her tremendous effort in the Slipper, Guelph lined up in the G1 Sires' Produce Stakes at Randwick and coming with a withering late run, swept past her rivals to win by three quarters of a length. This was history repeating itself as not only did she become the second winner of the race for Exceed And Excel, she also emulated her dam Camarilla, who won back in 2007.\nGuelph went on to victory in the G1 Thousand Guineas and G1 Flight Stakes the following season and was subsequently crowned Australia's Champion three-year-old filly of 2013/14.\nThe very same season, Exceed And Excel was responsible for his second consecutive Champion two-year-old, this time in the form of Earthquake . Sheikh Mohammed's homebred won her first four starts \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including a hugely impressive victory in the G1 Blue Diamond before coming agonisingly close to winning the Golden Slipper, beaten less than a length.\nExceed And Excel's runners have had an impact at the highest level the world over, with his son Outstrip landing the G1 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf in the US, followed a few months later with victory for Amber Sky in the G1 Al Quoz Sprint at Meydan, while more recently multiple G1 winner Flamberge has continued to fly the flag for his sire at home.\nAnother of his international stars and provider of his sire's 250th Stakes win - Mr Stunning - lines up in this Sunday's G1 Kong Kong Sprint at Sha Tin where should he salute the judge for the third consecutive time, would provide a very fitting conclusion to 2017 for Exceed And Excel.\nNews from Darley.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

The troopers left Baton Rouge on Oct. 10, four days before the start of the conference, driving 12 hours a day. By the second evening, they had reached the Grand Canyon, where they checked into a Holiday Inn Express that charged more than $250 a night per room. Rather than driving about 330 miles from there to San Diego, they took a significant detour to Las Vegas and, the following night, checked into two suites at the Palazzo resort and casino in Las Vegas.

CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

The distrACT app which has been designed by doctors with young adults and University of Bristol researchers to provide easy, quick and discreet access to general health information and advice about self-harm. \nNationally, there are around 200,000 hospital emergency department cases of self-harm reported every year. The number of people who self-harm in Bristol alone is around 25,000. It is the highest predictor of suicide, with self-harm patients 35 times more likely to end their own lives. \nThrough distrACT , people will find reliable answers to their questions in plain language \u2013 anywhere, anytime, in private. \nExpert Self Care Ltd , who developed the app, is a UK social enterprise certified by the NHS England Information Standard as a provider of reliable health information. It is led by practising NHS doctors, and aims to give people at different stages in their lives access to reliable, clear and useful health information - 'on-the-go' and without the need for an internet connection. \nThe distrACT app has been created by doctors together with young adults and experts in self-harm and suicide prevention, including Bristol Health Partners and the Improving Care in Self-Harm Health Integration Team (STITCH HIT), University of Bristol and University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust , as well as other local and national organisations. Self-Injury Support and Self-Injury Self Help helped involve young people with experience of self-harm in the design. \nDr Knut Schroeder, a GP and founder of Expert Self-Care, said: \u201cThis app is designed for people when they\u2019re at their most vulnerable. It can be hard to seek help, so distrACT aims to make that process as easy as possible. The young people we worked with have informed the content and design, so we hope that it can become a reliable source of support during difficult times. \n\u201cWe named it distrACT for two reasons. People wanted it to be discreet, so we deliberately didn\u2019t use the term \u2018self-harm\u2019. And distraction from thoughts about self-harm can help people avoid actually going through with it.\u201d \nDesigned to work for people of all ages in the UK, it will be helpful to English speakers anywhere who are struggling with self-harm. Its aims include: Suicide prevention : Help reduce the risk of suicides in people who self-harm Crisis support : Advice on how to access help in an emergency, lists of useful emergency numbers and support sites, and tips for safety planning Signposting : Guide people who self-harm to further sources of support Self -care : Encourage self-monitoring strategies and self-management of symptoms Health literacy : Increase knowledge and understanding of self-harm and related issues Practical support : Give practical tips and provide ideas for safer alternatives to self-harm Stigma : Reduce stigma and dispel myths about self-harm Resilience : Help people develop skills to build resilience and increase well-being Accessing health services : Support decisions around accessing health services and other means of support \nDownload the app \nThe app is available to download in both the Apple App Store and Google Play . Further information \nAbout Expert Self-Care Ltd \nExpert Self-Care Ltd is a social enterprise based in Bristol led by practising NHS doctors and certified by the NHS England Information Standard as a producer of reliable health information.

Follow Lynsey Britannica to blockchain: Human knowledge has gone digital (Source: Getty) Lynsey Barber \nOne of the people who created Wikipedia, the digital encyclopedia and go-to source of knowledge online, has joined a startup that wants to create a similar source of knowledge using blockchain technology. \nLarry Sanger, who founded Wikipedia with Jimmy Whales and is credited with coming up with its name, has joined US startup Everipedia. \nRead more : Brussels promises \"soft touch\" blockchain regulation \n\"Blockchain technology is making exciting new things possible.\" said Sanger. \n\"I'm delighted to join this team which is poised to innovate on the Wikipedia model just as Wikipedia innovated on the Britannica model almost two decades ago. In an era of misinformation, the world stands to benefit enormously from a transparent, immutable and decentralised protocol for accessing and sharing knowledge,\" he added. \nBy using blockchain's distributed ledger technology, Everipedia hopes it can widen the sources of knowledge for article subjects beyond particular types of editors - for example, more than 90 per cent of Wikipedia editors are male. Those who submit information will be rewarded with a digital token that also acts as a share of the platform. \nRead more : A think tank wants the UK to put passports on the blockchain \nThe site already has more than three million users at present, and will switch to a blockchain based platform early next year, according to Wired . \n\"The goal of the ecosystem is to democratise the traditional encyclopedia model and economically align the incentives of the value creators and value extractors,\" said the company.
