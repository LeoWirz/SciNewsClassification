Pryor, has published a personal manifesto outlining all of the ways that humans who refuse to accept their natural biological dispositions are still being \u201ctriggered\u201d by the everyday world around them. Two of these triggers apparently include the LGBTQIA Center at UMKC, as well as the \u201crainbow flag,\u201d a common symbol of LGBTQ-etcetera \u2013 both of which Pryor claims are offensive because they\u2019re too \u201cwhite.\u201d \nPryor, whose skin color is ironically about as pasty white as it gets, explains in his paper how the LGBTQIA building where he works on campus is in close proximity to other buildings and spaces that apparently make his cohort of gender non-conforming snowflakes feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d One such space is the student center where Greek Life flags are displayed, as well as all of the Greek houses located just outside of campus \u2013 two symbols of \u201cstraightness\u201d and \u201cwhiteness\u201d that Pryor feels violate his LGBTQIA safe space. \nNon-straight students of all rainbow stripes at UMKC claim to be suffering great hardship merely at the sight of what they claim are symbols of \u201chomonormative whiteness,\u201d Pryor laments. In his view, anything that\u2019s not LGBTQIA represents the \u201cupholding (of) power for White, Christian, able-bodied, and middle-class people.\u201d In fact, the mere existence of non-LGBTQIA anything is more than Pryor and his fellow brain-addled bigots can bear, which is why this collective of crazies is basically now calling for their removal in order to pacify their need to exist in an even more insulated bubble of non-reality. \n\u201cBy featuring these organizations in such a visible way, the campus is communicating the importance of fraternity and sorority membership,\u201d Pryor whined to Campus Reform , a news outlet that covers this type of insanity for the amusement of the non-brain-damaged. \u201cWhat would it mean for the campus to hang all the LGBTQ pride flags in that space? Questions likely not considered in such a heterogendered environment,\u201d Pryor added, echoing the sentiments of a fellow LGBT-whatever student at UMK by the name of \u201cJackson,\u201d a \u201cqueer, black, trans man\u201d who reportedly also takes offense at the presence of Greek Life flags in the school\u2019s student center. Many non-LGBTQIA folks find militant gays, lesbians, and trannies \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 \u2013 should they be accommodated, too? \nBut that\u2019s not all, folks. Pryor\u2019s ongoing triggering episodes are also caused by his school\u2019s gyms and locker rooms, which like most gyms and locker rooms throughout history are visibly dominated by athletes who are fit and straight. The fact that a majority of the individuals who use UMKC\u2019s gyms and locker rooms aren\u2019t obese slobs with confusing body parts offends Pryor and his fellow gender-confused psychopaths \u2013 which, by the looks of Pryor himself , definitely explains a lot. \nGetting back to these offensive spaces, Pryor argues that they\u2019re just \u201cnot particularly accessible\u201d to LGBTQers because they invoke the \u201cpressure to be fit\u201d and the \u201cexpectations of manliness.\u201d Another UMKC student named \u201cJeremy,\u201d who identifies as a white, cisgender male, expressed similar intolerance for men\u2019s locker rooms, which he claims \u201crepresent a space dominated by straight cisgender men, where masculinity is rewarded, heterosexuality is supported by sexist and homophobic comments, and athleticism is attributed to a specific body and masculinist nature.\u201d \nGod forbid that good-looking, athletic men who prefer women be afforded a space in which to change their clothes and enjoy \u201cguy time\u201d with their fellow athletes. Many of them likely don\u2019t feel particularly comfortable having to see crybaby losers like Pryor and his ilk, who presumably (based on their complaints) simply don\u2019t have what it takes to live up to higher standards like fitness and not feeling the need to replace their penises with vaginas. \nYou can be sure that if UMKC\u2019s football or soccer teams put together an \u201cacademic\u201d paper demanding that all LGBTQ weirdos be removed and put out of sight in order to make everyone else on campus feel more comfortable, all hell would break loose and the apocalypse initiated. And maybe this is exactly what needs to happen to finally put the out-of-control, LGBTQ-etcetera mafia in its place. \nSources for this article include:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dece", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeremy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pryor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethan huff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan t. pryor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "umk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umkc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lgbtqia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lgbtqia programs & services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greek life", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of missouri", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kansas city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libtards", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:52.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f3f1aed1a03c77e4d26474cc386bf663da74a3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pl2NhdRZH3Pbrx11Lx9eaAcVuh70CkLar", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/b/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/b/ -

(Related: Mueller\u2019s entire \u201cRussian collusion\u201d probe of Team Trump is a politically motivated SCAM and must be shut down .) \nConsider all that we\u2019ve learned in recent weeks regarding just this one agent, Strzok: \n\u2014 Though Flynn was charged with lying to the FBI, two of Hillary Clinton\u2019s closest aides \u2014 Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills \u2014 also made false statements to Strzok, denying that they knew anything about their boss\u2019 email server. Emails from long before Strzok interviewed them both indicate that they did know , meaning they lied to the FBI. But they were never charged . \n\u2014 He was fingered by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general for having exchanged \u201canti-Trump sentiments and other comments that appeared to favor [Hillary] Clinton \u201d with FBI lawyer Lisa Page, with whom he was also having an extramarital affair. \n\u2014 He was the lead investigator in the criminal probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s illegal mishandling of classified materials via her home-brew email server \u2014 crimes she most definitely committed, according to numerous legal experts but for which she was never even recommended for charges. \n\u2014 He was also the one who softened language in a statement then-FBI Director James Comey read to the press in July 2016. The original language in Comey\u2019s statement described Clinton\u2019s behavior as \u201cgrossly negligent,\u201d which is taken directly from the statute, to \u201cextremely careless,\u201d which has no legal weight. \n\u2014 And again, let\u2019s not forget that he was on Mueller\u2019s staff and that Mueller is investigating Team Trump and the president himself as a special counsel for \u201ccollusion,\u201d though that\u2019s not even a violation of the law . \nThere are more examples of FBI malfeasance and politicization: Enter, once again, James Comey: \n\u2014 During his July 2016 press conference to lay out the Clinton criminal investigation \u2014 which in and of itself was outside of standard FBI procedure to not publicly discuss an ongoing case \u2014 he laid out a list of criminal activities she had engaged in, but then refused to characterize the activities as criminal in nature (hence the Strzok language alteration). Comey was a career Justice Department and FBI official; he knew the statute that Clinton had violated. He knew that her behavior was \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d (as he himself wrote in his first draft) but then permitted that language (taken directly from the criminal code) to be changed into something no one had ever heard of. \n\u2014 We have also discovered that Comey was never going to recommend Clinton be charged in the first place . Reports earlier this year noted that Comey\u2019s memo exonerating her months in advance , while the investigation was still underway. The drafting of the memo occurred even before Comey and FBI agents had interviewed Clinton herself . \nIn addition to the FBI, the Office of Special Counsel and the Justice Department have also been shown to be utterly corrupt . \n\u201cThe agencies have, in the past, gone light on Democrats such as Hillary Clinton, but laid perjury traps for Trump officials like Flynn, who served as national security adviser for President Donald Trump for less than a month,\u201d Lifezette reports. \nJ.D.

I love to be staff to help out the players of the server.I will be very active because this is my best server that i have ever played on.\r\ni want to become staff because i love helping out other players on the server, So that they want to keep playing on the server and not have to worry about when there going to be moved in discord. I take pride in making sure that the players have the best time on the server and I consider it a failure on my behalf if a player has a bad time.I want to become staff because It's the only thing I do on Minecraft. Ever since I resigned from previous servers I pretty much haven't opened Minecraft once since moderation and administration Is the only thing I do on this game, It's the only thing I still find fun In the game, I want to be a part of something new and build a nice and better community. I Would Like To Be accepted for staff simply because i know i can do a good job and help out players in need. I've wanted to to be staff on a good server since Noxious and this seems like a wonderful opportunity. I am super efficient and think I could really help out the Noxious network. I will spectate players and see if they are hacking or modding. I remember Good memories of hcf servers and lately I haven't been having much fun on servers due to hackers and a toxic community. I want to make the community better. so everyone can be happy and have fun.Removing Advertisers from the networking- I know this is a big thing on somewhat smaller server because they have less staff on it so it\u2019s easier for them to Advertise because they want get banned as quick as on bigger servers. I believe you should accept me at staff because I'm fit and mature for this job. I continue each day to help this server out in anyway possible such as, telling staff if someone is grieving, hacking and so forth. I would like this application to stand out from other peoples staff application's because I don't want to put the same old stuff as everyone else does and I hope to have a big shot at this staff position. When I get on my computer I jump right in to minecraft and right on teamspeak. I'm on a lot and I'm very active, I heard you were in need of staff so as soon as I could I hopped right on this website because I feel like I'm the right guy for this job. I love to see servers grow and grow and I would love to join you guys on that journey. I'm mature for my age and I love to laugh and joke around. But trust me, when i'm doing my job I act very serious in what I do. Some other reasons you should accept me as staff is because you will see a big change in this community. I love helping other and doing whats right when it comes to minecraft servers. I'm willing to put my whole experience on the line for this job as a staff member I hope to become the very best staff member I can possibly be. I've been striving for staff on here for a while but before I made an application I decided to higher my playtime in game. I did this so you guys have a better idea of how much I play. I know all the commands because all I do is watch staff series. So I'm willing to take this job and use it to help this server and this community out. I have been doing this for a while now and I hope to get a opportunity to become staff on here. Please give me a chance in this position. I also should be accepted because of these reasons.\r\nAnother reason to why I am applying is because of my experience! I believe my experience is a lot better than other people that may be applying.\r\n\u200b\r\nImprovement:\r\n\r\nI think I can improve the staff team a lot, I bring lots of qualities to the staff team if I were to be accepted.\r\n\r\nMaturity - I understand how to act around players in game and in TeamSpeak. I do not insult other players or try to start a 'Riot' in chat ever. I know that players will attempt to annoy you sometimes, it is a given on Minecraft, but I won't let it affect me and I will not reply with any rude remarks or even reply at all unless they are asking a question.\r\nAlso, I can spectate a reported player and answer questions in game or in Teamspeak at the same time.\r\n\r\nConsideration - I am not an unfair person. I will consider both players arguments in a story and then analyse both points to decide what action I should take, I will never make any quick decisions to get something out of the way.\r\n\r\nBias - I will never favour my friend or a player I like over a player that I don't like. I will treat everyone fairly and give everyone the same treatment. I will make sure that no unfair judgements are made and that the correct action is taken place.\r\n\r\nOrganisation - Whenever I punish a player I make sure that I have all the facts laid out in front of me so I am sure that I am always sure the punishments I give are deserved and not false. Usually I keep the screenshots I take when punishing a player for two weeks or so just incase the player appeals his punishment.\r\n\r\nLazy - I am not lazy and I refuse to slack, I enjoy what I do and I believe it would be wrong to have a member on the staff team who ignores players occasionally. I will always try my hardest to solve problems and make sure they are properly resolved.\r\n\r\nRules - I obey the rules and do my best to enforce them. If a player breaks the rules I will punish them accordingly. I will also make sure that they understand they are breaking a rule so they don't do it again.\r\n\r\nCommunication - I have a working microphone that does not sound bad (blue yeti) , i have discord, Skype, teamspeak and telegram.\r\n\r\nSocial - I enjoy talking to other players in chat and getting to know people, I will never ignore a player if they need me for actual help or even just someone to talk to.\r\n\r\nLoyalty - I am very loyal to servers I staff on, if they treat me well I will try my best to repay them by keeping the community clean, however I won't be treated like a dog at the same time. On previous servers where I have been a member of staff, if I see corruption or disrespect towards me or any other member of staff from a higher up member of staff I will alert the owners or staff managers, if they don't do anything I will not let myself be pushed around, I doubt this will happen with Clarity though!\r\n\r\nTeamspeak - In TeamSpeak I am calm with regular players and I am always polite.

Canadian Press Posted Dec 7, 2017 4:00 am EST Last Updated Dec 7, 2017 at 6:20 am EST In this May 26, 2017, photo, leaders of the G7, from left, European Council President Donald Tusk, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, U.S. President Donald J. Trump, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker pose during a group photo for the G7 summit in the Ancient Theatre of Taormina ( 3rd century BC) in the Sicilian citadel of Taormina, Italy. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Andrew Medichini \nOTTAWA \u2013 The Liberal government wants to lift the mystery surrounding the G7 summit as it prepares to host the gathering next year, in hopes that Canadians will feel more included and, perhaps, less inclined to protest on the periphery. \n\u201cThe idea is to get input from Canadians,\u201d Peter Boehm, the Canadian G7 summit sherpa, said in an interview with The Canadian Press. \n\u201cWhat are they thinking about some of the big themes in the world, whether it\u2019s economic inclusion, what the jobs of the future might look like, climate change, energy and, indeed, some of the big foreign policy and security questions that might be out there?\u201d said Boehm. \nThe efforts to open the process up to Canadians includes Boehm speaking at a public event Thursday night, organized by the Toronto branch of the Canadian International Council and the G7 Research Group at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto. \n\u201cA lot of this is listening and then feeding it through, but also a chance for us to demystify what the G7 is,\u201d said Boehm, who is preparing for Canada to assume the G7 presidency in January, six months before it hosts the summit at a resort in La Malbaie, Que. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a big gathering where you see a lot of people and even more security.\u201d \nHeavy \u2014 and armed \u2014 security presence is a common sight on the edges of G7 summits, where the need to protect the leaders of powerful countries takes on added urgency due to crowds gathered for demonstrations, which have sometimes turned into violent clashes with police. \nThe turbulent Toronto G20 summit in 2010, which included mass arrests and cases of police misconduct, reverberated for years. \nBoehm suggested involving Canadians along the road to the G7 summit is one way to get ahead of the issue. \n\u201cWe all have the right to express our views and we fully expect that there will be people who will be expressing their views,\u201d said Boehm. \u201cMy own view is that it is best to do that from an informed perspective, so that\u2019s part of the reason for the outreach.\u201d \nStill, Boehm said the summit organizers will nonetheless be prepared for protests. \n\u201cIn the past at large gatherings there has also been infiltration by less desirable elements who do not want to express views nor hear views, but they want to create mayhem,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, on the security side, we will certainly be ready for that.\u201d \n\u2014 Follow @smithjoanna

Tags: allergies , asthma , benefits of animals , environment , farm animals , farm life , green living , immune system , immunity , lifelong immunity , Microbes , outdoor living , outdoors , overall health , parenting , superbug resistance \n( Natural News ) Growing up on a farm can be a wonderful experience for children. All the hard work that can be involved in maintaining a farm is balanced by the opportunity to marvel at nature in action on a daily basis and spend time outdoors. However, the benefits don\u2019t stop at fresh air and sunshine; a new study has found that the microbes children are exposed to on farms can set the stage for a healthy immune system throughout their life. \nAbout a third of kids around the world have allergies today, and allergies and asthma alike have been rising in industrialized countries. There is one exception to this rule, however, and that is among children who live on farms. The connection is made even clearer by the fact that kids who are living in the same village but not on a farm develop allergies and asthma at faster rates than their farm-living neighbors. \nThis is because farms expose kids to a broad range of microbes that can protect them by allowing their immune systems to develop naturally without overreacting to substances that are harmless, as is the case with allergies. \nNow, scientists have illustrated that it\u2019s not just the microbes but the farm animals themselves that help strengthen young immune systems and stave off asthma and allergies. The study, which was published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology , singled out a substance common in vertebrates known as sialic acid as being responsible for this protective effect. \nIt\u2019s not present in humans naturally, but the form Neu5Gc can be absorbed by them by contacting animals or eating food that has animal origins, where it then integrates into the person\u2019s glycoproteins. \nOnce humans have come into contact with Neu5Gc, their bodies create antibodies. After measuring the concentrations of these antibodies in serum samples that were taken from children who were part of a pair of epidemiological studies, the researchers were able to make the correlation with asthma incidence. Farm children had many more antibodies against the Neu5Gc substance, and they also had significantly less asthma . \nMore than 1,000 children were studied to reach this conclusion. A mouse model drove the point home, as mice who consumed the Neu5Gc molecules in food noted improved pulmonary functions. Farm life benefits kids in lots of ways \nA study from Australia\u2019s University of Melbourne reached a similar conclusion. After studying the life experiences of a total of 10,000 adults across 14 countries, they discovered that kids who lived on the farm from birth through age five had a 54 percent lower likelihood of developing asthma than children from cities. Farm kids also had a 57 percent lower likelihood of symptoms of nasal allergies. The findings were consistent across the countries studied, which were situated in Europe and Australia. \nAn even bigger study into how farm living affects children\u2019s immunity was carried out by the Asthma and Allergy Research Group of Munich University . That study looked at the parents of around 80,000 European kids, nearly 10,000 of whom had been raised on farms . The farm-raised kids had significantly less asthma, hay fever and allergies than those who visited farms occasionally or never. \nGrowing up on a farm is a great way to set up a child for a healthy life. Farms situated away from industrialized areas have lots of fresh air that is far less polluted than city air, and spending time in the sun is great for boosting your body\u2019s Vitamin D production \u2013 something that can prevent a host of diseases including cancer. The life lessons learned by observing animals and plants in their natural environment are extremely valuable, and having a healthy immune system is just the icing on the cake. \nSources include:",

Not only is the landscape breathtaking and the weather comfortably mild year round, but this iconic liberal enclave is also a \u201csanctuary city\u201d that provides refuge for people who live in the United States illegally, even going so far as to offer get-out-of-jail-free cards to any and all illegals who commit crimes there. \nOne of the most recent examples of this was the acquittal of an illegal immigrant murderer by the name of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate. Despite confessing to the 2015 murder of Kate Steinle as she walked on a busy San Francisco pier with her father, Zarate was declared to be \u201cnot guilty\u201d of this crime. The only crime the jury convicted Zarate of committing was felony possession of a firearm, staying true to the city\u2019s anti-gun reputation. \nThe shocking announcement of the jury\u2019s decision was quick to make national headlines, illustrating how \u201csanctuary\u201d status has turned many formerly great cities into cesspools of crime and lawlessness. And San Francisco, as desirable as it might seem to some, is certainly no exception. \n\u201cThe jury of six women and six men considered charges against Garcia Zarate that include murder, assault with a deadly weapon and being a felon in possession of a firearm in the death of (Kathryn) Steinle, a 32-year-old Pleasanton native and San Francisco resident,\u201d local news affiliates reports. Defense attorney in this travesty of a case had the gall to threaten President Trump and Vice President Pence \nZarate\u2019s lawyer in the case is fully aware of the fact that millions of law-abiding Americans are absolutely outraged over the ruling, which has allowed his illegal Mexican alien client , who just so happens to be a five-time deportee and seven-time convicted felon, to once again be turned loose on society. But rather than sympathize with them, he dug in his heels and actually lobbed accusations and threats against President Trump and his cabinet. \n\u201cFor those who might criticize this verdict \u2013 there are a number of people who have commented on this case in the last couple of years; the Attorney General of the United States and the President and Vice President of the United States,\u201d stated Matt Gonzalez, Zarate\u2019s defense attorney. \n\u201cLet me just remind them: They are themselves under investigation by a special prosecutor in Washington D.C. and they may soon avail themselves of the presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt, so I ask that they reflect on that before they comment or disparage the results of this case.\u201d \nGonzalez sure has a lot of nerve making such statements after shamelessly fighting for the release of his convicted criminal alien client. He\u2019s now got a whole lot of blood on his hands, as does the city of San Francisco which, had it done its job in reporting Zarate to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, this murder never would have happened in the first place. \nWhat San Francisco is communicating to the world with this whole saga is that it would rather harbor criminal aliens who don\u2019t even belong here in order to maintain its image of \u201ctolerance\u201d and \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d than protect the innocent, law-abiding citizens who live there legally. This is the nature of \u201csanctuary\u201d zones in general, a full list of which is available through the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). \n\u201cWhen jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities, they put the public\u2019s safety at risk ,\u201d commented Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the case. \u201cSan Francisco\u2019s decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.\u201d \nFollow more news on totally insane current events at Insanity.news . \nSources for this article include:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kathryn) steinle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pence  zarate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zarate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose ines garcia zarate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt gonazalez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt gonzalez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathryn steinle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garcia zarate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gonzalez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethan huff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kate steinle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garcia z\u00e1rate", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "natural news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "customs enforcement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for immigration studies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pleasanton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libtards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:54.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e6e4e6aef62e56e83aea4631a40c8b9306bc0d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pl2NhdRZH3PbRnbK5QWbiC_7k_gjYQ9rN", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/b/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/b/ - Random - 4chan", "title": "tiny tit appreciation", "title_full": "/b/ - tiny tit appreciation - Random - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T10:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 87, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.925, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e84103061a69afbe0f64ab627978af3d5cb7f70c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pl2NhdRZH3PbRnbK5QWbiC4sxvYA58W0fHHAAp.klv6w-", "ord_in_thread": 36, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>753147947\nIs that old-old Morgan from like 2014?

First of all, we have a big requirement on this site - canon friendliness and originality. While I applaud you for already trying to work within the existing the canon and not turning to plagiarism, humanity didn't actually have the capability to start colonising other systems until 2291 , when the slipspace drive was first invented by humanity. So I'd change their settlement date until after that. \nThere is one thing I'd like to mention as well - I'd try not to make this faction as technologically advanced, wealthy or as powerful as the UEG. The UEG had centuries to mature into a superpower, thanks to it already establishing colonies in the Sol system. After the Human-Covenant War, they may be able to compete in economics thanks to them losing so much during it, but technologically and militarily the UEG will still have the upper hand. \nLastly, I've added the Writer Template to your article. Make sure you always put it on any new articles you make - its sort-of a requirement here. That's really all I have to say. If you need any help or have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me or any of the administrators :) NCF TALK - 18:02, Wednesday 15th November 2017 (Australian Eastern Standard Time) Alright mate, you've seem to have made substantial edits on your other articles, but you haven't done anything to even acknowledge the issues I have presented above. Normally I would be more patient, but seeing as these require only a few word-changes and I have linked this page to you, I'm sure you're trying to ignore them. Elapsed Time: 530 hours Reason(s) of NCF (3) Humanity did not leave the Solar system until sometime after the development of the slipspace drive in 2291 . As such, there's no way that the TEC could've been founded on a planet outside the solar system in 2160 or any of the years prior to 2291. No other human government can be richer or wealthier than the UEG, because they have a massive industrial and economic base they can call upon across all their colonies. There's simply no way you could compete with the UEG, especially if you were established after they were. The final issue, and this goes for all your articles, is that they don't appear to be relevant to Halo at all - instead, you seem to be building your universe in complete isolation. What I mean is that outside of comparisons to the UEG, there's nothing to suggest these articles could be considered a part of the Halo universe. Solution(s) (3) Change the date of its establishment to a few years after 2291. I would get rid of any comparisons of the TEC's wealthiness to the UEG's. You need to make their interactions with the UEG and the Covenant Remnants more notable - start describing how the first contact between the UEG or Covenant Remnants goes, how their discovery affects the state of galactic affairs. What about describing a cold war rising between, as ONI and by extension the UNSC seeks to reunite humanity under their authority which threatens the TEC's existence? Or even how the Created react to discovering another human empire that can potentially resist them. In summary, there needs to be more links to Halo Lore in general. Other comments In your other articles, I've noticed that you haven't been putting your Writer template on them. Its a requirement on this wiki, so in case of vandalism we immediately know who the page belongs to. Just copy and paste the following code to your articles: {{Writer|Dester123}} Vote for Namespace The author has made no attempt to fix this page according to the NCF-guidelines.
