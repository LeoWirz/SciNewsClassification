The Republican-led House passed a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \nThe House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines \u2013 a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. \nOn a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty \u2014 who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting \u2013 said the bill would undermine states' rights, \"hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,\" according to The Associated Press. \nThe NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a \"watershed\" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure \"all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.\" \nIn the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats.

You are standing on the start line of your season's A-race. All your training has been leading to this moment. You know what you have to do and how to do it. Game face on, good to go....\n\nThen all of a sudden you hear an announcement telling you not to go into the water. In fact the announcement is that the swim leg of your A-leg triathlon is cancelled and all people need to meet at the swim exit as your race has just become duathlon of sorts.\n\nThat of course is exactly the scenario that faced everyone at the Busselton Ironman and 70.3 on the weekend.\n\nFor everyone in the 70.3 is all happened quite quickly. They either got pulled out of the water or they didn't enter it and they went straight from there to the swim exit. After a short delay they were started from there. They didn't have too much time for pondering and they got on with it relatively quickly.\n\nFor the Ironman athletes though, they were all told to stop what they were doing and stand by their bikes if they were in transition and await further instructions. 45 minutes later those instructions came and it was to tell people to go to the swim exit and prepare for a duathlon. Between that news and race start there was a good 45 minutes and so everybody had a good chance to have a think about what was coming next. From that thinking, by far the most common question I was asked was, 'should I race any differently?'\n\nIt was quite understandable that the question came about. After all, the race dynamic had just changed significantly. No swim leg meant that people who would usually be 10 minutes back started the bike with no deficit. No swim meant that people were fresher too. People wondered if they should go harder on the bike, really push it to try and maximise the advantage.\n\nMy advice to those people who asked was,\n\n'Dear god no, do not change your race plan. This race is simply an Ironman that starts after the swim, nothing else has changed'.\n\nThe reasoning for this advice was this:\n\nAn Ironman is a really, really, rea y long race. It is not a sprint, or a walk in the park. If you work beyond your limit at the start of an Ironman bike leg, you will pay the price either in the second half of the bike or on the run, it really is as simple as that. Go hard early, hurt later. Ironman is just too damn far to fake it. Have a plan and stick to it. No swim leg doesn't change that plan, it doesn't suddenly increase your FTP by 20W, doesn't suddenly make you an uber biker or make the ride 160km. Ride to your plan just as if the swim leg had happened.\n\nThe fact that the day ended up being searingly hot just made this advice even more relevant.\n\nInterestingly, watching the bike times, I am not sure how many people followed my philosophy for the bike leg. I wasn't watching everyone in the race, but from what I saw there were some very quick bike times. I think I saw more bike times in the 4:40s and 4:30s than I would normally expect for an age-group field, and this wasn't a particularly fast day. To me that says quite a few people simply went too hard, either by design or because they got excited and carried away.\n\nWhat I saw after the bike though was that on that brutal run leg, the people who got off the bike first weren't the people who crossed the line first. There are exceptions to that observation obviously, but I saw the top 5 of a few age groups completely change during the run leg as people suffered and faded away. That says to me that those people suffered for their cycling efforts on the run.\n\nIn the end all this is easy to say in hindsight, 20 20 and all that. Anyone who raced on Sunday, and particularly those who made the finish line are very worthy of respect. However, watching the race unfold, I can't help but wonder if some people could have executed their days just a little bit smarter., whether doing so may have made their days a bit more manageable.\n\nIronman is definitely a test of body and will, but it is also a test of the mind, and I don't think I have seen that more true that at Ironman WA last Sunday.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ironman wa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "busselton ironman", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:42.034+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad5250071566e27a8f2a16e4aeddd4b007525030", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRbkKoVHuOVT61_LfZT_V38eyE_jlW9Onw_XNOGrtTMnVC2FyImm7DYaAYsisAwyg_eS7faajMFi56a_W2fKyuxftZ9VQvf3JNMQYlah.PAmnlBPkPKd8n5shPvVFGh4HiToAfpSdVMpzFL7Vbo9jVz", "site_full": "uniontradejournal.com", "site": "uniontradejournal.com", "site_section": "http://uniontradejournal.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Union Trade Journal", "title": "Breaking Down The Technical Indicators For Star Paper Mills Limited (STARPAPER.NS)", "title_full": "Breaking Down The Technical Indicators For Star Paper Mills Limited (STARPAPER.NS)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad5250071566e27a8f2a16e4aeddd4b007525030", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRbkKoVHuOVT61_LfZT_V38eyE_jlW9Onw_XNOGrtTMnVC2FyImm7DYaAYsisAwyg_eS7faajMFi56a_W2fKyuxftZ9VQvf3JNMQYlah.PAmnlBPkPKd8n5shPvVFGh4HiToAfpSdVMpzFL7Vbo9jVz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Journal Contributor", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Breaking Down The Technical Indicators For Star Paper Mills Limited (STARPAPER.NS)", "text": "Privacy Policy Breaking Down The Technical Indicators For Star Paper Mills Limited (STARPAPER.NS) \nThe Average True Range of ATR For Shares of Star Paper Mills Limited (STARPAPER.NS) have trended downward over the past 10 bars, indicating bearish momentum for the equity near-term.

The Relative   is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d. \nFor further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator. In terms of moving averages, the 200-day is currently at 191.40, the 50-day is 196.20, and the 7-day is resting at 206.62. Moving averages are a popular trading tool among investors. Moving averages can be used to help filter out the day to day noise created by other factors. MA\u2019s may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock. Many traders will use moving averages for different periods of time in conjunction with other indicators to help gauge future stock price action. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "star paper mills limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr for shares of star paper mills limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:42.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45bfa2c410c5f28f22c622de07d165eea787805a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9UNs_b7vYkcd3KwHZ_cMJgyqR2V6qaf744E4VdvpVmjsz_Az1wDlZ.9RUrkOB0VjfI0m.Sq7nvlSH76VPRGnqT1BMvjLhKnbgK70egkL5vhuX_6hKzSyOUEOrUuaY2oyrJen_dcLXiq2KbceKxRCZsNc9Xs1JIes0-", "site_full": "www.essentialbaby.com.au", "site": "essentialbaby.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/forums/index.php?/forum/111-what-do-you-think/", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "What Do You Think? - Essential Baby", "title": "Do you spend evenly for Christmas?", "title_full": "Do you spend evenly for Christmas? - What Do You Think? - Essential Baby", "published": "2017-12-06T22:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/forums/public/style_images/master/meta_image.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40097, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "190080e0800b890acae88f33787b318f086fc4ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9UNs_b7vYkcd3KwHZ_cMJgyqR2V6qaf744E4VdvpVmjsz_Az1wDlZ.9RUrkOB0VjfI0m.Sq7nvlSH76VPRGnqT1BMvjLhKnbgK70egkL5vhuX_6hKzSyOUEOrUuaY2oyrJen_dcLXiq2KbceKxRCZshBewZJ4QwzJ0L5bf81TX5w--", "ord_in_thread": 22, "author": "Hands Up", "published": "2017-12-07T01:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "A $270 dance bag?

(JMTAUTOLTD.BO). The Relative   is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d. \nFor further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator. In terms of moving averages, the 200-day is currently at 7.30, the 50-day is 4.73, and the 7-day is resting at 5.19. Moving averages are a popular trading tool among investors. Moving averages can be used to help filter out the day to day noise created by other factors. MA\u2019s may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock. Many traders will use moving averages for different periods of time in conjunction with other indicators to help gauge future stock price action. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald lambert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jmt auto ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:43.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68c332b26ca986a37025876101438198f5a93406", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNhmZEbhKAgd39hSEndSTmYpp5f3r_votpAIkuN7DFvS0n.tkp0a22ahyzDL3IZF9hkeheTqk6epohAnoTeVatole3VUZL3bg-", "site_full": "www.thetechgame.com", "site": "thetechgame.com", "site_section": "https://www.thetechgame.com/rss.php?rss=forums", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "The Tech Game", "title": "What State are you from?", "title_full": "What State are you from?", "published": "2017-12-06T23:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thetechgame.com/images/media-logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 37874, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68c332b26ca986a37025876101438198f5a93406", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNhmZEbhKAgd39hSEndSTmYpp5f3r_votpAIkuN7DFvS0n.tkp0a22ahyzDL3IZF9hkeheTqk6epohAnoTeVatole3VUZL3bg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T23:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "What State are you from?", "text": "Joined: Feb 04, 2016 1 Year Member Posts: 125 Reputation Power: 23 Motto: Don't ever look down, be comfortable with who you are, our flaws are what make us perfect.

Nowadays, literature can be classified into numerous categories and subgenres and each one has different characteristics that define it. In society and pop culture, the process of composing these works of literature can further be categorized into different aspects, including one for professionals, those that have a journalistic approach, and some for academic purposes.\n\nNot only that, the act of composing messages and creating these works has also become a primary means of communicating and relaying new information in most societies. Due to this, a person needs to learn how to effectively incorporate it into their lives to adapt. There are all kinds of workshops and classes that focus on its practice and propagation. In line with that, the succeeding paragraphs will be focusing on the innumerable benefits of joining creative writing tutoring .\n\nAny person that joins a course the focuses on this area has to compose a lot of works and share them with the class and appointed instructor. This means that constant practicing enables them to widen their range of vocabulary, which entails learning new words and their meaning, to use them in an appropriate manner. After the entire workshop is over, they are guaranteed to have a wider knowledge on words and their meaning.\n\nWhen given a new task or assignment to work on, it often entails thinking creatively on what is the best way to portray certain ideas or thoughts and is also a great way to learn about different styles. For some writers, this provides a chance to learn new things and to adapt certain elements of different genres into their personal aesthetics. By developing their prowess in problem solving, they can apply the same process to other areas in their lives.\n\nOnce the student is able to comply with the assigned papers or projects, it will be submitted to their appointed instructor. This is done because the work is then assessed to determine if they have shown improvements and also to make the necessary alterations if deemed necessary. By doing this process for every output, the student shall learn better composition practices and will further improve grammar and even the spelling and usage of certain words learned.\n\nFurthermore, joining a workshop or securing a tutor to help you with the creative process of writing will challenge your skills in organizing. The entire process involves you constantly organizing ideas to create a better outline or plot for a story or essay. This is most apparent in writing stories or screenplays, wherein one has to ensure that the plot makes sense and is written in a chronological manner, where readers will not have a hard time comprehending the contents or timeline.\n\nAt times, some pieces of work requires the author to adapt a persuasive prose or voice. Learning how to master the art of persuasion will bring you many benefits, not just in writing but in other pursuits as well. That involves communicating with other persons and even in getting that new promotion or position you have always wanted.\n\nParticipating during these sessions will sometimes involve interaction with other students, especially in terms of debating or sharing differing ideas. Due to this, one becomes better rounded and tolerant of other opinions. Most people that join these tutoring sessions have various backgrounds and reasons for joining, so spending that much time with them allows you to leave the entire experience with more knowledge.\n\nApart from that, joining a course is an excellent way to meet new people and develop new friendships with them. Since you already share a common experience and passion, it makes for a great foundation for a friendship. Not only that, it can aid you later on when networking for jobs or broadening your contacts for business.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can find an overview of the advantages you get when you use creative writing tutoring services at http://www.writers.consulting right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "deborah morgan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:44.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1aaf402ae15f914a8490c60f57e1e42918101c8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8fE.HioO0icyqKwGbXO2pMVi.0TihvTGISoD2sGov.Aq3xGv2id3fIztB5szckYhtT4NkYNDN01A--", "site_full": "www.mersuforum.net", "site": "mersuforum.net", "site_section": "http://www.mersuforum.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=51", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "Mersuforum.net \u2022 N\u00e4yt\u00e4 alue - MB-Keskustelut", "title": "impressive considering Jeff Carter has been out since the m", "title_full": "Mersuforum.net \u2022 katso viestiketjua - impressive considering Jeff Carter has been out since the m", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "FI", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1aaf402ae15f914a8490c60f57e1e42918101c8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8fE.HioO0icyqKwGbXO2pMVi.0TihvTGISoD2sGov.Aq3xGv2id3fIztB5szckYhtT4NkYNDN01A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kirjoittaja elvafeng", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "impressive considering Jeff Carter has been out since the m", "text": "Remember when Sidney Crosby was struggling?

If you are worried about your credit info being breached but didn\u2019t freeze all three agencies, do that now.", "text": "Why this is important: With the recent Equifax breach, plenty of people have put freezes on their credit reports (for good reason). But if you only froze one, someone can now still take out a loan on your name if they have the rest of your info.\nWhat changed: Until recently, Fannie Mae required all three credit reports to actually report for them to buy a loan from a bank. The change now allows for your report to be frozen with one credit reporting agency, but the other two must be unfrozen.\nWhy this matters: Your local bank might sell the mortgages they originate to Fannie Mae. Many small and even moderately sized banks have investors they sell mortgages to. Fannie Mae is one of the largest investors here. The loan must be originated and underwritten to Fannie Mae\u2019s standards for them to purchase it. This means that Fannie Mae\u2019s guidelines impact your local banks\u2019 guidelines if they sell to them. This change means that other banks will now be allowing this same thing. So if you\u2019re worried about your credit but didn\u2019t freeze it with all three agencies, do that now.\nEdit: source\u2014I\u2019m a technical writer at a bank and am rewriting our internal procedures on what we accept based on the above as I type this.\nEdit 2: I\u2019m not suggesting Fannie Mae originates loans. The thing is that their decisions as an investor will impact how banks do business. Fannie Mae says they\u2019ll take loans that are riskier? Banks that sell to Fannie Mae will start originating those riskier loans because they know they can sell them. This is about Fannie Mae (being a large investor) saying they\u2019ll take loans with one frozen score, so some banks will start accepting that too and not require that it be unfrozen. All I was saying was, if you were concerned but thought freezing one or two was good enough, that\u2019s not necessarily the case.\n submitted by /u/poopsmitherson\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:45.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b565fbfd9418e7f5d9316e55e6c072d4f73a36fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsXSJfx6_ulzymPkO28pdl1W20_UOAGQz6_dI_5gU7EKO04COLI1t31WhwLmysaV8_1jb6ES7yTK50Z0Tls08EEzgCyl93c93sV", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "comments : personalfinance", "title": "Atrampoline Heads up: Fannie Mae will now be buying and accepting loans made with one credit report frozen.

(PA Graphics) \nA further 11 are in serviced apartments and four are staying with loved ones, meaning 118 remain in emergency accommodations. \nThe local authority was accused of making \u201cone broken promise after another\u201d, having previously expressed confidence every survivor would be out of emergency rooms by Christmas. \nMs Campbell said on Wednesday: \u201cAll of us sympathise with those who are still living in hotels with their children, especially at Christmas. \n\u201cI have always said we can only move at the pace at which victims and survivors feel comfortable: no-one should be rushed into making such an important decision about where they are going to live. \n\u201cHowever, I do accept, as we have heard tonight and last night at scrutiny, for some the pace is painfully slow.\u201d \nCllr Elizabeth Campbell: \u201cOur priority is to find permanent home for the 209 households from #Grenfell Tower & Walk who lost their homes. 42 households have moved in and 49 have accepted an offer\u201d #RBKCCouncilMtg \n\u2014 RBKC (@RBKC) December 6, 2017 \nSurvivors have expressed frustration at how regularly the rehousing deadline has shifted, stretching back to the immediate aftermath of the June 14 inferno. \nDays after the fire Theresa May initially appeared to pledge that everyone left destitute would be in temporary new homes within three weeks. \nSo far only 42 families have moved into permanent addresses, meaning the remaining 166, including 48 temporary places, could spend the festive period without a new home, survivors say. \nCurrently 29 of the families still in hotels have children, meaning many youngsters will likely wake up in hotel rooms on Christmas morning. \nCllr Elizabeth Campbell: \u201cNo-one should be rushed into making such an important decision about where they are going to live.

Is there anything I should avoid doing?\n(This is my first post after years of lurking, take it easy on me.)\n submitted by /u/DeanDaShay\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:47.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2494f51ffd5e5399a0cf3821878f34834d0e8ad7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsXFY.zoxI3F73r3H8EThdNM95yAOWwEKvI1csKYmOUGdL3HGsA7zesX5N7L0Tl3Lu5IynUVBliR0wSEhD0IAmBw2sCMpoyXc3hH_35dEAlGhw-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "comments : personalfinance", "title": "ybs1 What are the most reputable charities to give to and what are ways of knowing whether a charity is highly committed to serving the world and not just themselves as a non-profit organization?", "title_full": "ybs1 comments on What are the most reputable charities to give to and what are ways of knowing whether a charity is highly committed to serving the world and not just themselves as a non-profit organization?", "published": "2017-12-07T10:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.849, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2494f51ffd5e5399a0cf3821878f34834d0e8ad7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsXFY.zoxI3F73r3H8EThdNM95yAOWwEKvI1csKYmOUGdL3HGsA7zesX5N7L0Tl3Lu5IynUVBliR0wSEhD0IAmBw2sCMpoyXc3hH_35dEAlGhw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mementomoriok", "published": "2017-12-07T10:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "ybs1 What are the most reputable charities to give to and what are ways of knowing whether a charity is highly committed to serving the world and not just themselves as a non-profit organization?", "text": "submitted by /u/mementomoriok\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:47.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac4bc8572af386e1e7641f97c2a171c3d2cf2f04", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_i3AyxYFI9Z_3nM5D_f4qUsuolDWlQ8C8nblm4qN1dpx_Lvwkn6dCjpE5.JPpPb4e3s0fyLK.oQ1HXrLvAy1h7s6UGy9Wbs5Q-", "site_full": "www.pattinsonworld.com", "site": "pattinsonworld.com", "site_section": "http://www.pattinsonworld.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "PattinsonWorld", "title": "Robert Pattinson de vuelta en LA (6 Diciembre 2017)", "title_full": "Robert Pattinson de vuelta en LA (6 Diciembre 2017)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac4bc8572af386e1e7641f97c2a171c3d2cf2f04", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_i3AyxYFI9Z_3nM5D_f4qUsuolDWlQ8C8nblm4qN1dpx_Lvwkn6dCjpE5.JPpPb4e3s0fyLK.oQ1HXrLvAy1h7s6UGy9Wbs5Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nani-PattinsonWorld (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "Robert Pattinson de vuelta en LA (6 Diciembre 2017)", "text": "\n\n\n\n\nFuente ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert pattinson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fuente", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:47.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "327bbdfb3468f05dfa9aa82240f975e4a1384bcf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRb49YCQbprQVTO7B6fq4Qkdo2X3yZ.pgwceEcS6jR1L2PzNzSttKpKG_p2P88lMZb5xF0oi3NIe5ugjbkHpjeJD.LJ1lXukG2Eld8DYpjhky3iU05exhGOPy1Aj0FpQCI-", "site_full": "www.desidime.com", "site": "desidime.com", "site_section": "https://www.desidime.com/forums/local-deals-offers", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping"], "section_title": "Find Local Deals &amp;
