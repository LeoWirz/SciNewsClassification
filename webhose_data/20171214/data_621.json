It's a fairly common term.\nAs you state you built your belt driven triton I'm curious what method you used to determine the rear wheel was positioned in the same vertical plane as the frame centre line and parallel to it? How did you establish the frame centre line?\nThis is relevant as you're giving advice to the OP on how to fit a belt drive which requires both shafts to be parallel in the horizontal and vertical plane to prevent premature wear and failure.\nOr does none of this matter because as has been pointed out, everything flexes in use.

Thanks for the reply my antipodean chum.\nMaddoman, there is not a lot of room in that area mind you, in my case I would need to mount the front QPD pulley to see what space is available for a seal but have doubts if one could be placed in the engine case itself with the material to the base of bearing bore being around 1/8 \" thick (iirc). (There are seals of that depth no doubt but would it stay in place)\nMy 57 does have a later one piece crankshaft but am not familiar with what was done when the pre unit did get a seal in that location.\nIf the crank case pressure was controlled perhaps a labyrinth could be used instead of a conventional oil seal.\nI seem to remember one of the European motorcycles from the 1990's had frame castings with the alloy tubes held in place with some form of aviation based epoxy.\nMZ maybe.\n#717903 - Yesterday at 11:50 AM Re: Primary belt drive [ Re: Simon Ratcliff ] Joined: Oct 2012\nPosts: 3,147 Hillbilly bike\n Hillbilly bike\n Oct 2012\nPosts: 3,147\nRunning from demons in WNY Originally Posted by Simon Ratcliff Originally Posted by gavin eisler\nNot many people have surface plates big enough to set frame and transmission .

future: Manmohan\u2019s advice to Modi Thu, Dec 7 2017 03:08:13 PM Rajkot, Dec 7 (Zee News): After terming demonetisation as \u201corganised loot\u201d and \u201cmonumental disaster\u201d, former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday reiterated that the notes ban was disastrous. Addressing a gathering in Rajkot in poll-bound Gujarat, the veteran Congress leader said that \u201cwe should avoid such blunder like demonetisation in future\u201d. Hitting out at the Narendra Modi government, the former prime minister alleged that a large chunk of black money was converted to white during notes ban. He also said that millions of jobs were lost due to the move and new jobs were not created. Terming the move as a disaster, Singh claimed that none of the decisions by his government hurt the poor. According to the Congress party, Singh is in Rajkot for an interaction with teachers, professors and professionals on \u201cmatters of concern\u201d. Earlier this month, Singh had attacked Prime Minister Modi over government schemes, referring to hardships faced by people during demonetisation. He had said, \"I invoke memories of more than 100 people who lost their lives while standing in queues as a result of demonetisation. I say with immense pain and a sense of deep responsibility that November 8 was a black day for our economy and democracy.\" He had also said that it was too early to conclude that the economic slowdown has reversed as the 6.3 per cent growth rate in the July-September quarter did not take into account the small and medium sector which suffered huge losses in the aftermath of demonetisation and hasty implementation of GST. \"It is too early to conclude that this represents a reversal of the declining trend observed in the previous five quarters. Some economists believe that the CSO which released the figures has not adequately captured the impact of demonetisation and GST on the informal sector that accounts for about 30 per cent of the economy,\" Singh had said. The former prime minister said that while Modi claimed to understand Gujarat and the poor \"more than anybody else\", how was it that \"he never understood the pain his decisions unleashed\".

Upon their return to the 2nd Ship, Gareki is summoned to meet with a stranger, who has come aboard disguised as a tree...?!\nBut back at Chronom\u00e9 Academy, Kafka launches an attack, sending a swarm of Varuga to lay siege to the prestigious school. And when Tsubame attempts to protect her friends...she ends up a hostage herself! With Gareki back on board the 2nd Ship, who will come to her rescue?!   \n\nAs you all know, Karneval is one of my favourite series, the art is so cute, the plot is fun and yet has darker moments, as well as some mystery, and each volume leaves me wanting more! The series really is a little bright spot!  \n\nThis volume, we get baby Tsukumo and how she first met Hirato, which is something I've been curious about. I've been excited to get some more background on her and it finally happens yaaay!  \n\nWe wrap up the last arc of the last volume, as everyone from First and Second ships along with Akari go from chilling on the beach to rushing to rescue Tsukumo and Hirato. We nicely wrap up that arc and head off with First ship!  \n\nI'm not going to lie guys, Tokitatsu (Hirato's brother) seems a bit shady where Gareki is concerned. I can't decide whether to trust him or not. Tsubame's brother too. Yotaka is....interesting and we have more shadiness in the form of Keshiki. I figure he's the next bad guy to take down! And...guess who's back? (back again) Uro. He's going to be chilling with shady Karoku and Eliska. I actually didn't mind him as much, I'm more intrigued by him than anything else.  \n\nGareki is going to be spending some quality time with Akari and the rest of the Research Tower staff as he sets out on a new study course, which is hopefully going to go better for him than the last study course. I'm intrigued by what's happening with Gareki's character, he's changed and developed a lot so far and I'm interested to see where his character is going.  \n\nThings take a sinister turn as Tsukumo and Yogi discover there are Varuga where there shouldn't be...but why? Thanks to Tsukumo we get some potential theories for Kafka and their plans and what they're up to....and why the government kept quiet. The mystery just gets deeper and deeper...the plot thickens as it where, and I end up with so many theories and ideas and I just need llll the answers!  \n\nWe get some more mystery provided by Nai, because something....strange is going on with him. I'm intrigued to see what bearing it's going to have on the plot and how it fits in with everything else. Good Karoku is setting out on his own path too and I'm excited to see him hopefully have a bigger role to play again.  \n\nHeading out on the next story arc as we head to a new territory, Leberganze, and I'm excited to get to explore more of the world that's been created. It's such a vivid and rich world and I love getting to see more and more of it, and how all the characters histories are woven in along with the plot. It makes it rich and a nice series to sink your teeth in to. Interestingly, we get Nyanperona's story which gave me quite a chuckle.  \n\nWe end on quite the cliffhanger regarding Yogi and the wait for the next volume is going to be, as ever, completely torturous. The story in general is moving at a nice pace with new elements being brought in to keep it fresh and keep you guessing! As soon as you put something together..something else comes along to puzzle out!  \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hirato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yogi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varuga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eliska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kafka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tsukumo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tsubame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokitatsu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gareki", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "karneval", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karneval vol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyanperona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "research tower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chronom\u00e9 academy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "karneval", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varuga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yotaka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tsukumo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keshiki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karoku", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leberganze", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gareki", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:28.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "619529cf4627a40b1c1aac2df4d3da1192e20257", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm3MPpxE6n.n15axU7LZ.xHi", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=odell beckham jr", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "odell%20beckham%20jr News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Reeling Giants fire coach McAdoo, GM Reese after 10th loss | National Sports | postbulletin.com", "title_full": "Reeling Giants fire coach McAdoo, GM Reese after 10th loss | National Sports | postbulletin.com : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-12-04T18:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "619529cf4627a40b1c1aac2df4d3da1192e20257", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm3MPpxE6n.n15axU7LZ.xHi", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Post Bulletin", "published": "2017-12-04T18:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Reeling Giants fire coach McAdoo, GM Reese after 10th loss | National Sports | postbulletin.com", "text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.

The developers are not only planning to introduce more creatures to the game but also add a new dynamic weather system that will change the looks of the game. \nmore than 50 new Pok\u00e9mon from the Hoenn region will be added to the game later this week. The Hoenn region was depicted as a part of the Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire series aired back in 2002. Therein, a lot of focus was centered on the advantages of weather conditions for Pok\u00e9mon battles. This is where the second update kicks in. Niantic has said that the second update will add real-time weather changes to the game . The real-time weather conditions will not only strengthen certain types of Pok\u00e9mon but also make them pop up more than often for the Pok\u00e9mon Masters. \nNiantic Project Manager Matt Slemon, said, \n\u00e9mon. It was the first Pok\u00e9mon game that introduced weather affecting the world itself. Hoenn was heavily influenced by the world around it [and] we took all of that as pretty hefty inspiration. \n\u2019s head of global product marketing also told TechCrunch that an in-game holiday event is in works and might start up sometime around December 21.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pok\u00e9mon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoenn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt slemon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "niantic project", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hoenn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:28.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67b17d0e34237b41042b71cd1852d076b515b424", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE_pi1Lb4FujW", "site_full": "www.aldeer.com", "site": "aldeer.com", "site_section": "http://www.aldeer.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=11", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "Land, Leases, and Hunting Clubs -

If it turns out to be a reality, Samsung will replace the MyKnox application which it ended support for earlier this year. \nThe MyKnox was caught in a vulnerability scam as an Israeli research team went out to find flaws that gave hackers full access to a Samsung device .

Begum, who had contracted leprosy at a young age, had been living at the state government-run hospital in the central part of the city for over a decade.\u201cI receive about Rs 1,000 pension every month, which stopped coming to me for the past four months,\u201d Begum told IANS. She uses the money she receives from the state government as a welfare pension which is given to citizens above 60 years, to buy necessities like hair oil, bathing soap, occasionally some clothes and some snacks and tea from the hospital\u2019s canteen.\u201cShe had complained to us few days ago that she wasn\u2019t receiving her monthly pension. We were later told by the women in the hospital that she had received a letter from the bank asking her to link her pension account with Aadhaar number,\u201d the doctor recalled. The state-run Unique Identification Authority of India\u2019s (UIDAI) requires one to provide with biometric information \u2014 ten fingerprints and two iris (flat, coloured ring-shaped membrane of the eye) scans and a facial photograph \u2014 to be issued with an ID card. The existing rules made Begum incapable of receiving an Aadhaar number \u2014 and thereby her pension. With the hospital authorities approaching the local UIDAI centre, Begum and six others from the Leprosy Hospital were considered as special cases and were enrolled for the identity number.\u201cWe had taken just the person\u2019s facial photographs and a photograph of his/her eyes at the hospital, as getting biometrics wasn\u2019t possible,\u201d multitask officer at the UIDAI\u2019s regional headquarters in the city L. Somashekhar told IANS. As Begum and the others living in the hospital didn\u2019t have any proof of residence, the hospital had provided with an authentication letter, Zai said.\u201cMost of the patients here have been abandoned by their families and have no homes to go back to. So, we provided them with the authentication letters of their residence here,\u201d the doctor explained. With a lot of social stigma surrounding the disease, many who have been living in the hospital depend upon the welfare pensions, he said.\u201cSajida is unmarried and doesn\u2019t know the whereabouts of her parents as she has been living in leprosy homes for a long time now. The UIDAI officials had got their equipment to the hospital for the enrolment,\u201d Zai added. The hospital is now also working towards assisting all of its 59 patients in registering for pensions if they are eligible and is helping out with the documentation, he said.\u201cSometimes, Sajida and other patients remember their homes and families and cry. We\u2019ve seen Sajida also go into depression many times. As a hospital, we want to help them in whatever way we can in letting them lead their lives,\u201d Zai reiterated.(IANS) (Bhavana Akella can be contacted at [email protected] ) Prev Post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sajida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l. somashekhar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayub ali khan zai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhavana akella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "begum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sajida begum", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "unique identification authority of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leprosy hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uidai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ians", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bengaluru", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:29.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "80067a8a96efc1d2c66af15b7f56979af0a2dbfe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pEJmYP03ByBFC5TMSL9Uf4S78MWkUpRMG", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/aco/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/aco/ - Adult Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "Bonnie Rockwaller", "title_full": "/aco/ - Bonnie Rockwaller - Adult Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-10-13T03:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 119, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.369, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "973a274f059220102f6c59b516f0b2a2c513b2a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pEJmYP03ByBFC5TMSL9Uf4YL9cK7SM8B0RuyjSIAWJy4-", "ord_in_thread": 117, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-05T12:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>1799115\nWhat a Quote: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:29.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "80067a8a96efc1d2c66af15b7f56979af0a2dbfe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pEJmYP03ByBFC5TMSL9Uf4S78MWkUpRMG", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/aco/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/aco/ - Adult Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "Bonnie Rockwaller", "title_full": "/aco/ - Bonnie Rockwaller - Adult Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-10-13T03:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 119, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.369, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "46fe5eabe233fc37aaee7a7b8c3d4ea3cee6a73a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pEJmYP03ByBFC5TMSL9Uf4fiUnYwpqU0QDJaMBeOoZE4-", "ord_in_thread": 112, "author": "Barkin 10", "published": "2017-12-04T09:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I never really liked Bonnie that much.

While North American homes are often terrorized by raccoons and European red squirrels are chased away by their aggressive Canadian Grey counterparts, Beijingers seem to lead their day-to-day lives with no big disturbances. Well, not counting the occasional diminutive scorpion, poisonous millipede, or friendly shield cockroach. \nIf you wander outside of Beijing, for example, into the mountains and lakes of Miyun, the absence of wildlife is quite striking to anyone who has grown up with at least a glimpse of pristine nature. While it might seem the only animals in the streets are fried chicken dogs (the overly curly brown creatures) and an occasional fly buzzing inside your kitchen, Beijing's wildlife scene is not all that it seems. Nine years ago, the Beijinger took a look at the animals roaming the streets and outskirts of Beijing . Back then, the excitement of two wild boars frolicking down a main street in Haidian was tragically cut short when one of them ducked under a car. \nAnother sighting outlines some flocks of crows (much less exciting than boars) as well as a wolf caught near the Great Wall in Badaling. It was never really ascertained whether the lone wolf wandered too close to the tourist area or was threatening to cross the wall, but either way, it was captured and later transported further north and released. For die-hard animal fans, we'd suggest venturing into the wetlands and forest parks in the outskirts of the city while having your fingers very firmly crossed (you might get to see a woodpecker or at least a rabbit!). \nCalling it \"Beijing wildlife\" may certainly be a stretch. However, the one animal that for sure deserves its own chamber (or cave) of fame in the Big Smog is the Siberian weasel. Going by the nickname \"hutong weasel\"among most foreignersand \" yellow rat wolf\" (\u9ec4\u9f20\u72fc hu\u00e1ng sh\u01d4 l\u00e1ng ) by everyone else, this crafty yellow creature can often be heard pitter-pattering on hutong roofs in the middle of the night. The sighting of this near-mystical creature is often a reward in and of itself as those who have not been #blessed enough to spot this little golden critter often doubt their existence entirely. Example: Online discussions about sightings and legends regarding the hutong weasel like it might as well be Big Foot. \nBeing the most talked-about urban animal of them all wins this little weasel a set of myths and legends that surround it, including the Chinese folklore that claims that they are in fact wandering spirits that can steal and replace your soul. This soul-stealing tendency arises from the fact that weasels desire to become enlightened but in the Kingdom of Heaven it is forbidden for animals to do so, thus they can sometimes be perceived as a bad omen. Seeing one is also supposed to bring you good luck, so now we're stumped. \nA Chinese proverb also uses the Siberian weasel as a metaphor for sneaky and ill-intending characters, saying that \"The weasel wishes the hen happy new year\" (\u9ec4\u9f20\u72fc\u7ed9\u9e21\u62dc\u5e74 hu\u00e1ng sh\u01d4 l\u00e1ng g\u011bi j\u012b b\u00e0i ni\u00e1n ). What goes unsaid in the proverb, but understood as a subtext, is that a chicken or two may go missing should they great the weasel's well-wishes as genuine. \nThese conflicting opinions throughout history have usually worked out best for the weasels and whether out of good or ill will, Beijing's residents tend to pay them no mind. After all, you wouldn't want to anger them and get your soul stolen. Unless that is you're looking to make some new sweeping brushes, for which it is said, weasel fur makes great material. \nIf the hutong spirits have not yet blessed you with an eye-to-eye moment with a Siberian weasel, spend some time scouring Dongcheng's streets after dark. Just beware, while they look plenty cute, they will steal your soul/sandwich.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vee barbora  throwback", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dongcheng", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great wall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miyun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "badaling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingdom of heaven", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:29.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "80067a8a96efc1d2c66af15b7f56979af0a2dbfe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pEJmYP03ByBFC5TMSL9Uf4S78MWkUpRMG", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/aco/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/aco/ - Adult Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "Bonnie Rockwaller", "title_full": "/aco/ - Bonnie Rockwaller - Adult Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-10-13T03:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 119, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.369, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "197dd2a575b5d79b6d3641347f0c1e2f8802ec3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pEJmYP03ByBFC5TMSL9Uf4fiUnYwpqU0Q6SRx0OLVuXU-", "ord_in_thread": 113, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-04T09:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>1921553\nThat's half the appeal.\nThe desire to hate fuck the living daylights out of her.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:29.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95bc2367f14fc2678130799018db206edc0a2de5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_lUalP.Ot1GL5TqC06NQYJqpOs3dAXYc2xpFcvMn9m7eaWgOwrkj_sOro0Qli5oNRc1sqjeIGV.xx3t9qMXgOUVHRJ.OxMhysQIfF6Md95Bz8jYPpqq3lyzxAmL_Hr9VtKkhtk8sfKFhWr_r2M8Rzv0QVjBVke0ILj37zj5tEPzTU1ySNNWENt0B7_Ic083qNYjSKj_P0XAw--", "site_full": "www.basicbeijing.com", "site": "basicbeijing.com", "site_section": "http://basicbeijing.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Basic Beijing", "title": "Jazz Drummer and \u2018Birdman\u2019 Scorer Antonio S\u00e1nchez Talks Oscar Controversy and Trump Ahead of Blue Note Gig Tonight", "title_full": "Jazz Drummer and \u2018Birdman\u2019 Scorer Antonio S\u00e1nchez Talks Oscar Controversy and Trump Ahead of Blue Note Gig Tonight", "published": "2017-12-07T06:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.thebeijinger.com/sites/default/files/thebeijinger/blog-images/345221/birdman-live-score.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "95bc2367f14fc2678130799018db206edc0a2de5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_lUalP.Ot1GL5TqC06NQYJqpOs3dAXYc2xpFcvMn9m7eaWgOwrkj_sOro0Qli5oNRc1sqjeIGV.xx3t9qMXgOUVHRJ.OxMhysQIfF6Md95Bz8jYPpqq3lyzxAmL_Hr9VtKkhtk8sfKFhWr_r2M8Rzv0QVjBVke0ILj37zj5tEPzTU1ySNNWENt0B7_Ic083qNYjSKj_P0XAw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kyle Mullin", "published": "2017-12-07T06:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Jazz Drummer and \u2018Birdman\u2019 Scorer Antonio S\u00e1nchez Talks Oscar Controversy and Trump Ahead of Blue Note Gig Tonight", "text": "December 7, 2017 By Kyle Mullin \nAfter scoring a modern Hollywood classic, Antonio S\u00e1nchez longed to bring that same cinematic quality to his concerts. The prodigious Mexican drummer \u2013 who has been playing professionally since his teens and has long been acclaimed in jazz circles \u2013 broke into the mainstream in 2014 after being tapped by director Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu to score his hit, Michael Keaton-starring film Birdman, for which S\u00e1nchez won a Grammy. \nSince then, S\u00e1nchez has released the 2015 album The Meridian Suite which he plays with his backing band, The Migration, in one continuous go, taking inspiration from the extended, uninterrupted tracking shots that Birdman was famous for. He also released a political, Donald Trump deriding LP this year called Bad Hombre , which has also been nominated for a Grammy. \nAhead of his gig tonight at Blue Note Beijing, S\u00e1nchez tells us about this Tinseltown successes and scuffles, breaking beyond jazz's constraints, and living up to the legacy of his legendary grandfather, Mexican silver screen star Ignacio L\u00f3pez Tarso. \nWhat can people expect at tonight's show? We\u2019ll be playing from my 2015 album, The Meridian Suite , an hour-plus piece that I wrote as a continuous composition. It\u2019s my attempt at writing a musical novel, where I can develop a story over a long period of time. It combines a lot of acoustic and electronic elements, and it incorporates rock and roll, fusion, electronica, free jazz, and Latin rhythms. We play it straight through, and it\u2019s been a great thing to do in front of people, and to see their reaction as they get sucked into the story. \nWhat challenges lie in telling a story through music? The idea with this piece is to develop the story over a long period and to develop the characters of the story. The characters are the melodies, the rhythms, and the harmonies of the piece that keep coming back at different points of the composition. It\u2019s like a movie; we\u2019re trying to tell a story that's cinematic and that\u2019s told in one continuous shot because we play the composition straight through. \nIt sounds like Birdman in some ways, because that movie is famous for its long takes. Absolutely. When you watch that film it seems like one continuous shot, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do musically here. And the reaction from the audiences has been really good because it\u2019s something different for them. \nSpeaking of Birdman \u2013 which part of that score are you most proud of? Well, the beginning of the film when the credits roll is one of my favorite parts. And there\u2019s another scene where Michael Keaton is destroying his dressing room in the theater, and that\u2019s a very intense scene that I love as well. But I love the whole movie \u2013 every scene has very interesting characteristics. \nA lot of people thought that you should\u2019ve been nominated for an Oscar for Birdman's score, but then some controversy broke out when the Academy snubbed you because they felt there was too much classical music in the film. Yes, that was of course frustrating at the time. At first, they said the percentage of classical music was higher than that of original music in the film, and that was a mistake on their part. Once we did the recount and showed them, they realized they were wrong. But they nevertheless gave us another reason: the classical music \u201cdiluted\u201d the original music too much. So it seemed like they wanted to just get rid of my score. \nBut honestly, that controversy was better than getting an Oscar in the end, because a lot more people got curious about the score. Then, the score winning a Grammy later that year made up for the frustration with the Oscars. \nAnd on the other hand, just being part of a film like Birdman must\u2019ve been gratifying on its own, regardless of awards. After all, before this project, your work was critically acclaimed and award-winning but didn\u2019t reach nearly as wide an audience. Oh yeah, of course. The fact that my name is tied to a Hollywood movie that\u2019s part of the culture now, it definitely made my name resonate in circles that were inaccessible to me before. My name was in so many film and entertainment publications that a lot of people became aware of me for the first time. Jazz artists like myself often try to break away from just the jazz audiences. And this was a very big help for that. \nLastly: what does your grandfather, the famous Mexican actor Ignacio L\u00f3pez Tarso think of your success? He\u2019s one of the people that I admire most. He\u2019s still acting at 92, which is a huge inspiration for me. And the fact that he could support a family just by doing what he loved made me believe I could also do it \u2013 even though I wasn\u2019t in acting and there were no other musicians in my family, between him and my mother I had plenty of support to go on and try to make the best out of the situation I had in front of me, which was the opportunity to study music. \nTo this day, I have a great relationship with my grandfather. I recently went back to Mexico, and I saw his new play, which was incredible. Then I showed him my latest record [2017\u2019s Bad Hombre ]. On the first track, I sampled dialogue from one of his films where he\u2019s telling stories about the Mexican revolution. The album\u2019s title, Bad Hombre , is a reference to how Donald Trump described Mexicans at one of his rallies. So I wanted to put something very Mexican on the record, then thought: \u201cWhat could be better than my grandfather telling stories about the Mexican revolution with a mariachi band?\u201d When I showed my grandfather the piece he was very touched, and when it went on to be nominated for a Grammy, he was very happy for me. \nAntonio S\u00e1nchez will perform with his band, The Migration, at Blue Note tonight, Dec 7 at 7.30pm. Tickets are RMB 400.

The discovery, published in the journal Nature, could provide fundamental information about the universe when it was only 5 per cent of its current age. For black holes to become so large in the early universe, astronomers speculate there must have been special conditions to allow rapid growth -- but the underlying reason remains mysterious. \"This black hole grew far larger than we expected in only 690 million years after the Big Bang, which challenges our theories about how black holes form,\" said study co-author Daniel Stern of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Astronomers combined data from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) with ground-based surveys to identify potential distant objects to study, then followed up with Carnegie Observatories' Magellan telescopes in Chile. The newly found black hole is voraciously devouring material at the centre of a galaxy -- a phenomenon called a quasar. This quasar is especially interesting because it comes from a time when the universe was just beginning to emerge from its dark ages. \"Quasars are among the brightest and most distant known celestial objects and are crucial to understanding the early universe,\" said co-author Bram Venemans of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany. Much of the hydrogen surrounding the newly discovered quasar is neutral, meaning that it is the most distant quasar, the study said. The quasar's distance is determined by what's called its redshift, a measurement of how much the wavelength of its light is stretched by the expansion of the universe before reaching Earth. The higher the redshift, the greater the distance, and the farther back astronomers are looking in time when they observe the object. This newly discovered quasar has a redshift of 7.54, based on the detection of ionized carbon emissions from the galaxy that hosts the massive black hole. That means it took more than 13 billion years for the light from the quasar to reach us. Scientists predict the sky contains between 20 and 100 quasars as bright and as distant as this quasar. \"With several next-generation, even-more-sensitive facilities currently being built, we can expect many exciting discoveries in the very early universe in the coming years,\" Stern said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bram venemans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel stern", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ians", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jet propulsion laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magellan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max planck institute for astronomy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carnegie observatories", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pasadena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:29.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f67591bcca2f6c2fdbfb403cfefb7d8d1e5c2250", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_lUalP.Ot1GL5TqC06NQYJqpOs3dAXYc2xpFcvMn9m7UOi3l8vmSm0ImZUN8tN5083sEEH3pWGrDk23JNmX7ln.5WKSz.LZAq13tRhQazhNiIHGiYnstW1NFiIXH.xLa5NzPSNdZU.HT6YANvJZdO8JR49fEeAUwiU0Sq1xYNGJZLr5MpFZDLXi0Xps02kDZE-", "site_full": "www.basicbeijing.com", "site": "basicbeijing.com", "site_section": "http://basicbeijing.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Basic Beijing", "title": "Burgeoning Beiluogu Xiang Whiskey Bar Hoper Celebrates a Year in Business With Improved Menu, Party Nights", "title_full": "Burgeoning Beiluogu Xiang Whiskey Bar Hoper Celebrates a Year in Business With Improved Menu, Party Nights", "published": "2017-12-06T09:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.thebeijinger.com/sites/default/files/thebeijinger/blog-images/345221/1586797837.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f67591bcca2f6c2fdbfb403cfefb7d8d1e5c2250", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_lUalP.Ot1GL5TqC06NQYJqpOs3dAXYc2xpFcvMn9m7UOi3l8vmSm0ImZUN8tN5083sEEH3pWGrDk23JNmX7ln.5WKSz.LZAq13tRhQazhNiIHGiYnstW1NFiIXH.xLa5NzPSNdZU.HT6YANvJZdO8JR49fEeAUwiU0Sq1xYNGJZLr5MpFZDLXi0Xps02kDZE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kyle Mullin", "published": "2017-12-06T09:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "Burgeoning Beiluogu Xiang Whiskey Bar Hoper Celebrates a Year in Business With Improved Menu, Party Nights", "text": "December 6, 2017 By Kyle Mullin \nThough it's hardly been a year since Hoper opened its doors, much has changed for the cozy Beiluogu Xiang whiskey bar. For one, it's gone from a promising, slowly burgeoning newbie in a quiet alley to one of the highest quality hutong whiskey bars standing. Part of that is merely a numbers game, thanks to the decimation of the red-hot Fangjia Hutong earlier this year, leaving Beiluogu Xiang as an alluring alternative simply by default (after all, 8-Bit, Mai Bar and Mai Fresh, Voyage Cafe, and a few other joints give it a Fangjia-esque, pub crawl-worthy quality). \nRather than rest on any such laurels, however, Hoper's staff has decided to try and seize the moment. That means readying a set cocktail menu with more than a dozen new options (though off-menu options are still available) and penciling regular events in the hopes of making Hoper a home away from home for regulars. \nIn terms of cocktails, we recommend the RMB 80 Winter. Made with Japanese whisky, lemon, ginger, and Beijing pear cream, the drink is tart yet soothing. Owner James Hao says the addition of pear is inspired by an old Chinese remedy for colds and other winter ailments, in which pears are diced up and boiled in hot water. It's one of the many ways that his new cocktail menu draws on traditional Chinese culture, with the blackberry-infused baijiu- laden New Tradition (also RMB 80) sitting securely in the same flu-beating vein. \nThankfully such local twists to the cocktails sidestep becoming gimmicks, instead giving the cocktails an exotic flair for foreigners that remains flavorful and palate satiating. All that places Hoper in the esteemed company of hutong cocktails bars like Capital Spirits Bar and Distillery , Fang , and the sadly defunct Bar 4 Nine, both of which quickly became renowned for weaving Chinese ingredients and culture into their cocktail recipes and overall motif. \nDuring our recent visit, we found that new menu, along with two recently trained bartenders readying those drinks, all gave Hoper more of a professional vibe compared to when we dropped by last summer, when Hao manned the bar on his own and the place felt more like you're friend's den than a proper bar. Though the nookish, woodgrain decor still helps Hoper retain its home away from home charm, the menu and staff upgrades, along with Wednesday night events like acoustic jams, cocktail making classes, film screenings, and more all make the venue feel like it's striving for more than its humble beginnings as yet another hole in the wall hutong bar suggested. \nWe'd like to see the bar continue on its pedagogic run, perhaps holding seminars about Chinese ingredients and how it draws inspiration from old Chinese recipes, which would be a compelling draw nearby Sinophiles.

Pep Guardiola's City have built an eight-point lead following an unbeaten start to the season that has included 13 straight victories - equalling the record for the longest winning run in a single Premier League campaign. Not to be completely outdone, however, Jose Mourinho's Manchester United have equalled a historic club record by remaining unbeaten at Old Trafford for 40 matches in all competitions. And with former Barcelona boss Guardiola and ex-Real Madrid manager Mourinho having developed a fierce rivalry during their time together in Spain, Sunday's meeting promises to be one to savour. The last team to beat United at home were City in September, 2016 and a repeat performance would leave the club, once derided as \"noisy neighbours\" by former United boss Alex Ferguson, 11 points clear at the summit. City have been playing some exhilarating football this campaign with coach Guardiola's style of play, which served him so well at his previous clubs, bringing the expected rewards after a disappointing lack of consistency last season. Yet while United have suffered two defeats on the road - to Huddersfield Town and Chelsea - they too have looked like champions at home. The 40 games unbeaten have included 29 wins and 11 draws with 85 goals scored and just 17 conceded. This season's Premier League record at Old Trafford is played seven, won seven - 20 goals for and just one against. Mourinho, however, will be without his key French midfielder Paul Pogba, who starts a three-match ban following his red card in Saturday's crucial 3-1 win at Arsenal. United have produced their best football when they have had Pogba and Serbian anchorman Nemanja Matic on the field together and the former Juventus midfielder will be sorely missed. Given the gap between the two clubs in the table, it will be intriguing to see if Mourinho maintains his habit of playing defensively against title rivals, a tactic which has been much criticised following the goalless draw at Liverpool in October. Pogba, however, says United will approach the game in a positive fashion. \"We want to win. We need to win as well. They need to win because they know that we are behind and we are closing and closing,\" he said. \"If I didn't believe that (we can win it), I'd stop playing football now.\" United's Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic should be fit to feature at some stage in the game but defender Eric Bailly remains sidelined.

While the usual suspects all made it to the top 10, the choice for China\u2019s best restaurant may surprise you. \nTop of the global list is Guy Savoy\u2019s Monnaiede Paris (Paris Mint) with a score of 99.75 out of 100, followed by American TV chef Eric Ripert\u2019s New York fish restaurant Le Bernardin, and reasonably priced Tokyo sushi restaurant, Kyubey, both with 99.50. For Asia, the ranking continues with the aptly named faux-French chalet, Joel Robuchon (by chef Joel Robuchon) and glamorous sushi restaurant Kyo Aji, both in Japan and both rated 98.75. \nBy contrast, first in China, third in Asia, 31st overall, and with a score of 98.5 is Huai Yang Fu , located in the parking lot of Melody KTV in Andingmen. Established in 2011, Huai Yang Fu has two other locations, one at Jianguomen and one in Xidan, but it\u2019s the Andingmen branch that has captured the attention of La Liste. \nHuai Yang Fu serves dishes typical of Jiangsu\u2019s Huaiyang cuisine, one of China\u2019s Four Great Cuisines, along with Sichuan, Shandong, and Cantonese cuisines. Originating in the cities of Huai\u2019an, Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, at the confluence of the Huai and Yangzi Rivers, the cuisine is famous for its artful preparation of all things aquatic, including freshwater fish, crustaceans, and waterfowl. The cuisine is particularly noted for the subtlety of its flavors and its tendency toward sweetness. \nLa Liste\u2019s chief number cruncher, Jorg Zipprick, says his method of selecting the world\u2019s top restaurants is \u201cmore scientific and reliable\u201d than methods used by other guides. Zipprick and his team take restaurant reviews from 550 guidebooks and other publications and design individualized methodologies to convert each guidebook\u2019s reviews to standardized scores out of 100. They then ask several thousand chefs to give their opinions on each guidebook and use the results to give each publication a trustworthiness score out of 10. Each score out of 100 is then weighted according to the trustworthiness of the source, making up 75 percent of the total score, with the final 25 percent drawn from around 25 million customer reviews on sites like Trip Advisor, Yelp, and Dianping. \nWith all that impartial and unbiased science leading to the crowning of Huai Yang Fu as China\u2019s ultimate haven for foodies, we thought we\u2019d better find out what makes this restaurant China\u2019s best. True, it has five stars on Dianping and Trip Advisor, but it isn\u2019t ranked within Beijing\u2019s best 100 restaurants on Dianping, nor is it ranked within Beijing\u2019s top 500 on Trip Advisor, nor the top 1,000 restaurants on tripadvisor.com. So what does La Liste know that we don\u2019t? \nWe stopped by this week and found a multi-level maze of private dining rooms with efficient, no-frills service. The design and decoration was about what you\u2019d expect from a private room at any of the major duck restaurants, although not as fancy as Da Dong and not as atmospheric as Hua Jia Yi Yuan. We tried nine classic dishes \u2013 all varieties that we\u2019d either tried before at other Huaiyang restaurants, or that were recommended by Huai Yang Fu staff. \nTen kinds of mixed vegetables \u8001\u626c\u5dde\u5341\u9999\u83dc ( l\u01ceo y\u00e1ngzh\u014du sh\u00ed xi\u0101ngc\u00e0i ) (RMB 32) This dish was a great start to our meal at Huai Yang Fu. As you would expect from southern Chinese cuisine, each of the 10 ingredients brought a different element to the dish. Each mouthful was a fresh, pickled, crispy, chewy, sour, sweet, and salty delight. \nSouthern-style white chicken \u6c5f\u5357\u767d\u5207\u9e21 ( ji\u0101ngn\u00e1n b\u00e1i qi\u0113 j\u012b ) (RMB 58) Bai qieji is most famously served in Cantonese cuisine, where the whole chicken is boiled, cooled, chopped into bite-sized pieces and served with a ginger dipping sauce. The Jiangnan version served at Huai Yang Fu was boneless and far more tender than any we\u2019ve tried in Guangdong but with a sweeter, much saltier, soy-based dressing. \nZhenjiang-style aspic pork \u9547\u6c5f\u6c34\u6676\u80b4\u8089 ( zh\u00e8nji\u0101ng shu\u01d0j\u012bng y\u00e1o r\u00f2u ) (RMB 48) Visiting a restaurant serving Huaiyang cuisine, we\u2019d expected the dishes to be sweeter than we\u2019re used to here in Beijing, but just like the bai qieji above, this dish of cured fatty pork preserved in its own aspic brought with it a salty surprise. We found the flavor of the pork was completely overpowered by even the tiniest toe-in-the-water dip of the dipping sauce. However, after first judging the pork tasteless, we discovered formerly masked, albeit subtle cured pork flavors in the undipped slices. Could that be why they served it without the dipping sauce at \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Monday? Soy sauce stains on the Presidential Carpet aside, we think abandoning the sauce was probably wise. \nSignature homemade streaky pork with sauce \u62db\u724c\u79d8\u5236\u7ea2\u70e7\u8089 ( zh\u0101op\u00e1i m\u00ec zh\u00ec h\u00f3ngsh\u0101o r\u00f2u ) (RMB 128) Prepared as part of cuisines from many parts of China, hongshaorou or red-braised pork, is most famously prepared in Hunan Province and was a favorite of Hunan\u2019s most famous son, Chairman Mao. The thick, tangy, aromatic sauce on the version at Huai Yang Fu was superb \u2013 the kind of superb that would make competitive Texan barbecue veterans wonder what they\u2019ve been doing with their lives \u2013 but we found the lean meat a little hard and stringy for a dish that is supposed to melt in the mouth. \nDried and boiled beancurd shreds in chicken soup \u626c\u5dde\u5927\u716e\u5e72\u4e1d ( y\u00e1ngzh\u014du d\u00e0 zh\u01d4g\u00e0n s\u012b ) (RMB 68) As good as Huai Yang Fu's rendition of hongshaorou was, the shining star of our meal was this dish of finely shredded tofu served in chicken soup. The soup itself was apparently cooked by a conjured picture-perfect grandma who also happened to be a world-class Chinese chef. Not having tried shredded soft tofu before, we loved the texture it brought to each mouthful of the soup. \nPan-fried buns \u62db\u724c\u751f\u714e\u5305 ( zh\u0101op\u00e1i sh\u0113ng ji\u0101n b\u0101o ) (RMB 24 for six) Riding a tofu high, these tastefully arranged sheng jianbao lacked the usual contrast between crispy bottoms and soft tops of those sold street-side. The soft, almost brioche-like exterior surrounded a pork filling that was, again, far more delicately flavored than those seen in their natural environment. \nTraditional-style baked pumpkin casserole \u53e4\u6cd5\u7802\u9505\u7117\u5357\u74dc ( g\u01d4 f\u01ce sh\u0101gu\u014d j\u00fa n\u00e1ngu\u0101 ) (RMB 58) Half a pumpkin, sliced, laid on a bed of whole garlic, covered, and lightly baked. On tasting the garlic, we had a roundtable discussion on what spices they had used to (with great subtlety) flavor the dish. Was it turmeric? Was it five-spice powder? Was it some exotic mix of southern Chinese spices? No. It was definitely the tiniest one-eighth-teaspoon of curry powder. \nTaihu Lake whitebait fried with egg \u592a\u6e56\u94f6\u9c7c\u7092\u571f\u9e21\u86cb ( t\u00e0ih\u00fa y\u00edn y\u00fa ch\u01ceo t\u01d4 j\u012bd\u00e0n ) (RMB 88) This omelette made with tiny whitebait from Tai Hu, a lake in Jiangsu, was flavored with a minuscule suspicion of preserved vegetable, discovered on our third or fourth bite. \nYangzhou-style fried rice \u626c\u5dde\u4ec0\u9526\u7092\u996d ( y\u00e1ngzh\u014du sh\u00edj\u01d0n ch\u01ceof\u00e0n ) (RMB 68) We are able to be neither subtle nor delicate in our description of the Yangzhou fried rice. A signature dish of Huaiyang cuisine, this dish served in restaurants all over China, albeit without the premium ingredients used in Huai Yang Fu\u2019s version. While most people who\u2019ve dabbled in Chinese cooking know the best fried rice is made with left-over rice from a previous meal, we found this version dry to the point of inedibility. It wasn\u2019t chewy and it wasn\u2019t crispy. It was just hard. We\u2019re almost embarrassed to admit we added a little of the abovementioned chicken soup to the rice in our bowls to see if that would make it any easier to chew and swallow, but ended up abandoning the rice in favor of the check and the complimentary fruit slices. \nCould it be that these refined renditions of dishes from an already delicately flavored cuisine were too subtle for our spice-encrusted Beijing taste buds? Possibly. But many were dishes we\u2019ve loved at other restaurants. Former East Hotel head chef Rob Cunningham named Huai Yang Fu his favorite secret restaurant before leaving for Jakarta, and well-known Chinese food and wine critic Xie Ling (Lingxin Xiaoxie) also defends La Liste as being on point, so maybe you\u2019ll love it. \nVisit Huai Yang Fu if you have an interest in trying La Liste\u2019s top restaurants in China, if you have visiting relatives who need a subtle and delicate introduction to Chinese cuisine before you take them to hot pot, or if you have an academic interest in Chinese Cuisine and would like to try Huaiyang Cuisine in Beijing (although for that you might like to try the Jiangsu Provincial Government Restaurant , which to be frankly honest, we enjoyed much more). \nDaily 11am-2pm, 5-9pm. 198 Andingmen Waidajie (6426 5858, 6426 5959, bookings essential ) \u5b89\u5b9a\u95e8\u5916\u5927\u8857 198 \u53f7 \nPhotos: Garth Wilson, courtesy of Huai Yang Fu Provided:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andingmen waidajie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lingxin xiaoxie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric ripert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guy savoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la liste", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hua jia yi yuan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tai hu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joel robuchon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob cunningham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xie ling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huai yang fu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "da dong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zipprick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garth wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jorg zipprick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "best restaurant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyo aji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "presidential carpet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "le bernardin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melody ktv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinese cuisine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huaiyang cuisine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la liste", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris mint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yangzi rivers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jiangsu provincial government restaurant", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guangdong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hunan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huaiyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monnaiede paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shandong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yangzhou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sichuan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jianguomen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u00e9lys\u00e9e palace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyubey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huai yang fu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakarta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andingmen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huai\u2019an", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hunan province", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jiangsu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhenjiang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taihu lake", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:29.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ef9416a059de7e698650d2f5b6a56b9bad93e7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_UI0PlzfyPHQIkp3RzzQLroyg6EYjrZizAwDDbx3EWPQ8JWTPql18LcqdPNQohDnRs2SpwMchQt7", "site_full": "forums.att.com", "site": "att.com", "site_section": "https://forums.att.com:443/t5/Apple/bd-p/apple", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Apple iPhone / iPad Support -

Beijing has always been in a state of flux. Sometimes the busiest areas in one era give way to quiet lanes in another. Danish historian Lars Thom of Beijing Postcards has spent over a decade researching the evolution of the capital, tracking the rise and fall of the city\u2019s residential and commercial centers from century to century. \nThom\u2019s research has recently focused on Dashilan , where Beijing Postcards has its new public history space. The neighborhood is a warren of hutongs and lanes located just to the southwest of Qianmen Gate and today\u2019s Tiananmen Square. The area was once one of Beijing\u2019s most vibrant commercial neighborhoods, along with Wangfujing and Xidan. \nAccording to Thom, \u201cItems such as leather, shoes, watches, and bicycles could be found in the neighborhood stores and shops. And the lanes have been a destination for those seeking specialized commodities since the Ming dynasty (1368-1644).\u201d \nOn a recent research trip to Japan, Thom found a book of Beijing souvenir maps published in 1982, a time when Beijing was just emerging from the Mao era. On the map, shops are represented by icons, watches for sellers of timepieces, bicycles for those selling pedal-powered transportation and \u2026 well, you get the idea. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not that old, but this book of maps is a fascinating historical document,\u201d says Thom. \u201cIt triggers so many memories. You show it to people in the neighborhood and they immediately can recall such-and-such a shop, long since gone, but alive in the collective memory of the local residents.\u201d \nAccording to Mr. Liu, who Thom interviewed for his new research project on the commercial community in Dashilan, the main shopping drag would be an endless stream of consumers. Shoppers would get caught up in the flow of humanity which descended on Dashilan on a daily basis, one stream of pedestrians flowing west, another rolling east, each on their own side of the streets, so thick were the crowds. \nAnd yet today, areas such as Wangfujing and Dashilan are tourist attractions or afterthoughts to the current generation of Beijing uber-consumers. \nThe beginning of the end, according to Thom, was the opening of the new Beijing Railway Station in 1959. The old train station, built in 1901, was located just outside the Zhengyangmen Gate, close to the Dashilan Neighborhood. The area was the often the first point of arrival for visitors to Beijing and the neighborhood thrived with not only shops, but also guesthouses, taverns, restaurants, temples, theaters, and a lively red light district. \nThe construction of the new railway station, 2.5 kilometers to the west, shifted the commercial center of gravity in the direction of nearby Wangfujing. But even up until the end of the last century, Dashilan remained an important and bustling space for trade, even as the construction of gleaming new malls and shopping plazas in Chaoyang and beyond signaled a new era of consumer culture. \nIt can be hard running a hutong business in 2017, but in the days of Old Peking it wasn\u2019t any easier opening a shop in your local hutong \u2013 in fact, it was in many ways much more difficult. \nThom is researching how commercial guilds controlled the trade in different products and services and regulated the opening of shops and businesses in Beijing. \u201cYou had to be approved by the guild to learn a trade. There was a strict hierarchy. You started as an apprentice and even that wasn\u2019t easy. \nYou needed to not only find someone to hire you but to also stand as your guarantor. There were quotas and licenses. Just opening your own shop without going through the guild system just didn\u2019t happen.\u201d \nRenegade shop owners \u2013 or bespoke cocktail makers \u2013 who tried to buck the system could find themselves in deep trouble with both the city authorities as well as with the guild bosses the authorities relied on to keep economic order. \nThis system persisted throughout the first half of the 20th century, ending in 1949 with the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nThom takes a long view when looking at the changes in the city this year. \n\u201cGoing back to the 1950s and 1960s, a lot of the development was haphazard and chaotic. Cleaning up the city makes a certain amount of sense; you can\u2019t develop until you do. But the way it has been handled hasn\u2019t always been carried out humanely.\u201d \nCurrently, Thom is working on developing a walk based on his most recent find, combining interviews with local residents and archival research based on the establishments listed on the 1982 Dashilan map. \n\u201cOne place you can find a lot of stuff is Taobao,\u201d Thom says as he holds up documents and artifacts from a long-since defunct local factory. He found the documents by doing a search for the factory name on the popular e-commerce platform and was amazed at what was available. \nCurrently, Thom is displaying some of these artifacts at the Beijing Postcards Public History Space located at 97 Yangmeizhu Street, Dashilan as part of their Beijing Arrivals exhibit.

Share 0 Share \nCharter\u2019s approach to Digital Inclusion has developed over 12 years and is based a \u2018hook\u2019 to interests of our customers. \nThis started out in our sheltered schemes where we engaged people in our \u2018Silver Surfers\u2019 project. \nOne gentleman had never thought of using the internet until we introduced him places he could expands his miniature bottle collection! \nWe replicated this person centred approach creating connected communities and increasing digital literacy. \nOver the years we have developed some really successful projects, engaging with small groups of tenants and working with people on a one to one basis. \nIn 2007 we introduced community broadband on our largest estate and now 85% of our residents are now digitally included. \nThe Community Bunker on the site has a small IT suite and has seen 89 residents engage this year, whether that\u2019s to drop in and check their emails, take part in our ECDL course or access employability support. \nThis is also the base for our laptop loan scheme. Customers can borrow a laptop and receive support on using them to carry out job searches, complete applications or to support other training. \nThis has been really successful with 47 people benefiting in a 12 month period. \nOur Social Media and app development has meant that we are better connected with our customers. This means we can let people know about service changes, opportunities for involvement and gather opinions in a cost effectively manner. \nOur bespoke app allows rent account access and reporting repairs, and expands this mutually beneficial means of accessing and sharing information. \nI\u2019m most proud of the work we do to upskill people through digital inclusion, giving them the skills and confidence needed to access work. \nOur Heritage project saw 81 people learning new skills over a year and our Radio and Radiate projects have seen young people accessing technology and gaining skills that help them stand out in the job market. As an accredited ECDL deliverer we teach people on an individual and group process to achieve a recognisable qualification, with an 85% success rate. \nWinning this award means that we are on the right track. Looking to the future we working in partnership with Ffilm Cymru as that \u2018hook\u2019 to inspire involvement as well as Coding for adults and helping access Universal Credit online. \nWe want our customers to engage with us as they do with other services, focusing on channel shifting toward using our app. \nWe need to make sure our tenants have the skills for this. \nThis award has inspired the team and we move forward putting digital technologies and our customers at the heart of what we do. \n\nThis project, along with every shortlisted application in the Welsh Housing Awards, was published in CIH Cymru\u2019s annual Good Practice Compendium, sponsored by Lovell. \nThe 2017 edition is a compilation of practice from across the breadth of the sector, divided into chapters that reflect areas of focus in housing right now. \nYou can download the Good Practice Compendium 2017 in English or Welsh on the CIH Cymru website.

Not by a huge amount but, I was getting 450 credits in GA this morning and around 200 - 400 for a SA match depending on it's length. Probably around a 30% increase give or take which is better than nothing. There is also an element of performance based scoring. Some of my friends tend to top the leaderboard in most games and they were getting around 600 credits per match.\nIt is also now possible to earn 1500 credits each day in arcade mode, increased from 500 and they have said that there will be more crafting parts in the daily crate (I got 15 instead of the usual 5). None of these things fix the terrible and confusing progression system but, they are all small steps in the right direction. There will also be some activity specific weekends coming up such as blast this weekend which could well mean double credits.\nI tried to mix it up over the weekend and played a lot of Heroes vs Villians, which is a huge amount of fun and seems decent for quick credits. I have also become very addicted to Starfighter Assault, it is so much fun and I've been having reasonable success and managed to have a go in a number of Hero Ships. They really need an arcade mode for Galactic Assault though so, you can practice the heroes like you can for the 'boots on the ground' heroes. I tried turning advanced flight on but, I don't like it. The ship constantly rolls when I'm not expecting it too and I just find it really disorientating! Easy controls are the way to go on this one I think!!\nI've upgraded my first 'thing' to purple (is that epic?) which is my heavy shield. 480 crafting parts seems very expensive for that upgrade though!!

We\u2019re excited to have launched the game to the world, but recognize that there have been some challenges along the way. We have learned a lot, and are making adjustments to the game to ensure the best experience possible. On Tuesday, an update is rolling out that begins the Star Wars\u2122 Battlefront\u2122 II The Last Jedi Season by kicking off factional challenges, letting you choose a side and start competing for rewards as either The First Order or The Resistance.\nToday, an update went live that includes some adjustments to the economy and progression. While these are only some initial steps toward making much larger changes, some of these are ready to roll, and are available starting today.\nThe end-of-round payout has been increased. This is an area we agree needed to be buffed a bit, especially when it comes to rewarding players for doing well in-game. We're upping the number of Credits you get for a match across the board, and specifically bumping the top players on each team by even more.\nEarn 3X more Credits daily in Arcade Mode. It's been made clear that you were hitting the Arcade Mode Credit cap faster than we expected, so we wanted to alleviate that by increasing it to 1500 Credits. While we're still looking into ways to add more content into it the mode in the long-term, we think that this should help in the near-term for those who want rewards for completing the different scenarios.\nDaily Login Crates will now provide more crafting parts than before. You'll notice the change right away when you log in. Crafting the Star Cards you want will help make sure you're progressing in the direction you want, and we absolutely wantto empower that. This should help you get where you want to go faster when it comes to crafting and upgrading.\nThings kick into high gear over the next few weeks, during the Star Wars\u2122 Battlefront\u2122 II The Last Jedi Season, with free* heroes, maps, and vehicles. Stormtrooper-turned-hero Finn joins the fight for the Resistance and Captain Phasma steps on to the battlefront for the First Order. New locations and vehicles will also arrive: you can fight on the ground on the salt-covered planet of Crait in Galactic Assault mode, or take to space in the Starfighter Assault map of D'Qar (flying Tallie Lintra's RZ-2 A-wing, a vehicle you'll be seeing in the film).\nAnd, of course, Iden Versio returns in Star Wars\u2122 Battlefront\u2122 II Resurrection during the days of the First Order\u2019s rise to power. These new chapters of Star Wars\u2122 Battlefront\u2122 II\u2019s single-player story mode will be available December 13.\nThank you again for your passion around this game. Star Wars\u2122 is special to all of us, and we all want to experience that world in fun, exciting ways.

It caught up everyone's attention when Apple launched the iPhone 7 Plus , the first iPhone with dual rear cameras. Since then, we have seen many smartphones releasing with a special focus on portrait mode aka Bokeh effect capabilities. Even though most of the smartphones rely on dual cameras to achieve the depth of field effect, there are a few smartphones like Google's Pixel 2 which do the same with the single lens. \nThis is the reason it makes sense to do a portrait mode camera comparison featuring smartphones with the dual as well as a single rear camera.

over People's Postcode Lottery scam after 87-year-old woman from Malvern targeted Craig Gibbons 7 th Dec, 2017 Updated: 7 th Dec, 2017 \nRESIDENTS have been issued a stern warning from a Malvern man not to fall victim to a People\u2019s Postcode Lottery scam after his mother-in-law was targeted. \nLee Harrison, of Malvern World Travel on Somers Park Avenue, told the Observer that after visiting his 87-year-old mother-in-law yesterday (Wednesday) he found out she had received a letter, dated December 1, appearing to be from the People\u2019s Postcode Lottery which stated she had won \u00a3375,000. \nThe money was allegedly from a total cash prize of \u00a345million which would be shared \u2018among the first 200 lucky winners\u2019. \nA telephone number and apparent Government email address was put on the letter as a contact point but luckily for Mr Harrison, his mother-in-law had not got in touch with the fraudsters. \nAnd now Mr Harrison has urged Malvern residents to be wary of false claims of winning money to prevent them from falling victim to such scams. \n\u201cMy mother-in-law does not even take part in the People\u2019s Post Code Lottery so I knew something was up,\u201d he said. \n\u201cPeople can be easily drawn in to these kind of things. \n\u201cWith the email address ending in \u2018.gov\u2019 it makes it look like it had been authorised by the Government when in fact it has not. \n\u201cUnfortunately so many people would phone or email through and possibly give out details they should not. \n\u201cThe powers that be need to get down to the bottom of this and catching the people responsible.\u201d \nThe letter (pictured with the recipient\u2019s address removed) said winners had been \u2018randomly selected by computer from database of the Electoral Register\u2019. \nIt came printed with lottery ball numbers as well as a head office address and reference numbers to make it seem legitimate. \nThe letter added the winnings \u2018must be claimed no later than December 30\u2019 and that \u2018your claims company will be paid five per cent of the award price as the commission AFTER you have received your money\u2019. \nRachel Ruxton, a spokeswoman for the People\u2019s Postcode Lottery, warned against the scam and stressed they would never ask for payment to claim a cash prize. \n\u201cThe People\u2019s Postcode Lottery is aware that sometimes illegitimate individuals and organisations will attempt to use our lottery\u2019s brand to gain access to information or details supplied by unsuspecting members of the public,\u201d she said. \n\u201cWe take such matters very seriously. \n\u201cIf you receive one of these letters, phone calls, SMS messages or emails, then we strongly advise the public to treat these communications as scams and they should be ignored. \n\u201cLegitimate lotteries, such as People\u2019s Postcode Lottery, will not under any circumstances request a payment in order to receive your \u2018winnings\u2019.\u201d \nShe added anybody suspicious of fraudulent activities should contact their customer service team on 0808 1098 765. \nScams can also be reported to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or by visiting www.actionfraud.police.uk .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "craig gibbons",

Have you ever wanted to change out your sofa for the different holidays or seasons?  Well, if you're anything like me, and addicted to decorating, then I think you are going to be excited about today's post.\n\n\n\nI just received a new replacement slipcover for my Ikea Ektorp sofa from Comfort Works and I couldn't be more pleased with it. My new slipcover has instantly updated our living room and changed the whole mood of the room.\n\n\nYou may recall, I wrote THIS post not too long ago, where I was sharing my process for choosing the fabric for my new Ikea sofa cover. Comfort Works can send you fabric samples to try out, which I think is so great. I was able to really get a close look and feel at all of my options. It was a difficult decision, but in the end I decided that the Shire Coal was the best choice for me. \n\nIt took only a couple of weeks for my slipcover to be handmade by in house artisans and shipped to my doorstep. When it arrived, it came packaged in this cute cotton bag tied up in a pretty red bow.  It seriously felt like Christmas came early as I was opening it up.\n\n\n\nI was so excited, I immediately pulled the slipcover out of the bag and placed it on my sofa. I couldn't believe how well this slipcover fits my sofa. It wasn't too tight like my other slipcover, so I was able to slip it on really easily. But at the same time, it wasn't too loose where it looked  baggy. I would say it's the perfect fit.\n\n\n\nI also like how the added piping and pleats give it a tailored look. \n\nIt was a super cute touch to add tags to let you know where to place the slipcover.\n\n\n\nIsn't this dark grey so pretty? The Shire Coal is a wool blend that is 30% Wool and 70% Polyester.  And I can't even begin to tell you how incredibly soft this fabric is.  I have to run my hands across it every time I sit down. It feels amazing! \n\n\nI think the gray wool is the perfect fabric for winter time. It feels so warm and cozy, and it makes you want to cuddle up on the couch and relax the day away. \n\nI absolutely adore my new Comfort Works slipcover. It seriously feels like I just got a brand new sofa. \n\nSo if you are looking to update your sofa, I highly recommend Comfort Works . They specialize in making slipcovers for Pottery Barn and Ikea sofas, but they can custom make slipcovers for any other brands, models, and sizes of sofas as well. Comfort Works also offer a large variety of fabrics and finishes to choose from so you can design a sofa cover that is just right for your home. \nComfort Works also carries some amazing Christmas accessories.
