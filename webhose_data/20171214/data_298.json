We feel that Activision needs to be working on getting a Call Of Duty game on the Nintendo Switch as the port of Doom proves, the Switch can handle an intense first person shooter experience. Activision actually supported the Wii pretty heavily with Call Of Duty games, sure they were not as good as the PC, Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, but the support was there. They even released a Call Of Duty game (Black Ops II) on the Nintendo Wii U, but when that console failed to catch on with consumers, Activision lost interest. With the Nintendo Switch though, we feel that Activision could have a monster of a hit on their hands with a Call Of Duty game. The console is more powerful than people give it credit for and we feel that even if they were to release an older Call Of Duty game like Black Ops 3, Advanced Warfare, Infinite Warfare\u2026. Ok so maybe not Infinite Warfare, but Black Ops 3 or Advanced Warfare would be very well met, even though they are older games, the Switch (apart from Doom) has yet to have that huge first person shooter experience. Activision has been rather quiet on the Call Of Duty on Nintendo Switch front, but with how they have supported Nintendo consoles in the past, we would be very surprised if one is not in the works right now, especially with how well the Nintendo Switch is selling.

Black would make it hotter and easier to see. Right?\nI will leave thermal detection systems to someone better qualified (paging Qsurf), but there are physical properties of different coatings, different substrates, different environmental conditions going on with this (missile goes up, missile comes down) that are not as straightforward as people may think.\nIt can get somewhat complex, you know, with Kirchoff's equations, radiating black bodies, fluid densities, vectoring, then toss in systems trying to detect various signatures (so it can track them and destroy them) and what not.\nDare I say it, Driftcoast is on the right track with the SR-71 (and other stealth craft) being painted black. A fleet of spy planes and attack craft painted black? Do they know something we don't?\nApparently.\nBlack makes a great radiator of heat (transfers heat better than white) while absorbing pretty much all the visible light that hits it. It is that one-two combo which makes a black car surface feel warmer on a cold sunny day than a white car's surface. If it didn't radiate heat well, you wouldn't feel it, and if it did reflect back all the light, it would be white.\nAnything that absorbs a large spectrum of EMR (aka \"light\", radio, microwave, etc) doesn't reflect, which in turn makes it more difficult to see. And as it converts incoming energy to thermal and radiates thermal energy well, it would distribute the heat energy over the entire air-frame (even the side that is not in direct line of sight), making fewer hot spots. Those hot spots, are easier to detect...a small bit of 1000 C is easier to detect than a larger blob of 100 C (feel free to correct me on this, you thermal energy detector types).\nAnyway, I am not sure why the missile being black really means anything here, unless you think NK is part of some conspiracy of world control and this black paint is the crack in the veneer that lets those who know \"the truth\" know the real story.\nSuffice to say, the missile is painted a color for set of reasons which lead to the the goal of delivering a payload without being shot down while it survives the physical stress of the flight, oh, maybe because the black was less expensive because even the military can have a budget.\nEdit:\nTooting my own horn and patting myself on the back with this Stealth stuff. Follow the link to the radar absorbing material part and you will see: \"... absorb radiated energy from a ground or air based radar station into the coating and convert it to heat rather than reflect it back.\"\nEdited by Mr Doof ( 12/04/17 04:17 PM )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_technology"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:38.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9e3b7398b0f4b4bf93599de5ebeeee2c80465001", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScjUkU0mROukw9hlRF37lwgKZoyfVcQOftAKeD8lvKhuEElGiba7IPc3uL5ujJO6N0weza87rEDwKXIuYe1EyfEOKDsu9cPDcdMG4oY5s9nKjpd3xAgqa44FK2DRRHHaSI21Pn9m4oWQ2t7SwvBTz7kqzgJvAIrtw-", "site_full": "cymopoleiasite.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://cymopoleiasite.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Apple IPHONE 6 6Plus 16GB 64GB WORLDWIDE GSM UNLOCKED SPACE GRAY/ GOLD/ SILVER \u2013 Cymopoleia", "title": "Apple IPHONE 6 6Plus 16GB 64GB WORLDWIDE GSM UNLOCKED SPACE GRAY/ GOLD/ SILVER", "title_full": "Apple IPHONE 6 6Plus 16GB 64GB WORLDWIDE GSM UNLOCKED SPACE GRAY/ GOLD/ SILVER", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9e3b7398b0f4b4bf93599de5ebeeee2c80465001", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScjUkU0mROukw9hlRF37lwgKZoyfVcQOftAKeD8lvKhuEElGiba7IPc3uL5ujJO6N0weza87rEDwKXIuYe1EyfEOKDsu9cPDcdMG4oY5s9nKjpd3xAgqa44FK2DRRHHaSI21Pn9m4oWQ2t7SwvBTz7kqzgJvAIrtw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cymopoleiasite", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Apple IPHONE 6 6Plus 16GB 64GB WORLDWIDE GSM UNLOCKED SPACE GRAY/ GOLD/ SILVER", "text": "Apple IPHONE 6 6Plus 16GB 64GB WORLDWIDE GSM UNLOCKED SPACE GRAY/ GOLD/ SILVER \u2013 Buy \u2013 Apple IPHONE 6 6Plus 16GB 64GB WORLDWIDE GSM UNLOCKED SPACE GRAY/ GOLD/ SILVER ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:38.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0cf245aa3394349781be398ab8e13fa67d6c26c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mtwpVP3F9EOzqP8qg136iZk", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp;

The sheer amount of magical items the man carries with him at all times should be particularly noticeable to anyone who has enhanced senses or detection equipment. Immanuel can make it magically appear on his person by simply willing it to come forth.\nStats\nRanged: 9 - Immanuel wears a pair of spell storing gauntlets that both contain a total of 8 plasma bolt firing wands, thus allowing Immanuel to fire an almost excessive amount of eerily accurate and fast moving bolts at his enemies with the power of his mind...although they are neither self guiding or particularly powerful individually. But of course when he needs the additional fire power he could simply rely on the excessively high powered shoulder mounted railgun that he can construct with the use of his hyper. Although rather unfortunately it is a cumbersome and hard to aim weapon that takes a while to reload. His requiem allows him to temporarily enchant other people and their equipment from a distance.\nClose Quarters: 0 - While Immanuel's belt of Vaguely Enhanced Strength does in fact provides him with the strength of five men, he had neglected to actually specify which five men when he created them. This ended up screwing him over when he ended up creating a belt that provided him with the strength of five heroes of myth and legend, who of course, by being virtue of existing in myth and legend, are living men no longer.\nMobility: 5 - Immanuel can fly thanks to his Iron Sabatons of inexplicably fire based flight after he accidentally set fire to one of the rather expensive and rather hard to replace ingredients required to create a pair of Winged Boots of flight when creating it. This works out about as well as you can expect it to when it comes to straight line speed and rapid increases in altitude. Although it leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to actually maneuvering the damn thing.\nDefense: 5 - Immanuel's heavily enchanted set of gothic full plate armor allows him to take hits that would completely and utterly destroy a much lesser man, although in the end of the day he is in fact just a ridiculous man in a rather heavy set of armor when it comes to durability. He can also use his magic to form a small directional force field to try and mitigate the damage he takes a bit, but the act of creating one usually takes longer than the time it takes for the enemy's attack to hit him.\nExcel Hyper: 0 - None, Immanuel has never seen the point of learning one big and easily detected trick to win when he can do so with several dozen tiny tricks that batter down your efforts.\nRequiem\nArtificer's Infusion: Immanuel is able to infuse often weak magical effects into regular pieces of equipment during combat, although those effects usually have a limitation in the form of it having a limited amount of uses or only being usable for a short period of time. Although he is able to bypass these limitations to create a permanent magical item if he has the time and necessary materials for it.\nHypers\nSofortige elektromagnetische schienenkanone-Erstellung [4]: An ingenious combination of arcane spells allows Immanuel to almost instantaneously create a shoulder mounted and semi magical railgun for him to fire at his enemies. While this particular Hyper can be used whenever Immanuel's worldview has an unused 4, it simply fails to attach the railgun onto Immanuel's shoulder if he already has one on each shoulder.\nArcane Infusion: Mobilit\u00e4t+ [4]: Immanuel swiftly targets himself with a tried and tested series of mobility and speed enhancing spells as part of a presumably desperate attempt to get to a particular location in the nick of time. Causing a pair of wing shaped flames to shoot out of the back of his shoulders. But of course the spell's duration always runs out just a few seconds after Immanuel managed to reach his destination.\nArcane Infusion: Leistungsverst\u00e4rker [5]: Immanuel focuses almost entirely on his magical offenses for a few short moment to drastically increase the power of his ranged attacks for a single turn.\nArcane Infusion: \u00dcberw\u00e4ltigen [6]: Immanuel targets the weapons of two different allies with some randomly chosen magic in an attempt to infuse it with a mixture of hopefully not at all volatile magic that will definitely deal more damage to someone in the general area of the weapon.\nSpoiler: Tor Svensen (Dragon Rage) (click to show/hide) Current Regalia\nPortable Tabletop: This forearm-mounted device comes with a flat surface covered in card slots, a mechanical deck shuffler/sorter, a dice rolling mechanism, and a life counter. The life counter will take hits for Tor, but if it\u0092s reduced to 0 by attacks the Portable Tabletop will shut down for ten minutes, making it impossible for him to play cards.\nStats\nRanged: 7 - Tor\u0092s ranged capabilities are split roughly evenly between maneuver cards and monster cards. His monster cards do most of the fighting for him, and maneuver cards provide support and supplemental offense by enhancing his monsters and allies, or occasionally through directly attacking enemies.\nClose Quarters: 4 - Tor is really big and strong for a human, and he knows how to throw a punch. Additionally, he can have his monster cards intercept and assault, and deploy trap cards. Trap cards lie in wait until an enemy trips their activation requirement, which is set when they're played. Then, the trap card punishes or counters whatever tripped it.\nMobility: 2 - Tor isn\u0092t more mobile than a normal human on his own, but he can call upon monster cards to provide a mount or vehicle for faster movement, flight, underwater travel, etc.\nDefense: 4 - Tor doesn't have any ways to mitigate damage if he actually takes hits, and has to rely on healing maneuver cards in that case. Fortunately, he has some pretty good ones. However, he can have his monsters body-block incoming fire, or shield him with their own defenive abilities.\nExcel Hyper: 2 - Asteroid Field Ambush.\nRequiem\n<Unnamed>: Tor\u0092s requiem is simple. When he plays trading cards, he can cause the card\u0092s effects to manifest in the real world. He mostly uses this with his personal deck of Space Vikings, but any trading cards can be used. Due to the rules of the game, he must only play one monster card, one maneuver card, and one trap card each round.\nHypers\nUntil Folkvangr [3]: Tor plays one of his signature cards, the maneuver \u0091Until Folkvangr\u0092, to ascend two of his monsters to Freyja\u0092s halls, replacing them with a more powerful Einherjar monster. Only monsters who have seen battle may be ascended in this way.\nShining Valkyrie Squad [4]: Tor summons one of his ace monsters, the \u0091Shining Valkyrie Squad\u0092, a team of elite shieldmaidens equipped with laser battleaxes, particle shields, railguns, and hoverbikes.\nAssault Carrier Valhalla [5]: Tor summons one of his ace monsters, the \u0091Assault Carrier Valhalla\u0092, a space battlecruiser equipped with powerful railguns, thick armor, particle shields, and a hanger full of Huginn-class interceptors and Muninn-class bombers. The carrier can produce one fighter each round. The Assault Carrier Valhalla is a unique hero card, and Tor can only have one active at any given time.\nOmega Solar Flare [6]: Tor uses one of his signature cards, the maneuver \u0091Omega Solar Flare\u0092, and has one of his monsters go out in a blaze of glory. The monster is sacrificed to produce a huge blast of solar plasma capable of dealing devastating damage to multiple enemies. Omega Solar Flare\u0092s power scales with the power of the monster sacrificed.\nAsteroid Field Ambush [R]: Tor always keeps his signature trap card, \u0091Asteroid Field Ambush\u0092, in reserve. Asteroid Field Ambush activates if Tor or an ally would be defeated or slain by an attack, surrounding the attacker with asteroids from which three vehicle-type monsters charge in. The monsters intercept the incoming attack as best they can, and if any survive they immediately counterattack. This card can be activated from Tor\u0092s hand.\nSpoiler: Sasha Estevez (Zetaark) (click to show/hide) Current Regalia\nScarlet Lucereizen: Scarlet Heat is a heavily modified crimson colored motorcycle Sasha uses as her method of transportation and attack. The motorcycle can reach speeds racecars wish they could experience. Though not fully armored, it is specced to withstand increadibly high speed collisions and some degree of explosions, though maintenance tends to need to be done after the fight. Luceria and Zerreizen, meanwhile, are the twin pistols she wields in combat. Each one can individually fire out a volley of shots rapidly, and the two can be fused together to form a sniper rifle capable of high powered shots.\nStats\nRanged: 2 - Her gun, in either form, can deliver a barrage of smaller shots or larger and more powerful plasma shots. High speeds tend to limit the accuracy of her ranged shots, though she cheats using Spacial Rend to bypass aiming difficulties. As a result, her ranged attacks are all Hypers.\nClose Quarters: 4 - While her physical strength is decent, her main method of close combat involves ramming into them with her bike.\nMobility: 10 - Her motorcycle moves at incredibly high speeds, making her an evasive target. She herself is quite dexterous, and even without the bike can be a hard target to hit.\nDefense: 3 - Her bike is designed to withstand the abuse from the high speeds and plasma shots she fires, and offers some protection to Sasha during her more reckless stunts.\nExcel Hyper: 0 - None.\nRequiem\nSpacial Rend: Sasha can warp space, allowing her to ride her bike in ways that defy physics and more frequently warp her shots directly to the enemy, among other things.\nHypers\nRapid Shot [3]: Switching her gun to its dual pistol form, Sasha fires off a barrage of smaller shots onto her enemies.\nPlasma Shot [4]: In the gun's rifle form, Sasha fires a large and powerful, but slightly slower high-energy shot that creates an explosion on contact.\nExplosive Shot [5]: Sasha fires a shot at the enemy that sticks onto them. On command, the shot explodes, dealing more damage depending on how long it lingered.\nAccel Crash [6]: Sasha rams an enemy with her bike and fires a high-powered plasma shot, which she rams her enemy into at an extreme amount of speed. What's safety?\nSpoiler: Faznie Kotvar (TCM) (click to show/hide) Current Regalia\n35mm Goddard C800 Camera: An off-putting, shoulder-mounted film camera, cutting edge for its era. Sometimes it talks or writes things on the wall in unidentifiable liquid, but that's part of its charm. The Goddard functions not only as a recording device but a projector as well, transmitting movie images into reality that take on a physical form. Its effects do not require line-of-sight.\nStats\nRanged: 7 - Faznie is most comfortable fighting at a distance, chipping away at enemy psyches before they can reach her.\nClose Quarters: 4 - Faznie will not back down from a CQC encounter, changing her tactics from grand summons into quick flashes of the Goddard to unleash swinging cleavers, gruesome traps and writhing tentacles out of the ether in rapid succession. She also carries a folding knife, although its combat applications are limited to desperation attempts and coup de graces.\nMobility: 0 - Is it too late to regret taking Metallurgy of Swords over Track & Field?\nDefense: 6 - Goddard will produce defensive structures around Faznie in order to protect her, oftentimes without her direct input. It selects all sorts of props for a given situation, like a warehouse's metal gate, or partial debris of a crashed airplane.\nExcel Hyper: 2 - EARN YOUR 'X' RATING.\nRequiem\nThe Void: Faznie's presence and perpetual creation of the macabre takes a toll on morale. Even her defensive maneuvers are unsettling to say the least, who wants to have to hack through a wall of rotting cattle or gooey bile? Enemy interaction with Faznie causes sustained psychological trauma that manifests as Panic, Madness, and Resignation, among other symptoms. Of course, this is dependent on the psychological resolve and capacity of each enemy, though even non-sentient beings (such as robots or animated objects) can be negatively effected.\nHypers\nUnmarked Territory [3]: A sweeping 360-degree pan with the Goddard to change the immediate environment around Faznie. This landscape alteration is meant to conceal her allies and herself, while hindering enemy visibility and mobility. They might find themselves in a field of surprisingly resilient maize, or stumbling around a pitch-black basement.\nMind Crush [3]: A projection directly targeting the mind of an enemy, causing a grotesque intrusion and audiovisual hallucination. Causes direct psychological damage and disrupts focus.\nThey Come! [4]: A monstrous creation comes from beyond for Faznie to sic' on an enemy. These summons, manic sewer dwellers and giant frenzied insects, are not invulnerable but are impressively motivated to give their target a bad time. These apparitions dissipate after the enemy turn.\nFolly of Chance [5]: Do you notice how stupid and clumsy everyone becomes once the antagonist is chasing them? Faznie applies this cliche to an enemy, throw a deus-ex-machina wrench in their plans. Their gun could suddenly jam, or they trip over an unforeseen root during a charge attack.\nEARN YOUR 'X' RATING: The Goddard focuses entirely on one target until their reality and the projected reality are no different, effectively temporarily trapping them in a pocket dimension. See how the mighty veteran cybersamurai fares when he becomes a towel-clad housewife fleeing her suburban duplex from the \"Golf Club Killer\".\nSupporting Characters\nSpoiler: Marina von Siemens (IntSys) (click to show/hide) Current Regalia\nCintamani Brooch: A brooch wrapped in gold foils with a lustrous, green jewel put in it. It serves to amplify Marina's wish-granting powers.\nStats\nRanged: 4 - Marina's able to cast starry fireballs as rudimentary projectiles, but they're considered mediocre. Their power could be further amplified through the aid of wishes.\nClose Quarters: 4 - Marina's picked up a few melee tricks, due to having to wish for more boosts in melee increasingly often. Though, the power's still considered mediocre. Her melee strength could be further amplified through the aid of wishes.\nMobility: 4 - Marina's fairly lightweight, and her small build provides her with greater agility, but she would still be considered mediocre in mobility. Her mobility could be further amplified through the aid of wishes.\nDefense: 5 - Marina's capable of wishing for immediate shields to mitigate incoming damage. Having used the ability the most often, she grew to be the most proficient at it, being a bit above average. Her defense could be further amplified through the aid of wishes.\nExcel Hyper: 2 - Meteor Shower.\nRequiem\nWishmaker: Marina can grant wishes. To be more precise, Marina can grant wishes for people (including herself). She may only grant wishes that only affects the recipient directly, such as an extra pair of wings. Though, of note, her wish-granting powers are still not to the point of always granting the real thing - that is, even if she were to grant you a jet engine strapped on your back, it may still only be able to enhance your mobility somewhat, rather than blasting you into the oblivion upon activation.\nIn general, her wishes may cover healing and buffs that last for the duration of the battle (or damage and debuff to the recipient, but who in the right mind would wish for that?). The more is requested, the less potent it gets.\nThe potency of her wishes depends on the description given by the recipient, the recipient's willingness to believe in her powers, as well as her own current capabilities, though it may be enhanced through the help of her Excel Hyper, Meteor Shower.\nHypers\nRepelling Burst [3]: Quick and condensed close-ranged explosions from a flick of a finger. Its high knockback can be used to knock an opponent up high, or just simply be used as an effective disruption.\nAstral Shield [4]: A flexible shield that can be summoned in a whim for either point defense or a more rounded-out one.\nShooting Star [5]: Marina summons a bright shooting star out of nowhere, crossing the skies in a snap. The star shines so brightly that it's still noticeable in broad daylight. Should her allies wish upon the star, she would be able to grant several wish simultaneously.\nBest Wishes [6]: Marina passes on all of her current buffs to an ally, in addition to restoring health to them. It can only be used if she possess at least one buff.\nMeteor Shower [R]: Marina summons a magnificent meteor shower that crashes down upon the enemy party and deals decent damage overtime. It would last around a minute, and it would greatly improve the potency of her wishes for the duration of the shower.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:39.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51273a78fd8c122c904246741341a097dc9c474e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg93Ai8AfUnTTWWv6q.A_lmGLgmDYpdgpMZiCG0PfUSCWT.yiGnk7yoZknC7jXuoLuZFla_EpWGSyfXXIWJK0TRsS4bMfRvX1Tk8Jj5x3PFs53kp_FgBTtyCjVMMpCn2Xy5m5GOgmRd0WdnA.iDUnjKf", "site_full": "www.ebay.com", "site": "ebay.com", "site_section": "http://www.watchinga.com/il/shopping/gifts.rss?utm_source=watchinga&utm_medium=categorypage&utm_term=gowatchinga_gifts&utm_content=shopping&utm_campaign=rssfeed", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Gifts & Coupon Shopping on Watchinga", "title": "Antique Style Hollywood Decorative Projector with Clock Home Decor Gift 06", "title_full": "Antique Style Hollywood Decorative Projector with Clock Home Decor Gift 06", "published": "2017-12-07T05:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNTk1/z/pRYAAOSwB-1Ytm9Q/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51273a78fd8c122c904246741341a097dc9c474e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg93Ai8AfUnTTWWv6q.A_lmGLgmDYpdgpMZiCG0PfUSCWT.yiGnk7yoZknC7jXuoLuZFla_EpWGSyfXXIWJK0TRsS4bMfRvX1Tk8Jj5x3PFs53kp_FgBTtyCjVMMpCn2Xy5m5GOgmRd0WdnA.iDUnjKf", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "Antique Style Hollywood Decorative Projector with Clock Home Decor Gift 06", "text": "Image not available Photos not available for this variation View previous Antique Style Hollywood Decorative Projector with Clock Home Decor Gift 06 Condition: Time left: 4d 23h 55m $69.00 Estimated Dec. 27- Jan. 12 From:India Dec. 27 - Jan. 12 Est.

Part of the confusion stems from the historic evolution of its consumer-facing store brand: from Walmart (1962) to Wal-Mart (1964-1992) to Wal*Mart (1992) to Walmart (2008 to present).\nWhile its corporate brand stayed behind in the Wal-Mart era, \u201cWalmart\u201d has been used since 2008 in its stores, website, signage and marketing, as its Wikipedia entry shows visually.\nCEO Doug McMillon says the chain is legally changing its corporate name to \u201cWalmart Inc.\u201d on February 1, 2018, so it matches the name that consumers know it by. The move essentially creates a \u201cOne Walmart\u201d and a seamless brand, as investors, analysts, lawyers and its corporate partners can now bid Wal-Mart farewell and welcome Walmart.\n\nNot only does this clean up any usage clunkiness between its corporate and consumer branding, a press release notes that the name change and removal of hyphen and awkward punctuation \u201cchiefly demonstrates the company\u2019s growing emphasis on serving customers seamlessly however they want to shop: in stores, online, on their mobile device, or through pickup and delivery.\u201d\n\u201cOur customers know us as Walmart and today they shop with us not only in our stores but online and with our app as well,\u201d McMillon said. \u201cWhile our legal name is used in a limited number of places, we felt it was best to have a name that was consistent with the idea that you can shop us however you like as a customer.\u201d\nWalmart adopted \u201cWal-Mart, Inc.\u201d as its corporate name when it incorporated in 1969 and changed it to \u201cWal-Mart Stores Inc.\u201d a year ater. It\u2019s been using the current Walmart logo in its stores and website since 2008.\n\nThe post So Long, Wal-Mart: It\u2019s a One-Walmart Era in Corporate Rebrand appeared first on brandchannel: .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "doug mcmillon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcmillon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal-mart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal-mart stores inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wikipedia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal*mart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walmart inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:39.037+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "24cf47950df5c9eabda431efc8fee0e03a259f93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kltitvMrFnH7H5dUHlkH4wQI53PSxl3.x0kecoJBYIg521csWALCl2yIkZDsi1KxZlUgXrQwT5JQgZhmqhg4bjfvSNdyPWI0-", "site_full": "www.seabreeze.com.au", "site": "seabreeze.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.seabreeze.com.au/forums/Surfing/Longboarding", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Longboarding - Surfing forums | Seabreeze, page 1", "title": "Heads up thread 43", "title_full": "Heads up thread | Surfing Forums, page 43", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 23, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 55346, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1576b298064ac4b69842af3097a931db0978dcb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kltitvMrFnH7H5dUHlkH4wQI53PSxl3.x0kecoJBYIg521csWALCl2yIkZDsi1KxZlUgXrQwT5JQgZhmqhg4buc6W4WVg8gSKyE7rw6h.xw--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Macaha", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Select to expand Quote: vanders1 said..

Current price levels place the shares above the rising trendline. \nA principle of technical analysis is that once a trend has been formed (two or more peaks/troughs have touched the trendline and reversed direction) it will remain intact until broken. That sounds much more simplistic than it is! The goal is to analyze the current trend using trendlines and then either invest with the current trend until the trendline is broken, or wait for the trendline to be broken and then invest with the new (opposite) trend. \nOne of the basic tenets put forth by Charles Dow in the Dow Theory is that security prices do trend. Trends are often measured and identified by \u201ctrendlines.\u201d A trendline is a sloping line that is drawn between two or more prominent points on a chart. Rising trends are defined by a trendline that is drawn between two or more troughs (low points) to identify price support. Falling trend-s are defined by trendlines that are drawn between two or more peaks (high points) to identify price resistance. \nSharp investors may be looking to examine the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. Developed by Larry Williams, this indicator helps spot overbought and oversold market conditions. The Williams %R shows how the current closing price compares to previous highs/lows over a specified period. Beazley Plc (BEZ.L)\u2019s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is sitting at -78.69. Typically, if the value heads above -20, the stock may be considered to be overbought. On the flip side, if the indicator goes under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. \nAnother technical indicator that might serve as a powerful resource for measuring trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Beazley Plc (BEZ.L) is noted at 25.67. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nInvestors may use various technical indicators to help spot trends and buy/sell signals. Presently, Beazley Plc (BEZ.L) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -125.37. The CCI was developed by Donald Lambert. The assumption behind the indicator is that investment instruments move in cycles with highs and lows coming at certain periodic intervals. The original guidelines focused on creating buy/sell signals when the reading moved above +100 or below -100. Traders may also use the reading to identify overbought/oversold conditions. \nTaking a look at other technical levels, the 3-day RSI stands at 13.10, the 7-day sits at 26.54 and the 14-day (most common) is at 37.95. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d. \nKeeping an eye on Moving Averages, the 50-day is 495.91, the 200-day is at 474.20, and the 7-day is 490.98 for Beazley Plc (BEZ.L). Moving averages have the ability to be used as a powerful indicator for technical stock analysis. Following multiple time frames using moving averages can help investors figure out where the stock has been and help determine where it may be possibly going. The simple moving average is a mathematical calculation that takes the average price (mean) for a given amount of time.

The assassination of John F. Kennedy. The Challenger disaster. \nPeople often say that they remember exactly where they were and what they were doing when traumatic events like these occurred, reflecting a long-held belief that emotion enhances memory. There\u2019s even a name for it \u2014 flashbulb memory, because the memory is so accurate it\u2019s like a photograph. \nBut new research from Brandy Bessette-Symons , an assistant professor in the Ithaca College Department of Psychology , bolsters a growing consensus that emotion might actually do more harm than good. Neurons firing in the brain. (Image by Svisio) \nIn a new article in the journal Memory , entitled \u201cThe Robustness of False Memory for Emotional Pictures,\u201d Bessette-Symons shows that while under certain circumstances emotion can improve memory, it also makes it less reliable. \n\u201cEmotion doesn\u2019t necessarily make us better at remembering,\u201d says Bessette-Symons. \u201cIt sometimes makes us worse.\u201d \nHer conclusions are drawn from a series of nine experiments conducted over the course of several years, in which student volunteers were shown a series of pictures meant to evoke positive or negative emotions, or none at all. They were then shown those pictures, plus some that weren\u2019t in the original group, and asked to recognize which they had previously seen. This was done after two delay intervals \u2014 either 10 minutes or a week \u2014 to assess differences in short and long-term memory. \nIn the long term, participants were more likely to correctly identify the original negative emotion-inducing pictures than the neutral ones, while in the short term they were not. But in both, participants were more likely to falsely identify new negative pictures as originals. \n\u201cFalse memory is the most robust effect of emotion,\u201d Bessette-Symons says. \nThese results have important practical implications for things like the reliability of eyewitness testimony and police lineups. \n\u201cIf you give an assault victim a \u2018null lineup,\u2019 meaning the perpetrator is not in the lineup, they would, because of the emotionality of the crime, be more likely to falsely identify someone,\u201d said Bessette-Symons. \nPsychologists have demonstrated the unreliability of memories associated with emotions before, but Bessette-Symons is the first to explore how the effect of relatedness between pictures might influence emotional memory differences. For example, if someone is shown photos of a lion, a cheetah and a panther \u2014 all big cats \u2014 they\u2019re more likely to falsely remember seeing a photo of a tiger if later asked. It is then possible that the relationship between the pictures, not their emotional content, is responsible for the false memories. But Bessette-Symons discovered that this is not the case. \n\u201cWhat I found is that the emotional pictures were more related to each other, but that alone couldn\u2019t explain all the results that I reported,\u201d says Bessette-Symons. People Problem? \nAn interesting wrinkle that Bessette-Symons found in a subsequent analysis has led her to a new line of inquiry. In her experiments, false memories were only elicited by pictures of people, not pictures of objects. Brandy Bessette-Symons (Photo by Dan Verderosa/Ithaca College) \nBessette-Symons speculates this could be a result of people empathizing with pictures of people in a way they cannot with objects. \u201cIt could be that this bias component to emotion may only extend to social things, and the reason it only extends to social pictures is because it may be driven by an empathetic component of emotion,\u201d she said. \nThe original experiments used more photos of people than objects, so Bessette-Symons is now designing experiments that include an equal number of each in order to discern whether false memories are only prompted by pictures of people. \nShe says that some psychology labs tend not to find a false memory effect tied to emotion, which could be because they tend to use pictures of objects, not people. A Group Effort \nWhile Bessette-Symons is the sole author of the Memory article, she is quick to point out that she received help from a team of student researchers. In the Ithaca College psychology department, all psychology majors are required to work on a research team for three semesters. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really great,\u201d she said. \u201cThey get really closely involved in the research.\u201d \nThe students on Bessette-Symons team contribute to all aspects of her research projects, including helping to design the experiments, recruiting participants and performing data collection and analysis. Throughout the years required to complete the data collection for the nine experiments represented in the Memory article, many of her students presented on one or more of the experiments as posters and oral presentations at both undergraduate and professional conferences. \nAdam Chafee, who graduated with a psychology degree in May 2017, was on Bessette-Symons\u2019s research team for three semesters, and still helps out today. In spring 2017, he helped present the research at the annual convention of the Eastern Psychological Association in Boston, Massachusetts. \nChafee says his experience with Bessette-Symons has proven invaluable. \u201cIn terms of getting into the research field, it\u2019s important to get as much experience as possible and IC definitely gives you the opportunity to do that,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dan verderosa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john f. kennedy", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "svisio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chafee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandy bessette-symons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam chafee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bessette-symons", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ithaca college", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eastern psychological association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ithaca college department of psychology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan verderosa/ithaca college", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pearl harbor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:39.055+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "24cf47950df5c9eabda431efc8fee0e03a259f93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kltitvMrFnH7H5dUHlkH4wQI53PSxl3.x0kecoJBYIg521csWALCl2yIkZDsi1KxZlUgXrQwT5JQgZhmqhg4bjfvSNdyPWI0-", "site_full": "www.seabreeze.com.au", "site": "seabreeze.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.seabreeze.com.au/forums/Surfing/Longboarding", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Longboarding - Surfing forums | Seabreeze, page 1", "title": "Heads up thread 43", "title_full": "Heads up thread | Surfing Forums, page 43", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 23, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 55346, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2a1a77888eae87a7518af62068222787efd7ae6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kltitvMrFnH7H5dUHlkH4wQI53PSxl3.x0kecoJBYIg521csWALCl2yIkZDsi1KxZlUgXrQwT5JQgZhmqhg4buc6W4WVg8gREWeyg0u9.Vg--", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "SP", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Select to expand Quote: Macaha said..

(AP) - The Latest on Southern California wildfires (all times local): \n10:30 p.m. \nA surge from the biggest of the wildfires burning in Southern California has forced several thousand more people to evacuate in a community of artists and resorts. \nVentura County sheriff's Sgt. Eric Buschow says flames have been creeping closer and slowly surrounding the town of Ojai (OH'hi), and on Tuesday night increasing winds brought them close enough to expand evacuation orders there. \nFlames, now about 4 miles away, were visible from the city's downtown for the first time on Tuesday night, and ash was raining down. \nParts of Ojai were already under evacuation orders, and the entire valley surrounding it had been under a voluntary evacuation advisory since the fire broke out on Monday. \nThe new evacuations meant most of the town of about 7,000 people was under mandatory orders. \nNearly 30,000 people are under evacuation orders for the fire. \n___ \n7:50 p.m. \nThe largest and most destructive wildfire in Southern California has grown to 140 square miles and fire officials say the worst may be yet to come. \nThe 90,000-acre fire burning in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles has swept through ridges and canyons to the sea and Santa Ana winds that drove it are expected to return with a vengeance overnight. \nState fire director Ken Pimlott says winds that eased in the afternoon could return with gusts up to 80 mph Thursday that would make it impossible to fight the fire. \nDozens of homes have burned since the blaze erupted Monday. Nearly 1,800 firefighters and a fleet of aircraft are fighting the flames but the blaze is only 5 percent contained and an estimated 12,000 buildings are in danger. \n___ \n6:20 p.m. \nA wildfire in a wealthy western area of Los Angeles has reached the estate and winery owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. \nRoxanne Langer at Moraga Vineyards in Bel Air says a temperature-controlled wine storage shed burned after the fire erupted before dawn Wednesday but it's unclear how much wine was lost. \nShe says firefighters stepped in to douse the flames with the aid of helicopters and that other storage sheds, the winery itself and the estate's unoccupied house are not damaged. \nThe winery has been evacuated. \nMurdoch bought the property for about $30 million in 2013. \nLanger says it appears the 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines suffered only slight damage and the grapes already had been harvested. \nIn a Facebook statement, Murdoch says some neighbors suffered heavy losses and his thoughts and prayers are with them. \n___ \n3:45 p.m. \nFirefighters have stopped the spread of a wildfire that has destroyed homes near the world-famous Getty museum in Los Angeles. \nDeputy Fire Chief Charles Butler says firefighters and aircraft stopped the growth of the 475-acre (192-hectare) blaze in the Bel Air neighborhood. \nThere are currently few visible flames and crews are concentrating on the southwest corner of the fire. \nButler says four homes have been destroyed and 11 damaged since the blaze erupted before dawn Wednesday in an area that includes many hilltop mansions. \nAbout 700 homes, an apartment building and a school have been ordered evacuated. \nNortheast winds driving the flames eased by afternoon but are expected to return in full force Wednesday night. Firefighters are struggling to ring the blaze before that happens. \n___ \n3:15 p.m. \nCalifornia's top firefighter says the state is in for the worst Santa Ana wind conditions it's ever seen. \nKen Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, says the wind wildfire threat to Southern California for Thursday is purple. The has color has never been used before, means there is extreme danger and that fires that erupt will burn uncontrollably. \nBelow that is red, meaning high danger of fires that burn rapidly and intensely and are difficult to control. \nPimlott says the winds could hit 80 mph (129 kph) and make it impossible to fight Southern California wildfires that have destroyed at least 200 homes and buildings. \nFive wind-driven flames continue to threaten homes in Ventura and Los Angeles. Some 200,000 people are under evacuation orders. \n___ \n1:25 p.m. \nThe University of California, Los Angeles, has canceled classes for the rest of the day due to difficult traffic problems stemming from a wildfire. \nThe university's website says many students, faculty and staff have been unable to reach the campus Wednesday, so classes from noon onward are canceled. \nThe athletics department says a night men's basketball game and all other team workouts and practices are canceled. \nThe fire erupted before dawn in the Sepulveda Pass, just up Interstate 405 from UCLA. The fire has destroyed some homes as it spread into the Bel Air area. \n___ \n10 a.m. \nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti says at least four and possibly six homes have been destroyed by a wildfire in the city's Bel Air area. \nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday in Sepulveda Pass, a major commuter route between the west side of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north. \nThe fire burned up hillsides on the east side of the pass into expensive neighborhoods that are now under evacuation orders. \nThe mayor says the fire is now 150 acres with zero containment. \nSome 500 firefighters are battling the fire along with water-dropping helicopters and airplanes laying down streams of fire retardant. \nThe dangerous Santa Ana winds that have fanned fires across Southern California this week have diminished over the new LA fire but conditions are very dry, with just 9 percent relative humidity. \n___ \n9:15 a.m. \nPresident Donald Trump says his thoughts and prayers \"are with everyone\" in the path of California's latest wildfires. \nTrump in a tweet is also encouraging everyone \"to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials\" and thanking first responders for their \"incredible work!\" \nWind-driven fires have raced through California communities for the second time in two months, leaving hundreds of homes feared lost and uprooting tens of thousands of people. \nThe most damaging fire is in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, where more than 100 square miles (259 sq. kilometers) and numerous homes have burned. \nDeadly fires tore through Northern California earlier this year. \n___ \n8:03 a.m. \nThe biggest and most destructive of several wildfires burning in Southern California has scorched more than 101 square miles. \nState fire authorities say the fire burning in Ventura County about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles is also considered a threat to 12,000 structures Wednesday. \nDozens of homes have burned since the fire erupted Monday amid fierce Santa Ana winds. \nA new fire burning among ridges and canyons on the west side of Los Angeles has also burned several homes while snarling morning commuter traffic. \n___ \n7:35 a.m. \nTwo homes are burning in a wildfire that has erupted in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles, the latest to hit fire-plagued Southern California. \nThe fire broke out before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Interstate 405 in the Sepulveda Pass and raced up steep slopes into neighborhoods at the top. \nThe Los Angeles Fire Department has deployed hundreds of firefighters and called in helicopters and airplanes. \nEvacuations have been ordered and a wider area has been told to be ready for orders to leave. \nIt's the same region of Los Angeles where hundreds of homes burned in the famous 1961 Bel Air Fire. \n___ \n6:52 a.m. \nMandatory evacuations have been ordered in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles as a dangerous new wildfire burns in Southern California. \nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Sepulveda Pass, which carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains on the city's western side. \nHelicopters are making water drops and more than 200 firefighters are battling flames close to homes. \nIn addition to the mandatory evacuations, Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman Margaret Stewart says a wider area on the east side of the pass has been advised to get ready in case of evacuation orders. \n___ \n5:35 a.m. \nA brush fire has erupted on the west side of Los Angeles along Interstate 405 in Sepulveda Pass. \nFire Department spokesman Margaret Stewart says the fire was reported at 4:52 a.m. Wednesday and is burning uphill, driven by topography rather than winds. \nStewart says 47 firefighters are on the scene, setting up protection for homes at the top of the steep slopes. Two firefighting helicopters have been assigned. \nSepulveda Pass carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains between the western neighborhoods of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north. \n___ \n12:40 a.m. \nThe same vicious winds that made three Southern California wildfires so destructive are also making the firefight itself more difficult. \nThe water-dropping planes and helicopters essential to fighting massive fires have been mostly grounded because it's too dangerous to fly in the strong gusts. \nCommanders hoped to have them back in the air on Wednesday morning, but all indications are the winds will be whipping then too. \nThe blazes brought evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people, destroyed nearly 200 homes and have remained mostly out control. \nThe largest and most destructive of the blazes, an 85-square-mile wildfire in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, had nearly reached the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday night after starting 30 miles inland a day earlier. \n___ \nThe 5:35 a.m. entry has been corrected to say west side.

While it is possible to see signs that it is growing gradually, there needs to be a significant expansion if EVs are going to become a substantial element of the overall vehicle parc. \nOne of the encouraging aspects of the recent Budget was that the Government is showing signs of dealing with this issue with a raft of measures designed to boost availability of chargers. \nThe most visible of these was a \u00a3400m Charging Infrastructure Investment Fund. However, what was perhaps more interesting were a range of moves that will integrate charging infrastructure into general Government activity. These included updating building regulations to mandate that all new residential developments contain enabling cabling for chargepoints in homes, changing roadworks guidance for local authorities so that infrastructure is installed when works are happening, and providing greater emphasis on the delivery of chargepoints at rail stations as part of the franchising process. \nInterestingly for fleets, also announced was a Benefit in Kind exemption for employees charging electric vehicles at work, to come into effect April 2018. \nAll of this sounds impressive but there is a question mark over whether it is enough to make a noticeable difference to EV adoption, especially in the short-medium term. This is very difficult to assess but what is perhaps most important is that policy is heading in the right direction and we are hopeful that these measures will be followed by further moves in the future. \nThe next big Government reveal regarding EVs and infrastructure will be in March 2018 when information will be released about official zero emissions road transport strategy. We await further details with interest.
