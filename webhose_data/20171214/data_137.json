All of this will decrease passenger transfer demand. \n\u201cThe Middle East is a key hotspot for helicopter operations in the coming five years with a 20% increase in overall activity between 2018 and 2022. In Latin America, activity has nearly halved during the downturn, but will rebound quickly, primarily driven by activity in Brazil. \n\u201cGrowth opportunities also exist elsewhere, particularly in offshore wind business. As the next generation of projects becomes commercially competitive and developers build further from shore, clusters of projects will likely share infrastructure and logistics. Helicopter operators that get in early will benefit from this future growth.\u201d Recommended for you ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve robertson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westwood", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "energy voice | offshore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westwood global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airbus super pumas", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mediterranean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guyana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:27.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d48d0bef5f05425a153aefd71747604e17748d47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsXm9.rT3o.P6Bf_jilfZExLYhJkKAdyNgGzmQc8E2mq0hwcy1xqtsZi1mkqBX80fUWza5GOIb4IaHkV5Odf9SQPXrA7MsDkvRC", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : personalfinance", "title": "With $63K in 2017 income, what are some uncommonly known tax deductions or loopholes that can lower my Federal Tax burden?", "title_full": "With $63K in 2017 income, what are some uncommonly known tax deductions or loopholes that can lower my Federal Tax burden? : personalfinance", "published": "2017-12-07T09:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.169, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad50caf1649336a1d0275b54df7ed2f8d6c44d5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsXm9.rT3o.P6Bf_jilfZExLYhJkKAdyNgGzmQc8E2mq0hwcy1xqtsZi1mkqBX80fUWza5GOIb4IaHkV5Odf9SQPWPuNgDlfmg56odQhN3h4ygBVuHxwGrqPw--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "point51", "published": "2017-12-07T09:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yes, I have school loans (~$400 per month).

Frecklington Tobi Loftus Full Profile Login to follow \nSITTING Nanango MP and LNP Deputy Leader Deb Frecklington has officially declared victory for the seat following the November 25 election. \nWhile the Queensland Electoral Commission is yet to declare the full result of the state election, News Corp analysis showed Labor had won the 47 seats needed to form a majority government. \nMrs Frecklington said she would continue to advocate for the electorate on the floor of Parliament, no matter which party forms government. \n\"If we have a Labor government it is holding them to account and delivering something,\u201d she said. \n\"History tells us that a Labor government just doesn't deliver for our region. \n\"I announced many road projects during the election campaign and I'm determined to see them on the top of the priority list for this area.\u201d \nThose promises included upgrades to the Maidenwell-Bunya Mountains Rd, Byee Rd, Mundubbera-Durong Rd and the Cooyar bridge. \n\"A lot of these roads are very important roads for people that use them, though outside of my area people wouldn't care about them or know they're even there,\u201d Mrs Frecklington said. \n\"But they really will make a difference to safety in the lives of people on that road. \n\"There are so many projects that I was able to announce in the election that I'd love to see come through but that is up to the government of the day.\u201d \nOpinion polling prior to the election showed Pauline Hanson's One Nation would perform better than they did in the end. \nMrs Frecklington said voters saw through the party's populist nature. \n\"I think people are attracted to populist politics but at the end of the day they are able to see hard-working local members who have delivered things in the past and there is an advantage to having a conservative government in place for areas such as Nanango,\u201d she said. \n\"What people out there are looking for is for their representative to listen to them, understand what their problems are and try to do something about it.\u201d \nMrs Frecklington said she did not want to comment on the state result for the LNP until all results were known. \n\"My concern currently is for my colleagues who have lost their seats, my colleagues who have gained their seats and my colleagues who are sitting waiting for their votes to be counted,\u201d she said. \n\"Out of respect for all those people I won't be making any comment on state-wide issues.\u201d \nMrs Frecklington also wouldn't be drawn into any speculation on an LNP leadership challenge.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "deb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deb

Traditional QSRs like d\u00f6ner kebabs and currywurst stands are considered staples of the city- these traditional outlets tend not to go with the trends in the wider QSR market. Larger QSR outlets have shown increased focus on integration through phone based connection with customers. Examples include: phone based payment systems, or simply making the menu available through social media. This helps make QSRs more accessible in people\u2019s busy lives. \nFrance \nNew burger brands have emerged in Paris e.g. Burger King, Five Guys. As a result, the burger is now an element of \u201ceveryday\u201d food. Additionally, online delivery services like Deliveroo, Foodora and Uber Eats connect QSRs directly to customer homes. The health & wellbeing trend is also prominent in France, with consumers increasingly looking for fresh, homemade, local produce. Millennials and people under the age of 35 most commonly frequent QSRs. Workers can avail of \u201crestaurant tickets\u201d given to them by their employer, and are therefore very popular among this cohort. High level professionals and trendy business workers tend to eat in more up market options. Regardless of age or socio-economic class, most people use QSRs due to speed and convenience factors. Paris is seeing more and more healthy and homemade QSR options. Increasingly, consumers are looking for healthy, fresh and ethically sourced food with a natural and \u201cFrench touch\u201d. \nSweden \nQSR growth in the Swedish market has been aided by evolving menu offerings and general consumer enthusiasm with regard to eating out. A wider premiumization trend, driven by a consumer desire for healthy, fresh, locally-produced and sustainable ingredients is of particular note. The premiumization of menus and ingredients also extends to the restaurant interior, and more focus is now placed on creating venues to match. Food trucks are particularly popular amongst those self-employed, students and tourists. These are typically quick and affordable options. Classic fast food chains such as McDonalds, Burger King and Max are particularly popular with families. Increasingly, working professionals of various ages go for lunch in QSRs. This demographic wants healthy, fresh and quality ingredients, and an inviting space to sit down for lunch. Mobile payment is popular amongst Swedish consumers, which help to streamline the ordering experience. Most QSR also offer free Wi-Fi and have good social media presence. Home delivery apps are also very popular in major cities e.g. Foodora, Hungrig and Wolt. \nPlease feel free to read the entire article here", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dan orehov  healthy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deliveroo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foodora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hungrig", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mcdonalds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qsr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish food board (board bia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burger king", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foodora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:31.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a710af18aba499d0323ef89db4e1e266ca75c8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSLIs.dq9M0LgLiGfH9tQNGc7jTo9PgOVMZ9kRKrfm8vr6QvABchtIaYwn7BUxr470ismtOHvMFsDoQ6DR97IAlbXZIImXkQpaVnUwPlsWQbg--", "site_full": "www.southburnetttimes.com.au", "site": "southburnetttimes.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.southburnetttimes.com.au/feeds/rss/homepage", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "southburnetttimes.com.au: South Burnett Times Homepage", "title": "BUSHkids launches its new website", "title_full": "BUSHkids launches its new website", "published": "2017-12-06T16:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2017/03/16/b88644740z1_20170316135909_000g65i1iro2-0-ktkn3r4hyq9sb2kpwn2_ct300x300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a710af18aba499d0323ef89db4e1e266ca75c8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSLIs.dq9M0LgLiGfH9tQNGc7jTo9PgOVMZ9kRKrfm8vr6QvABchtIaYwn7BUxr470ismtOHvMFsDoQ6DR97IAlbXZIImXkQpaVnUwPlsWQbg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T16:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "BUSHkids launches its new website", "text": "BUSHkids launches its new website 7th Dec 2017 12:33 PM BUSHkids has launched a brand new website.

Lagos \nBy Evelyn Usman \nT ragedy struck yesterday in Bariga area of Lagos after an owner of a pharmaceutical shop, Mr. Kenneth Eze, his pregnant wife and two children were burnt to death in a fire that engulfed their bungalow building. \nThe exact cause of the inferno, which occurred at about 2a.m. could not be ascertained. But some residents of Buriamoh street stated that it was caused by power upsurge while others claimed that it was by candlelight. The fire at Rida National Plastics Company Ltd., Lagos, yesterday. \nThe Ezes, according to residents ,were last seen at about 10.30p.m. Monday. \nA woman, who gave her name as Mama Ibeji, told Vanguard that she was the last person to patronise the family that night. \nAccording to her: \u201c When I got to the shop to get some pain relief medicine for my ailing son, they were already closing for the day. I saw their two children sleeping. \n\u201cI gave them N500 but they suggested that I should either bring the money tomorrow (today) or leave it with them and come for my balance the next day. I took the money with a promise to bring the N220 to them today. But to my shock, the unthinkable occurred .\u201d \nThe fire was said to have started from their pharmaceutical shop located on number 13 of the street while Eze, his pregnant wife, Sarah and their two children of ages five and eight were sleeping. \nAnother resident, Mr. Ezenwa Uche, told Vanguard: \u201cPerhaps, they all would not have died had there been other tenants in the compound with them. From all indications, it was obvious that they all slept inside the shop where the fire started from. \n\u201cWe were alerted by the shout of fire at about 3a.m. Though we tried there was nothing anyone could do to salvage the situation because the fire had extended to the main building.\u201d \nFather\u2019s love \n\u201cFrom the positions of the charred remains, it was obvious that Kenneth carried one of the children and attempted to escape, as the bodies were seen in that posture,\u201d Uche added. \nThe spokesperson for the Lagos State Police Command, Chike Oti, a Superintendent of Police confirmed the incident. He said: \u201cThe family lived alone in the building. The fire consumed the bungalow and the shop. \n\u201cPolicemen, firefighters and other rescue operators, who were mobilised to the scene, prevented the fire from spreading to other buildings.\u201d \nOn his part, the Lagos State Director, Fire Service, Rasaq Fadipe, said that the incident occurred at about 2.48a.m., adding that the double burglary irons on the door and windows of the apartment prevented personnel of the Fire Service from reaching out to rescue the victims on time. \nSpeaking through the Service\u2019s spokesman, Amodu Shakiru, he said: \u201c The apartment is a chemist store.

Let\u2019s explore what the cost-effective unstructured data storage solution we have in the market. \nThanks to cloud storage which makes it easy and lower the cost without compromising the quality & security. \nObject storage can be used to store any object like photos, video, audio, pdf, documents, static files, etc. \nThis can also be used to host a static website or backup purpose. \nA good thing about cloud storage is you can upload and download the data from anywhere on the Internet and also give you an option to restrict it. \nSo you have both options to choose from based on your requirement. \nAnother worth mentioning you pay for what you use . \nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the best cloud storage services. 1. AWS S3 \nIf you are working in the cloud already, then this is pretty much guessable. One of the famous and pioneer\u2019s in providing object storage. \nDon\u2019t bother about storage limitation; you can upload any amount of data. \nAWS S3 provides 99. % durability and give you an option to upload/download data using a browser, API. \nThere are three types of storage class offered. \nStandard \u2013 a low-latency general purpose storage type, perfect for content distribution, big data analytics, etc. \nStandard IA (infrequent access) \u2013 You can go for IA if the content isn\u2019t accessed frequently. IA cost less than standard and suitable for keeping long-term data which is not accessible daily. \nGlacier \u2013 lower cost than IA and suitable for data archive. \nAWS provides lifecycle management to transition objects from one storage class to another. \nS3 is a region basis that means you can keep your data near to your customer, visitor for faster content distribution and uploads. \nAnd if you are thinking about DR then it\u2019s covered. It supports cross-region replication which can be used for backup, DR. \nIf you are looking to explore the S3 (simple storage service) solution, then you can get it started with FREE tier which includes 5GB storage. 2. Google Cloud Storage (GCS) \nA low-latency storage by Google for small to enterprise level of business . Google offers four types of storage. \nSimilar to S3, GCS offer data life-cycle too for moving data from one storage type to another. or you can also configure to delete it. \nThere could be a scenario when you want to keep data only for a specific period. Ex, below condition will delete any data older than 30 days in a bucket. \nConsidering Google Cloud got multiple data center across the world, you can keep your data in various cities in Asia, Europe, and the USA. \nRecently GCS have introduced requester pays feature where requester bears the data requests cost. \nUnder GCP free tier, you get 5 GB regional storage to play around. 3. Spaces \nNewly introduced storage service by DigitalOcean called Spaces offers two months FREE trial. \nCurrently, its available in New York and Amsterdam data center and cost $5 per month for 250GB and additional $0.20 per GB. \nYou can either use drag-n-drop interface or programmatically through API or CLI to control the data. \nSome of the common usages of spaces are: Web resources like HTML, image, CSS, js or to host the static site Logs storage Keeping a backup, data archive \nIf you are looking for fixed rate monthly, then DigitalOcean would be one of the cheapest one. 4. Cloud Files \nCloud Files by Rackspace is powered by OpenStack to provides scalable cloud storage. It tightly integrates with AKAMAI CDN to serve content faster worldwide. \nYou can keep cloud files container as a private or public. \nRackspace provides unique features like temporary URL which is valid only for a specific period. A perfect solution where you want to sell digital media and want a user to download within a defined time. 5. IBM Cloud Object Storage \nCloud storage by IBM offers server-side encryption and SSL/TLS in transit. Data can be controlled using a web interface, RESTful API, SDK. \nBy using SDK, it enables you to use storage not just with IBM cloud services with another platform too. There are two resiliency options. Regional \u2013 store data in multiple data center but same region Cross region \u2013 store data in multiple regions, useful if you are looking for region-based HA. \nIBM offers four types of storage . Standard \u2013 general purpose data, accessed frequently Vault \u2013 data accessed once a month or less Cold vault \u2013 Occasionally accessed data, for long-term data retention Flex \u2013 Dynamic data, mix of data accessed frequently and infrequently \nUnder the lite plan, you can get it started with 25 GB data in FREE. 6. Alibaba OSS \nAlibaba Cloud OSS (Object storage service) offers 99.9% availability guarantee. Costing is based on what you use, without upfront or long-term commitment. \nAlibaba storage is capable of handling more than 50,000 requests per seconds , and it got in-built multi-level security to protect from DDoS , unauthorized login attempts. 7. Azure Blob Storage \nStore any unstructured data with Microsoft Azure blog storage . One of the more considerable advantages of Azure is locations. \nEx: if you are looking for multiple datacenter locations in India then at the moment, Azure got better coverage. \nAzure also got other types of storage like File & Archive to suit additional requirements. 8. Oracle Storage \nCloud storage by Oracle let you store unlimited unstructured data per bucket. Some of the features are: Multiple ways to connect \u2013 OpenStack swift API, HDFS plug-in, REST API, Java SDK, Python CLI and console Scalable \u2013 don\u2019t worry about data size, it scales automatically. Encryption \u2013 server-side encryption with 256 AES algorithm \nI know there are multiple choice to store data in the cloud. Best way to choose is by trying them. Most of the above-listed cloud storage service provider offer an FREE trial. \nI use GCS and happy with the performance and pricing.

Source: Thinkstock \nBy Jennifer Bresnick \nDecember 06, 2017 - Surgical space is a finite resource for hospitals and health systems, and it is also one of the most important. Long wait times for an operating room are simply unacceptable for most physicians and their patients, especially when emergency situations arise. \nEven worse is an OR that has booked for a provider but consistently remains empty during the scheduled hours, says Yi-An Huang, Director of Operations at Boston Medical Center (BMC) \u2013 especially when the mismatch could be avoided through better big data analytics and the use of business intelligence tools. Yi-An Huang, Director of Operations at Boston Medical Center Source: Xtelligent Media \nBoston Medical Center has around 400 beds and 24 operating rooms. \u201cThat means scheduling OR time can be extremely complex,\u201d Huang explained to HealthITAnalytics.com . \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a very good look when you have physicians complaining that their patients can\u2019t get into the OR fast enough, but when you go to check on the situation, the room is empty because it was blocked off for someone who didn\u2019t end up using it.\u201d \nSurgery can be an unpredictable specialty, he added, and an individual provider\u2019s needs might change from week to week. READ MORE: Leveraging Business Intelligence for Healthcare Management \n\u201cThey might need two hours or ten hours,\u201d he said, \u201cand they might not always be able to tell us what the number will be in advance. We need to make sure we have time available when something takes too long, or gets changed, or becomes an emergency and needs to be booked in right away.\u201d \nSurgeons have very full schedules that include more than just operating time, Huang said. \u201cThey have clinic consults; they have meetings. So you want to make sure they can schedule those things with some degree of certainty \u2013 you can\u2019t just tell a surgeon they have to jump into the OR whenever it happens to be free.\u201d \nBalancing adaptability with predictability was a difficult task for Huang, who doesn\u2019t have a large in-house analytics team to help him take on the challenge. \n\u201cWhen I started at BMC, there was very little data available about OR scheduling and what we were doing,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe had just transitioned to Epic Systems, and we were trying to set up some of the analytics and reporting to understand whether our surgical teams were effectively using the time that was allotted to them.\u201d \n\u201cEpic has a lot of strengths, but we couldn\u2019t get exactly what we needed in this case. I was actually taking the PDF reports we got from Epic, copying and pasting the data into Excel, and re-working the data so we could use it for what we needed.\u201d READ MORE: Turning Healthcare Big Data into Actionable Clinical Intelligence \nUsing Excel as a fallback wasn\u2019t sufficient for this use case, Huang said, even though the ubiquitous data management tool can provide healthcare organizations with some analytics capabilities. \n\u201cHospitals have so much data available these days, but we\u2019re still cutting that data with stone tools,\u201d he stated. \u201cYou can have a great data warehouse, but if you don\u2019t have the right applications on top of that to perform meaningful analytics, you\u2019re probably going to rely heavily on Excel.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s a classic stone tool. You can get the job done with some effort, but it\u2019s not very pretty, and you can\u2019t really get as deep into the data as you might want to.\u201d \nHealthcare organizations are in desperate need of better business intelligence, he continued. Without a firm grip on utilization metrics, patient challenges, and available resources, providers will be unable to meet the high-pressure challenges of value-based care. \n\u201cEvery hospital or health system has to learn to use their data better and understand their patients better so they can intervene to improve outcomes quicker and more effectively, especially if they want to compete in the value-based care market,\u201d he stressed. READ MORE: Big Data, PCP Engagement Aid Mount Sinai with Population Health \nSmall tweaks to a population health management approach, for example, could produce significant returns in patient health as well as spending. \n\u201cThe classic illustration is buying an air conditioner for chronic asthmatics \u2013 that\u2019s a minor up-front investment, but it can help improve their quality of life and lower costs significantly down the line. But if you don\u2019t have the data or the insight into that data to identify those patients who could benefit from a program like that, you\u2019re leaving money on the table.\u201d \nWith a targeted business intelligence tool at his disposal, Huang is now able to adjust OR booking slots more easily and more often, ensuring that providers who need extra time can get it \u2013 and those that don\u2019t are not inhibiting the work of their colleagues. \n\u201cNow instead of spending two hours a month putting together custom reports in Excel, I can go into Hospital IQ and get data in a usable format to get the answers I need,\u201d said Huang. \nHaving better business intelligence at his fingertips has actually made some tough conversations easier, he added. \n\u201cThere was definitely a phase where I really needed to go to providers and explain where the data came from and how we constructed our metrics,\u201d Huang acknowledged. \n\u201cThey wanted to make sure it was reliable enough to make decisions, which is a great thing for providers to care about and bring up to their analytics leaders. The rest of it was just getting people used to the fact that this was how we were going to allocate OR time from now on.\u201d \nChecking the scheduling every two or three months allows Boston Medical Center to keep on top of staffing changes, identify opportunities for improvement, and answer questions from the surgical teams. \n\u201cThe fact that we are doing this in an objective way, transparently and backed by data, has made people feel more included in the process, which reduces friction when we have to make a change they might not particularly like.\u201d \n\u201cI can go to them and say, \u2018Listen, the data shows that this time isn\u2019t getting used. We\u2019re going to reallocate it, but we\u2019re also going to watch it and see if that change is effective or not. That way, we can add back the time if it turns out to be warranted.\u2019\u201d \nSpeedier access to data that is tailored to the specific use case at hand has enabled Boston Medical Center to continue developing a culture of reliance on data for operational decision-making. \n\u201cBecause we can get the data so much more easily, we can be very responsive and turn this into a continuous improvement process,\u201d explained Huang. \n\u201cWe are able to have much more thoughtful, informed, and intentional conversations about all the little adjustments we need to make in order to maximize utilization of a finite resource.\u201d \nExecutives, clinicians, and other stakeholders are more willing to collaborate when sharing a single, trusted source of information, said Huang. \n\u201cThere is a lot more scrutiny of our processes, but it\u2019s not negative or punitive in nature. The conversations have shifted from \u2018I think this might be happening\u2019 to \u2018here\u2019s the data that supports my theory about this trend.\u2019 That\u2019s a much better conversation to have.

As Zipcar, Uber and other car- and ride-sharing programs add more EVs, they\u2019re pushing cities to expand charging infrastructure and convincing users to go electric. By Lyndsey Gilpin, InsideClimate News Dec 7, 2017 \nEurope\u2019s car-sharing programs have been shifting to electric vehicles; Paris's programs have over 1,100 stations and 4,000 self-service electric cars. In the U.S., the slow spread of charging infrastructure has been an obstacle. Credit: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images \nTwenty Nissan Leafs are scattered at electric charging stations across Chattanooga, Tennessee. At first glance, the compact electric cars may seem like they're already owned, but they're actually for public use\u2014and as easy to access as a bike share. \nUsers just have to download the city's electric car-sharing service Green Commuter app, get approved, and choose a vehicle. Most are available for $7 an hour, and a few sponsored by the city's electric power board are as low as $4 an hour. \nIn one year, the project has sparked demand for both electric vehicles and EV infrastructure, including from housing developers interested in adding charging stations, said Philip Pugliese, transportation system planner for the Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority (CARTA), which manages the project. \n\"We have this goal of expanding electrification and infrastructure, and this program is giving people the opportunity to experience electric vehicles,\" Pugliese said. \nFor over a decade, car-sharing companies like Zipcar have had some electric vehicles in their fleets, but U.S. demand for EVs started to surge only in the last few years as governments tried to limit greenhouse gas emissions, battery costs dropped and more models hit the market. With China and European countries now setting electrification goals and planning to ban diesel and gas-powered vehicles within the next few decades, major automakers are scrambling to electrify their vehicles, and most U.S. cities aren't prepared. \nOne way to increase U.S. demand and help cities expand EV charging infrastructure is through car-sharing and ride-sharing fleets that can introduce future car buyers to electric vehicles, said Robin Chase, co-founder and former CEO of Zipcar. \nCar sharing is growing rapidly in urban areas as more people forego the hassle and expense of owning a car. The number of car-sharing users rose more than 300 percent in North America from 2010 to 2014, according to the latest data from the University of California-Berkeley's Transportation Sustainability Research Center. With the support of a city or transit authority, an accessible charging network and an affordable price, electric car sharing can not only make transportation more climate-friendly, it can also help drive electric vehicle adoption, Chase said. Gateway to EV Adoption \nIn 2001, when Zipcar first added electric vehicles to its fleet, the EVs were the last ones to be taken out of the lot, Chase said. But in the last few years, that's changed. \"People aren't as afraid of electric vehicles as they used to be,\" she said. \n\"Exposure to electric vehicles makes a difference for people,\" said Alan Jenn, a researcher at the Institute of Transportation Systems at the University of California-Davis, citing a 2011 study of drivers who tested one for a year. Most of them said the experience made them more likely to buy, and Jenn said his recent research has shown a similar effect after using one in a ride-sharing or car-sharing service. \nChattanooga's car-sharing electric vehicles can be found with charging stations around the city. Credit: Tennessee Valley Authority \nRide-sharing companies like Lyft and Uber are also investing in electric vehicles. \nIn the coming months, Lyft is testing nuTonomy autonomous electric vehicles in Boston, and the company has partnered with General Motors to deploy electric autonomous fleets in San Francisco and other cities. It has a goal of providing a billion electric rides per year by 2025. Uber is pushing electric vehicle rentals in London, India and the U.S. Will Charging Stations Catch Up to Demand? \nChattanooga has always been friendly to electric vehicles. It just celebrated the 25th anniversary of its electric bus fleet and was one of the first mid-sized cities in the U.S. to get an electric car-sharing program. \nIts Green Commuter car-sharing project was made possible through a grant from Tennessee Valley Authority, which has three solar farms that generate electricity to offset 22 charging stations at retail centers, the university campus and downtown. Maintained by CARTA, these stations have 62 ports that can be used by electric vehicle owners, too. Students often use the EVs to tool around the city or pick up friends from the airport, and tourists drive them downtown. \n\"We want to make sure the public has confidence it will work,\" Pugliese said. \"I think public agencies can have a role in that as we look toward the future with a mix of public and workplace charging.\" \nHowever, building and maintaining that infrastructure is still a huge hurdle. Most cities don't yet have widespread charging networks\u2014even in EV-friendly states like California. \nLos Angeles is launching the electric car-sharing service BlueLA in lower-income neighborhoods. It aims to have 100 cars on the road and 200 charging points in 2018. Credit: Mark Ralston/Getty Images \nThere are only about 16,500 public charging stations in the U.S., with 45,000 charging ports, compared to more than 100,000 gas stations, according to the Energy Department . California alone has a quarter of those charging stations, and research shows it needs more than 200,000 ports to meet projected demand by 2020. \nCar2go ran into a charger problem in San Diego. The car-sharing company launched the nation's first all-electric car-sharing fleet there in 2011 with the \"promise and expectation that a robust charging infrastructure would be established,\" said Tim Krebs, communication manager for car2go. In 2016, the city's utility gained approval to install 3,500 charging stations, but the project just started this summer. Because of the lack of infrastructure, car2go switched back to gas-powered cars last year , Krebs said. \nSome cities have launched smaller-scale partnerships to expand local infrastructure neighborhood by neighborhood. In May, the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality District started a program at three public housing units that offers six electric Kia Souls to residents. In Chattanooga, two charging stations are currently being built at new residential complexes, and many workplaces are interested in adding them as well, Pugliese said. The transit agency is also talking with other Tennessee cities like Nashville and Knoxville about how to replicate its program. How Cities and States Are Driving EV Growth \nExpanding infrastructure and encouraging people to choose electric vehicles will take more rigorous state policies, Jenn said. California has a Zero-Emission Vehicle program, which requires automakers to sell electric vehicles, and eight other states, many of them in the Northeast, have adopted similar mandates . \nIn November, Atlanta passed an ordinance that requires residential and commercial builders to install electrical infrastructure that will support chargers. San Francisco added a similar rule this year. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has set a goal of having 50,000 electric vehicles by 2020, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently announced $3.5 million in funding to speed up the adoption of electric vehicles, inviting proposals for ways to reduce charging station costs and to use electric vehicles to improve grid resiliency. \nChase said she's seeing major shifts in the U.S.\u2014and car sharing can play a role. \n\"There's a huge number of American consumers for whom electric vehicles are ideal and could be usefully used for what they do,\" she said. \"And having these shared fleets are the exact right space for electrification.\" Published Under: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle":

It\u2019s a muddy pitch and I\u2019m sure we would have been able to carry on with it. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to do it all over again now and we\u2019ve got to try and find somewhere to fit it in.\u201d \nThe home side started the game with frenetic pace and opened the scoring in the first minute. \nSean Stewart burst past Ryan Ferguson on the right and played the ball to Dachi Khutsishvili who slotted home. \nIt was a fantastic start for the Innerleithen side, but it didn\u2019t last long. Eleven minutes later Stewart Adams grabbed an equaliser at the back post after some great attacking football by Lewis Grant and Shane Costelloe. \nBut Vale did come close to retaking the lead soon after. Ainslie Hunter saw his shot go narrowly wide and Aaron Lewis had a strike saved by Ross McMullen in the Tynecastle goal. \nThe visitors also created chances through Robbie McIntyre, but none good enough to challenge Kieran Beveridge. \nVale kept pressing though, and should have been 2-1 up when Stewart drove into the box, but Niall Kelly made an excellent goal-saving block. \nA few minutes before half time/full time, referee Addy called both managers over to raise his concerns about the pitch, but let the game run. \nAnd he would have had a huge decision to make at the break had the home side regained the advantage one minute before the whistle. \nKerr Allan had his shot saved by the keeper\u2019s legs and Lewis fired the rebound over. \nAs the managers were giving their team talk, the ref and his assistants, Iain Gallacher and Niamh Westwood, came back out to carry out an inspection, with all three believing it was too much of a risk to continue. \nOn the match, Vale boss Anderson said: \u201cWe made a really good start. \u201cIt was a sloppy goal to concede, but apart from that I thought it was actually a really entertaining game, which could have gone either way.\u201d \nVale: K Beveridge, A Lewis, R Brady, A Smith, C McBride, J Blaikie, B Raiker, A Hunter, D Khutsishvili, K Allan, S Stewart.

Digitalization, interconnection, and big data are their important characteristics. How relevant are these for industrial kitchens? \nBy Dieter Mailander \nRevolutions cause fundamental and even long-lasting changes in a nation\u2019s system of rule and its social order. Similarly, as is the case of industrial revolutions, a part of the people affected, profit from their upheavals. But many others among them suffer severely to some extent. Such a development affected those families in the middle of the 19th century, who earned their living with their mechanical weaving looms. Due to the introduction of the automatic weaving loom, this work was relocated to factories. The families frequently lost their work and therefore their income too; they had to fight to survive. This led to civil unrest and even often to violent uprisings. Let\u2019s take a look back to the earlier industrial revolutions and then turn to the present and the future, namely to the digitalization and interconnection. Experts see in it the fourth industrial revolution. \nIndustrial Revolutions Reach the Professional Kitchens \nToday, one designates the first industrial revolution at the end of the 18th century with industry 1.0, in which railroads, steam engines or textile mills emerged among other things. Due to these new sectors of industry the sales markets increased, new working places were created, others, as were described above, cease to exist. The second industrial revolution at the beginning of the 20th century was characterized by the mass production of commodities on electric run assembly lines. Being that the standardized working processes were unusually fast and monotonous, this put a strain on the people physically and psychologically. This causes deadening and alienation. Working models, which cushioned these effects evolved first decades later. \nCooking Requires Technical Understanding \nThe third industrial revolution emerged in the last third of the 20th century. Therefore, it is not too long ago and pushed automation forward strongly through electronics and IT in all business sectors, even in commercial kitchens, especially by programmable logic controllers. In 1976, Rational presented its first hot-air steamer. The devices have been upgraded successively with new programs. The amplitude of the today\u2019s range of applications can\u2019t be compared with those of the early stages. From a simple hot-air steamer with a few standard programs, it has become a versatile deployable multifunctional piece of equipment with a broad spectrum of standard programs and the additional possibility to program cooking processes individually. Its means of application require a differentiated knowledge, especially with those, who manage the production of food and test, which programs deliver the best results. Their employees are usually only accessing preset programs, which is possible without a problem after qualified instruction. The development of the convection oven is typical for all of the professional kitchen equipment. Dishwashing equipment and dishwashing systems or blast chillers/shock freezers have run through a comparable development and are digitalized and network-compatible as well. Specialists like the founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, speak of the fourth industrial revolution, which encompasses all areas of our lives. Scientists, for instance, are working all around the world digitally integrated on products and processes. Manufacturers are unifying their standards and are therefore enabling an increasingly closer interconnection between people, machines, and systems with the effect that the efficiency of their working processes are climbing considerably. The equipment of private apartments, from window shutters, refrigerators up to heating systems can be controlled by way of a smart phone. \nPlease feel free to read the entire article here", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "klaus schwab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dieter mailander", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "world economic forum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:34.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91c20cb4ce4494ebceca0428f153e430e7d8b814", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWkvufT8W0_jyi6PNHmT_9h2tSX6cVebzy.rhPQCCbvLxUYE3vpV.XJm90NSbXBSkKKknCwN6if07I.JxcC2Irr0_pKh7Y3O7yy4_PTQboINO5Hgl_YD10Ivl8DDBOUHh0w7g6Isd3S6.MZz2xfMOvzvHOMUzpr0D5TivzsquksLw-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-oral-care-products/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Oral Care Products for the Best Price in Malaysia", "title": "Whitening Powder Natural Organic Activated Charcoal Bamboo Toothpaste", "title_full": "Teeth Whitening Powder Natural Organic Activated Charcoal Bamboo Toothpaste | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-11-13T10:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.809, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "32ea51efca828f57a29d105a92b6a05226e6a38d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWkvufT8W0_jyi6PNHmT_9h2tSX6cVebzy.rhPQCCbvLxUYE3vpV.XJm90NSbXBSkKKknCwN6if07I.JxcC2Irr0_pKh7Y3O7yy4_PTQboINO5Hgl_YD10Ivl8DDBOUHh0w7g6Isd3S6.MZz2xfMOvzvHOMUzpr0D5BNgVtFfEWnUqITRmlaLRqQ--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Nur&#039;ain D.", "published": "2017-11-21T10:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "CONVIENCE BUT MESSY", "text": "EASY TO USE BUT ONCE U USE AT THE SINK,MUST WASH THOROUGHLY SAME AS AT YOUR TEETH...IT WILL LEFT THE DIRT IF NOT WASH PROPERLY", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:34.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ac0fa62aea78647e8fc72fadc1ca761917f34e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSLIs.dq9M0LgLiGfH9tQNGc7jTo9PgOVMZ9kRKrfm8vlO_gvzrcMhxfWshXYu_GzgIpYeTUqbFYs9mj5_0ync.BuBGsqcAq1rT.A_Xb6LLfQ--", "site_full": "www.southburnetttimes.com.au", "site": "southburnetttimes.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.southburnetttimes.com.au/feeds/rss/homepage", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "southburnetttimes.com.au: South Burnett Times Homepage", "title": "New date set for the Cherbourg rodeo", "title_full": "New date set for the Cherbourg rodeo", "published": "2017-12-06T16:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2017/12/07/b881121651z1_20171207112140_000gubt6o292-0-20smr8c1hmrwidgydp2_ct300x300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ac0fa62aea78647e8fc72fadc1ca761917f34e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSLIs.dq9M0LgLiGfH9tQNGc7jTo9PgOVMZ9kRKrfm8vlO_gvzrcMhxfWshXYu_GzgIpYeTUqbFYs9mj5_0ync.BuBGsqcAq1rT.A_Xb6LLfQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T16:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "New date set for the Cherbourg rodeo", "text": "New date set for the Cherbourg rodeo 7th Dec 2017 9:20 AM RIDE 'EM COWBOY: Anton Fisher comes out strong. Michael Nolan \nTHE Cherbourg Community Rodeo is back for another year on Friday, December 15. \nHeld at the Community Sports Complex, the rodeo is open to all. \nIt is a partnership between the Cherbourg council and Arethusa College, which is an alternative school based near the town. \nArethusa College takes students who are having difficultly with mainstream school and teaches them more hands-on skills such as bull and horse riding. \nEach year the college students clean up at the community bull ride - but that doesn't deter local adults from trying their hand at the magic eight seconds. \nAlong with the spectacle of a bull ride, the evening is a chance for the locals to catch-up, share a meal and talk. \nA range of service providers will be on hand to talk to locals about any concerns they might have and Goodnir van is coming over from Dalby to prepare food and drinks. \nThe junior football club will also sell hot food. \nEdwina Stewart from Cherbourg Council is one of the organisers. \nShe said Christmas was a tough time for some families and the community rodeo was a great way to connect those in need with people who can help. \n\"We can let them know there is support there if they need it and instead of just giving out pamphlets it puts a face to the services,\u201d Mrs Stewart said. \nFor the young folks there'll be rides, including a mechanical bull and jumping castle. \n\"They'll keep the kids entertained while we get ready with the bulls,\u201d MrsStewart said \n\"We'll also have Santa on a horse giving out some presents to the children.\u201d \nEntry is free but it costs to register for a ride. \nPoddy rides (seven to 11 years): $10 \nJunior steers (12-16 years): $15 \nJunior bulls (16-18 years): $15 \nOpen bull ride: $25 \nLocal buck jump: $25 \nBullock ride: $25. \nNominations close at 2.30pm so make sure you arrive at the event early or miss out on a ride. \nThe Cherbourg Community Rodeo will run from 3.30-6pm.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anton fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bullock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael nolan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edwina stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrsstewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalby", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "arethusa college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cherbourg community rodeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cherbourg council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cherbourg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:34.001+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15134682, "moreResultsAvailable": 15134582, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512638374001&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 801}
