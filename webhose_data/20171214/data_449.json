I once admired Gillibrand. No longer. Even if she thinks she is doing this to help enact legislation to help victims and that is her justifications for throwing an innocent man under the bus, she and the others who are telling Franken to resign without an investigation are WRONG.\nI would not be surprised if they were all secretly Russian traitors too at this point. I really wouldn't. I wouldn't ever vote for Gillibrand if I lived in her district now, and I know what she did to try and get the MJIA passed, but today shows that she doesn't believe in JUSTICE at all. Just POLITICS.\nfark her.\nOn mobile, so hard to Quote: all properly and stuff...\nI agree with the part of defending one's self against allegations of inappropriate conduct. There has to be some kind of middle ground between \"swept under rug\" and \"public execution\". This is why I would like to see All Franken step back (hear me out) and run for his seat again in the eventual special election / general election. Let him step back, pay his penance (or fight to clear his name) and ask the primary voters or the voters if MN if he has their trust and faith again. When he runs again, anyone who brings up the old allegations can be painted as living in the past, or being un-Christian, or whatever response fits.\nThe Dems, and the liberal spectrum have got to understand that humans are flawed. They make mistakes, and that not everything must be perfect, and those who fall short must be cast out forever. There has to be standards, but they can't be so inflexible that a small infraction (say, a dumb blonde joke) gets you an eternal label of \"sexist garbage\" unworthy of support (exaggeration sure, but it feels like it's coming sometimes)\nYes, the D's have to keep the high ground, but the high ground doesn't automatically guarantee victory. You can stand on your mountain of superiority and be so sure that you alone are best, but the bottom crawlers and mudslingers below can still bring you down with numbers if you're all alone up there. And then what?\nThere must be standards, but also understanding the imperfection of all of us.\nAnd honestly, I think Gillebrand is keeping this loud and obvious to shore up support for 2020. Prep for a run as the real New England champion of women, without the same baggage as HRC. But someone needs to sit her down and explain that sacrificing the party for her own power is a path to obstruction at best, and ruin at worst.\n\"All must fall, and those who stand themselves highest, fall hardest\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:34.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad775861757e8d5a8a3323ed07116d00b35c99c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb.8wlIH94ZGNIXH1xP0WG4eWyb_g9dr.9.o6WHzOQsgKGkhEAKiwJV0APuGu5s2dyOF5zoyLpK_3j4_CXgTNpbF_zyqwAdFjZ9.VhJ6DqGBfRwlvl2GjquakH58PQBJEGDwxAARSUhlRWVVsT7XR4jjyzYV2hjEXk2N8DuYjjMjGu3669E7JBIS2MnWklwNw07Rbs5gAdpz75kfwe3i09kMwcfD4c2Lh7vvSkwQFOV9GvPYvLkeNxbC0E8xFP698dSkEjxZYIvUx4JfGqqtZ0JHncmGy0STQ_s-", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/entertainment/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Entertainment links", "title": "(9830008) Trumpy and Bibi are trying to kick off armageddon, the Tax Fraud bill is stalled out, the Silence Breakers are the people of the year and WHAT THE %^&$ DO YOU MEAN IT'S ONLY WED??

The existing literature has taken either a positive or negative view of SNS, arguing that it either decreases performance by taking time and effort away from work, or increases performance by providing social benefits for enhancing performance. In contrast, this experimental study, investigates how SNS use can disturb or enhance the performance of different types of tasks differently, thus influencing the sustainability of task performance. Based on distraction-conflict theory, this study distinguishes between simple and complex tasks, examines the role of SNS, and analyzes data including electroencephalography data captured by a brain-computer interface. The results show that task performance can be sustainable such that SNS use positively influences performance when participants are engaged in a simple task and influences performance neither positively nor negatively when participants are engaged in a complex task. The study finds the former result is attributable to the positive effect of the psychological arousal induced by SNS use and the latter result to the negative effect of the psychological arousal offsetting the positive effect of reduced stress resulting from SNS use.

It's impossible to exaggerate just how nutritionless this so-called journalism is.'

I once admired Gillibrand. No longer. Even if she thinks she is doing this to help enact legislation to help victims and that is her justifications for throwing an innocent man under the bus, she and the others who are telling Franken to resign without an investigation are WRONG.\nI would not be surprised if they were all secretly Russian traitors too at this point. I really wouldn't. I wouldn't ever vote for Gillibrand if I lived in her district now, and I know what she did to try and get the MJIA passed, but today shows that she doesn't believe in JUSTICE at all. Just POLITICS.\nfark her.\nOn mobile, so hard to Quote: all properly and stuff...\nI agree with the part of defending one's self against allegations of inappropriate conduct. There has to be some kind of middle ground between \"swept under rug\" and \"public execution\". This is why I would like to see All Franken step back (hear me out) and run for his seat again in the eventual special election / general election. Let him step back, pay his penance (or fight to clear his name) and ask the primary voters or the voters if MN if he has their trust and faith again. When he runs again, anyone who brings up the old allegations can be painted as living in the past, or being un-Christian, or whatever response fits.\nThe Dems, and the liberal spectrum have got to understand that humans are flawed. They make mistakes, and that not everything must be perfect, and those who fall short must be cast out forever. There has to be standards, but they can't be so inflexible that a small infraction (say, a dumb blonde joke) gets you an eternal label of \"sexist garbage\" unworthy of support (exaggeration sure, but it feels like it's coming sometimes)\nYes, the D's have to keep the high ground, but the high ground doesn't automat ...\nOh absolutely, I see it up here too.\n\"We elected a left-wing government, we're going to get all the things!\"\n\"Fark no we aren't, this stuff takes time to do properly, there's a process, and you have to allow for fluctuation, like an economic downturn like we have, or if something unexpected happens\"\n\"But I want it now!\"\n\"Too damn bad, it's taken 40 years to get here!\"\nMum likens it to the struggle to legalize MJ. To use a sports analogy, the hard progressive wing (usually younger millenials on the coasts) acts like they came off the bench, made a run, put a beautiful foot on the ball and scored a wonderful goal to win the match, so they can celebrate their great victory and revel in the accomplishment.\nExcept it's really still the 65th minute, there's still lots of time left in the match, the lead in tenuous, and the defenders who have been out there the whole time already really deserve credit for keeping the game close. If the fresh forwards don't come back and help on defence, put in the work, and understand that they are part of a team, then their heroics will count for nothing, and they'll get blamed for being lazy and quitting because they didn't follow up after a brief moment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:34.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad775861757e8d5a8a3323ed07116d00b35c99c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb.8wlIH94ZGNIXH1xP0WG4eWyb_g9dr.9.o6WHzOQsgKGkhEAKiwJV0APuGu5s2dyOF5zoyLpK_3j4_CXgTNpbF_zyqwAdFjZ9.VhJ6DqGBfRwlvl2GjquakH58PQBJEGDwxAARSUhlRWVVsT7XR4jjyzYV2hjEXk2N8DuYjjMjGu3669E7JBIS2MnWklwNw07Rbs5gAdpz75kfwe3i09kMwcfD4c2Lh7vvSkwQFOV9GvPYvLkeNxbC0E8xFP698dSkEjxZYIvUx4JfGqqtZ0JHncmGy0STQ_s-", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/entertainment/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Entertainment links", "title": "(9830008) Trumpy and Bibi are trying to kick off armageddon, the Tax Fraud bill is stalled out, the Silence Breakers are the people of the year and WHAT THE %^&$ DO YOU MEAN IT'S ONLY WED??
