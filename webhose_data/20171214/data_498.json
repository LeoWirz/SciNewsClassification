If you wish to crawl and grovel, do it where I cannot see you\r\n\r\nThe globalist plague immigration experiment\r\nfunnels huge flows of wealth and privilege to\r\nbillionaires, yet it burdens workers with\r\nunpayable debt. Australia is entering the\r\nglobalist third world of ethnic strife and\r\ngrinding poverty. All decisions on population and\r\nmass immigration numbers have already been made by\r\nthe gangsters who really run Australia and there\r\nwill be nothing but a bit of fiddling at the edges\r\nto give the illusion of a democratic process in\r\naction. To any Aussie resident faced with seeing\r\ntheir suburb ruined with Stalinist \"Stack and\r\nPack\" slums, it would seem that the Department of\r\nImmigration, State Government, and property\r\ndevelopers are little more than a corrupt triad\r\nfrom the third world.\r\n\r\nGlobalism's well-bribed stooge Paul Keating applauded the idea that Australia no longer exists. I will applaud when that quisling no longer exists\r\n\r\nMulticultural love is blind when it comes to\r\nfeeding ever more real estate Ponzi schemes with\r\nimported scab labour, or the lunatics and\r\ncriminals that third world countries happily\r\nexport. Multiculturalism is merely a facade for\r\nthis criminality. Had there not been plague\r\nimmigration, when global oil production declines,\r\nmost mass killing would be in the form of wars\r\nbetween countries. However, overpopulated\r\ncountries will simply self-destruct as ethnic\r\ngroups butcher each other. Just one look at the\r\nbloodsucking property racketeer bed-bugs and\r\ndemented ethnic parasites that infest our elected\r\ngovernments is enough to make any decent citizen\r\nrealize that we have lost control of the madmen\r\nwho govern us.\r\n\r\nImported third world subhuman wastes spurting out like a stinking golden rain of contagion\r\n\r\nThat \"sucking\" sound is the inflation propelled\r\ntransfer of your savings from your bank into the\r\nblack hole of the mass immigration scam boosted,\r\ngovernment backed, artificially low interest\r\nrates, speculative property debt-bubble Ponzi\r\nscheme. The illusion of freedom will continue as\r\nlong as it's profitable. When the illusion becomes\r\ntoo expensive to maintain, they will take down the\r\nscenery, pull back the curtains, and you will see\r\nthe brick wall at the back of the theatre. The\r\nseething ethnic resentment in the Third World\r\nagainst the West should cause second thoughts\r\nabout opening our borders to mass immigration from\r\nthat world. Not all those coming here bring in\r\ntheir hearts a passionate attachment to Australia.\r\n\r\nThe imported hate-cultures are right in our faces\r\n\r\nNobody likes to admit to being wrong. But\r\nparasites who supported brute-force immigration\r\nmust continually remind themselves that their\r\nblind obedience to a corrupt, money-grubbing,\r\nglobalist conspiracy for many years demands\r\nconsistent apologies. Do you enjoy living in the\r\nbubble of bullshit coprophilic multiculturalism\r\nmade for you? That good old \"wage restraint\" and\r\nunaffordable housing. A slice of GST on top of the\r\ngood things that your borrowed money buys. It\r\ndoesn't get better than this. Much of the problem\r\nfacing citizens in having their voices heard, is\r\nthe mass media machine, which serves as a\r\ndisinformation agency for globalist change agents\r\nwho have organized the mass immigration takeover\r\nof Australia.\r\n\r\nThe degraded and infantile multicultural mind\r\n\r\nGlobalists obscure the facts about overpopulation,\r\nknowing that as the limb is bent, so grows the\r\ntree. Once children are indoctrinated in third\r\nworld levels of crowding, violence and poverty,\r\nthat becomes the status quo they struggle to keep.\r\nEvidently, many \"greens\" spring from a fraudulent\r\ncollective of quasi-Marxist gays and dykes. They\r\nalso seem to be quite comfortable with national\r\nand environmental destruction as long as it is\r\nwrought by pandemic immigration. The final product\r\nof the globalist multicultural mass-breeding\r\nexperiment is a sea of raw human waste. That is\r\nthe best that \"nation building\" via plague\r\nimmigration can offer. It cannot spawn a single\r\nproductive thing for Australia.\r\n\r\nCitizens appalled by unsustainable plague immigration\r\n\r\nI want you to think about who stands to gain from\r\nthe horrible \"Yellow Australia\" plague immigration\r\npolicy. We must discuss these issues until the\r\nculprits are brought to complete justice\r\n(execution probably). It is getting harder for\r\nglobalist quislings to dress up plague immigration\r\nas anything other than the treason that it really\r\nis. This squalid fraud constructed on globalist\r\ndiversity rhetoric, has been a violent alien\r\nparasite in Australia. The globalist\r\nimmigrationists realize that with stupid, lazy,\r\nhypnoidal citizens, who accept things told them by\r\ntheir government, who believe images and concepts\r\ntheir idiot box spins, no bullshit or deception\r\nwill ever be seriously questioned.\r\n\r\nThings you should know about your government\r\n\r\nAs Queensland's pro-growth premier Anna Bligh\r\nadmitted in a speech to the Queensland Property\r\nCouncil, the costs of population growth are now\r\nclear and tangible to people in their daily lives.\r\nShe cited traffic jams, hospital queues and house\r\nprices. Under globalism and its third world plague\r\nimmigration invasion, multicultural propaganda,\r\npolitical police, re-education camps and labour\r\ncamps will gradually become the norm in Australia.\r\nDisplacing the hated Anglo majority with imported\r\nethnic scab labour is very profitable for wealthy\r\nparasites. If it actually cost them money, the\r\nplague immigration invasion would be stopped in a\r\nheartbeat. Easy unearned Ponzi scheme profits.\r\n\r\nThe hidden multicultural agenda is disbelieved, and disbelief keeps it hidden\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the increases in national\r\nmoney supply go into the real estate debt-bubble.\r\nIt is called \"capital appreciation\" - in reality\r\nit is just inflation of those asset classes.\r\nSavings are eroded by this effect. And it's breed,\r\nbreed, breed, Just go and sow your seed. Don't ask\r\nme, I don't give a damn, Just go and push that\r\npram. And it's screw, screw, screw, Get up and and\r\nspawn a few. Well there ain't no time to wonder\r\nwhy, Whoopee! they're all gonna die. You can't\r\nlook prosperous without some blood circulating.\r\nFor decades, Aussies tolerated being\r\nsystematically bled by Australian establishment\r\nparasites, only to also have international\r\nvampires invited to this blood-feast by the\r\nelected quislings.\r\n\r\nTheir globalist arguments are bullshit. Mass immigration is not essential to our economic growth\r\n\r\nIt seems that this international depression and\r\nimported scab labour are being lowered onto the\r\nsheeple gradually and systematically. The\r\nglobalist billionaires and their greed-crazed\r\npoliticians must be beside themselves with joy.\r\nThe enormous culpability of the moral pygmies who\r\nrule us, is never examined by the media drones,\r\nnor do they examine the bipartisan conspiracy, the\r\nreal estate rackets, Ponzi schemes, or the\r\nmulticultural mass immigration treason. As the\r\nocean of human idiocy swells, and the real estate\r\ndebt-bubble expands, the value of human life\r\nshrinks. It is a gruesome forced climb to the\r\nsummit of a mountain of globalist misery. But it\r\nserves the gangsters, profiteers and speculators.\r\n\r\nUnder globalist rule, Australian citizens are powerless and without influence\r\n\r\nIndoctrinate a generation of children to accept\r\nalien ideas and become \"Global Citizens\"\r\n(livestock) for the coming globalist \"Stack and\r\nPack\" slum future. A vote for a pro-immigration\r\nlawyer candidate is a vote against our national\r\ninterests. The cult of mass immigration has\r\nallowed its acolytes to combine profiteering,\r\ntheft and racketeering with enormous\r\nself-righteousness. The political Left and Right\r\ncan both be elevated morally by what is actually\r\ntreason. Economies built on credit and debt are by\r\nnature unstable. They are essentially Ponzi\r\nschemes or pyramid rackets always needing new\r\nsuckers. Caught between cycles of expansion and\r\ncontraction, their own corruption rots them hollow\r\nfrom the inside.\r\n\r\n\"Confidence\" that relies on speculation in real estate Ponzi schemes bloated by plague immigration\r\n\r\nInfantile multicultural propaganda has done its\r\nworst to the weak-minded. The boulder of ignorance\r\nand mental lethargy never moves easily, so most of\r\nmy energy is spent on repeating the same simple\r\nthings to drooling retards. Multicultural\r\ndystopian agendas thrive on human idiocy and\r\ncraven conformity. They infect nations with\r\nmulticultural ratbaggery - the very essence of\r\ncorruption and dishonesty - then invade, hidden\r\ninside the cultural diversity Trojan Horse. And\r\nour globalist mass media system is a never ending\r\nparade of mindless muppets singing and dancing to\r\nthe tune of the false left/right paradigm and\r\nunearned real estate profits through the plague\r\nimmigration Ponzi scheme.\r\n\r\nDon't allow genocidal Anglophobic multiculturalism to ethnically-cleanse Australia\r\n\r\nProperty speculators are cannibals, yet\r\ngreed-crazed politicians get poor Aussie workers\r\nto underwrite all of their risks from indulging in\r\ncriminal real estate Ponzi schemes. So speculators\r\ncan now make huge unearned, guaranteed, windfall\r\nprofits. So-called \"multiculturalism\" is what\r\nmakes the job of Australia's enemies easier. The\r\ninfinitely variable demands and assertions of\r\nglobalist \"progressives\" keeps Aussies on the\r\ndefensive. No matter how many demands are met, new\r\nones are invented. People should not be mere\r\neconomic livestock or subhuman resources to be\r\ndeceived and exploited. Attempting to get that\r\ninto the dim-bulb mentalities of most Australians\r\nis wasted effort. Aussies are too busy\r\naccumulating debt.\r\n\r\nWhich \"benefit\" of plague immigration do you prefer: losing your job to imported scab labour, or unaffordable housing?\r\n\r\nPolitically correct dogma was created to silence\r\nopposition to the globalist plague immigration\r\nagenda of our government. Few relish the thought\r\nof being considered a racist, xenophobe, or a\r\nhater. Which is why this mindfuck has been\r\neffective. If you accuse mass immigrationists of\r\nbeing on the side of landlords and moneylenders,\r\nit will be true. The poor little multicultural\r\njellyfish will be shocked, and will spew putrid\r\ninvective and insults in your direction. Most\r\nAussies are sidelined or offended by the\r\nmulticultural suckhole revolution, and they will\r\nnever be ready to \"embrace\" their own displacement\r\nby imported scab labour. The Aussie sense of\r\npessimism about home ownership is well-founded.\r\n\r\nA few got rich by borrowing from overseas to finance an plague immigration driven real estate debt-bubble\r\n\r\nUnder globalist rule you will work for less. You\r\nwill be losers. You will be saddled with enormous\r\nsurplus population. You will be crushed into\r\n\"Stack and Pack\" urban pig-pens. You will\r\neventually discover how you were tricked by\r\nmulticulturalism. Globalism (Stalinism and piracy\r\ncapitalism) is a threat to all that lives. It is\r\nonly through individual and collective\r\nnon-cooperation (disobedience) and direct action\r\nthat total disaster can be prevented and a\r\nsustainable future possibly evolve. Plague\r\nimmigration boosted real estate Ponzi schemes give\r\nunearned profits - for those in control. People\r\nwanting affordable housing are outgunned by\r\nproperty pimps, speculators, government,\r\ndevelopers, overseas investors, and bloodsucker\r\nlandlords.\r\n\r\nPlague immigration poverty in Australia: The modelling phase moves into real time implementation\r\n\r\nIt is still acceptable in \"intellectual\" circles\r\nto be rude about white working class people and\r\nespecially to scorn them for their so-called\r\nracism, yet no-one would dare heap the same level\r\nof abuse on any other group. Cultural genocide by\r\nassimilation in Australia can succeed, not because\r\nit is popular (it is not), but because of\r\nAustralians being gradually outnumbered. Genocide\r\nby assimilation is greatly enabled by third world\r\nmass immigration. The costs of the globalist\r\nplague immigration pyramid scam trickle down to\r\nthe poorest of working Australians, while the\r\nunearned profits magically flow uphill to the\r\nwealthy privileged minority. The multicultural rot\r\nis in the national heartwood.\r\n\r\nThe awful ramifications of the plague immigration state religion are obvious to normal people\r\n\r\nAustralia's mass immigration juggernaut continues\r\non its crazy punitive path, crushing jobs,\r\nservices, quality of life and affordable housing\r\ninto oblivion. Quisling politicians and globalist\r\nmedia drones \"celebrate\" this, so it will only get\r\nworse. Plague immigration and globalist \"reforms\"\r\nextinguished the few dying embers of hope for a\r\ndecent Australian future. All that is left is the\r\nprospect of being imprisoned in Chinese-style\r\n\"Stack and Pack\" slums. Disempowered and\r\npauperized by the plague immigration scam are you,\r\nmy greedy and retarded little conformist drones?\r\nThe worst is yet to come, but you are crack-whores\r\nand suckers for every Ponzi scheme in town. No\r\nplace is safe under globalism.\r\n\r\nPlague immigration is no panacea. It is a disease\r\n\r\nMulticulturalism, and brute-force immigration are\r\nsanctified by the political dogma of Right and\r\nLeft, that man is merely homo economicus, the sum\r\nof his functions as worker and consumer, nothing\r\nmore. His country, nation and culture are just\r\ntrash. Herein lies the fundamental idiocy of the\r\nglobalist political discourse: \"Multiculturalism\r\nis good for its own sake. All cultural practices\r\nare equally valid, no matter who they hurt.\" So,\r\nwe are being \"liberated\" by \"diversity\" somehow?\r\nRealize that world population growth is out of\r\ncontrol, and that's why people flee their third\r\nworld pestholes by the millions. It seems we must\r\nabsorb our third world brothers and sisters until\r\ntheir grotesque ordeal is endured and shared by us\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe globalist quislings are ordered to say that Australia's \"prosperity\" is responsible for the growing scarcities and chaos\r\n\r\nGrowth-mad politicians and globalist media drones\r\nbrainwashed Aussies into accepting a perpetual\r\npopulation growth cargo-cult. Globalist propaganda\r\nand the multicultural guilt-trip made Aussies\r\ndeaf, dumb and blind to this national gang rape.\r\nPeople have noticed the environmental impact of\r\nmass immigration on Australia, although government\r\nlackeys have \"embraced\" the mythology that\r\nAustralia is a virtually unlimited space which can\r\naccommodate unlimited amounts of cheap third world\r\nflesh. The multicultural game is played by\r\nimported scab labour ethnics shouting, \"Racism!\"\r\nwhenever they encounter any criticism, or fail to\r\nbe promoted ahead of locals. The generous \"wins\"\r\nfrom playing this game hard, are paid by Aussie\r\ntaxpayers.\r\n\r\nOpposing globalist totalitarianism and mass immigration\r\n\r\nStop clinging to false hope and face reality. Our\r\nleaders are hopeless globalist puppets and\r\nquislings, so no help will come from that quarter.\r\nThe multicultural fuse on the plague immigration\r\nterror-bomb just keeps burning shorter and\r\nshorter. In their anxiety to please everyone,\r\nAustralians came down with a severe dose of\r\nglobalist suckholes. Globalist bullshit and plague\r\nimmigration have increased our inequalities and\r\nmiseries over the years, and now it's time to\r\nquit. Greed-crazed human locusts are unsustainably\r\ndepleting the base of all available natural\r\ncapital, not merely living off the interest. This\r\nmeans future generations will have much less\r\ncapital to work with. They will inherit depletion\r\nand pollution.\r\n\r\nTurning our cities into Asian-style \"Stack and Pack\" cesspits\r\n\r\nThe rise in corporate profitability in the 1990s\r\nwas part of a longer-term picture involving\r\nincreased labour exploitation and growing\r\nhousehold debt, all pumped by mass immigration.\r\nThe property bubble and high house prices only\r\nmeant scarcity. There is a Ponzi scheme operating\r\nin Australia, where governments are urged by\r\ndevelopers to release more land for housing, then\r\nmore immigrants to create demand for that housing,\r\nwhich once again requires more land - then more\r\nimmigrants... If you wonder why Australia has a\r\nskills shortage, blame successive quisling Liberal\r\nand Labor governments who slashed education and\r\ntraining in the hope of importing skills on the\r\ncheap.\r\n\r\nPaying the bills for imported scab labour and the new third world republic\r\n\r\nThe globalist elites are getting awfully brazen in\r\ntelling us who is boss. The Stalinist nature of\r\nthe plague immigration regime imposed in defiance\r\nof the wishes of citizens, illustrates the chasm\r\nbetween elite ideas and public opinion. Mendacious\r\nglobalist suckholes pushed fake prosperity,\r\neconomic nonsense, and the open borders \"level\r\nplaying field\" as the new snake-oil remedies and\r\nnostrums that would save us all. We now have debt,\r\npoverty and strife, everywhere. Perhaps Satan\r\nwants the subhuman breeders to fornicate, and\r\nmaybe Moloch wants them to make more babies as\r\nsacrificial offerings. But stimulating appetites\r\nto consume ever more won't preserve the planet or\r\npromote happiness.\r\n\r\nOpening the globalist vault of multicultural horrors\r\n\r\nDullards think it is profound to parrot\r\n\"Populations grow - they just do!\" But they should\r\nrealize that cancers grow - they just do. And so\r\ndoes almost every evil blight you can name. The\r\nmulticulturals are prize candidates for the Darwin\r\nAward. The Labor Party is just as happy with\r\nforced labour as is the Liberal Party. They both\r\nsupport plague immigration as a way to keep the\r\nworkers hard at it. Unaffordable housing and high\r\nrents is the icing on the cake for property\r\nparasites. Nationalists must not be co-opted into\r\nthe Liberal Party's globalist game plan. Be free\r\nto act in the interest of Australians. Reject the\r\nLiberal Party's plague immigration, globalism,\r\nimported scab labour, war for the New World Order\r\netc..\r\n\r\nMulticulturalism's idiots will remain in denial to the bitter end\r\n\r\nYou are getting a stinking heap of bullshit, when\r\nhyperactive politicians recite unquantifiable and\r\nsubjective \"benefits\" such as the \"flexibility\",\r\n\"adaptability\", \"dynamism\" and \"competitiveness\"\r\nimmigrants are said to confer on the host society.\r\nWith their imported scab labour invasions, our\r\nelected \"representatives\" fully intend to engineer\r\na permanent reversal in the conditions of the\r\nAustralian working class. Workers' real incomes\r\nfell even faster since the supposed \"recovery\" of\r\n2009. The massive bubble of corruption and fraud\r\nbuilt on mass immigration and real estate Ponzi\r\nschemes is so rotten and ripe, that it will soon\r\nburst. These constant infrastructure, development\r\nand re-zoning stunts are nothing but colossal\r\nracketeering.\r\n\r\nThe evil that lurks within plague immigration policy revealed\r\n\r\nGreasy property developers help to rip up national\r\nheritage and history, while moulding Australia\r\ninto the globalist third world Utopia.\r\nMegalomaniacal politicians behave like gangsters,\r\nor whores, as Australia's resources are seized and\r\nplundered. The Melbourne film festival showed how\r\nChina wants to impose its own views and values on\r\nAustralia (Chinese people protested because the\r\nfilm festival featured a human rights activist\r\nRabiya Kader, an Uighur exile from PR China).\r\nEverything that happens in Australia seems to be a\r\nmasochistic phenomenon. Working longer, harder,\r\nand cheaper in competition with desperate imported\r\nscab labour, has been \"embraced\" by an amazing\r\nnumber of gormless Aussie sheeple.\r\n\r\nMulticultural: Selected from the ethnic sewer or cultural cesspit\r\n\r\nWhat dullards want, is freedom from freedom, and\r\nglobalism is itching to let them have lots of\r\nthat. Dullards despise those with better minds.\r\nTheir \"friends\" are those drones who corroborate\r\ntheir infantile and contradictory ideas. Bloated\r\nglobalist hypocrites are the very diseases they\r\nlecture us about. They aid the malignant spread in\r\nAustralia of every exotic pathogenic disease they\r\ncan force on to us. We don't need their plague\r\nimmigration or infantile multicultural drivel.\r\nBankrupt Aussie lemmings want the banks to help\r\nthem take on even more unpayable debt. At least a\r\nfew more years of total failure are left in the\r\n\"magic\" bottle of globalist reforms. So don't vote\r\n- it only encourages the bastards.\r\n\r\nPlague immigration and multiculturalism are responsible for nearly all the national defilements\r\n\r\nThere will always be morons who claim that\r\nAustralia can sustain a population of 300 million\r\nor more. Any drooling retard can just pluck a\r\nrandom number out of its arse, and claim that\r\nAustralia actually \"needs\" catastrophic\r\noverpopulation. Are you sheeple bleating for\r\nsolutions? Here are solutions: Stop breeding like\r\nlocusts. Stop importing third world retards who\r\nbreed like locusts. Eliminate traitors in the\r\nestablishment. Abolish real estate Ponzi schemes\r\nand landlordism. Globalism reversed the long trend\r\nof rising Aussie wages. The political and mass\r\nmedia establishments drone the hypocritical \"wage\r\nrestraint\" mantra as imported scab labour leads\r\nthe race to the bottom of the \"level playing\r\nfield\" cargo-cult.\r\n\r\nHow much mendacity do you want with your globalist racketeering?\r\n\r\nGlobalist whim is the serial killer of Australian\r\nmanufacturing. Somehow, silly little gay service\r\nindustries are expected to provide decent\r\nemployment for Aussies displaced by imported scab\r\nlabour. Media drones and \"economists\" haven't got\r\na clue. When a globalist quisling government is no\r\nlonger responsive to the basic needs of its\r\ncitizens to protect their vital interests, such as\r\ntheir culture, their jobs, their housing, and\r\ntheir security, it has abrogated its right to\r\nexist. Some citizens have spoken out against\r\nplague immigration, but have no power because of\r\nthe government being bought out by corporations\r\nwho want cheap labour, or by special-interest\r\ngroups who are pandered to by greed-crazed\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nHarsh awakening to a third world \"Stack and Pack\" slum future\r\n\r\nWe are commanded to \"embrace\" and \"celebrate\" all\r\ndifferences and anyone who disagrees shall be\r\nshouted down, silenced or slandered as a racist.\r\nTo the thoughtless multicultural assertion that\r\n\"All cultures are equal\" I simply ask \"Who says\r\nso?\" The same old \"sucker speak\" from the\r\nglobalist parasite elite: The economic shipwreck\r\nis going to make a \"soft landing\" so everything is\r\nall fixed. I always trust that fairytale! Don't\r\nyou? What puzzles the tame media \"economists\"\r\nabout Australia's plague immigration driven slump\r\nin home ownership rates, is how it happened in a\r\n\"vibrant\" era of globalist \"prosperity\" and\r\ngrowing \"reform\" frenzy that squeezed out the\r\nfirst home buyers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul keating", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabiya kader", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna bligh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "state government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labor party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aussies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queensland property council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anglo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labor", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "third world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queensland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:02.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfd7f41bdf5799f0d4035f7090e99c3b03140c26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeVI8_ydbRIgb6KX5LWD8Ow1BFU_NK0SHODvPSptle1PfFGZ4FutqnjDRX4wCW7ROmVcBk3E725Nyjg1oS59ipTa71XMYbwy3sLYkwuxYXOo64jV_bf9gy2gCrfPBZff4mbSaDDiv_C8gVXJrRl5DSpylHzkuRSruaIBo_GMy5zZHM2QjLVRM35A--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/zero-installments/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "0% Installments - Buy 0% Installments at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "York (R410A) YSL3F10AAS/YWM3F10CAS 1.0HP Wall Split Air Conditioner", "title_full": "York (R410A) YSL3F10AAS/YWM3F10CAS 1.0HP Wall Split Air Conditioner | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-06-11T07:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 271, "participants_count": 246, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.168, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb5999655a9f6265b984ed79dcaaed5f2c778134", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeVI8_ydbRIgb6KX5LWD8Ow1BFU_NK0SHODvPSptle1PfFGZ4FutqnjDRX4wCW7ROmVcBk3E725Nyjg1oS59ipTa71XMYbwy3sLYkwuxYXOo64jV_bf9gy2gCrfPBZff4mbSaDDiv_C8gVXJrRl5DSpylHzkuRSruaIBo_GMy5zZHOSKrNTOQlEhluZ8YqyFRm", "ord_in_thread": 226, "author": "Wei H.", "published": "2017-11-22T08:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Item was not delivered to me and Lazada have not refunded", "text": "Item was not delivered to me and Lazada have not refunded..

Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital despite intense Arab, Muslim and European opposition to a move that would upend decades of U.S. policy and risk potentially violent protests. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s move to recognize the divided city of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital may have triggered a worldwide chorus of critics but the president had his ears closely tuned to his supporters at home.\nFor Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \n\u201cWhile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\u201d the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \u201cToday, I am delivering.\u201d \nThose were words to savor for a president who\u2019s been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed \u2014 sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns. Advertisement Continue reading \nRepealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump\u2019s frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel\u2019s claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He\u2019s now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president\u2019s former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president\u2019s action. \n\u201cIf I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\u201d said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cAny move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\u201d \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump\u2019s words about the embassy as \u201cjust a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\u201d \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. Advertisement Continue reading \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump\u2019s campaign operation trumpeted: \u201cJerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\u201d And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \u201ccontinues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\u201d \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\u201cMy hope is it doesn\u2019t change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\u201d said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \u201ctriumph of domestic politics and personal ego\u201d over \u201csound foreign policy.\u201d \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians.

When they see a painting, however, some of those barriers disappear. They no longer see a journalist holding a recorder but instead a fan of the sport. Riders sometimes forget that most of the media pass holders are also fans. \nIn a relaxed environment, riders and team members begin to speak more freely and even mention details they might not have shared during a \u201cnormal\u201d interview. The process of asking members of the paddock for their personal opinions\u2014something they usually keep close to their hearts\u2014was interesting for me. After all, everyone just wants to share his (or her) joy for racing. \nMaverick Vi\u00f1ales, Movistar Yamaha MotoGP \nCourtesy of Tammy Gorali \nRound 1: Wilco Zeelenberg, Movistar Yamaha rider performance analyst | Maverick Vi\u00f1ales, Movistar Yamaha | Losail International Circuit, Qatar \n\u201cWe were expecting a lot after the winter test because we were the fastest all nine days on track. After winning the Valencia race with Jorge [Lorenzo], winning Qatar with Maverick was really special. We replaced the rider but we were still winning and you can imagine that it was a bit surreal. \n\u201cIt was wonderful to see a young kid in MotoGP who won his first race just a season earlier and now with the Yamaha looked very promising. The last five laps of the race with all the action between him, [Andrea] Dovizioso, and Vale [Rossi] were great to watch. After all the preparation and emotions we went through, it was an amazing feeling when he took the victory. \n\u201cOver the season, I don\u2019t think we were expecting too much. Four or five races in, we were leading the championship. Even in the last few rounds, we could have still made a difference and that\u2019s what you need as a champion. I don\u2019t think we were over-enthusiastic. We seemed to be on the road to the championship but this is racing; things change. \n\u201cI was very proud to notice during the race that Maverick listened to me. We all saw the crash from Johann Zarco; it happened in a corner I mentioned to Maverick a few times advising him not to go there too wide as it can be very slippery when you have too much lean angle and you can lose the front even when the lean is correct. \n\u201cWhen Zarco crashed at turn 2, Vinales was one meter wider and the following lap he was even two meters wider to the left and opened more space so he would not end up like Zarco. We laughed about it after the race. Like any rider, Maverick is not a good listener; they are all focused on their own. But if it\u2019s advice, they swallow it up.\u201d \nMaverick Vi\u00f1ales, Movistar Yamaha MotoGP \nCourtesy of Tammy Gorali \nRound 2: Patrick Primmer, \u00d6hlins engineer | Maverick Vi\u00f1ales, Movistar Yamaha | Termas de R\u00edo Hondo, Argentina \n\u201cArgentina is a track where we never had a great success\u2014even with Lorenzo\u2014but with Maverick\u2019s confidence and the way he rode, we approached it like any other race. In qualifying, Maverick even surprised us, as he qualified sixth, first Yamaha, when it was his first time on the bike in the rain. \n\u201cAt that point, we even thought we had a good thing going with the rider, Yamaha, and the rain, but it turned out to be different. Argentina was an easy weekend, we did not have to change too much; things are easy when you are fast. There is something good about Maverick being a younger rider. \n\u201cAs riders get more experience, they get really opinionated in what must be changed and what does not work. With time, things change and adjustments that might have not worked in the past might work now. It\u2019s nice to have a rider who just says what he feels, what\u2019s missing, what he needs to go fast. He concentrates more on the riding than on the bike.\u201d \nMarc Marquez, Repsol Honda Team \nCourtesy of Tammy Gorali \nRound 3: Sergio Escrivano, \u00d6hlins suspension engineer | Marc Marquez, Repsol Honda | Circuit of The Americas, United States \n\"This drawing captures a very similar scene to one of the greatest moments of my life. The win in 2015 was my first in MotoGP as I joined Marquez's side of the garage after two seasons with Scott Redding at Pramac and a career in World Superbike and Moto3. At first, I thought this drawing was from that day. It was incredible, a dream come true. \n\u201cI knew all the team members before I joined as we are all Spanish and from the paddock so the acceptance to the team was relatively easy, but still I had to do the transition from going out friends to colleagues. I remember that this specific race was not difficult; I hardly touched anything on the suspension. It was an easy race for me with a wonderful result.\u201d \nDani Pedrosa, Repsol Honda Team \nCourtesy of Tammy Gorali \nRound 4: Sete Gibernau, 500cc Grand Prix race winner | Dani Pedrosa, Repsol Honda | Circuito de Jerez, Jerez de la Frontera, Spain \n\u201cThis picture is a lot of Dani. Dani has a very big heart, he has a lot of talent, and he has hurt himself really badly in racing. He has seen and felt all aspects of the sport many times for many years. Jerez is like a summary because he was fighting very hard there to recover something he had lost, and we knew the effort that he was making. \n\u201cI personally think he is doing something very special. If he keeps on going like this, good things will come for him. Looking at this reminds me that there are a lot of things happening inside of you during a race. Only a rider knows what you are going through. But racing is like that. You cannot avoid problems; it\u2019s how you deal with them, just like life. \n\u201cWe have to learn it\u2019s not always going to be good, but that\u2019s how you deal with the failures and successes. During the podium ceremony, I did not cry but it was a very emotional and special moment. I am putting a lot of passion into this. I know what we are going through. I know what we are working on for many years. Dani\u2019s smile is my victory.\u201d \nMaverick Vi\u00f1ales, Movistar Yamaha MotoGP \nCourtesy of Tammy Gorali \nRound 5: Paco Sanchez, rider manager | Maverick Vi\u00f1ales, Movistar Yamaha | Le Mans Bugatti Grand Prix Race Circuit, France \n\u201cAfter two wins at the start of the season, we had a crash in Austin and then problems in Jerez. We had two races with almost zero points so the victory in Le Mans was positive and wonderful. The problem was that after this superb win, a very difficult period started for us with a lot of ups and downs\u2014a real disaster. \n\u201cYou see the love here that Maverick has for the M1. His problem during the season was not the bike. It was another issue; neither bike nor rider. No rider could win two out of three races and then forget how to ride in the next races. It just doesn\u2019t happen. Top riders are always on the top, and they do anything possible to succeed.\u201d \nAndrea Dovizioso, Ducati Team \nCourtesy of Tammy Gorali \nRound 6: Dr. Martin Raines, MotoGP statistician | Andrea Dovizioso, Ducati Team | L\u2019autodromo del Mugello, Italy \n\u201cNot only was the Italian GP the first weekend in a long time in which all three winners of all three classes were Italian but Andrea Dovizioso won his first race of the season. That was a milestone: Italian rider, Italian bike, Italian soil. Danilo Petrucci even got on the podium. \n\u201cThis result started us thinking maybe we could consider Dovi as part of the elite, as he started to put his claws on the championship. It also allowed us to see the real Ducati return to the top after the loss of Casey Stoner and its hard work in the last five to six years. \n\u201cI think a lot of people in the paddock were happy with that win as Dovizioso is a really well-liked guy, who was not really appreciated. He and Ducati worked hard at developing together bit by bit.

Andy is our mechanic, and Olivia is my service writer and assists my mechanics. Denis teaches our classes. Rory is our shop assistant and does whatever we ask: stocking inventory, cleaning, pushing bikes in and out, helping in the shop. He\u2019s my invisible force! He loves being told to do something different every day. I try to model the type of hard work for everyone to follow. I do the books as well as restock the toilet paper. We have plenty of plates spinning at once.\u201d \nI asked her what\u2019s it\u2019s like to have her identity so tied in with her business. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting task, responsibility, and pleasure to be the face of the business,\u201d she said as she smiled and sat straighter on her bar stool. \u201cWe have meetings constantly as we move forward; we\u2019ve only been open for a year, coming off one of the wettest winters in decades. We still had people trailering in their bikes for service despite that weather last year, which is gratifying. We\u2019re striving to cut down on the turnaround time but bringing machining in-house. We have too much \u2018halt to revenue\u2019 when we have to wait so long for jobs to get done that we could do here. We\u2019re creating standards so everyone who works here understands their role. \nCustomers come from all around the West Coast. \nPhoto: The Vintage Monkey \n\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing the resurgence of the mom-and-pop shop; we don\u2019t sell bikes, we just restore and repair them. We also don\u2019t currently service fuel-injected bikes. The world was losing the hands-on talent to work on old bikes, and we hope to change that, at least in Sacramento.\u201d \nThe capital city of California has had a hands-on industrial edge for decades, reflected in the bikes its citizens rode. \n\u201cThere were always Harley riders when I began,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSomeone told me there was another woman riding a sportbike in Sacramento back then, and we became friends. Neither one of us could find gear that fit properly. It was this fun, lonely world as a rider back then, and thankfully that\u2019s changed. Over the past decade there\u2019s been a new motorcycle culture that\u2019s hard to define. It\u2019s fantastic but hard to peg. The foot traffic in my building doesn\u2019t necessarily dictate the success of my building.\u201d \nThe local Triumph dealer in nearby Roseville reached out recently to see if Smith was interested in hosting the 2018 Triumph Bobber Black unveil in early January. She was excited with the validation and the cool factor of partnering with Triumph. She also led about 150 people on the Sacramento Distinguished Gentleman\u2019s Ride in late September, with nearly 400 for the after-party. \nShasta Smith \nPhoto: Tim Engle \nSmith\u2019s grandfather is one of the last World War II survivors. He left school after the eighth grade, and by the time he was an adult he was hiring Stanford graduates for his corporation. \n\u201cHe\u2019s a fascinating and fun guy,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhen people ask me what the next phase for The Vintage Monkey is, I tell them it\u2019s providing the need and the want for customers. We always need to evolve; I don\u2019t think on things for too long, and I listen to what people are asking for: Beer? Coffee? Food? As foot traffic increases we\u2019ll be ready. And we\u2019re always fine-tuning our service department, getting more niche-y so we can really deliver quality. Getting deposits is a two-way form of commitment, and helps us hone the process. Our crew is dynamic and solid, and I feel very lucky. It\u2019s not always been this way for me, so the hard work and sleepless nights are paying off. I\u2019ll never be able to coast, but the weight on my shoulders is lighter and I can open up my brain more to really pay attention to details. \nThe Vintage Monkey \nPhoto: The Vintage Monkey \n\u201cWe\u2019ll evolve this space where people can lounge. The caf\u00e9 plans have been scrapped because there are plenty of places to eat but none to lounge among classic bikes. I hate the term \u2018evolve or dissolve\u2019 or \u2018innovate or die.\u2019 I appreciate listening to customers\u2019 needs, but classic and vintage motorcycles are our bedrock, and they haven\u2019t had to evolve to maintain their cool! There\u2019s a lot of elbow grease and dirty work to turn a profitable business, especially one with motorcycles lining the walls.\u201d Tags:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "denis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shasta smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim engle  smith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "shasta smith does motorcycle social big", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stanford", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sacramento", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olivia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roseville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:04.082+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15107102, "moreResultsAvailable": 15107002, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640264082&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 438}
