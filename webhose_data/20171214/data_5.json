The act of recognizing Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem prior to a negotiated peace agreement will have the same damaging impact as an actual move of the embassy. \nIsrael\u2019s capital is in Jerusalem and it should be internationally recognized as such in the context of an agreed two-state solution that also establishes a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem. In the absence of that final agreement between the parties on the city\u2019s status, blanket recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital is premature and divisive. That is why, since 1967, all administrations have maintained that the final status of the entirety of Jerusalem is to be decided by negotiations, and have avoided any actions that could be interpreted as prejudging their outcome. \nThe president made absolutely clear that this decision was intended to deliver on a campaign promise. Once again, as in the case of the Iran nuclear agreement, ideology and political concerns are triumphing over the commonsense recommendations of US and Israeli security experts and the opinion of the majority of Jewish Americans. We hope it will not result in further violence and suffering for Israelis and Palestinians \u2013 but we fear that it might. \nMembers of Congress and Jewish communal leaders concerned about Israel\u2019s security and future should not support this misguided and damaging decision.

This is a 6% rise as compared to 2015. Updated: December 7, 2017, 12:43 PM IST Representative image/ REUTERS New Delhi: There was a 6% rise in the number of cybercrime incidents recorded in 2016, as compared to the previous year, with Uttar Pradesh recording the maximum number of cases. Experts that News18 spoke to have, however, weighed in on the numbers put forth by the agency. While they acknowledged the trend of rising incidence of crime, they also raised doubts on how the agency arrived at these numbers. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) released its annual crime data last week and according to it, there were about 12,317 cybercrime cases in 2016. This is a 6% rise as compared to 2015. Uttar Pradesh, with 2,639 cases reported the highest number of cases of cybercrime accounting for 21.4% of the total, followed by Maharashtra with 19.3% or 2,380 cases and Karnataka with 8.9% or 1,101 cases in 2016. However, experts say about 90% of cybercrime cases go unreported. Recording Cyber Crimes Earlier this year, a 26-year-old woman walked into Delhi Police\u2019s cyber cell to report a fake profile of hers on a dating/hook-up website. The case resulted in a complaint, but not an FIR. The case was eventually closed after the social networking site refused to divulge details of the accused persons to the police. For the woman, she was glad that her complaint was lodged and properly looked into, as she was told by the police officials. In layman terms and as per the laws of the country, this amounts to a cyber case. However, chances of the case counting among number of cases mentioned in the National Crime Records Bureau data are bleak. The NCRB relies on police records, which in turn categorises a case as a cybercrime incident only if there was an FIR. Kislay Chaudhary, a cyber security expert said FIRs make all the difference for a case of cybercrime to be counted in the NCRB data. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t show the real picture. The fault lines are at various levels, starting from how the crime is reported and taken forward,\u201d Chaudhary said. Chaudhary added that over the past year, he has received over 20,000 calls seeking help for various cyber issues. \u201cMany of these complainants may have gone to the police but could never file an FIR, thus taking the NCRB data at much lesser numbers,\u201d he added. Leading cyber lawyer and Supreme Court advocate Pavan Duggal seconded Chaudhary\u2019s concerns and said that most of the times the police would not record the complaint at all as they do not know how to deal with it or investigate. \u201cThere is a huge need for capacity building. Police force in the country does not know how to deal with a cybercrime nor does it have the necessary knowhow of the laws. They are not well-equipped to handle these cases, which often leads to under reporting,\u201d he added. Duggal further said that the accused, at times, have often been traced to foreign territories, which again falls beyond the realm of the Indian police authority, thus further cementing their lackadaisical attitude in solving a cyber case. Apprehension in Taking Case Forward Chaudhary gave an example of a young Vaishali-based resident who approached the police with a complaint regarding her social media profile. The police, in turn, told her registering an FIR would mean involving her parents too. \u201cNowhere in the law does it say that an FIR amounts to the complainant\u2019s family being involved. But the girl was told this and she got scared. Women want to ensure their identities are guarded, but sadly the authorities do very little to assure them that,\u201d said Chaudhary. For many complainants, he added, the immediate step is to get primary relief like getting the fake Instagram account deleted or get their morphed image removed from Facebook. \u201cNot many want to get to the bottom of the case, which is a big deterrent in recording of cybercrimes,\u201d he said. Duggal added that about 90% of the cases go unreported. \u201cOf the 10% that are reported, only 1% or less translates into a FIR. Now, that miniscule percentage can\u2019t be symbolic of the whole problem,\u201d he said, adding that he has been dealing with cases on a regular basis and that there is no way that the NCRB data shows what the true picture is. \u201cThe situation is far worse,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

Spokeswoman Michelle Slavich said Tuesday that some have already been hired, and the team will be a combination of employees and contractors.\nWojcicki said the company will apply lessons learned from combating violent and extremist videos to other \u201cproblematic\u201d videos. YouTube will expand the use of \u201cmachine-learning\u201d technology, a new form of artificial intelligence, to flag videos or comments that show hate speech or harm to children. It\u2019s already been using the technology to help remove violent extremist videos.\nSeveral advertisers have reportedly pulled ads from YouTube in the past few weeks as a result of stories about videos showing harm to children, hate speech and other topics they don\u2019t want their ads next to. Some 250 advertisers earlier this year also said they would boycott YouTube because of extremist videos that promoted hate and violence. YouTube said Monday that it is also taking steps to try to reassure advertisers that their ads won\u2019t run next to gross videos.\nThere have been reports of creepy videos aimed at children and pedophiles posting comments on children\u2019s videos in recent weeks. There was also a conspiracy-theory video that came up in a YouTube search a day after the October Las Vegas shooting that killed dozens.\nGoogle isn\u2019t the only tech company that\u2019s stepping up human content reviews to help it police its platform after criticism. Facebook in May said it would hire 3,000 more people to review videos and posts, and, later, another 1,000 to review ads after discovering Russian ads meant to influence the U.S. presidential

Racing 92 sit third in the Top 14 after seven wins from their opening 12 matches \n\"For Scotland, I completely understand that it's difficult to lose a player of Finn's calibre. However, it shows where Scottish rugby is at the moment, that Scottish players are getting more and more attention, and they're growing. I think that's a positive thing. \n\"There are two pro-clubs in Scotland. I'm sure they'll be disappointed Finn has moved on, but there are guys that come through and gain more experience. Potentially Pete Horne, or young guys like Adam Hastings. That's how you grow your depth.\" 'You're up against massive men every week' \nGray, 28, has 64 Scotland caps and represented the British and Irish Lions on their victorious tour of Australia in 2013, making a substitute appearance in the decisive third Test. \nThe towering second-row sat out the autumn internationals as he continues to recover from summer back surgery, but says he is \"very close\" to a return, with the Six Nations Championship two months away. Fiji captain Nemani Nadolo is among the largest backs in professional rugby \nThe Top 14 is home to many of rugby's biggest players - 130kg Fijian winger Nemani Nadolo, and hulking props Uini Atonio and Ben Tameifuna, both over 140kg, are among the brawniest specimens in France. \nGray says playing in this land of behemoths has helped \"toughen him up\". \n\"You go up against massive packs and massive men every week,\" he told BBC Scotland. \"That was the first big adaptation I had to make, to get used to these bruising battles week in, week out. \n\"It is a little bit slower. However, with Finn, he might want to come over and inject that bit of pace and flair which he likes to play with. \n\"That [physical] aspect of my game, my line-outs, my rucking, my scrummaging, my close-quarter play, has improved in the years I've been over here. I certainly think I've made some gains in that aspect of my play.\" Club and country \nFor Scotland supporters, that testimony may sound alarm bells. Fly-half is the position in which the national team can least afford an injury, and no longer will Russell operate under the keen gaze and control of the Scottish set-up. Gray, now 28, believes his four years in France have \"toughened me up\" \n\"It's a tough situation because yes, you're not in your union, so maybe you can't be looked after as well leading up to games,\" Gray said. \"But it's really about the conversations you have with clubs. \n\"If I look back to the Six Nations, we played Ireland, France, then it was the bye week. Toulouse were playing Montpellier, but the coach said, 'Richie, you've played a lot of games, take this week off.' \n\"In fairness they've been generous to me here. I'd hope it hasn't affected my Scotland career too much. Naturally if you move away from Scotland it's going to be a little bit more difficult. \n\"The big thing for me going back into working with Scotland is trying to get up to pace with everything they've been doing, and trying to readapt in a short space of time to new calls and methods. That's probably my biggest struggle. \n\"It'll potentially make things a little bit harder but he's a great player and I'm sure he'll be fine. I don't think Scotland fans should be worried. I think he'll adapt well.\" Land of riches \nAs well as the bulkiest players, French clubs have deep pockets. \nGray concedes the vast salaries on offer do have a bearing on potential newcomers, but says there are many personal benefits to living overseas. Lock Richie Gray signed a four-year deal with Toulouse in 2016 \n\"I'd be lying if I said money doesn't come into it,\" Gray admitted. \n\"However, you take everything as a whole and I've loved my time here, enjoyed it from a cultural point of view, met some great people, learned a lot about myself living abroad from quite a young age, so there's a lot more to it than simply money. \n\"When you're in Glasgow, you're in your home town, you've got family and friends around you, you're well looked after. \n\"But when you move over to France, you don't speak much of the lingo, I remember the hot water wasn't working, and you're going, 'I can't speak a word of French, what do I do?' \n\"Little things like that, you just have to fend for yourself a bit more. I'd like to think I've grown up a bit quicker.\" Share this page", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "russell", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "finn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uini atonio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richie gray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam hastings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nemani nadolo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pete horne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben tameifuna", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "montpellier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish lions", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toulouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:19.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a85babb469ef5c02802a0fe12c5c324d7fa9d501", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..GwbCvKuuYhLJ8KiWEZqEPPqzLGCuo2iC5pC4cRTwmIfI1630bs2_s0k-", "site_full": "forums.overclockers.co.uk", "site": "overclockers.co.uk", "site_section": "http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Overclockers UK Forums", "title": "Can you review my AMD Ryzen gaming rig proposal?", "title_full": "Can you review my AMD Ryzen gaming rig proposal? | Overclockers UK Forums", "published": "2017-12-01T04:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.overclockers.co.uk/styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13599, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "11bbeb6d30af87ae8957f3247c8e75ad3b001f77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..GwbCvKuuYhLJ8KiWEZqEPPqzLGCuo2iC5pC4cRTwmIfI3fLnKVG0x0d41IP9c0poCw--", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "marco.da.man", "published": "2017-12-04T04:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "jimbobjeff85 said: \u2191 Thanks for the reply guys!

After releasing the December security patch , Android Oreo 8.1 , Android Oreo Go , and Chrome 63 , the tech giant has now announced the rollout of Android Oreo for wearable devices. The update is perhaps smaller than some would have expected, but it does bring a few changes on board. Here's the complete list of new features: Vibration settings for notifications - Normal, Long, and Double Touch lock feature allows users to disable touch-to-wake functionality. Useful in wet conditions. Toggle for manually enabling \"Battery saver\" mode. Battery saving background limits Notification channels for apps Support for 7 new countries/languages - Dutch (Belgium), Czech, Spanish (El Salvador), Spanish (Honduras), Spanish (Paraguay), Portuguese (Portugal), English (Nigeria) Google hasn't confirmed the list of devices that will receive the update first, as timing will be determined by the manufacturers.

If you're cool, so let's go.\nI want to start this by saying that Mutsuki has a incredible character development. I just loved it, and the only one I think it's better is from Ken. Ishida is just like Kanou, and his masterpiece is Ken.\nIt has been shown Mutsuki has been showing to us that she passed through a lot ever since before the beginning of series, and as a conclusion, she has several mental daddy issues. And right now, you may have a lot of anger of her, but she's basically (please notice the basically) a antagonist right now , so if you hate her that means she's doing her job right.\nAnd, I also sympatize with her a lot. She's going through a lot of stuff in her life, her dad just beat the fuck off her every single day, and when a sparkle, with just one bit of hope appears to her, it's gone. That was what Kaneki did to her, even though it wasn't intentional.\nYou can also see this post of tumblr that explains my point in a better way. I had posted this before but people started to misunderstand the real meaning of it so I decided to re-do the post in a clearer way.\nAnd I know that A LOT of characters in the history passed through bad things, but a person's problem does not diminish that of another.\n submitted by /u/Ephemerxl\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://hamliet.tumblr.com/post/168235005169/mutsuki-is-irredeemable"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:20.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56c5632966e762b5604f86883173859b89877410", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qw9gRuWdOYTCPQUmcT6vZlSuekOxJIe2h02Ds8PG5jkCbWIbvK4.KOoo8EMsTcwSMav6Enpy0VuJlLQH3jEx1xL0ZAvs5P8SV0yRMcjzf1W2d77KmDTYUmw--", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/india.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top India News- News18.com", "title": "Kalyani University UG Degree Part 1 Results Declared, Check Now", "title_full": "Kalyani University UG Degree Part 1 Results Declared, Check Now", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/12/KALYANI-UNIVERSITY-875.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "56c5632966e762b5604f86883173859b89877410", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qw9gRuWdOYTCPQUmcT6vZlSuekOxJIe2h02Ds8PG5jkCbWIbvK4.KOoo8EMsTcwSMav6Enpy0VuJlLQH3jEx1xL0ZAvs5P8SV0yRMcjzf1W2d77KmDTYUmw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Kalyani University UG Degree Part 1 Results Declared, Check Now", "text": "1-min read Kalyani University UG Degree Part 1 Results Declared, Check Now The varsity has declared the results of its various Undergraduate (Three Year Degree) Part-I courses under 1+1+1 Education System, including honours, major and general programmes for Bachelor of Arts (B.A), Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com) and Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) streams.

He is being accused of \u201cCausing damage to a military installation,\u201d referring to Israel\u2019s illegal Annexation barrier built on his village\u2019s land. Abdullah stated, \u201cThe occupation has used many methods including killing, injuring, and raiding our homes in order to stop us from exercising our right to protest and struggle against the occupation. But we will not stop struggling until the occupation is dismantled.\u201d Abdullah, a leading non violent activist and human rights defender has has been held in military prison since the occupation forces raided his village, Bil\u2019in, and took him from his home in the middle of the night on the 19th of November, 2017. Abdullah was handcuffed, gagged and his hand were tied to the roof of the jeep. Since then, two military judges have conceded that Abdullah is not dangerous and should be released on certain conditions, but the military prosecution is intent on making sure he remains in detention, and has continued to hold him without regard to due process. Tomorrow\u2019s hearing will be to determine if Abdullah has broken conditions set for his release by a military judge after his arrest from the Alwada Cycling Marathon on Nakba Day, the 13th of May, 2016. Abdullah has been arrested and injured many times in the past for his role in promoting non-violent creative protest in his own village of Bil\u2019in and across the West bank. In 2010 , Abdallah served 16 months in prison after being convicted on charges of \u201cincitement\u201d and \u201corganizing and participating in an illegal demonstration.\u201d Abdullah continued to advocate for nonviolent action and Human rights from prison. In addition to Abdullah, 16 year old Ahmad Abu Rahmah, as well as Ashraf Abu Rahmah , another prominent Bil\u2019in activist, were also taken and are still being held by the military. Ahmad Abu Rahmah was arrested with Abdullah in the raid and accused of throwing stones, as was Ashraf, following his arrest on the 14th of November 2017. Ashraf\u2019s two siblings, Basem and Jawaher, were both killed in separate incidents while nonviolently protesting the illegal wall constructed on their land.

So when Barangay Ginebra head coach Tim Cone experienced it, he did not waste the opportunity to tell buddy and Miami Heat tactician Erik Spoelstra about it. The PBA\u2019s winningest coach was left in awe after a PBA all-time record of 54,086 fans flocked to the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan, for Game 7 of the Governors\u2019 Cup finals. He made sure to tell Spoelstra the story moments after Ginebra won the championship. \u201cI did tell him (Spoelstra). I went to their game against the Warriors, the Heat-Warriors game. I was able to spend two days with him. After the game, I went with Eric and we walked around San Francisco for exercise for about two hours. Sobrang pagod . So tired. We were talking the whole time,\u201d said Cone. He added: \u201cHe asked me, \u2018How did you get 54,000 people in Araneta? Sitting on top of each other?\u2019 He really thought we played in Araneta, not in Philippine Arena.\u201d Cone said Spoelstra was not shocked that so many people went to a PBA game. \u201c\u2019I\u2019m amazed but not surprised,\u2019 those are his words. There were 54,000 people but [he said] \u2018I\u2019m not surprised because I know the fans there, I know what they\u2019re like,\u2019\u201d Cone said. It was not the first time Cone coached before more than 50,000 fans. In Game 6 of the same series, 53,642 supporters went to the world\u2019s biggest indoor arena to cheer for their respective squads. But it was probably Game 7 that really left a mark on Cone, especially since that was when he secured his 20th PBA title. Cone and his wards will be returning to the Philippine Arena as they face the Star Hotshots in another Manila Clasico bout on Christmas Day. \u2013 Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

admitted to his role in a separate home invasion during which the victim was shot twice, with one bullet remaining stuck in his body.\nBrock Johnston, 29, was due to face a trial in the WA Supreme Court on Thursday for the attempted murder of Beau White, who was shot in the back at his Butler home in December last year, but pleaded guilty to a lesser offence.\nThe court heard the weapon used during the home invasion was later found in Johnston's possession when police stopped a car in East Perth driven by his partner, lawyer Sanella Naumovski.\nProsecutor Justin Whalley said two people visited Mr White's home two days before the shooting and demanded money for a debt, but he managed to chase them away.\nJohnston was one of several people who broke into the house two days later wearing balaclavas.\nMr White, 28, went into his garage and armed himself with a large jarrah stick, which he used to hit Johnston.\nAdvertisement Another intruder then shot Mr White twice in the back, leaving him with internal bleeding and a collapsed lung.\nMr Whalley said the victim had spent six days in hospital as a result of his life-threatening injuries, but had made a full recovery despite having the bullet still lodged in his body.\nHe described it as a premeditated home invasion, and said the protection of the community and need for personal deterrence demanded a significant term of imprisonment.\nThe incident happened shortly after Johnston was released from custody over claims he fatally shot 23-year-old father Mitch Finnerty in a driveway at a Banksia Grove home in April 2016.\nJohnston was also accused of attempting to kill Coffin Cheaters bikie member Pellegrino Mule, 53, and his 24-year-old son Mark.\nBut the charges were dropped in November 2016 because there was no reasonable prospect of conviction.\nDefence counsel David Edwardson conceded Johnston had a long criminal record and had already spent a substantial part of his life in custody.\nBut he urged Justice Michael Corboy to be merciful with his sentence to avoid the risk of Johnston becoming institutionalised.\nHe said Johnston wanted to have children and work in the construction industry on his release from prison.\nJohnston has pleaded guilty to causing bodily harm, aggravated home burglary, and illegally possessing a firearm and ammunition.\nJustice Corboy will sentence him on Friday.\nAAP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "corboy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brock johnston",

pursuance of a judicial order. Updated: December 7, 2017, 11:42 AM IST The government will issue the Aadhaar notification tomorrow. New Delhi: The Centre on Thursday told the Supreme Court that it will extend the deadline for mandatory linking of Aadhaar to various government schemes till March 31, 2018. A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra was informed by Attorney General K K Venugopal that the Centre was willing to extend the deadline of December 31 to March 31 next year for linking of Aadhaar with various services and schemes. The Attorney General, however, made clear that February 6 next year would remain the deadline for linking Aadhaar for availing uninterrupted mobile services as it had been mandated by the apex court. Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for those who are opposed to Aadhaar scheme told the bench, also comprising Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, that the central government should give an undertaking that no coercive steps would be taken against those fail to link their Aadhaar with various services. The apex court will set up Constitution Bench next week to hear interim pleas seeking stay on Centre's move to link Aadhaar with various schemes and services. The SC on October 30 had said that a Constitution Bench would commence hearing on the clutch of petitions against Aadhaar scheme from the last week of November. Recently, a nine-judge constitution bench of the apex court had held that Right to Privacy was a Fundamental Right under the Constitution. Several petitioners challenging the validity of Aadhaar had claimed it violated privacy rights. The Centre had on October 25 told the top court that the deadline for mandatory linking of Aadhaar to receive benefits of government schemes has been extended till March 31, 2018 for those who do not have the 12-digit unique biometric identification number and were willing to enrol for it.

(Image: Reuters) New Delhi: Reacting to US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, India on Thursday said its position on Palestine is independent and consistent. \u201cIndia's position on Palestine is independent and consistent. It is shaped by our views and interests, and not determined by any third country,\u201d Raveesh Kumar, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, said in a statement. Trump on Wednesday recognized the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital \u2014 a historic decision that overturns decades of US policy and risks triggering a fresh spasm of violence in the Middle East. \"I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\" Trump said from the White House. \"It's the right thing to do.\" The declaration calls into question seven decades of deliberate diplomatic ambiguity about the final status of a holy city vociferously claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. Trump also kicked off the process of moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, making good on a campaign promise dear to evangelical Christian and right-wing Jewish voters \u2014 as well as donors. He said his decision marked the start of a \"new approach\" to solving the thorny conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Trump's predecessors \u2014 from Bill Clinton to George Bush \u2014 made similar promises on the campaign trail, but quickly reneged upon taking office, and the burden of war and peace. This most unlikely of presidents, who came to office with no foreign policy experience and denouncing experts, was determined to show his arrival in Washington spells the end of business as usual. \"Many presidents have said they want to do something and they didn't do it,\" Trump said in the hours leading up to his historic address. \"Whether it's courage or they changed their mind, I can't tell you,\" he said. \"I think it's long overdue.\" The announcement leaves many angry US allies and leaders across the Middle East trying to find a measured response and hoping that the tinderbox region is not destined for yet another round of bloodletting. Pope Francis joined a list of leaders warning of a historic misstep that could trigger a surge of violence. \"I cannot silence my deep concern over the situation that has emerged in recent days,\" the pontiff said Wednesday, one day after speaking by phone with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas. The pontiff added that maintaining Jerusalem's status quo was important \"in order to avoid adding new elements of tension to an already volatile world that is wracked by so many cruel conflicts.\" In a frantic series of calls, the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the European Union, France, Germany, and Turkey also warned Trump against the move.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pope francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raveesh kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of external affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:22.039+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b1e7101a2417777cb54ce9e1ba9e30067eac0817", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Zo6Jdbl4jwnUDBfdgZZMB54B.V1q.fGPvPBEErFNdMJqAgylY6VEW_22oP5Qa883JIG1CCsntWm45fMSAEUgP0wlkVnP8PqQR0lF6H4QBa7nsyK1SI2MYmbIZ0FwDhmuU6idx2FqGow--", "site_full": "www.thepresstribune.com", "site": "thepresstribune.com", "site_section": "http://www.colfaxrecord.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "sports"], "section_title": "Colfax Record", "title": "15656 FILE NO. 17-02379 FILED NOVEMBER 22, 2017 FICTITIOUS", "title_full": "15656 FILE NO. 17-02379 FILED NOVEMBER 22, 2017 FICTITIOUS", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1e7101a2417777cb54ce9e1ba9e30067eac0817", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Zo6Jdbl4jwnUDBfdgZZMB54B.V1q.fGPvPBEErFNdMJqAgylY6VEW_22oP5Qa883JIG1CCsntWm45fMSAEUgP0wlkVnP8PqQR0lF6H4QBa7nsyK1SI2MYmbIZ0FwDhmuU6idx2FqGow--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "15656 FILE NO. 17-02379 FILED NOVEMBER 22, 2017 FICTITIOUS", "text": "15656 FILE NO. 17-02379 FILED NOVEMBER 22, 2017 FICTITIOUS   \n15656 FILE NO. 17-02379 FILED NOVEMBER 22,   FATHER AND SON FARM, 3435 AMORUSO WAY, ROSEVILLE, CA 95747 1.

Messenger marketing has been billed by many in the marketing industry as something that will revolutionise direct to customer marketing on a level comparable to that of email. That\u2019s quite a claim and if the reality turns out to be even part of the way towards substantiating these forecasts, social marketers will want to make sure they are early adopters. Response rates and engagement tend to be at their highest when a marketing communication channel is still new and catches the interest of the target engagement market. \nSo what exactly is Messenger Marketing? It\u2019s a combination of an email subscribers list and Facebook Messenger. Followers, including existing and potential customers can get in touch directly with a brand\u2019s Facebook page through the Messenger app and communicate in real time. Users must first subscribe to a brand\u2019s Messenger list but once they have been encouraged into doing so, the business can then message them in the same way as friends can be messaged from a regular, private Facebook profile. It\u2019s like an email in many ways but the more personal method of delivery has already been demonstrated to lead to far higher engagement and response statistics. Open rates of communication delivered by Facebook Messenger are currently as high as over 90%. \nThird party software is already available to help businesses build their Messenger lists as well as to segment a list into different groups and automate marketing campaigns. The big advantages that Messenger campaigns offer to social commerce marketers are: \nReach: Facebook Messenger has over 1.2 billion users and 1 billion messages are already being exchanged with businesses every month through the new feature. And that\u2019s before most businesses have started using the channel. Impressive Open and CTR: Open rates are reported as being as high as 90% to 100% and Click Through Rates over 90%. Messages actually being opened and read is the number one priority for marketers. As long as the product or service being presented is high quality and competitively priced, that is a very small step from marketing communication then being actioned. \nReduce Ad Costs: reduced advertising costs and expanded organic posts reach by setting up automatic Messenger responses to comments under Facebook posts. For example, an offer can be made via a post on a brand\u2019s page such as \u2018reply Yes for a 10% discount\u2019. Users responding with \u2018yes\u2019 will then immediately receive an actionable message via Messenger. \nConversational: while email marketing is very one-sided, Messenger Marketing is focused on interactive back-and-forth communication. Automation can be set up to trigger message sequences specific to a customer\u2019s needs based on keywords used. Interaction doesn\u2019t require a human to respond to Messenger communication meaning campaigns are scalable and can still be educational and authentic if set up well. \nCheap to Build Messenger List: early adopters can take advantage of the fact that lack of saturation at present means that Messenger lists can be built cheaply in comparison to email subscriber lists. \nROI: Spend on Facebook Messenger marketing is reputedly being rewarded with ROIs of upwards of 400%, which is enough to pique the interest of even the most conservative marketers. \nEmail and other traditional marketing channels are far from dead and still very much have their use. However, the increasing role of social media in marketing is a trend set to continue and the smart marketer will make sure they get the \u2018early adopter\u2019 advantage.

Picture: Phil Hillyard \n\u201cA lot of the girls in this competition, particularly the Australian players, have probably been full time cricketers for at least six months, if not longer,\u201d Perry said. \n\u201cFrom that point of view it only means that players are going to be better, from a skills point of view, but also an athletic point of view. They\u2019ve had a longer time to focus on being stronger and fitter. \n\u201cEspecially in T20 cricket where that athleticism and explosiveness comes into play so often, I expect everyone to be better than they were last year.\u201d \nBrisbane Heat\u2019s Beth Mooney was in ripping form during the recent Ashes T20s, putting on an 86 and 117 in two of the three match, and she expects the runs will flow freely this season. \n\u201cNorth Sydney Oval, opening weekend, it will be a belter of a wicket again,\u201d she said. \n\u201cWe might see scores of 160-plus all the way through the weekend. media_camera Ellyse Perry in action for the Sixers last season. Picture: Gregg Porteous \n\u201cIt will be really exciting and a really good spectacle for the Australian public to look at and get talking about women\u2019s cricket.\u201d \nTalk is key in taking the game beyond it\u2019s current audience. \nCricket Australia\u2019s head of Big Bash Kim McConnie said while those in cricket circles knew all too well about the exciting T20 women\u2019s competition, the challenge was now reaching people outside that. \nFree entry to games, double headers and taking games to non-traditional grounds are some of the steps they are taking, as well as entering partnerships with non-sport entities. media_camera It\u2019s going to be a colour bash! Picture: Phil Hillyard \n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, the level of awareness on women\u2019s cricket is ridiculously low, still,\u201d she said. \n\u201cWe\u2019re in the world so we find that hard to believe but only 40 per cent of Australians actually know there\u2019s a professional women\u2019s cricket team. \n\u201cWe do a fantastic job with out cricket audience, but Mamamia, Nickelodeon they give us access to people who aren't in our cricket community and that\u2019s where the growth will come from. \n\u201cThe growth will come from a mum realising that a great day out at North Sydney Oval, seeing her kids watching the competition that\u2019s fantastic and having a great fun day too.\u201d WOMEN\u2019S BIG BASH OPENING WEEKEND \nNorth Sydney Oval ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fiona bollen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gregg porteous", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ellyse perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beth mooney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phil hillyard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim mcconnie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mamamia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wbbl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "news corp australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sixers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nickelodeon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney sixers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brisbane heat", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north sydney oval", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney oval", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:23.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bbd4714f856293f7bae2bf78aaeada9ca03e085e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W1E45b5uoIk.Q2d5ftDX.Qe92FeGv9N3HJfsIgu8hKr8.xwCwTWSFhIuFSotmOR0PbNHxgKZPyOiHWvUusc4s4Y-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "Would you want male birth control?

IQPlus, (07/12) - Fitch Ratings has assigned a National Long-Term Rating of 'A+(idn)' to Indonesia-based integrated fabric and garment manufacturer PT Sri Rejeki Isman Tbk's (Sritex; BB-/A+(idn)/Stable) USD10 million domestic medium-term notes due 2020. The notes add to the USD30 million issuance in October 2017, which are part of Sritex's total issuance plan of USD80 million.\nThe company plans to issue the remaining USD40 million in February 2018. Proceeds from the issuance will be used to refinance Sritex's bank debt. Sritex's ratings reflect the company's profile as Indonesia's largest integrated fabric and garment manufacturer, its increasing operating cash flows, and its moderate financial profile. We expect Sritex to reduce its leverage (defined as net adjusted debt/EBITDAR) to around 3.0x by end-2017 from 3.9x at end-2016 as it completes its new production capacity.\nLeverage fell to 3.2x at end-September 2017 from a peak of 3.7x at end-June 2017 as working capital needs returned to normal after new capacity increased sufficiently to ease a production bottleneck in its finished fabrics division. The domestic medium-term notes are rated at the same level as Sritex's 'A+(idn)' National Long-Term Rating because they represent the senior unsecured obligations of the issuer. 'A' National Ratings denote expectations of low default risk relative to other issuers or obligations in the same country. However, changes in circumstances or economic conditions may affect the capacity for timely repayment to a greater degree than is the case for financial commitments denoted by a higher rated category.\nWorking Capital Normalising: We expect Sritex's cash conversion cycle to normalise to less than 190 days by end-2017, from a high of 217 days as of end-June 2017, and 181 days at end-2016. The working capital increase in 1H17 was temporary and driven by the production bottleneck at the company's finished-fabric division because new production capacity in the division took longer to be commissioned, even though spinning and weaving production, key raw materials for finished fabrics, had already increased.

Defying dire, worldwide warnings, President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke with decades ... \nJERUSALEM (AP) - The Latest on the fallout from President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital (all times local): \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.
