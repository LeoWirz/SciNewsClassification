Vi var som i kan se p\u00e5 billederne super heldige med vejret! Der var h\u00f8j sol og skyfri himmel hvilket bet\u00f8d vi havde den aller fineste udsigt over hele downtown Los Angeles. Sikke en udsigt.. Sports t\u00f8jet var fundet frem, samt ens mest comfortable tr\u00e6ning sko! Jeg havde ikke helt haft nogle forventninger, da jeg ikke rigtig har vidst hvad jeg kunne tillade mig at forvente, MEN en ting er i hvert fald sikker \u2013 skuffet, det blev jeg IKKE! Our Hollywood Hills hike is without doubt the highlight of our California trip. As you can see on the pictures we were extremely lucky with the weather! Sunny and no clouds \u2013 oh yes.. That meant we had the best view possible watching over downtown Los Angeles. What a view! The sports outfit was on together with our most comfortable workout shoes. I didn\u2019t have any expectations for the hike, I just knew it was going to be amazing. I didn\u2019t really knew what I could allow myself to expect, but one thing is sure \u2013 I DID NOT get disappointed! Vi havde kun et par timer til at n\u00e5 op til toppen, s\u00e5 vi kunne desv\u00e6rre ikke n\u00e5 at komme helt op til skiltet. Jeg syntes stadig det var en k\u00e6mpe oplevelse at komme s\u00e5 t\u00e6t p\u00e5 som vi gjorde, og faktisk virker det til at v\u00e6re l\u00e6ngere v\u00e6k n\u00e5r man kigger p\u00e5 billederne, end det var i virkeligheden. Jeg elsker dusty jord farver, udsigten, det smukke lys og s\u00e5 var der slet ikke s\u00e5 mange mennesker som jeg havde troet. Der er s\u00e5 meget areal, at man ligger slet ikke m\u00e6rke til, at der er andre. K\u00e6mpe oplevelse af Visit California, at tage os med herop \u2013 det er en oplevelse jeg vil huske for altid. Mit yndlings tr\u00e6ning s\u00e6t fra Sweaty Betty var perfekt til dette, og sidder smurt p\u00e5 ens krop, som en dr\u00f8m! Har i nogle sinde v\u00e6ret der? Hvis ikke, s\u00e5 burde i virkelig skrive det p\u00e5 jeres bucket liste.. Hvis jeg boede i Hollywood, s\u00e5 havde Claudia Rex og jeg taget hinanden i h\u00e5nden hver dag, for at vandre her i bjergene. Det kan kun g\u00f8re en glad i l\u00e5get. Haha   We only had a few ours for the hike, so unfortunately we didn\u2019t have enough time to get all the way to the top. Still it was such a big experience, and we still got to get close to the Hollywood sign. On these images it looks like we are quite far, but we were actually closer than it looks like on these pictures. I love the dusty earth colors, the sun and then there were far less people there than I\u2019ve expected. The hills are really big, so it\u2019s far from crowded. Such a dreamy thing I get to cross of my bucket list thanks to Visit California. I will remember that day forever. My favourite workout gear from Sweaty Betty was just made for this. It fits so well it almost looks like it\u2019s painted on your body! Love that. Have you ever done this hike before? If not, then you must write it on your bucket list.. If I lived in Hollywood, then this hike should be my every morning workout session. Then I would take Claudia Rex, and we would do it together. That can only make your day!

Last Wednesday night, right in the middle of downtown Oak Bluffs, the magic was launched with the lighting of the tree and the dramatic one-of-a-kind arrival of St. Nick aboard a red-lighted, sirens blaring, Oak Bluffs fire engine. It was nothing short of spectacular! \nThank yous are in order, starting with the Oak Bluffs School student and artist Madeleine Bengtsson, who created this year\u2019s tree lighting poster. The tree was given by Paul Mahoney, and it was erected, along with all of the other holiday decorations in town, by the Oak Bluffs Highway Department and Mark Crossland. Bows were a gift of the Friends of Oak Bluffs. Carols played by the Vineyard Classic Brass and the upbeat music by Brian Weiland and Paul Thurlow to welcome Santa were sensational. \nThanks to the PTO for helping to get the word out, and to Mike Santoro for gallons of hot chocolate topped with whipped cream and his mighty crew for pouring. Thanks to Christine Todd and Kathleen Cowley in charge of antler-giving and to Kathy Burton, chairman of the board of selectmen, for lighting the tree. \nA most special thanks to the Oak Bluffs Fire Department Civic Association for bringing the jolliest Santa ever and for collecting six overflowing baskets of food that were given by all who attended for the Island Food Pantry. \nOur heartfelt thanks and best wishes to all from the Oak Bluffs Association for the merriest and most heartfelt holidays ever.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul thurlow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine todd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathy burton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madeleine bengtsson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathleen cowley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark crossland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul mahoney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike santoro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian weiland", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "island food pantry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oak bluffs association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oak bluffs fire department civic association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. nick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oak bluffs highway department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "santa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:43.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf2e3329fcaf977b1e0cccc2e799bb8304158e77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_4ah3ZS9QWRmbMeKPhWUmxSViNmhp55xop2SDD2awFR2qEeLG.Te9Rd7I8aBT5XQ0-", "site_full": "www.risingshare.fun", "site": "risingshare.fun", "site_section": "http://www.risingshare.fun/viewforum.php?f=22", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "~RisingShare~ \u2022 Visualizza forum - Software Mac", "title": "Golden Software Grapher 12.1.651 (x86/x64)", "title_full": "~RisingShare~ \u2022 Leggi argomento - Golden Software Grapher 12.1.651 (x86/x64)", "published": "2017-12-07T02:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.301, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cf2e3329fcaf977b1e0cccc2e799bb8304158e77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_4ah3ZS9QWRmbMeKPhWUmxSViNmhp55xop2SDD2awFR2qEeLG.Te9Rd7I8aBT5XQ0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rollroy", "published": "2017-12-07T02:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Golden Software Grapher 12.1.651 (x86/x64)", "text": "Golden Software Grapher 12.1.651 (x86/x64)\nGolden Software Grapher 12.1.651 (x86/x64) | 102.2 MB\nGrapher is the only graphing program you will ever need.

I am sure these include approaches to determining the number of components in a mixture. You could probably look there.

Certain misgivings have been expressed in the media regarding \"bail-in\" provisions of the FRDI Bill.The provisions contained in the FRDI Bill, as introduced in the Parliament, do not modify present protections to the depositors adversely at all. They provide additional protections to the depositors in a more transparent manner, the officials said.At present, each depositor of banks can be only protected up to a limit of Rs 1 lakh by the guarantee of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). The remaining deposits (beyond Rs 1 lakh) do not have any protection guarantee and are treated on par with claims of unsecured creditors as of now.Besides providing similar protection or guarantee of Rs 1 lakh to depositors, as it exists today, the rights of uninsured depositors are being placed at an elevated status in the FRDI Bill compared to the existing legal arrangements over the unsecured creditors and even government dues.The sources said the FRDI Bill is far more depositor friendly than many other jurisdictions, which provide for statutory bail-in, where consent of creditors/ depositors is not required for bail-in.\"The FRDI Bill does not propose in any way to limit the scope of powers for the government to extend financing and resolution support to banks, including public sector banks. Government's implicit guarantee for public sector banks remains unaffected,\" they said.\"Indian Banks have adequate capital and are also under prudent regulation and supervision to ensure safety and soundness, as well as systemic stability. The existing laws ensure the integrity, security and safety of the banking system. In India, all possible steps and policy measures are taken to prevent the failure of banks and protection of interests of depositors (e.g. issue of directions/prompt corrective action measures, capital adequacy and prudential norms).\"The FRDI Bill will strengthen the system by adding a comprehensive resolution regime that will help ensure that, in the rare event of failure of a financial service provider, there is a system of quick, orderly and efficient resolution in favour of depositors,\" the sources said.

It helps you stay more present in the moment, and more tuned in to what you're experiencing. It helps you develop more sexual self-confidence. It helps your partner learn what you like, and lowers their performance anxiety. It's also a low-stress way to play with fantasies. Here's how to talk dirty for beginners. \nArt by Jim Cooke/GMG Get Comfortable \nMany people have never tried talking dirty before, and feel anxious about how to get started. Sex is still a taboo topic, so the idea of talking about it out loud, in front of another person, can seem overwhelming. If you're brand new to dirty talk, you can first check out a past article I wrote about getting comfortable talking about sex . The article walks you through figuring out which words feel easier to use than others, and how to string together some basic sentences. Another tip is to start with breathing more heavily and moaning first, then work your way up to being verbal. Do This Tonight: Mutual Masturbation In case the title isn't clear, mutual masturbation is when you and your partner masturbate in front of each other. I think it's one of the most underrated sexual acts; very few people do it, but it can be one of the most erotic experiences you'll ever have. Read more Initiate \nA lot of people get nervous about initiating dirty talk if they have never done it before. But it doesn't need to be that complicated. You can start with saying really simple phrases such as, \"That feels so good.\" My favourite recommendation is to do a post-sex recap session. After you and your partner have just wrapped up, talk to your partner about how that particular session went. Tell them the details of what you really enjoyed. You already know what happened, so you're just sharing your experience, not coming up with something new. If you're brand-new to talking dirty, you can start super-simple and just say, \"That was great,\" or \"I'm speechless.\" Once you feel more comfortable, try more detailed things such as, \"That position we tried was hitting some really good angles for me.\" Consider Different Communication Options \nIf talking dirty in person feels too intimidating at first, you can always get started via text or email. Communicating in writing tends to be easier, since you have more time to think about what to say, and you don't have to be face-to-face when you deliver your dirty talk. What to Say \nThere are a lot of different things you can communicate with dirty talk. Here are some examples: \nShare what you're feeling in the moment \nOne of the easiest ways to talk dirty is to simply describe what you're feeling in the moment. There's no need to think about anything detailed or complex. Just share what's going on for you. \nExamples: \n\"You feel so big inside of me.\" \n\"That feels so good I can hardly stand it.\" \nGive feedback \nPeople tend to get nervous about feedback because they think they need to be giving directions . But feedback is another way of sharing what you're feeling in the moment. It's just a bit more direct. \nExamples: \n\"A little to the left.\" \n\"Harder.\" \n\"Don't stop.\" \nAsk for something that you want \nYou can also be more direct, and ask specifically for something that you want or want to try. \nExamples: \n\"Hold my hands over my head.\" \n\"Take your clothes off.\" \nAnother simple form of dirty talk is to compliment your partner. \nExamples: \n\"I can't stop staring at your arse.\" \n\"You turn me on so much.\" \nReminisce \nThis is another great type of dirty talk for beginners. You can ease your way into talking dirty by discussing memories of great times you've already shared. \nExamples: \n\"Remember when we were in [fill in the blank]...?\" \nTalk about fantasies \nDirty talk is a great way to test drive fantasies before actually trying them in real life. Many couples find that just talking dirty about a fantasy is thrilling enough. (If there's a fantasy you'd like to talk dirty about, but you're positive you don't want to do it in real life, make sure to give your partner a heads-up about that.) \nExamples: \n\"I'm thinking about watching you go down on another woman.\" \n\"What do you think it would be like if I tied you up and made you my slave?\" \n\"That scene from the movie earlier was so hot. I can't get it out of my head.\" \nRoleplay \nYou can use dirty talk to try on a different persona. Maybe you want to be bossier, or more submissive. You can also use words or language that you wouldn't normally use. It can be really hot to use \"taboo\" words such as \"slut\", especially if you wouldn't use that kind of language outside of the bedroom. (Keep in mind that you can talk dirty in the bedroom and still be a sex-positive feminist. Consciously choosing to use or allow your partner to use certain language is different from having that language thrust upon you.) \nExamples: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "first time vanessa marin dec", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:43.098+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18cded1a4980688980ee9d666acbf002e69b564a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpRUu0DADpMNQlNmTZ31RGb5WaxZ7YmL6lKKULHVexSVX92gDu6O.3dhch823xIqkmvxhLPUAZcfIqf5jfDX5niLNIpnkzZrOQSnfdHoFOI4LhAf6JRthuyWoGu_YkjM4Qu.Y5pIqw6FRg--", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/mobiles-new?page=2", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Mobile Phones - Cheap Contracts, PAYG &amp;

They are meant to show you the ideal version of a project: beautifully illuminated by the sun, clear blue skies, smiling people on the street, occasionally a flock of feathered friends in flight. \nWhich is why the rendering for 679 Lefferts Avenue caught our eye. The proposal for a six-story residential building in East Flatbush \u2014 a cubist spike looming over the single-family homes that surround it \u2014 is presented in the rendering amid a torrential downpour. It makes the building look like the ominous lair of a horror-movie villain. The complete image. Rendering via IMC Architecture \nWe decided to call IMC Architecture, the firm behind the design and the architect of record, to see what they were thinking. \n\u201cNew York City isn\u2019t always a sunny place,\u201d said Eugene Mekhtiyev, one of the principals at the firm. They at first tried a sunnier rendering, he added, but decided it needed \u201csome more flair.\u201d \nAs you can see above, flair is certainly not something the rendering is lacking: Lightning strikes in the distance; trees blow violently in the wind; at the base of the building, people rush around with umbrellas (curiously, a suspicious man wearing sunglasses lurks in the background); an oil spill seems to have occurred in the street. The building will replace a semi-detached early 20th century row house. Photo by Joe Strini for PropertyShark \nThe firm has been receiving a lot of calls about the rendering, said Mekhtiyev, which may mean it has achieved at least one apparent goal: attention. \nThis isn\u2019t the first unusual rendering, of course. Who can forget the \u201c Bulgarian Neo-Goth Super-Villain Crack Lair \u201d at 410 Tompkins Avenue, or Drake\u2019s appearance on the proposed Fort Greene Park entrance ramp? \nRelated Stories", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eugene mekhtiyev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mekhtiyev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe strini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drake", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "prospect lefferts gardens", "sentiment": "positive"}], "locations": [{"name": "lefferts avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort greene park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prospect lefferts gardens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tompkins avenue", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:44.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "871ac247d54ca23f6859bd797fdb3afff7fe29e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRCauWqe0O14VVlEBDOcvO5MZAYhyDdiZsccSbu5UydqHJKjnIIAGTGI9bSKaKdBg4zLaIxGRPkB03rAMdiEW9asGkQqdJZyFF9hVnPjz.4l1IWXJzuu28AkcDpb55l430-", "site_full": "www.lifehacker.com.au", "site": "lifehacker.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.lifehacker.com.au/lifehackeraustralia", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Lifehacker Australia", "title": "Briefly: Black Mirror Trailer, Anxiety Hacks, Best Games On Switch", "title_full": "Briefly: Black Mirror Trailer, Anxiety Hacks, Best Games On Switch", "published": "2017-12-06T21:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_large/vn2k9ou22ljxqhvucprh.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17620, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "871ac247d54ca23f6859bd797fdb3afff7fe29e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRCauWqe0O14VVlEBDOcvO5MZAYhyDdiZsccSbu5UydqHJKjnIIAGTGI9bSKaKdBg4zLaIxGRPkB03rAMdiEW9asGkQqdJZyFF9hVnPjz.4l1IWXJzuu28AkcDpb55l430-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Chris Jager", "published": "2017-12-06T21:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Briefly: Black Mirror Trailer, Anxiety Hacks, Best Games On Switch", "text": "Chris Jager Dec 7, 2017, 5:30pm \nBrief news items of note for Lifehacker readers, including: Watch the new trailer for Black Mirror Season Four, four morning rituals to help relieve anxiety, the best 12 games on Nintendo Switch.

The tests are now available for the patients all over Europe through the online platform http://www.locus-medicus.com .\n(Photo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/616634/Locus_Medicus.jpg )\nTHE HIDDEN-C TEST changes the way we look at feminine reproductive health\nThe Hidden-C\u00ae Test is a unique non-invasive method which uses menstrual blood to provide a deeper understanding of the feminine reproductive health, being able to identify in one sample, more than 31 microorganisms, viruses and fungi which can remain asymptomatic and may lead to infertility or to sexually transmitted infections.\n\" The innovation in the Hidden-C\u00ae Test lies in the use of menstrual material , which flows through the upper and lower female genital tract, collecting cells of the shedding endometrium, as well as any microorganisms contained in cervical and vaginal fluids, becom ing a complex source of information . C ombined with the extremely high sensitivity of Real-Time PCR, t he Hidden-C\u00ae Test exceeds >95% sensitivity for screening the endometrium for the presence of pathogens revealing hidden infections in both the upper and the lower genital tract \" , says Doctor Vassilis Tsilivakos , Head of Research in Reproductive Medicine at Locus Medicus.\nEARLY PREGNANCY FAILURE AND RECURRENT MISCARRIAGES MAY ORIGINATE FROM THE SPERM\nLocus Medicus laboratories propose a comprehensive investigation of sperm, to identify hidden microorganisms inside the spermatozoa, which can have a crucial influence on the future pregnancy even after a successful conception.

For roles you have to right click a role mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Credentials]\r\n; If you have a bot account (which you should), you can find your token here:\r\n;     https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/\r\n; Then click the button for your bot to go to the bot's page.\r\n; Make sure \"Require OAuth2 Code Grant\" is unchecked.  You also do not need to\r\n; add any \"Redirect URIs\" or \"RPC Origins\".\r\n;\r\nToken = Mzg4MjQ1NDk2MzgyMzU3NTA1.DQqNXQ.ZDdGJRil63hUetLv9jO2YxrveLg\r\n\r\n; If you want to use a normal user account instead of a bot account, use these\r\n; options instead. Comment (or delete) the token line and uncomment the\r\n; Email/Password lines.\r\n;\r\n;Email = account@email\r\n;Password = account_password\r\n\r\n\r\n[Permissions]\r\n; This option is for setting which user has full* permissions/control of the\r\n; bot.  Only one user can be set here. Additional users can be granted\r\n; permissions in permissions.ini, read that for more details.\r\n;\r\n; You can use this option two different ways:\r\n;\r\n;   1. If set to \"auto\", the bot will set the owner to the owner of the\r\n;      application/bot account.  This can only be used with bot accounts.\r\n;\r\n;   2. To set the owner to another user, this should be set to the user's ID.\r\n;      Getting a user's ID is explained above.\r\n;\r\n;      Example:\r\n;         OwnerID = 998877665544332211\r\n;\r\n;      TLDR: enable developer mode in discord, right click a user's name in\r\n;            discord, Copy ID, paste here.\r\n;\r\n; * The owner is not automatically granted dev command access (see below)\r\n; \r\nOwnerID = 297751877221744662\r\n\r\n; This option is for developer use only.  Adding user ids here will allow the\r\n; listed users to use commands marked as \"Dev only\".  These commands do not\r\n; show up in the help command list, and include the \"debug\" command, which is\r\n; used to run arbitrary code (very dangerous).  This should only be used when\r\n; actively developing the bot.  Users with no interest in making changes to\r\n; the bot's code should ignore this option completely. \r\n; \r\n; Note: The owner is NOT automatically added to this group.  These are special\r\n; commands outside the scope of normal use.  Users must be explicitly added.\r\n;\r\n;DevIDs =\r\n\r\n\r\n[Chat]\r\n; Change this if you don't want commands to trigger another bot\r\n; Example:\r\n;   CommandPrefix = *\r\n; This means the commands you use in chat are *play, *skip, etc.\r\n;\r\n; In case you were wondering, this explanation exists because some people\r\n; haven't learned what \"prefix\" means.  Reminder, you do not list commands\r\n; here.  That means you DO NOT put something like this:\r\n;   \"CommandPrefix = *play *queue *np *skip *clear...\" etc.\r\n;\r\nCommandPrefix = !\r\n\r\n; Restrict the bot to only listen to certain text channels.  Uncomment the\r\n; line and add channel IDs to enable.  Getting channel IDs is explained above.\r\n; Example:\r\n;   BindToChannels = 1122334455667788 1223344556677889\r\n; (Don't use these ids, they won't work)\r\n;\r\n;BindToChannels =\r\n\r\n; Join a channel on startup.

Note the bot must have Manage Messages\r\n; permission in the channel to delete messages from other users.\r\nDeleteInvoking = no\r\n\r\n; Save the queue to the disk and update it as it changes.

In commemoration of the lives lost in that nightmare and of the more than 500,000 lives lost to gun violence in this country since, clergy from all over the country will hold a vigil in front of the NRA headquarters in Fairfax, Va., at 10 am on Dec. 14, 2017. Clergy on Martha\u2019s Vineyard will hold our own vigil at 10 am on Thursday, Dec. 14. We will first join together at 9:15 am at Owen Park as the multifaith fellowship we are. At 9:30 am, the time that the shooting began, we will march silently to Five Corners, where we will offer prayers and read out the names of the children and adults who died in 2012 at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. Members of the clergy will lead us in prayer for an end to the unnecessary loss of life that gun violence has caused and continues to cause in this country, and for a just and moral resolution to the dilemma our country faces between personal freedom and public safety.
