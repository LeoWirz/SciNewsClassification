The Red Devils are currently on a four-match winning streak in the Premier League, and a victory over their cross-town rivals will create a new unbeaten home record of 41 games across all competitions. Formation: 3-4-1-2 Lineup: David de Gea has started the last 15 Premier League games for United, and he will be beaming with confidence for the derby following his world-class performance versus Arsenal . He is certain to start in goal. Phil Jones is likely to play some role in the Manchester derby, and we are backing him to start in a three-man defence alongside Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelof , who has found his feet in the Premier League of late. Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young have remained regulars in the right wing-back and left wing-back spots under Mourinho, we don't expect any changes unless Mourinho decides to spring a surprise. Nemanja Matic was left out of the midweek Champions League game versus CSKA Moscow with a minor muscle injury, but he is assured of his spot in central midfield this weekend. Likewise, Marouane Fellaini could be drafted straight into the lineup after injury with Mourinho not having the services of Paul Pogba , who received a straight card versus Arsenal . Jesse Lingard has been one of the headline makers over the past week with three goals in two league appearances. The Englishman could be fancied to start in the number 10 role behind the main strikers.

It can be tough to build end-of-year marketing campaigns that don\u2019t focus on any specific holidays, but still stand out among the busy season\u2019s greetings. \nIf you\u2019ve got an end-of-year campaign going out, you know how hard it is to get a message through against the tide of holiday greetings that are also hitting mailboxes and messaging platforms during the crowded season. \nIt\u2019s especially difficult if your message has nothing to do with the holidays. Increasingly, companies are veering away from conventional, denominational seasons greetings design schemes in favor of more generic (but just as genuine) feel-good creative. But once you give up the familiar sights of colored lights and gift-wrapped boxes, how do your materials rank among all of the festive mailings at this time of year? \nThere\u2019s always iconic winter imagery to signal the \u201cend of year\u201d vibes, like snowmen and hot cocoa. (This may be a little trickier in South Florida!) Or you can always focus on the new year itself \u2014 though there are only so many images and phrases tied to the (technically secular) date, and you do risk blending in with, or becoming redundant to, any other New Year\u2019s assets. \nSometimes it\u2019s best to be led by a concept or the content. Here are a few of our favorite end-of-year ideas: An always-popular idea is offering something practical, like a round-up of trends for your industry from the closing year (we suggest limiting text and going with an infographic). Similarly, a practical item, like a calendar, is more likely to be kept on hand (and may be more cost-effective for you to mail than other practical items like a magnet or pen). It\u2019s a prime time to offer reward, membership, and loyalty systems that launch first thing in the new year, or sales and promotions that end at the close of this one. People also love a good peek behind the scenes, so you could share your team\u2019s favorite memories from the year (it doesn\u2019t hurt that this is an opportunity to revisit any recognitions, conference appearances, or special moments that peppered your year). In that same vein, looking ahead is exciting too: Maybe you\u2019re thinking of expanding the team, focusing on a new niche, or just changing the music in the lobby. Letting your audience, clients, customers, collaborators, vendors, and others know what\u2019s to come in the new year helps them feel included and builds on your relationship. \nSteal This Idea \nHere\u2019s our best idea for 2017 \u2014 and please feel free to \u201csteal\u201d it! Instead of giving out something with your own logo prominently displayed, create something with the client\u2019s name on it that they can give away to someone else as a gift. It can even be jokingly sent out after the holidays as a \u201cregift\u201d \u2014 which offers the added bonus of distancing you from the holiday hustle. That\u2019s something practical they\u2019re bound to keep or actually give out to someone, to promote their own brand. Depending on what it is, you could add a tiny logo somewhere (\u201cdesigned by\u201d) or just keep the credit within the attached note and let the sentiment of the gesture speak for itself.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "share facebook facebook facebook facebook end-of-year marketing", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:03.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "123fa6884d8812ee167c6bd714b95d774e40a72d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQY.gRDA6k9Whd54VYTLwvaGJAu0JAUf7S2RMwKUJ55szuEFTnpOgmhVtXhFzQSrRraWPtV13mKDRDJVh2wcCtzBYel8QXxWC6RTWEoXQLW6GcPuPj3rRttkGiw4umOZ37xXU2pBPGjOeGTfnzMMkphyCTdsyeHzA-", "site_full": "www.itsecuritynews.info", "site": "itsecuritynews.info", "site_section": "https://www.itsecuritynews.info", "site_categories": ["hacking", "tech"], "section_title": "IT Security News", "title": "Apple\u2019s Best of the App Store in 2017: Calm, Splitter Critters, Affinity Photo and The Witness", "title_full": "Apple\u2019s Best of the App Store in 2017: Calm, Splitter Critters, Affinity Photo and The Witness", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "123fa6884d8812ee167c6bd714b95d774e40a72d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQY.gRDA6k9Whd54VYTLwvaGJAu0JAUf7S2RMwKUJ55szuEFTnpOgmhVtXhFzQSrRraWPtV13mKDRDJVh2wcCtzBYel8QXxWC6RTWEoXQLW6GcPuPj3rRttkGiw4umOZ37xXU2pBPGjOeGTfnzMMkphyCTdsyeHzA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ITSecurityNews", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Apple\u2019s Best of the App Store in 2017: Calm, Splitter Critters, Affinity Photo and The Witness", "text": "Apple today published its annual Best of 2017 charts for the App Store, iTunes Store, and iBooks Store, highlighting the top media content and trends across 2017.\nApple\u2019s App Store editors chose two standout games and two standout apps for the iPhone and the iPad as their best of 2017 picks.

Unfortunately the answer is true likely yes. The Hill has combed through the SEC\u2019s internal evaluations, and it\u2019s now clear that the Commission had been warned about digital security issues for years. An inspector general audit warned about \u201cweaknesses\u201d in the SEC\u2019s security measures back in 2013, and multiple warnings appear to have sometimes fallen on deaf ears. A June 2016 inspector general report stated the SEC hadn\u2019t \u201cfully addressed\u201d a few problems from previous audits, and was at \u201cincreased risk\u201d of intruders taking sensitive data. \nThat security was weak isn\u2019t completely shocking when a number of American authority agencies have fallen prey to hacks . Also, multiple authority agencies have to make do with aging computers and infrastructure that can\u2019t receive software updates outside of exceptional circumstances . The inspector general\u2019s office itself has struggled with both poor funding and a lack of clear goals. \nStill, the SEC had plenty of time to update its platforms and implement policies that weren\u2019t necessarily dependent on newer technology, such as thorough data encryption. The hack further illustrates a serious problem with authority cybersecurity in the US. If an agency as crucial as the SEC struggled to improve its security practices over the years, that suggests other important institutions further have a lot to learn about safeguarding critical data. \nSource of information: The Hill Related Posts: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:03.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e6ff30de5deb64dbdf15471f54e99dbf26d6a01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg87.oYIHpPSPBX2mpbg6scEqsDNy8FathiWq5Uq2i7VOmofLsZTFJh12ddJuyl9Dkbqd5QiXrtR4zip8bJ2LPlR", "site_full": "www.vrogue.co", "site": "vrogue.co", "site_section": "http://www.vrogue.co/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "VRogue", "title": "Exotic Brown Microfiber Couch And Loveseat", "title_full": "Exotic Brown Microfiber Couch And Loveseat", "published": "2017-12-07T14:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e6ff30de5deb64dbdf15471f54e99dbf26d6a01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg87.oYIHpPSPBX2mpbg6scEqsDNy8FathiWq5Uq2i7VOmofLsZTFJh12ddJuyl9Dkbqd5QiXrtR4zip8bJ2LPlR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rogue", "published": "2017-12-07T14:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Exotic Brown Microfiber Couch And Loveseat", "text": "exotic brown microfiber couch and loveseat furniture Thursday 07th, December 2017 12:58:14: PM \nBrown microfiber sofa loveseat sensations gray weekends only furniture mattress chocolate motion recliner.

It is the most amazing sensory experience! Every time I make cloud dough with my kids I have to jump in and play too. For Day 7 of our 23 Days of Christmas series we are playing with Christmas themed cloud dough! Today we have put together a list of 10 of our favorite Christmas cloud dough versions for you to try out! We've been having a blast checking these out! Cloud dough is one of those easy to make things that I keep on my 5 Things I Do (or wish I did) Every Day with my Toddler list . Our all time favorite cloud dough recipe is shared by Jackie at Happy Hooligans. It can be adapted to be taste-safe . Taste-safe cloud dough means that if your toddler eats it, it's not a huge deal. That being said, you don't want your toddler to be eating spoonfuls of the cloud dough. That WILL make them sick. Make sure you use coconut oil or vegetable or another alternative mentioned in these posts below versus baby oil, if you want your cloud dough to be taste-safe. As with all activities we share, this is an activity that needs to have adult supervision. Scroll down to read how we keep this activity semi-tidy... or at least try to. Here are 10 awesome cloud dough ideas that you should try this Christmas season! 1. P E P P E R M I N T C L O U D D O U G H This peppermint scented cloud dough shared by Growing a Jeweled Rose is so colorful and smells amazing! Anything that smells like peppermint is a win in my book. 2. S P A R K L Y S N O W C L O U D D O U G H Where we live in Northern California we are always wishing for snow and never getting it! This snow-like cloud dough sensory experience shared by Nurturestore (with SPARKLES) lets kids make snowmen without the cold. We love it! 3. C A N D Y C A N E C L O U D D O U G H Candy Cane cloud dough shared by Growning a Jeweled Rose is especially fun because of the bright contrasting colors. Adding in the actual candy canes might put it over the edge from being cool to amazing. You might want to try some fake candy canes with littles who still try and eat everything... since although the cloud dough is taste-safe, you don't want kids to be eating it by the bucket loads. 3. H O T C H O C O L A T E C L O U D D O U G H Hot chocolate cloud dough shared by Sugar, Spice & Glitter MUST be pulled out when you watch the Polar Express! Filling up cups with cloud dough and doing your own pretend play with hot cocoa is so fun! 4. 1 {H E A R T} C H R I S T M A S C L O U D D O U G H Meri Cherry's I love Christmas cloud dough is so colorful and light and fluffy! Her magic secret ingredient to make her cloud dough festive is so simple and easy! I wish I had thought of it! 5. C H R I S T M A S S M E L L S C L O U D D O U G H There are certain smells you associate with Christmas and several of them can be found in Lalymom's Christmas Smells cloud dough ! Apple pie, cocoa, and candy cane are always yummy smells to play and explore with. 6. G I N G E R B R E A D C L O U D D O U G H Since it is Gingerbread Week for our Virtual Book Club for Kids, we tried this gingerbread cloud dough version from Sugar, Spice and Glitter yesterday and my kiddos loved it! We made the gingerbread men run around as fast as they could through the cloud dough. 7. P E P P E R M I N T C L O U D D O U G H Frogs, Snails and Puppy Dog Tails also created a fun and sparkly peppermint cloud dough version that is on our list to try out. I love the sequins that are added in! Sparkles make everything extra Christmasy. 8. F I Z Z Y C L O U D D O U G H Powerful Mothering moved from just playing with cloud dough to experimenting with it! We are excited to make some Fizzy Christmas cloud dough ! We'll probably make ours red or green instead of purple. 9. C H R I S T M A S C O O K I E C L O U D D O U G H I'm a fan of anything that mentions the word \"cookie.\" Christmas cookie cloud dough shared by Little Bins for Little Hands mixes in some yummy cookie scents to make this sensory experience one that is fun for the nose and fingers. 10. P E P P E R M I N T C O C O A C L O U D D O U G H Peppermint and cocoa are separately two of our favorites things, but together they make a power couple. Teaching Mama adds both scents to her Peppermint Cocoa Cloud Dough to make a delicious smelling sensory experience for kids. K E E P I N G T H I N G S T I D Y Cloud dough can be messy. We like to play with it outside to help keep the mess out of our house. When it is cold or rainy, we use a big plastic tablecloth and lay it out in our kitchen. It is perfect because it covers the floor and when we are done we can roll it up and shake it out in the outside trash and move on to the next thing. When kids play with cloud dough, we always review the rules about keeping the cloud dough in the bucket. Kids sometimes try throwing the dough and making a mess, so I usually reiterate the rules/expectations, and then if the kids still can't follow them, we're done with the activity. Although I like to let kids explore materials, I don't want them wasting or ruining play materials. Enforcing expectations (even for my littlest ones) and using the big plastic sheet really help me mellow out a bit and not worry too much about the mess. It cleans up really easily with a broom or napkin.

About Graphics Drivers: While installing the graphics driver allows the system to properly recognize the chipset and the card manufacturer, updating the video driver can bring about various changes. It can improve the overall graphics experience and performance in either games or various engineering software applications, include support for newly developed technologies, add compatibility with newer GPU chipsets, or resolve different problems that might have been encountered. When it comes to applying this release, the installation steps should be a breeze, as each manufacturer tries to make them as easy as possible so that each user can update the GPU on their own and with minimum risks (however, check to see if this download supports your graphics chipset). Therefore, get the package (extract it if necessary), run the setup, follow the on-screen instructions for a complete and successful installation, and make sure you reboot the system so that the changes take effect. That being said, download the driver, apply it on your system, and enjoy your newly updated graphics card.

About OS Independent BIOS: Although installing a newer BIOS version might add new features, update various components, or improve the device's usability, this process is very risky, so the upgrade is recommended to be performed only when it is really needed. In addition to that, this task should be performed by someone who has the knowledge to successfully complete the installation; regular users may fulfill it at their own risk. When it comes to applying a new version without taking into account the computer's operating system, the most commonly used method to flash the BIOS is by creating a bootable USB or CD containing the update file, and running it from DOS. Still, regardless of the method used or whether the upgrade is performed by a regular or power user, it's recommended that the new BIOS be applied in a steady power environment such as the one ensured by a UPS unit. The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is a very important software that loads the currently installed OS, and tests all of the system's hardware components \u2013 so make sure you flash it correctly. Bear in mind that failing to perform a successful installation could seriously damage your device, and the faulty BIOS resulted from the process might even render it unusable. So, if this release includes useful changes, hit the download button, get the package, and update your BIOS version.

There\u2019s nothing to it,\u201d said White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah, according to The Los Angeles Times. \nBefore assuming the presidency, Trump touted his health and questioned Hillary Clinton\u2019s fitness during the campaign trail, going as far as suggesting that she lacked the \u201cstamina\u201d for the job. \nMore: Will Trump\u2019s exercise and eating habits catch up to him as stress mounts? \nRelated: Trump declares Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, breaking with decades of U.S. foreign policy \nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2AgVI2l", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raj shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "god", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mia farrow", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "los angeles times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:04.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd8088056e359bdfb83313882295d54ae3a0e415", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYBXhkF0p0kPmyFrLPKLX7tb", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": ">nah dude there won't be a correction lol we've al", "title_full": "/biz/ - >nah dude there won't be a correction lol we've al - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T08:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 148, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cbf5b9528a154acdb369888605f06eaaf4184fe7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYBXhkF0p0kPmzc5PxMTVB4LOFAxBby8gxo-", "ord_in_thread": 116, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>4842639\nWe will be in lambobugattiville some day soon brah.

About OS Independent BIOS: Although installing a newer BIOS version might add new features, update various components, or improve the device's usability, this process is very risky, so the upgrade is recommended to be performed only when it is really needed. In addition to that, this task should be performed by someone who has the knowledge to successfully complete the installation; regular users may fulfill it at their own risk. When it comes to applying a new version without taking into account the computer's operating system, the most commonly used method to flash the BIOS is by creating a bootable USB or CD containing the update file, and running it from DOS. Still, regardless of the method used or whether the upgrade is performed by a regular or power user, it's recommended that the new BIOS be applied in a steady power environment such as the one ensured by a UPS unit. The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is a very important software that loads the currently installed OS, and tests all of the system's hardware components \u2013 so make sure you flash it correctly. Bear in mind that failing to perform a successful installation could seriously damage your device, and the faulty BIOS resulted from the process might even render it unusable. So, if this release includes useful changes, hit the download button, get the package, and update your BIOS version. Otherwise, check with our website as often as possible, so that you don't miss the release that you need.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "toshiba", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "toshiba satellite", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "efi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ups", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:04.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aee64115cff685d27744feb2d058846eeb4db265", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMopbZsP2F.BPzPPlhmSPo0PH1i2RqiyDupAifct8KgvJGBgLyJOZzvLnN85bfcJb0DglKGCuX6bH5ePCYtrbM.D73WlQY1xUPg-", "site_full": "trueviralnews.com", "site": "trueviralnews.com", "site_section": "http://trueviralnews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "True Viral News", "title": "Google is killing Chrome Apps for desktops, for good", "title_full": "Google is killing Chrome Apps for desktops, for good", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aee64115cff685d27744feb2d058846eeb4db265", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMopbZsP2F.BPzPPlhmSPo0PH1i2RqiyDupAifct8KgvJGBgLyJOZzvLnN85bfcJb0DglKGCuX6bH5ePCYtrbM.D73WlQY1xUPg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TVN stuff", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google is killing Chrome Apps for desktops, for good", "text": "Google is killing Chrome Apps for desktops, for good 07.12.2017 tweet \nGoogle is officially done with Chrome Apps for desktops: it\u2019s now removed the Apps section from the Chrome Web Store, leaving only Extensions and Themes available for you to customize your browser with from here on out. \nThe company explained its intention to do away with apps a year ago, and as we noted back in August when it officially announced its plans, only about 1 percent of Windows, macOS and Linux users actually used Apps, so they\u2019ve gotta go. However, Apps will still be available on Chrome OS-powered devices, like Chromebooks, and they\u2019re accessible via direct links to their Chrome Web Store pages. \nIf you\u2019re wondering whether you\u2019ll miss out on much, don\u2019t worry: as Ars Technica noted, many Apps were essentially little more than bookmarks for webpages, with the added benefit of being able to access them from various parts of Chrome\u2019s interface. Some packaged apps were able to take advantage of USB-connected hardware, but if Google\u2019s figures are right, it seems like not many people cared for them. \nThey\u2019ll be replaced by mid-2018 by the introduction of Progressive Web Apps for desktops. You might have already seen some of these on your mobile device: they\u2019re sites that get a full-screen immersive interface, push notifications, and an icon on your home screen. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if people care to adopt these once they\u2019re widely available.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

About OS Independent BIOS: Although installing a newer BIOS version might add new features, update various components, or improve the device's usability, this process is very risky, so the upgrade is recommended to be performed only when it is really needed. In addition to that, this task should be performed by someone who has the knowledge to successfully complete the installation; regular users may fulfill it at their own risk. When it comes to applying a new version without taking into account the computer's operating system, the most commonly used method to flash the BIOS is by creating a bootable USB or CD containing the update file, and running it from DOS. Still, regardless of the method used or whether the upgrade is performed by a regular or power user, it's recommended that the new BIOS be applied in a steady power environment such as the one ensured by a UPS unit. The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is a very important software that loads the currently installed OS, and tests all of the system's hardware components \u2013 so make sure you flash it correctly. Bear in mind that failing to perform a successful installation could seriously damage your device, and the faulty BIOS resulted from the process might even render it unusable.

The House version gives a relatively lower increase for units registered under the CARS program when compared to the Senate version, he said.\nThe CARS program, which stands for Comprehensive Automotive Resurgence Strategy, provides perks to participating car companies to produce 200,000 units within six years. It has two registered participants, market leaders Toyota Motor Philippines Corp. (TMP) and Mitsubishi Motors Philippines Corp. (MMPC). ADVERTISEMENT\n\u201c[The Senate bill] might impact the volume that would have been sold. The volume expected to be sold if it were [pct] increase would change when the tax rate becomes 10 percent,\u201d Lopez said in a mix of English and Filipino.\n\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s the manufacturing activity you are creating. If they are successful, that means the manufacturing activity would grow, creating more jobs and more local content. If the increase is super big, it would be a slowdown. That\u2019s why our wish is closer to the House version,\u201d he said.\nUnder House Bill No. 5636, different increases were pinned for different price brackets as higher rates are imposed on more expensive cars.\nFor example, the lowest bracket, which covers cars with a net manufacturing price of up to P600,000, would be imposed a three-percent excise tax rate for the first year of implementation, then four percent in the next year.\nSenate Bill No. 1592 simplifies this, offering only two excise tax rates: 10 percent for those priced up to P1 million, and 20 percent for those that exceed that amount. For most of the price brackets, the Senate bill offers lower increases in excise tax. It even offered lower increases for more expensive cars, such as those in the luxury market, which would have had an excise tax of 90 percent to 120 percent in the House bill.\n\u201cInitially, my answer there assuming we have the Senate version is that I\u2019m for the House version. That\u2019s because there is less increase in the House bill and that\u2019s where the prices of the cars under the CARS program are,\u201d Lopez said.\nThis, he said, is under the assumption that he has a choice between the two. However, if the rates in the Senate bill prevail in the bicameral conference, he said he \u201ccan still live with that.\u201d\nMitsubishi and Toyota officials have not yet reached out to him, he said. ADVERTISEMENT\nBoth TMP and MMPC joined the program during the last stretch of the Aquino administration, prior to talks of excise taxes being raised under a new tax regime. Now, the models the companies registered under the CARS program \u2014 TMP\u2019s Vios and MMPC\u2019s Mirage \u2014 would be subject to an increase in car taxes, just like every other car brand. The difference now, however, is the extent of the increase.\nAs of this writing, representatives of both car companies did not provide, upon request, the net manufacturing price for their respective CARS-registered models. For both chambers of congress, the excise tax rate would depend on the net manufacturing price.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "duterte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lopez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramon lopez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trade and industry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toyota motor philippines corp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toyota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tmp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mmpc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitsubishi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comprehensive automotive resurgence strategy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitsubishi motors philippines corp.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:04.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd8088056e359bdfb83313882295d54ae3a0e415", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYBXhkF0p0kPmyFrLPKLX7tb", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": ">nah dude there won't be a correction lol we've al", "title_full": "/biz/ - >nah dude there won't be a correction lol we've al - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T08:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 148, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d4ccd087a3e61752de6242a012d8daa9d94e61e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYBXhkF0p0kPmzc5PxMTVB4L5_wpOEpbtvk-", "ord_in_thread": 113, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>4842574\nIt is unreal.

It was simply an idea that came into my mind one day. \nHere\u2019s how it works:\nI send a message to the host before I make a booking. \nYes, I write the host a message, and as you\u2019ll see below, there\u2019s a good reason for it. \nFirst, while Airbnb does try to keep the blue \u201c Contact host \u201d button quite hidden, it does exist and is usually right there on each listing page, just under the property description.\nSo all I do is click that \u201c Contact host \u201d link and write my message.\nIn my message, I simply ask for a discount . This really does work and it works even better if your arrival date is less than a month away. Why? At this point, the host will naturally be more motivated to rent out their place for fear of not renting it at all during that period of time. \nWith that said, this little Airbnb discount trick still tends to work no matter how far in advance you are making your booking, which is why you should always give it a try.\nWhat I typically do is come up with an amount that I want to pay for my stay and I write something such as, \u201c I see your apartment is listed at $500 for two weeks. If you could make that $400 I\u2019d book it right now. \u201d \nAnd then I also provide some details about myself so that the host feels more confident in me as a renter. I\u2019ll include something like \u201c we\u2019re clean, laid-back, we work from home and we don\u2019t party or cause any issues. \u201d\nBasically, the idea is to explain to the host that they don\u2019t have to worry at all about you or their apartment/house, making the deal even better for them. \nIn addition, I\u2019ll also try to use some of the local language as it shows some respect to the host and lets them know that you are an experienced traveler.\nAn overall message might look like this:\n\u2014\n\u201cDobry den Eva,\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. We\u2019re coming to Prague from September 10th \u2013 20th and your apartment really caught our attention. I noticed the price for 10 days is $410 USD. If you could offer us the place for around $330 USD, we\u2019d book it right now. We\u2019re laid-back, we\u2019ll definitely keep the apartment very clean, we actually both work on our laptops from home most mornings and then we like to just wander around the city in the afternoons. We\u2019re not party people and we\u2019ll always respect all the rules of your place. Let me know when you can and we look forward to hopefully staying at your beautiful apartment!\nRegards,\nDerek\u201d\n\u2014\nWhat happens next is that I\u2019ll usually receive a reply from the host followed by a \u201c Special Offer \u201d email from Airbnb. These emails come in when a host has changed the listed price and is offering you a stay at a discounted rate.\n\nI just went through my last six Airbnb stays ( Gran Canaria , Prague, Dubrovnik, Kotor, Athens and Mauritius ). Sure enough, a discount was received on all of them. The smallest discount was 6% and the largest was 25%. \nAnd it all happened by sending one quick email to the host. That one message creates a human connection which is something that a normal Airbnb booking, or any accommodation booking, lacks if you just book it right away. \nWhen we make a personal connection, everyone involved tends to worry less and feel more confident in whatever we are trying to do. In this case, a host will feel more inclined to give a discount and trust their incoming guests if those guests reach out and give a good first impression.\nAt least that\u2019s how it\u2019s worked for me!\nFor those wanting to give this Airbnb discount trick a try, here\u2019s an Airbnb link that will also give you up to $40 off your next booking. \nHave you ever tried the above? Any success? Any other Airbnb discount tricks to share? \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "derek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airbnb", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gran canaria", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kotor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airbnb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubrovnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mauritius", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:04.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6ef4ef69daa4ba6e1dacceece4f7846f8281aff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMopbZsP2F.BPzPPlhmSPo0PbOuXKIonGViLYkSVIhp8j.vj7XfuTusnWEhoetwWCDh91x_GROmW8puBA0H0t5HymGAfS3PNJf3Bvemg5bmJ70T7T8a.uV5ywkT9kw920YeW8go8xyWtmA--", "site_full": "trueviralnews.com", "site": "trueviralnews.com", "site_section": "http://trueviralnews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "True Viral News", "title": "Florida police say mass shooting by Filipino at mosque thwarted \u2013 INQUIRER.net USA", "title_full": "Florida police say mass shooting by Filipino at mosque thwarted \u2013 INQUIRER.net USA", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6ef4ef69daa4ba6e1dacceece4f7846f8281aff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMopbZsP2F.BPzPPlhmSPo0PbOuXKIonGViLYkSVIhp8j.vj7XfuTusnWEhoetwWCDh91x_GROmW8puBA0H0t5HymGAfS3PNJf3Bvemg5bmJ70T7T8a.uV5ywkT9kw920YeW8go8xyWtmA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TVN stuff", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Florida police say mass shooting by Filipino at mosque thwarted \u2013 INQUIRER.net USA", "text": "Florida police say mass shooting by Filipino at mosque thwarted \u2013 INQUIRER.net USA 07.12.2017 tweet \nJACKSONVILLE, Florida \u2013 Law enforcement authorities said they prevented a mass shooting at a Jacksonville mosque and arrested a 69-year-old Filipino immigrant who allegedly hated Muslims. \nPolice charged Bernandino Gawala Bolatete with having a silencer not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record but obtained from an undercover officer. The silencer was sold December 1 in the parking lot of Academy Sports and Outdoors at 11901 Atlantic Blvd. \nBolatete, a green card holder, was arrested at his home and faces up to 10 years in federal prison if he is convicted on the weapons charge. \n. \nThe investigation started in October when the Sheriff\u2019s Office received a tip that Bolatete \u201cexpressed a hatred for Muslims and made a specific threat to \u2018shoot up\u2019 a mosque,\u201d according to the complaint. \nThe undercover officer recorded conversations with Bolatete on Nov. 10, Nov. 14, Nov. 20 and Nov. 24 and provided them to the FBI as evidence, according to the complaint, according to Jacksonville.com . \n\u201cIf I ever decide to do that I\u2019m not thinking of getting caught,\u201d Bolatete said, according to the transcript. \u201cI\u2019ll \u2026 I\u2019ll die there in that area. [laughter] They\u2019ll be some sort of suicide thing \u2026 suicide by police?\u201d \nHe apparently has only one kidney left and it was no longer functioning fully. Police said this meant that Bolatete did not expect to survive the intended mass shooting. \nThe complaint stated that Bolatete had practiced shooting with the undercover officer at a gun range. They also drove by the Islamic Center and he pointed out to the officer the tower from which the mass shooting could be done. He told the officer he had five guns, including an AR-15 that could be converted to an AR-47. He also said Muslims attended the mosque on Fridays, so that would likely be the day of the attack. \nThe Sheriff\u2019s Office worked with the FBI, Florida Department of Law Enforcement and other agencies throughout the investigation. \nSubscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70+ titles, share up to 5 gadgets, listen to the news, download as early as 4am & share articles on social media.

Fonacier attributed the further decline in the GIR from $80.419 billion in October mostly to \u201coutflows arising from payments made by the national government for its maturing foreign exchange obligations as well as revaluation adjustments on the gold holdings of the BSP resulting from the decrease in the price of gold in the international market.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT\nThe peso remained at the 51:$1 level in November.\nThe drop in GIR was nonetheless \u201cpartially offset by the net foreign currency deposits of the national government and income from the BSP\u2019s investments abroad,\u201d Fonacier said.\nThe end-November GIR can cover 8.4 months\u2019 worth of imports of goods as well as payments of primary income and services.\nAlso, the dollar reserves level as of November were equivalent to 5.4 times the short-term external debt based on original maturity, as well as 3.7 times based on residual maturity.\nThe BSP defines short-term debt based on residual maturity as outstanding foreign debt whose original maturity was a year or less, plus principal payments on medium- and long-term loans of the government as well as the private sector that are due within the next 12 months.\nAs for net international reserves, or the difference between the GIR and total short-term liabilities, these also declined to $80.3 billion in November from October\u2019s $80.4 billion.\nThe BSP had projected dollar reserves to slightly decrease to $80.5 billion by end-2017, equivalent to 8.3 months of import cover, from end-2016\u2019s $80.7 billion.\nADVERTISEMENT Subscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70+ titles, share up to 5 gadgets, listen to the news, download as early as 4am & share articles on social media.

About OS Independent BIOS: Although installing a newer BIOS version might add new features, update various components, or improve the device's usability, this process is very risky, so the upgrade is recommended to be performed only when it is really needed. In addition to that, this task should be performed by someone who has the knowledge to successfully complete the installation; regular users may fulfill it at their own risk. When it comes to applying a new version without taking into account the computer's operating system, the most commonly used method to flash the BIOS is by creating a bootable USB or CD containing the update file, and running it from DOS. Still, regardless of the method used or whether the upgrade is performed by a regular or power user, it's recommended that the new BIOS be applied in a steady power environment such as the one ensured by a UPS unit. The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is a very important software that loads the currently installed OS, and tests all of the system's hardware components \u2013 so make sure you flash it correctly.

The main accused had someone film the killing and share it on social media with a stern warning. On Thursday, police arrested Shambhulal Regar, the main accused in the case. At Afrazul\u2019s home in Saiyadpur, over 325 kms from Kolkata, relatives have gathered in mourning soon after they received a call from the Rajasthan Police. \n\u201cWe want those who killed my husband so brutally and showed it to the world be hanged. I want Insaaf (justice). He was only killed because he was a Muslim. Yesterday, at around 3 pm, we received a call from Rajasthan Police and were told that my husband has been murdered,\u201d said Gul Bahar Bibi, speaking to The Indian Express over the phone. \n\u201cWe even spoke to him on Tuesday. He calls us everyday. We do not know what love jihad is. He has grandchildren. They butchered my father like animals before setting him on fire. I want those who did that to suffer in the same manner. I have seen the video and the cries of my helpless father while he was being killed,\u201d said Rejina Khatun daughter of the victim. \nAfrazul, father of three girls was scheduled to get back home later this month to arrange for the wedding of his youngest daughter. According to family members, for the past 12 years, Afrazul has been working as an unskilled labourer in Rajasthan. Every two months he returns home. He has a small plot of land which is not enough to fend for his family. \n\u201cThere is a conspiracy and big people are involved. What can a labourer do? The manner in which the crime is highlighted on social media shows that there is a deep conspiracy and big people are involved. We have relatives in Rajasthan who are at the police station now,\u201d said Zeenat Khan, the Afrazul\u2019s niece. \nAfter the news broke, villagers poured into the home of the victim, waiting for the body to be brought back so that the final rites can be completed. Many are in disbelief. They say they Afrazul they knew was a god-fearing man. \n\u201cI have known him for years. There is no bad record in his name here. He was a gentleman and a god-fearing person,\u201d said Jewel Choudhury, the victim\u2019s neighbor. Another neighbour, Ibrahim Sheikh expressed concern about the future of his children. \u201cNow who will run the family. His youngest daughter studies in class ten. He is the only earning member of the family and very poor,\u201d he said. \nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shambhulal regar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zeenat khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jewel choudhury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibrahim sheikh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rejina khatun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afrazul khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afrazul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "insaaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gul bahar bibi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rajasthan police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rajasthan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bengal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afrazul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolkata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saiyadpur", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:04.034+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "29602d2adda4b391de4dc37ac31bae7ac2e70338", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspatEWvF9gXhTdM1w_kURGtHIjJvdJHTfzEp4mFA.2wz2.9GYBdHpPEGiHHu8q_Xm1XqHA_yQLQHVJTSKXc3niMgu2VwzT6JQYk", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/Washington-Hoteis.d178318.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Washington: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Grand Hyatt Washington:", "title_full": "Grand Hyatt Washington: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-11-21T00:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.354, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d887e8bec939539d1d407ae27a7bf783b3fbbba8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspatEWvF9gXhTdM1w_kURGtHIjJvdJHTfzEp4mFA.2wz2.9GYBdHpPEGiHHu8q_Xm1XqHA_yQLQHVJTSKXc3niMghAXTInnWYw6vxa_97.8jyR19t6s5oXQePmR9WOrIlkQ", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-04T19:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Nice hotel but noisy taxi rank outside during the night !", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 4.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:05.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a1d30742b09066d20384825108cf23acc38abc2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wuM0lGBJFLORNqcVNOaZawt11dU3Y3JJFl0EiS6RBrqkvpjrVk4PF", "site_full": "whitewolf.wikia.com", "site": "wikia.com", "site_section": "http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?feed=atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "White Wolf  - Recent changes [en]", "title": "Douglas Bender", "title_full": "Douglas Bender", "published": "2017-12-07T05:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/whitewolf/images/6/6c/Doug_Bender.png/revision/latest?cb=20171207035629", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 114, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a1d30742b09066d20384825108cf23acc38abc2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wuM0lGBJFLORNqcVNOaZawt11dU3Y3JJFl0EiS6RBrqkvpjrVk4PF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bro David", "published": "2017-12-07T05:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "Douglas Bender", "text": "[[File:Doug Bender.png|thumb|283x283px]] Doug grew up working with spare parts and junk cars behind his father's auto body shop.

The Premier League holders drew 1-1 against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League in midweek, and Antonio Conte will want a much-better performance as the Blues missed a few clear-cut chances to put the game to bed. Formation: 3-5-1-1 Lineup: Thibaut Courtois has been ever-present for the Blues in this season's Premier League, and he can be backed to start regardless of Conte's rotation policy. In central defence, Gary Cahill could return to the bench to allow Antonio Rudiger form a three-man partnership alongside Cesar Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen . Victor Moses has started the last two games on the trot in the right wing-back position, and Conte may well persist with the Nigerian as he looks back to have achieved full fitness. Marco Alonso was replaced Davide Zappacosta in the midweek game, but we should see the Spaniard return to the lineup for the London derby scheduled for an early kick-off. Onto the midfield, Tiemoue Bakayoko could be the one benched with Danny Drinkwater likely to return to the mix. The Englishman will partner former Leicester teammate N'Golo Kante and Cesc Fabregas in a three-man midfield. Further forward, Eden Hazard could feature against the Hammers with a view to potentially resting him for the Huddersfield game on Tuesday night. The Belgian is likely to play just behind Alvaro Morata , who is the undisputed choice to lead the line ahead of Michy Batshuayi this term.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drinkwater", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marco alonso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andreas christensen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tiemoue bakayoko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sri aswin how chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alvaro morata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thibaut courtois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cesar azpilicueta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davide zappacosta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio rudiger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary cahill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n'golo kante", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michy batshuayi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio conte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cesc fabregas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny drinkwater", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victor moses", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "west ham united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huddersfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premier league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leicester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atletico madrid", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west ham united chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:05.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "29602d2adda4b391de4dc37ac31bae7ac2e70338", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspatEWvF9gXhTdM1w_kURGtHIjJvdJHTfzEp4mFA.2wz2.9GYBdHpPEGiHHu8q_Xm1XqHA_yQLQHVJTSKXc3niMgu2VwzT6JQYk", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/Washington-Hoteis.d178318.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Washington: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Grand Hyatt Washington:", "title_full": "Grand Hyatt Washington: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-11-21T00:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.354, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "226ecc9cc1d2632a7856db4b6daf97b9cebeb09f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspatEWvF9gXhTdM1w_kURGtHIjJvdJHTfzEp4mFA.2wz2.9GYBdHpPEGiHHu8q_Xm1XqHA_yQLQHVJTSKXc3niMglF_Aep5XQF7Z3p8Q23JHiVtmRhqXtIpBdfv4namwBrI", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-29T11:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The Grand Hyatt is a gracious hotel within walking distance of The National Mall.
