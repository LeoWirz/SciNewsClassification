Here is how they differ 10 offer letters for IIT-Madras students in 1st placement round today Samsung Pay has over 2.5-mn users in India: Company official \nSamsung India plans to hire 1,000 graduates from top engineering colleges across the country in 2018 with over 300 of them coming in from various IITs, a top company official said. A majority of these engineers are expected to be hired for new-age domains like artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), biometrics, natural language processing, augmented reality and networks including 5G. Apart from IITs, Samsung will also be hiring talent from premier institutes like Delhi College of Engineering, BITS Pilani, Manipal Institute of Technology and IIITs among others.\" Samsung is extremely bullish on R&D in India. We have been here for over 22 years. The three R&D centres in India work on several cutting-edge technologies,\" Samsung Global SVP and MD of Samsung R&D Institute India, Bengaluru, Dipesh Shah told PTI. He added that the India centres not only work on innovation for Indian consumers but also contribute to global products. Some of the India-centric features developed by the local teams include S-bike mode and Ultra Data Saving mode for smartphones and ActivWash+ for washing machines.\" Samsung R&D centres in India have worked on several global products of Samsung, including the high-end camera modules for flagship smartphones, intelligent interface Bixby that was launched with Galaxy S8 and Samsung Pay,\" Shah said. Last year, the Korean company had hired 800 engineers for its R&D facilities, out of which 300 were from IITs. Samsung has three R&D centres in India at Bengaluru (the largest outside Korea), Noida and Delhi. Globally, it has a total of 32 R&D centres. While the Bengaluru centre has expertise in areas like AI, ML and IoT, the Noida facility plays a key role in the development of biometrics, mobile software development, multimedia and data security. The Delhi centre works primarily on research related to high-end televisions, other consumer electronics products as well as Samsung's operating system, Tizen.   15:14 IST", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bengaluru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dipesh shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bixby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tizen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "iits business standard samsung india", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "samsung india", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "delhi college of engineering", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung r&d institute india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manipal institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ultra data saving", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung global svp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengaluru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:21.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68463d98613e1831fe5306ab337b39d8da8cadaf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbfF1nnpthfNXD2872INSPrEW2vzFzerg7tbLbJOJwDieXaCvlzTQKc1oqJdgU9.S3IEyGH5v5iHrLh0fjhfj8W0aSuqS3Kn45CAjrvDMs1b_", "site_full": "www.expedia.no", "site": "expedia.no", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.no/Doraville-Hoteller.d7890.Reise-Guide-Hoteller", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hotell Doraville | 581 billige hoteller i Doraville p\u00e5 Expedia.no", "title": "The Westin Buckhead", "title_full": "The Westin Buckhead Atlanta (Atlanta, United States) | Expedia.no", "published": "2017-08-20T13:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a81a9db6b48690a24a3bed7173d53b14f12b6d3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbfF1nnpthfNXD2872INSPrEW2vzFzerg7tbLbJOJwDieXaCvlzTQKc1oqJdgU9.S3IEyGH5v5iHrLh0fjhfj8W0aSuqS3Kn45LcdFfjCcnRuAHavGK6AzMl6PPeX5h3elVKJ0KZBxMdE", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-24T22:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Dishes were not clean in the club lounge.

Fuscaldo December 6, 2017 \u2014 2:20 PM EST Bitcoin futures are coming thanks to CME Group ( CME ) and Cboe Global Markets, with a handful of online brokerage s including Ally Invest and TradeStation ready to offer the futures to their clients on day one. While cryptocurrency is confusing, volatile and unregulated \u2013 raising the ire of all sorts of regulators around the globe \u2013 it is also hugely popular with investors. \nFor Rich Hagen, president of Ally Financial Inc.'s ( ALLY ) online brokerage Ally Invest, Bitcoin futures offered by CME may be the ideal investment vehicle for investors who are curious about cryptocurrency but aren't so sure how to play the market. \"What's interesting about Bitcoin futures is that you'll have the ability to take both sides of Bitcoin \u2013 it's a two-sided market, you can go long or you can go short,\" Hagen said in an interview with Bank Innovation. He said that offering CME's Bitcoin futures on Dec. 18 when they become available is all about giving investors choice. \n[Ally Invest offers powerful charting tools and $4.95 trades. Read Investopedia's Ally Invest review to learn more about this low-cost broker.] \nLate last week, the CME and Cboe Global Markets got the green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to list their futures. The futures are set to launch on Dec. 18. The CBOE said it will have a timing announcement on its product soon. Both companies have acknowledged that they have to create a way to handle the swings in Bitcoin's value. CME, for instance, will require an initial margin of 35% from investors to back the trades. \nAs Ally Invest and TradeStation plow ahead with offering the Bitcoin futures, Fidelity Investments isn't following suit, and Charles Schwab told Investopedia that it is taking a wait-and-see approach. \"We are monitoring this new market and evaluating our clients' interest levels and familiarity with cryptocurrencies, along with their dynamics and risks,\" said Schwab spokeswoman Kaitlyn Downing. \"We intend to study the new proposed bitcoin futures contracts and weigh their associated risks with an eye to protecting our clients' interests before we make these products available.\" \nMany investment firms are concerned about the volatility associated with cryptocurrency and the risks that come with investing in something that is unregulated. Bitcoin started the year trading around $1,000 and recently surpassed $11,000, underscoring its extreme volatility. Hagen said in the interview that, because the futures let you bet on its rise and its decline, it could decrease volatility. \nWhat's more, Hagen thinks CME's move brings more legitimacy to the digital currency marketplace that some big bank executives, namely JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s ( JPM ) Jamie Dimon, have railed against. \"I think it does [signal that shift],\" Hagen said about CME's entrance into the market bringing legitimacy to cryptocurrency. \"There's also an interest in Bitcoin ETFs \u2013 the ETF market will watch this closely to see how Bitcoin's volatility and performance is affected.\" Definitions", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donna fuscaldo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rich hagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles schwab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schwab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaitlyn downing", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cme group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe global markets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpmorgan chase & co.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fidelity investments", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "investopedia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ally financial inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank innovation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:23.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d547daab55d3f9977e9dbeff15ccb7f4dadb7678", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQsIH1q9vYgDvEHejlxTP3r.h_8gXN_G3inI5AJkOGzSudwQvd3ZIm3OAYfDAuMDShMfedYg2gBKzi0gR1gdJz8qtFS1_6lxRl_vn1hxNQErQ--", "site_full": "www.xconomy.com", "site": "xconomy.com", "site_section": "https://www.xconomy.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Xconomy San Francisco", "title": "The \u2018Amazon Effect\u2019 and the Gender Wage Gap", "title_full": "The \u2018Amazon Effect\u2019 and the Gender Wage Gap", "published": "2017-12-07T12:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51865, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d547daab55d3f9977e9dbeff15ccb7f4dadb7678", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQsIH1q9vYgDvEHejlxTP3r.h_8gXN_G3inI5AJkOGzSudwQvd3ZIm3OAYfDAuMDShMfedYg2gBKzi0gR1gdJz8qtFS1_6lxRl_vn1hxNQErQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adnan Mahmud", "published": "2017-12-07T12:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "The \u2018Amazon Effect\u2019 and the Gender Wage Gap", "text": "The \u2018Amazon Effect\u2019 and the Gender Wage Gap \nOpinion Reprints \nThe battle to land Amazon\u2019s second home is shaping up to be one of the fiercest competitions to lure a corporate headquarters in modern history. From serious incentives like massive tax breaks to headline grabbing stunts like offers of bear wrestling and giant cacti, it\u2019s safe to say cities are pulling out every stop imaginable to attract the online retailer. \nNearly 240 cities in all but 7 states nationwide have set forth the bids for Amazon\u2019s HQ2, and it\u2019s no wonder why. The online retail behemoth is planning to bring a $5 billion construction budget for its new headquarters to the chosen city, along with 50,000 jobs with average annual salaries exceeding $100,000, and that\u2019s just the start. Civic and business leaders making their pitch to Amazon need look no further than Seattle to see the additional benefits of attracting the company. Since 2007, the company has virtually transformed Seattle, investing in everything from local non-profits to new transportation initiatives to sustainable energy. According to Amazon, more than 53,000 additional jobs have been created in the city as a result of the company\u2019s direct investments. \nAmazon\u2019s new \u201chome away from home\u201d\u2014wherever that may be\u2014will also likely laud the company\u2019s efforts to bridge the gender pay gap. Despite rollbacks of Obama era regulations like the Equal Pay Pledge , the company has publicly boasted a nearly equal pay for men and women who hold the same jobs. However, data we analyzed at LiveStories suggests that Amazon alone\u2014even with its size and commendable commitment to wage equality\u2014would not close the gender wage gap in many American cities. \nThe pay \u201ccanyon\u201d: Highly educated women fall way behind in Seattle \nAs is the story nationally, women in Seattle trail their male counterparts in pay across the board. A recent report we produced on the city finds a much deeper disparity in positions that require more training and skills: Women who hold a graduate or professional degree\u2014the education typically required for a tech or specialized job at Amazon\u2014 make just 68 cents for each dollar earned by men. What\u2019s worse, the wage gap widened between 2010 and 2015, meaning despite Amazon\u2019s laudable efforts internally and its rapid growth in the city during that period, the \u201cAmazon effect\u201d hasn\u2019t been seen in the larger community. \nThis is worrisome. Cities of similar size\u2014including Baltimore, Boston, Denver, and Nashville\u2014do not exhibit this pattern, and in fact have near parity in pay for men and women with more advanced education. \nCities that stand to gain the most in tech pay \nDespite Seattle\u2019s struggles with the pay gap for those with advanced degrees, there\u2019s no argument that Amazon\u2019s workforce pay parity will have at least some benefit to the chosen city for HQ2. \nIn a breakdown of income data by LiveStories for computer science and mathematics jobs in seven major cities between 2011 and 2015, we found that Atlanta and New York are fared the worst when it comes to the wage gap. In Atlanta, highly educated women in tech made 81 cents for each dollar earned by men. Chicago comes next last for large cities at 87 cents on the dollar, with Boston and Dallas tying at 88 cents on the dollar. \nIf Amazon is looking for a major city with a comparatively low gap in tech pay, Washington, D.C. is the place. Women in the District make 97 cents on the dollar. In Denver, it\u2019s 92 cents on the dollar. \nWill fairer economies prevail? \nWhile it remains to be seen what exactly will factor into Amazon\u2019s final decision, the company\u2019s request for proposals for HQ2 states a preference for \u201cthe presence and support for a diverse population.\u201d Considering the company needs a city with a talent pool of 50,000 workers across industries, economies that have historically provided more equal pay to women and men might have an advantage. While a diverse workforce entails more than equality for men and women in the workplace, cities that have made strides to close this gap are already ahead and poised to diversify further. \nAdditionally, Amazon has requested labor and rate information for jobs that will be created, and specifically called out a need for a city to prove its ability to attract software development engineers to the region. If a city or region doesn\u2019t currently have jobs that pay equally, it\u2019s a reasonable assumption that they\u2019re losing female talent to areas that offer women fairer rates\u2014a disadvantage for the HQ2 bid. \nWhile it\u2019s clear that Amazon\u2019s presence alone will not magically fix the wage gaps that exist nationwide. Even the influx of 50,000 jobs with more equal pay will not shift the statistics one way or the other, as Seattle\u2019s data shows. However, one would hope the company\u2019s internal goal toward gender pay parity ultimately influences the local economies of its headquarters cities.

China and Japan alternate in being the largest holders of US bonds, or Treasuries, with Ireland a distant third. That sale realises sufficient backing for the currency in circulation to increase through those infamous backroom keystrokes.\nIn a normal growth scenario, the wealth of the country increases (or \\\"inflation\\\") and so when those bonds mature there is enough value to buy them back and pay the interest due .\nThe problem comes if the creditor wants to sell early, or holds too many bonds maturing on the same date. There's an enormous interest payment to find, and there would be a drain on the debtor's currency just by removing that backing for its bond-backed created money. So if China was looking to destroy the US economy it would try to offload its Treasury bonds.\nThe second half of the equation I haven't yet got to grips with: what would such a sale do to China's economy and the value of its currency? If it divests itself of an investment in future growth, like any share, where does that gain \\\"go\\\"?\nCan anyone on CiF who understands more about international money help me?

The Redmi 5 is successor to the Redmi 4X which was unveiled back in February this year and then launched as Redmi 4 in India later on. Well, even though the Redmi 5 succeeds the Redmi 4, it has a design which differs a bit, especially the front. The first thing that you will notice after looking at the Xiaomi Redmi 5 is its bezel-less design. The Redmi 5 sports a 5.7-inch display having 1440 x 720 pixel resolution and an aspect ratio of 18:9. This makes it possible to cram in a larger display into the device while still being able to keep its overall footprint relatively lower. The screen also has rounded corners, and, the bezels at the top and bottom are also trimmed down. There also don\u2019t seem to be capacitive navigation keys present below the display, which means you will now have to make do with on-screen buttons \u2013 like the ones on the flagship Mi MIX 2 . The Xiaomi Redmi 5 is powered by Snapdragon 450 SoC which is paired with 2 or 3 GB RAM. The 2 GB RAM variant comes with 16 GB storage whereas the 3 GB RAM variant comes with 32 GB of storage.

Well, Qualcomm has now shared all the details about the Snapdragon 845 SoC that you would want to know. The Snapdragon 845 SoC is successor to the Snapdragon 835 SoC that\u2019s currently powering almost all the flagship Android smartphones available in the market. And, as one would expect, the Snapdragon 845 chip does come with some nice improvements and new features. The Snapdragon 845 SoC consists of eight Kryo 385 CPU that are clocked up to 2.8 GHz \u2013 four of which are performance cores and the remaining four being efficiency cores. And, like the Snapdragon 835 SoC, the Snapdragon 845 SoC is also based on the 10nm manufacturing process. The Snapdragon 845 SoC also comes along with Adreno 630 GPU which enables Room-Scale VR for mobile XR headsets with six degrees of freedom (6DoF) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). As compared to the 835, the 845 comes with 30% faster graphics, is 30% more efficient, and, users should also expect 25% performance uplift in gaming. With Snapdragon 845 SoC, Qualcomm has also focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI) which we should be expecting to hear more about next year. The Snapdragon 845 SoC comes with 3x improvements in overall AI performance over the previous generation, and, it now also comes with support for Tensorflow Lite and Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX). Moreover, the 3rd-gen Hexagon 685 DSP that comes along also enables on-device AI processing while delivering better camera, voice, XR (eXtended Reality) and gaming experiences. The Snapdragon 845 SoC also comes with Spectra 280 ISP which enables image capture of up to 16 MP at the rate of 60 images per second. This Snapdragon 845 also enables capturing of 64x more high-dynamic range color information for video capture and playback on Ultra HD Premium displays. The Snapdragon 845 SoC also comes with X20 LTE modem which supports LTE Category 18 peak download speeds of 1.2 Gbps, up to 5x carrier aggregation, License Assisted Access (LAA), Dual SIM-Dual VoLTE as well as 4\u00d74 MIMO on up to 3 aggregated carriers. Moreover, the Snapdragon 845 comes with Secure Processing Unit (SPU) which is actually a hardware isolated sub-system that has its own dedicated processor and memory. The SPU is independent of the phone\u2019s OS, and, hence, offers \u201cvault-like security\u201d to your bio-metric data like fingerprint, iris, voice and facial information. This makes sure that your bio-metric data is safe in an event of your device being under attack by any malicious applications. For photography, the Snapdragon 845 SoC comes with support for up to 16 MP dual cameras, up to 32 MP single cameras, and, it also comes with Hybrid Auto-focus and Multi-frame Noise Reduction (MFNR). Lastly, the Snapdragon 845 SoC support for Quick Charge 4+ technology that can charge your phone up to 50% in 15 minutes. \u201c As leaders in mobile technology, we will transform the mobile experience with comprehensive advancements in visual processing, AI, security and connectivity. The Snapdragon 845 Mobile Platform is the next horizon of innovation and is going to transform the way people use their mobile devices to make their lives better. \u201d said Alex Katouzian, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Mobile, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. The Snapdragon 835 SoC was manufactured by Samsung, and, the Snapdragon 845 SoC will also be manufactured by Samsung. The Snapdragon 845 SoC is being sampled to customers and is expected to start shipping in commercial devices in early 2018. However, don\u2019t be surprised if the first smartphone powered by Snapdragon 845 SoC available for purchase is from Samsung.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adreno", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alex katouzian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kryo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gpu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dsp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qualcomm technologies, inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "open neural network exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qualcomm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:24.063+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b0c27b0e07a1a2f678d59a7cf9bb7edfe0ecc19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nmFR93hfFGTJeefh9wq7n6dPXTYdfN8CDSVfghvMTqHkItVua9itdehHtSh0grOTj0eY6x2mHmYZ4jq1SoX.L7w--", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest financial, market &amp; economic news and analysis | Business | The Guardian", "title": "China's debt levels pose stability risk, says IMF | Business", "title_full": "China's debt levels pose stability risk, says IMF | Business | The Guardian", "published": "2017-12-07T03:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 50, "participants_count": 27, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.117, "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e44b6468adf872372bc6bc2f27ae8b814f6542b/0_226_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=9c667fd43db81a8537badd5a202cbf98", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 170, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bd58f99da55c50cfad8003189354f90be56b3f5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nmFR93hfFGTJeefh9wq7n6dPXTYdfN8CDSVfghvMTqHkItVua9itdehHtSh0grOTj0eY6x2mHmYY.vEq_tBueY1zI5h60gVnVKrBHbueQR0A-", "ord_in_thread": 31, "author": "Tony Spencer", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Always assets backing credit?

A real shame becuase as you say, he has genuine pace, and would be a real handful but unfortunately only for about a two over burst! http://batallday.blogspot.com/ - Cricket blog dedicated to domestic cricket.

Think he has a good technique and can play all round and scores quickly naturally. Of course he has to get things right between the ears and what goes into his belly.\nThe rest picked itself.\nIf Jamie Overton was fit he would come into this side pushing the incumbents. His record has been very good the last 2 seasons considering the pitches he plays on. In fact I think it is under-realised. Just about staying on the park and playing.

On Friday, he was due to travel to northern Greece and visit the Muslim community there. \nBut even before he landed, he riled his hosts with suggestions of revisions to a 1923 treaty, the Treaty of Lausanne, which established the borders of Turkey and therefore of Greece. \n\"This is a treaty that encompasses the entire region and just because of that, I think during the course of time, all treaties need a revision, and Lausanne in the face of the recent developments needs make up, a revision if you will,\" Erdogan told SKAI TV and Kathimerini newspaper in an interview. \nIn swift rebuttal, Greece said the treaty was non-negotiable, and suggestions that it be revised were not conducive to attempts to build relations. \n\"The Greek government, and the Prime Minister, expect that his (Erdogan's) visit will build bridges, not walls,\" government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said in a statement. Advertisement Advertisement \nTurkish flags were not visible in the central Syndagma Square, apart from one seen outside a hotel Erdogan was thought to be staying. \nThe two NATO partners teetered on the verge of war in 1974, 1987 and 1996 over long-running disputes on ethnically divided Cyprus, mineral rights in the Aegean Sea and sovereignty over uninhabited islets in that sea. \nAlthough relations have improved, many Greeks believe Turkey has territorial aspirations against their country.

They are used to make ceilings or walls. Drywall construction has emerged as a speedier alternative to the traditional plaster. Rapid expansion of construction activities worldwide is giving impetus to the global market for drywall and building plaster. With the number of construction firms across countries projected to increase, the innovation of drywall-based construction techniques is likely. This in turn is expected to give a major boost to the market for drywall and building plasters. \nThe drywall and building construction market is broadly classified into residential and non-residential, based on end user. Of these, the demand from the residential sector is the highest, Regionally, the global drywall and building plaster market can be segmented into Asia Pacific, North America, Europe, and Rest of the World. Increasing demand from the construction industry in China and the U.S. is offering a significant boost to the drywall and building plaster market. Request For Report Sample@ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=11222 \nThe report presents a comprehensive overview of the growth trajectory exhibited by the global drywall and building plaster market. It studies in detail the various factors influencing the market\u2019s growth trends. The most lucrative regional markets for drywall and building plasters are identified in the report to aid enterprises in determining future growth strategies. \nGlobal Drywall and Building Plaster Market: Key Opportunities and Threats \nThe U.S. and China are expected to dominate the global market for drywall and building plasters. These countries are projected to account for the largest share in the overall demand generated for drywall between 2016 and 2023. Additionally, product sales in the U.S. are expected to grow at an impressive rate during this period. After witnessing a slight decline in demand in the U.S. during 2006 and 2011, the drywall market in the country exhibited robust growth post the economic rebound. \nThe rapidly increasing nonresidential building construction sector in the U.S. will give an impetus to the demand for drywall and building plasters in the country. In China as well, the market for drywalls and building plasters is expected to expand at an impressive pace. This growth will be aided by the rising construction activities in China. \nOther countries that are projected to show lucrative prospects for the drywall and building plasters market include India, Thailand, Mexico, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. Increasing demand for urban housing will boost expenditure on residential building constructions in these countries, consequently propelling the market for drywall and building plasters. Going forward, local companies operating in the construction market in these countries will increase their spending on modern building materials. Thus, the demand for drywall and building plasters is anticipated to rise exponentially in the coming years. \nGlobal Drywall and Building Plaster Market: Regional Outlook \nRegionally, North America and Europe will emerge as two of the most lucrative markets for drywalls and building plasters. The market is poised to report above average growth in Asia Pacific, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East and Africa. The use of drywall in residential construction is expected to increase due to its rising popularity. This is likely to be a key factor bolstering demand for drywalls and building plastics from these regions.

The aetiology of the sporadic form is still unknown, but there is a broad consensus that Parkinson's disease involves multiple pathways. In previous human post-mortem studies investigating substantia nigra of parkinsonian subjects, gene expression alterations in various metabolic pathways including protein folding, trafficking, aggregation, ubiquitination and oxidative stress were found. These studies revealed transcriptomic dysregulation of various genes, amongst others Skp1A and PSMC4 (part of ubiquitin-proteasome system), HSC70 (belonging to the chaperone family) and ALDH1A1 (an enzyme involved in the catabolism of dopamine). To investigate whether these alterations are manifested at the protein level, we performed immunohistochemical analysis in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease and compared them to Alzheimer's disease and non-neurological post-mortem controls. We were able to confirm cell-specific reductions in the protein content of ALHD1A1 and Skp1A in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra of Parkinsonian patients compared to Alzheimer's and control subjects. Furthermore, we observed particular distribution for HSC70 and PSMC4 in the cytoplasm and accumulation within Lewy body in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra in Parkinson patients. These findings, together with previous evidence, suggest a malfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome and possible autophagy systems as major players in protein misfolding and aggregation in Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, this needs further proof, possibly with trajectory time line.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2jmXeVV", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lewy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:25.004+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15078077, "moreResultsAvailable": 15077977, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512642085004&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 59}
