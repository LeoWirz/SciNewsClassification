It occurs when a speaker breaks off from addressing the audience (e.g. in a play) and directs speech to a third party. 07 December 2017 Panglossian Wonderland It's quite maddening to watch as politicians do an obviously bad job of Brexit and then give Panglossian self-reviews to the media. We are required to believe that current disaster is the best possible outcome in the best of worlds. It's as though we've gone down the rabbit hole to Wonderland. Up is down and sense is nonsense. But this theme of of disaster being spun as a great victory is nothing new. Remember the Alamo ? The Alamo was a failed attempt to withstand a siege. All the US soldiers died. The Charge of the Light Brigade ? A suicidal cavalry charge at artillery. Everyone died. The more suicidal some mission is, the easier it is to sell failure as success. While the news is focussed on the Brexit disaster something weird is going on. Here in the UK the government tops up earnings for almost every working person in some way. And meanwhile the top 1% of the wealthy are squirrelling more and more wealth away in tax havens. The government subsidises low wages so that wealthy shareholders can take an ever greater slice of the profits of industry. In-work benefits don't benefit workers struggling on subsistence wages, they benefit employers who have no incentive to pay a living wage. Landlords are subsidised to charge rents much higher than most people can afford, because govt meets the difference. Business owners are subsidised to pay low wages, or offer zero-hours contracts knowing that govt will top them up with \"benefits\". And this is called \"Free Market Economics\"? Pull the other one. This is market manipulation to favour the rich. It's welfare that is being targeted at the rich. It is one of the biggest confidence tricks in history. The really creepy thing is that the turkeys are all voting for Christmas and attacking anyone who suggests they should support the turkeys instead of the farmers. I'm reminded of Monty Python... \"Terrific race the Romans, terrific\". Anyway there's some really fucking evil genius at work here.

This promotion is one of the most generous and ambitious the company has ever undertaken, and the expectation is that demand will be huge. The process has been designed to be quick and easy; the form only asks for five key pieces of information, first name, last name, email address, phone number, and postcode. Once completed the site visitor then receives their voucher via return email. They simply take the voucher to their local Carpet One Australia Store and can redeem it against any purchase over $750.00 including sale items. \u201cWe are always looking for innovative promotions and ideas that truly benefit our customers,\u201d said David Meyer of Carpet One Australia. \u201cRather than offer a promotion on specific floor coverings or other merchandise available in store, we decided to offer a voucher that allowed all of our customers to benefit regardless of the products they chose to purchase. We believe that this could be our most successful promotion ever, in fact, the biggest problem customers could face is choosing which product best suits their home. We have even thought of that though and have created our exclusive flooring comparison tool to give our customers some guidance in the peace and quiet of their own homes. Be warned though this promotion must end by the 31 st January.\u201d Carpet One is a co-operative and one of the world\u2019s largest retail floor covering groups. This means that they have huge buying power. The subsequent savings made as a result are then passed onto customers offering unbeatable value all year round. All of their stores offer a large range of carpet, timber, vinyl, and laminate.

The fruits of those decisions had been enjoyed .Now they should come out to say where the money lent has gone, in the interest of the country no matter they are not in the Government?

He never took action on his own. If not for media and alert opposition, he would have allowed highest level of corruption to continue. Reply K V Dec 7, 2017 at 6:53 pm Simply clarify Mr Manmohanji then whether you were a dependent PM or Independent PM. Still you are talking like parrot of Mr Rahul, why so much fear in you, is there any intrinsic act haunting you.? Please God sake don\u2019t compare yoynaction on corruption and present BJP probing. Mr PV your guru told your Congress colleagues not to resort corrupt practices as the law will take its own course. In UPA regime you have only \u20180\u2019 knowledge compare to your colleagues who were well aware of the same as they themselves involved. You atleast dare to question you people why they mislead you, not BJP.

The boy was apprehended around 1 am on Thursday after the police traced the ransom call to a house that was rented to his brother-in-law by the girl's father, Superintendent of Police (SP), Ambala, Abhishek Jorwal said. \"He did not show any remorse. During questioning, he told us that he had watched a movie after which he decided to hatch a plan to make easy money. The boy was working on his laptop when the police reached the house,\" he said. The 16-year-old had hid the body in a water cooler after drowning her in the water tub, the SP said. The boy was alone at home as his brother-in-law, who worked at a shop owned by the girl's father, along with his family had gone to Uttar Pradesh, he said. The officer said that the boy lured the girl to his house last evening when she was playing outside her residence. The victim's family started searching for her after she did not return home and later informed the police, he said. In the meantime, a neighbour received the ransom call. The caller demanded Rs 20 lakh, the SP said. It was traced and the police zeroed-in on the house. Realising that the police had been alerted and the girl could raise an alarm, he decided to kill her, Jorwal said. The SP said that the girl's father was not aware of the boy's background and intentions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abhishek jorwal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jorwal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uttar pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "haryana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandigarh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ambala", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:25.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10310e0ccca679741ced78a1c884ef2aafd27e9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Wjftei94Pt_YWcRrT300Ya3oEGMVbe76CP_9cTkxE98TwnGvwaZNTiIvf2NjsI7IUeJkcpoPj.NIdKvsXErHQ6VzrtXWJFVnQ4O0clVm_yVOj3udyRNPwUAUfAjNnerU-", "site_full": "www.cheyennejournal.com", "site": "cheyennejournal.com", "site_section": "http://www.cheyennejournal.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "business", "marketing"], "section_title": "Cheyenne Journal", "title": "[UPDATED]: India\u2019s Leading Event Management Company", "title_full": "[UPDATED]: India\u2019s Leading Event Management Company", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10310e0ccca679741ced78a1c884ef2aafd27e9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Wjftei94Pt_YWcRrT300Ya3oEGMVbe76CP_9cTkxE98TwnGvwaZNTiIvf2NjsI7IUeJkcpoPj.NIdKvsXErHQ6VzrtXWJFVnQ4O0clVm_yVOj3udyRNPwUAUfAjNnerU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "editor", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "[UPDATED]: India\u2019s Leading Event Management Company", "text": "Print This Article Share it With Friends Events are of multiple types, and the success of any of them depends solely on the management of the team assigned by the event management company in charge.

By: Pragya Srivastava | Updated: December 7, 2017 3:18 PM Finance Minister Arun Jaitley tweeted: \u201cThe Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2017 is pending before the Standing Committee. The objective of the government is to fully protect the interest of the financial institutions and depositors.\u201d (Image: PTI) \nA law is often simple; what\u2019s interesting is its ifs, buts, and interpretations. Similar is the case with the proposed Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, which has been making a lot of noise lately. In Finance Minister Arun Jaitley \u2019s words, the FRDI Bill will \u201cprovide a specialised resolution mechanism to deal with bankruptcy situations in banks, insurance firms and financial sector entities\u201d; what was not said was that under the \u2018bail-in\u2019 clause, it would be depositors\u2019 money that would provide that specialised resolution. \nWhat the bail-in clause is: \nA bail-in is rescuing a financial institution on the brink of failure by making its creditors and depositors take a loss on their holdings. A bail-in is an opposite of bail-out, in which, the banks instead of saving bankrupt companies, save themselves. So, the FRDI bill, if passed in the Winter Session scheduled to commence on December 15, will allow critically ill banks to restructure their liability, which is also depositors\u2019 monies. \n\u201cCritically ill banks can change the structure of their liabilities under the bail-in clause to rescue themselves. Restructuring of liabilities means that they can take your deposited cash and issue bonds, shares etc, which can be redeemed only after a fixed period of time,\u201d Samir Ghosh, General Secretary, All India Reserve Bank of India Employees Association said. \nA tried-and-failed formula: \nIn 2013, Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean witnessed the collapse of its banking system. Banks were shut overnight, people were left with access to their money and the government refused to step in and bailout. Cyprus, then, became the testing ground for the bail-in programme, which was advocated in 2012 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Cyprus bail-in programme was a disaster; what can be called as \u2018legal theft\u2019 of 60% of depositors\u2019 money. \nOr maybe not\u2026 \nBut Cyprus was not the first country to go with the bail-in programme: It was Denmark. In its response to its financial crisis in 2011, the country came up with five bank packages which included increasing the cap of the insured amount deposited in banks, along with a safety net. During the Bank package III \u2013 bail-in was implemented and wind down a (small) bank during a weekend, including imposing losses on senior debt holders, and continue operating with no effect for ordinary customers. Since then European Countries are mulling to go bail-in instead of bail-out. \nThe legal framework is key: \nWhat, perhaps, made Denmark\u2019s bail-in case, not a disaster is was the orderly manner in which the entire process was done. In fact, the IMF, which advocated \u201cfrom Bail-out to Bail-in\u201d, also said that it is essential to have clear and coherent legal framework for bail-ins. \u201cAn appropriate balance between the rights of private stakeholders and the public policy interest in preserving financial stability. Debt restructuring ideally would not be subject to creditor consent, but a \u201cno creditor worse off\u201d test may be introduced to safeguard creditors\u2019 and shareholders\u2019 interests,\u201d IMF said. \nThe crucial point is that investors need to be convinced that a recapitalization under a bail-in will provide sufficient time to restore the bank\u2019s capital strength and hence, the bank\u2019s long-term viability. Otherwise, the triggering of the bail-in power could be seen as a bank\u2019s nonviability, causing a run instead of preventing it. \nIndia\u2019s case: \nThere are two things; first, government\u2019s denial that the depositors\u2019 money is in danger and second, how to introduce a legal system which actually by-and-large rescues the financial institutions and also protect the rights of depositors. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley tweeted: \u201cThe Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2017 is pending before the Standing Committee. The objective of the government is to fully protect the interest of the financial institutions and depositors.\u201d \nHowever, how the government is planning to \u201cfully protect the interest of the financial institutions and depositors\u201d is not clear yet. The bill is indeed at an early stage and required changes can be brought given the apprehension regarding the danger it poses to depositors\u2019 money at a time when country\u2019s bad loans have soared to a record high. \nIncrease insurance cap: \nThe All India Reserve Bank Employee Association has written to RBI governor Urjjit Patel demanding security against the bill by increasing the maximum coverage of insured bank deposits from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. In 1993, there was an increase in deposit coverage from Rs 30,000 Rs 1 lakh as the outcome of the review of the scheme in the background of security scam in 1992 and the subsequent liquidation of Bank of Karad.

The memo also cited a \"nearly unanimous consensus\" among NFL owners who supported finalizing the deal. \nThe league's 32 owners voted unanimously in May to authorize Blank and the compensation committee to negotiate an extension with Goodell, whose previous deal ran through 2019 and paid him $31.7 million in 2015, the last year for which his salary was reported. The New York Times reported that Goodell's extension is for an additional five years. \nThe compensation committee faced criticism along the way from Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who at one point threatened to sue his fellow owners in order to prevent the completion of the deal. He later said he would not take the matter to court but told USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell he wanted \"accountability.\" \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger goodell", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "arthur blank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom schad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goodell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jarrett bell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jake roth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry jones", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "atlanta falcons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa today sports' jarrett bell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas cowboys", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:26.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "98535f7bc88a98cf77d38244853afc5ec443ffe5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWNlMW5oJxd5dljNBlZe8Vi76N5UMhUboktUqxMrpNrtWws2pdcMbD9", "site_full": "nixpages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://nixpages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "NixPages", "title": "VIPER", "title_full": "VIPER", "published": "2017-12-06T16:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c5c4e804c48ac42b104001dd04688197dc3b52f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWNlMW5oJxd5dljNBlZe8Vi76N5UMhUboktUqxMrpNrtXo49HfUHh514ZoxJckXMfM-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Su-sieee!

By: PTI | New Delhi | Updated: December 7, 2017 2:56 PM \nUIDAI, the authority which issues Aadhaar, said today that the deadlines for verifying bank accounts, PAN cards and mobile SIM cards with the biometric ID stand \u201cvalid and lawful\u201d, and there is no change in them. (IMage: Reuters) \nUIDAI, the authority which issues Aadhaar, said today that the deadlines for verifying bank accounts, PAN cards and mobile SIM cards with the biometric ID stand \u201cvalid and lawful\u201d, and there is no change in them. While the deadline for verifying bank accounts and income tax Permanent Account Number (PAN) by providing Aadhaar is December 31, for SIM cards it is February 6. Refuting social media messages, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) said that as on date there is no stay from the Supreme Court on Aadhaar and its linking to various services. \u201cThat Aadhaar Act being in force, all notifications for requiring Aadhaar for various welfare programmes, verifying bank account, PAN card and SIM card with Aadhaar stand valid and lawful,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s legal position is that there is no stay as on December 7, 2017 from the Supreme Court on Aadhaar and its linking to various services,\u201d it added. The government has made it mandatory for verifying bank account and PAN to weed out black money and bring unaccounted wealth to book. The same for SIM has been mandated to establish identify of mobile phone users. \n\u201cThe mandatory requirements of Aadhaar for PAN, bank accounts, welfare programs, and SIM cards have been challenged in the Supreme Court and no stay has been granted. Therefore, it is clear that the video is outdated because it does not reflect the latest legal position as on today (December 7, 2017),\u201d the statement said. UIDAI said the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 was passed by the Parliament on March 16, 2016 and notified in the Gazette of India on March 26, 2016. \n\u201cTherefore, subsequent notifications issued under section/s of Aadhaar Act for requiring Aadhaar as primary identifier by various ministries and departments of Government of India and States/UTs Governments for various services, benefits and subsidies hold the field today,\u201d it said. UIDAI asked people not to get misled by an outdated video doing rounds in the social media and Whatsapp and said \u201cpeople should instead verify their banks accounts, investment accounts, SIM cards, etc as per the current laws and deadlines as early as possible to avoid any inconvenience.\u201d \n\u201cUIDAI has clarified on a video circulated purportedly out of context of a lady lawyer on WhatsApp, Twitter and Social Media and said that the video refers to an order passed by the Supreme Court on August 11, 2015 when the court had restricted use of Aadhaar to only few programs,\u201d the statement said. The video, it said, does not reflect \u201ctrue legal position\u201d as it stands today, because after the said Supreme Court order of 2015, Aadhaar Act was passed by Parliament in 2016. Subsequent to the Act, notifications have been issued making Aadhaar mandatory for availing various welfare benefits such as public distribution services (PDS), cooking gas LPG, MNREGS, scholarships and pensions. \nThe Income Tax Act was amended in March 2017 to make Aadhaar mandatory for PAN cards. On June 1, 2017, PML Rules have been amended to make Aadhaar mandatory for linking all bank accounts, insurance, pension, mutual funds and DMAT accounts. \u201cSupreme Court too in Lokniti Foundation case through an order passed in February 2017 has approved verification of all SIM cards with Aadhaar,\u201d UIDAI said. The Apex Court has upheld the linkage of Aadhaar with PAN in the case of Binoy Viswam vs Union of India which mandates Aadhaar for income tax returns and PAN.

Gary Glenn today voted in favor of legislation to protect public services and the retirement benefits for police, firefighters and other local government employees in Michigan. \nThe reforms emphasize proper reporting from local governments to pinpoint ones that may be in financial trouble due to underfunded retirement plans. The legislation mirrors recommendations from a task force assembled earlier this year by Gov. Rick Snyder. \n\u201cOur first responders put their safety on the line every single day to make sure the rest of us are safe,\u201d Glenn, of Williams Township, said after the legislation was approved in the Michigan House. \u201cWe are taking important steps with this legislation to help ensure the benefits that have been promised to police and firefighters are available when they enter their well-deserved retirement.\u201d \n\nSnyder\u2019s task force explored the critical challenges posed by Michigan\u2019s underfunded local government employee retirement systems \u2013 which have unfunded liabilities fast approaching $20 billion. \nThe legislation creates a reporting system with uniform financial and accounting standards for local government retirement plans.

I then had to have it checked by my lawyer. Then it was clear that I could take over the Kiefer Racing Team and the two Moto2 starting positions,\" Pickworth told Speedweek.com. \n\"Of course, everyone is very sceptical, as soon as you pronounce the word 'Russia'. But we are moving in a methodical, professional way. We cannot influence the way people think about us. All we can do is be very professional. And we will do that.\" \nKiefer Racing won the 2011 Moto2 World Championship with Stefan Bradl and 2015 Moto3 title with Danny Kent. 2017 saw the team cut back to Moto2, switch from Kalex to Suter and suffer the disappointment of a disqualified race win for Aegerter at Misano. \nWhat does Pickworth expect from the new team in its first year? \n\"I am very confident about our goals. The KTM won the last three races at the end of the season. The bike has proven it is competitive. We have two good riders with a lot of potential. I guard against predictions, but I am very hopeful and expect to be near the front.\" \nIn terms of the funding, Pickworth added that the money to takeover the team comes from a Russian investor, while the money to go racing - which he states as 2.5 million euros, roughly matching the figure quoted by Forward Racing's Giovanni Cuzari - will be raised from sponsors in Russia and Switzerland. \n\"The names of these financiers will be announced at the team presentation in January.\" \nPickworth also wants the team to return to Moto3, in 2019. \n\"In an ideal world, we would like to work with KTM in the Moto3 class. But let's wait and see what they think about us after the first season. Now there is a contract, they are less skeptical. \n\"If they see how we work and how we do it and what the team's performance is, I am sure they will also talk to us about the Moto3 World Championship.\" \nTarran Mackenzie, who rode alongside Aegerter for most of the season, is set to join BSB in 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "spee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jochen kiefer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stefan bradl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tarran mackenzie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pickworth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stefan]", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aegerter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny kent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giovanni cuzari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kiefer racing", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ktm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kiefer racing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bsb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kiefer racing team", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pickworth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kalex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "misano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:27.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a7e0ab01e39027c886332fda4bbf79e8e65f404", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSptx_IfmwzxXNprwW7uRXqWbbWfoN8sQnU0QXluSzFTbOvUYlpiGJsnEGey2buwQET8owIMkkkgYqL36XXVzNAnVEqoA6gaNA-", "site_full": "forum.wordreference.com", "site": "wordreference.com", "site_section": "https://forum.wordreference.com/forumdisplay.php?f=6", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "English Only | WordReference Forums", "title": "\"Reserved by nature\" meaning?", "title_full": "\"Reserved by nature\" meaning? | WordReference Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T09:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.033, "main_image": "https://cdn77f.wordreference.com/styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 315, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a7e0ab01e39027c886332fda4bbf79e8e65f404", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSptx_IfmwzxXNprwW7uRXqWbbWfoN8sQnU0QXluSzFTbOvUYlpiGJsnEGey2buwQET8owIMkkkgYqL36XXVzNAnVEqoA6gaNA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "zigbee", "published": "2017-12-07T09:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Reserved by nature\" meaning?", "text": "Hello, I have just read a sentence, that is \"He is reserved by nature\".

Sorry to yet again ask a newbe question. I hope that I one day can give something back to this forum.\nWhen searching and reading about this subject I have understood that the triumph 8 also brake isn\u2019t show stopper but can it be as bad as mine or is something wrong?\nSome background: I bought the bike (-59 TR6) this summer but haven\u2019t ridden it yet properly. One reason being that\u2019s imported from the UK and still isn\u2019t road legal here in Sweden and the other that I have been rebuilding the engine and transmission. I have also gone over most of the bike and replaced parts where needed.\nOne such part was the front brake that I thought was a bit tired ( barely working). I replaced the brake shoes but apart from that everything else looked fine. After a very short ride this winter (2 kilometres) I noticed that the front brake still wasn\u2019t performing at all. I took the brake apart the other day and found a lot of dust from the brake shoes, a lot more than you would expect from such a short ride. The big clue to the bad performance (and the brake dust) was that I had put the brake shoes on the wrong way. The right part of the shoes were at the right side of the fulcrum and pivot pin but I had them switched. I cleaned everything and put them back the right way. But still the same poor brake performance. I took everything apart again and lined the inside of the drum with adhesive sandpaper to match the shoes with the drum. After carefully \u201cgrinding\u201d away some of the shoes I took everything apart again, cleaned and rebuilt. Loosened the fulcrum, squeezed the lever and tightened the nut. Now there were some improvement but the brake are still so bad that it\u2019s dangerous. If I pull the lever really hard the bike will stop eventually but there\u2019s no \u201cbite\u201d ( the bike is just rolling down a small slope, no engine running) . It just sounds like the shoes are slipping/dragging on the inside. My previous encounters with drum brakes are that even if they are bad, if you pull hard enough they will \u201cbite\u201d. But these aren\u2019t. I can\u2019t even get my front to \u201cbow\u201d when I squeeze the handle all I can. It just slips!? The bike would probably stop faster if I dragged my feet on the ground\nI include some pictures, maybe someone sees the problem. The brake drum to seems ok. One can see that it has been machined/skimmed (is that the right word) in the past but it\u2019s nice and flat. I also had an idea that maybe the pivot and fulcrum pin were for another model and that they are causing the problem but upon inspection they seem to be in good nick and looks like the parts in the parts book. What to do?\n/ Chris\nLast edited by TrophyTR6; 2 hours ago .\n #718007 - 1 hour ago Re: 8 SLS performance [ Re: TrophyTR6 ] Joined: Dec 2004\nPosts: 8,935 kommando\nkommando\nJoined: Dec 2004\nPosts: 8,935\nScotland If the drum has been skimmed in the past then you need new oversize linings arc'd to the drum or made to your measurements for best performance, using std shoes in a skimmed drum will result in contact only in one section of the shoe and a weak brake.\nFor oversize shoes made to suit the drum and measurement then you can use\nhttp://villiersservices.co.uk/index... r=4&zenid=b7uqd0qk6gcnmu7j6vk5kfhjn2\nor\nhttp:/ / www.saftek.co.uk/ classics.html\nBoth have good reviews, you send them your old shoes and tell them the size of your drum ID and the OD of the shoes with no lining fitted, they then fit modern linings to suit those measurements.\nLast edited by kommando; 1 hour ago . #718009 - 35 minutes ago Re: 8 SLS performance [ Re: TrophyTR6 ] Joined: May 2017\nPosts: 42 TrophyTR6\n TrophyTR6\n May 2017\nPosts: 42\nGothenburg, Sverige Good info kommando! But when I installed the new shoes the first time it was real snugg and there were not much clearance in the brake arm. Could the drum still be to big? In one of the pictures you can se the small edge left from skimming, its very small. I have had bikes with break drums really beaten up from wear and tear and there would still be some bite in it.

Though ultracapacitors are usually supercapacitor more expensive than battery packs for the same purposes and cannot retailer as a lot power as battery packs, ultracapacitor packs are projected to final the life of the car and provide better gas-efficient operation by means of braking regeneration energy seize and supplying of car acceleration power.\nFinally, a balancing or drain resistor is mounted in parallel around every ultracapacitor to securely discharge the pack to an inactive state over a time frame. Foam rubber insulating and sealing sheet 90 that covers the ultracapacitors 20. The primary sheet ninety has cutouts for the ultracapacitor terminals 45 and fill port 50 so that the sheet 90 can seal tightly in opposition to the duvet 55 of the ultracapacitor 20. The copper bar electrical interconnections one hundred and five embody holes that the ultracapacitor terminals 45 protrude by means of.\nThe ultracapacitor is connected on a circuit board to each the tag\u2019s chip\u2014by way of a bonding pad initially designed to mount a battery to the chip for a battery-assisted passive (BAP) tag\u2014and its antenna. The ultracapacitor still requires a power supply to acquire the power it shops, the company notes. FastCAP makes a speciality of ultracapacitor devices and systems for quite a lot of markets together with power exploration, aerospace and protection, automotive, and stationary storage. Ioxus designs and manufactures ultracapacitor cells and modules that provide peak power and prolong the lifespan of different power sources equivalent to batteries.\nThe ultracapacitor pack 200 includes structural support, environmental safety, automatic cooling, electrical interconnection of the ultracapacitors, remote ON/OFF switching, a security pre-cost circuit, a safety and automated equalizing discharge circuit, a programmable logic controller, a digital interface to a management space information network for control and standing reporting, and an non-obligatory fireplace sensing and suppression system.\nIn a most popular embodiment, the triple can connections are arranged 4 rows deep and twelve rows along the highest to efficiently bundle one-hundred and forty 4 (a hundred and forty four) cylindrically formed ultracapacitor cans with threaded polarized connections at each end of the can. Wireless energy tools using an ultracapacitor could be charged just before use.\nAlthough the ultracapacitor pack 10 and the half modules 15 are shown as being typically rectangular in shape, either or each could have shapes aside from typically rectangular corresponding to, but not by way of limitation, circular, oval, other curvilinear shapes, different rectilinear shapes, and different polygonal shapes. The energy drain action is sluggish enough in order not to intrude with the normal operation of the ultracapacitor pack 200.\nAn ultracapacitor could be used for the jolts of energy needed to carry heavy things, which might give an extended life to fork lifts\u2019 lead acid batteries, stated Hall. According to speech of NuinTEK, they\u2019re one of the largest manufacturers of motor operating capacitors and metallized film capacitors in Korea and likewise newly developed Extremely Capacitors for mass manufacturing as an extension of enterprise.\nTo find out if one or more ultracapacitors 20 within the pack 10 must be replaced, a user observes the sunshine emitting diode (LED) failure detection show by the transparent cover 75. The LED failure detection display includes an array of LEDs that correspond to the array of ultracapacitors 20, each LED indicating the standing of a corresponding ultracapacitor 20. Each unlit LED indicates a corresponding failed LED.\nAttaching the ultracapacitors 20 to the mounting assembly 112 by the terminals forty five as a substitute of the exterior ultracapacitor casing 60 permits the ultracapacitors 20 to be more effectively cooled as a result of the vast majority of the surface space of the ultracapacitors 20 is in the cooling air stream supplied by the cross-movement air cooling assembly a hundred and fifteen. As indicated above, each ultracapacitor 330 is linked in parallel with the drain resistor 340.\nThe worth of each ultracapacitor 330 is 2600 Farads and the value and energy of the drain resistor 340 is selected to utterly discharge the ultracapacitor 330 over a variety of hours during an inactive period of the ultracapacitor pack 200. The discharge is also slow sufficient in order to not trigger any vital temperature increase from the drain resistors 340 within the ultracapacitor pack 200.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hall", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ultracapacitor woojin industrial programs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ess", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "metro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "incheon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daejon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:27.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0be5a3b0497a1ef7727056bbac297af35ab8ca2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQdICmXCwwvrNTroF0FABYowE98_DdvILpfNPhBmWc8FbwIvcavK3X2", "site_full": "mahaveer96.livejournal.com", "site": "livejournal.com", "site_section": "http://mahaveer96.livejournal.com/data/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Mahaveer Jain", "title": "Internet \u0938\u0947 Paise \u0915\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u0915\u092e\u093e\u090f | \u0907\u0928\u094d\u091f\u0930\u0928\u0947\u091f \u0938\u0947 \u092a\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u0915\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 6 \u0924\u0930\u0940\u0915\u0947", "title_full": "Internet \u0938\u0947 Paise \u0915\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u0915\u092e\u093e\u090f | \u0907\u0928\u094d\u091f\u0930\u0928\u0947\u091f \u0938\u0947 \u092a\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u0915\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 6 \u0924\u0930\u0940\u0915\u0947", "published": "2017-12-07T10:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/sign.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0be5a3b0497a1ef7727056bbac297af35ab8ca2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQdICmXCwwvrNTroF0FABYowE98_DdvILpfNPhBmWc8FbwIvcavK3X2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "Internet \u0938\u0947 Paise \u0915\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u0915\u092e\u093e\u090f | \u0907\u0928\u094d\u091f\u0930\u0928\u0947\u091f \u0938\u0947 \u092a\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u0915\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 6 \u0924\u0930\u0940\u0915\u0947", "text": "Anonymous comments are disabled in this journal We will log you in after post We will log you in after post We will log you in after post We will log you in after post We will log you in after post Anonymously", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:27.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b1d8f4de5516a90b076f1343aff698aef0cfc1b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRKSdOC9B0lZ_IYfrC4AtCXC1PFIV.DDeILInOa3uknBDMPUtAF.XFR5pPKWnYvFFr7IYav7R7kNrB5yb6j7STglVm6KoS.03SLkUKkkw624.NGOveuX.DDmRGvmgfJwrU.6DenabILdg--", "site_full": "50daysofpray.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://50daysofpray.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Day 25: 50 Days of Prayer for the Persecuted Church: Brunei \u2013 50 Days of Pray", "title": "Day 25: 50 Days of Prayer for the Persecuted Church: Brunei", "title_full": "Day 25: 50 Days of Prayer for the Persecuted Church: Brunei", "published": "2017-12-07T11:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1d8f4de5516a90b076f1343aff698aef0cfc1b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRKSdOC9B0lZ_IYfrC4AtCXC1PFIV.DDeILInOa3uknBDMPUtAF.XFR5pPKWnYvFFr7IYav7R7kNrB5yb6j7STglVm6KoS.03SLkUKkkw624.NGOveuX.DDmRGvmgfJwrU.6DenabILdg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "50daysofpray", "published": "2017-12-07T11:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "Day 25: 50 Days of Prayer for the Persecuted Church: Brunei", "text": "Today we pray for Brunei.

Beau LaFave of Iron Mountain today voted in favor of reforms to help protect the retirement benefits of police, firefighters and other local government employees. \nThe legislation approved by the Michigan House will help identify local governments most at risk of bankruptcy or severe financial hardship due to underfunded retirement plans. The legislation sets up a system to help guide local governments to solid financial footing, so they can continue to pay for promised retiree benefits and public services. \n\u201cThe last thing I want is a federal bankruptcy court to cut retiree benefits, like what happened with Detroit,\u201d LaFave said. \u201cThis plan will shine a spotlight on the financial health of local government retirement plans and help preserve benefits. It provides a framework to allow locals every opportunity to assess and improve their own budgets. That\u2019s the best way to preserve retirement benefits for police and firefighters, and protect funding for public services.\u201d \nMichigan\u2019s local government employee retirement systems have unfunded liabilities fast approaching $20 billion, including a surprising amount in the Upper Peninsula. The legislation working its way through the Legislature aims to help communities improve their plans\u2019 finances. \nThe plan is identical to recommendations from a task force assembled by Gov. Rick Snyder earlier this year, which enjoyed broad support of local governments and police and fire unions. \nThe legislation creates a reporting system with uniform, realistic financial and accounting standards for local government retirement plans. An early detection system will help identify potential funding problems and allow local governments to act quickly to mitigate them. Communities will be vetted through a state treasurer\u2019s fiscal impact evaluation and retirement systems will be flagged as underfunded when municipalities aren\u2019t meeting set criteria to alleviate their debts. \n\u201cWe want local governments to have the opportunity to fix things on their own, without the state or federal government coming in on their high horses and forcing changes down our throats,\u201d LaFave said. \u201cI believe in shining a light on these systemic problems and helping communities make their own changes when they\u2019re needed.\u201d \nHouse Bill 5298 and companion legislation advance to the Senate for consideration.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lafave", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beau lafave", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick snyder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "news  state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "legislature", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "upper peninsula", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:28.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba8531be5983ed5377ea4aa5996c6a2a9ba9e0af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqpci4rZL8WckWK6Gi1iRqZTwRdJipRbqs62RvWHfrJ8fuc6A6no44FEuI2VjHzB25ftff6ix7Hhk6UksYByyoUcuUWgHHL8N93mZ_iAZNSthjGMlS4DHRw", "site_full": "theguitarteachingblog.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://theguitarteachingblog.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Guitar Teaching Blog", "title": "Where to Teach, pt.

(video) I caught this snip from the live feed as the video was playing :) We won. We did it . Despite the huge adversity and years of angst and frustration, the floodgates finally opened and the House of Representatives have just passed marriage equality federally. Yes, in our long fight we finally gained equality before the law. The final parliamentary vote had only five people voting against it. It passed without amendments. Over a long drawn out day the religious exemption amendments were all solidly voted down one after the other. Not one single one survived. Abbott had his last plead at the last amendment but again for nought. The parliament would not accept superfluous, unnecessary and discriminatory legislation being included in a bill that was simply about marriage. The tenacity and gall of the RWNJ's to spend the day trying to keep putting these amendments up when they were being defeated so strongly was appalling and pathetic to watch. The full gallery erupted singing the \"We are Australian\" song. This victory however comes at a very big cost to us. The pain of the postal survey on our existence and love will be with many of us for years to come. The victory hasn't been cheap. The far right kept going right to the bitter end, and we'll never forget what no balls Turnbull put us through for the sake of his political career. To see him basking in the glory at the end in parliament today praising the postal survey was just sickening. The audacity for him to take credit for this is right over the top. The victory is ours, not his. We were the ones who paid the price for it . It feels more like limping over the line battered and bruised rather than a triumphant passing of the posts. The religious freedom debate has been deferred to a committee to report back it's findings next year.

intelligence and law enforcement agencies will be unrecognisable to a practitioner from the turn of the century. Jane\u2019s examines some of the factors surrounding the digital revolution that will dictate whether nation-states maintain an informational advantage over their adversaries.\nThis is an extract from an article from Jane\u2019s Intelligence Review\nKey points:\nMiniaturised, sensor-based platforms using artificial intelligence are likely to gain prominence in future intelligence collection, as evolutions in quantum and conventional computing will make communications interception increasingly difficult. As the digital revolution advances, states are increasingly likely to begin fusing human and technical intelligence \u2013 and foreign and domestic operations \u2013 into single, threat-based collection processes. Overemphasis on technological supremacy in intelligence-gathering will risk inattention to other and more prosaic challenges, such as resistance to innovation, risk-averse planning, and slow institutional response times. For states, intelligence collection and analysis have an overarching objective: to maintain informational superiority over an adversary. Yet the ability of a state to maintain that advantage \u2013 over competitors and even its own citizenry \u2013 is no longer assured. The exponential pace of the digital revolution has already had a profound effect on how intelligence agencies and law enforcement operate. It has consigned much of the Cold War-era tradecraft to history as technological capabilities shift power away from governments and towards commercial companies and individuals, or create new realities in inter-state competition.\nThe digital revolution brings both threats and opportunities to the intelligence community. Recognising the pace of change, it has begun to adapt and innovate. In 2015, the CIA under former director John Brennan launched a new Directorate of Digital Innovation. According to David Ignatius writing in The Washington Post on 9 April 2015, this change reflected the CIA\u2019s recognition that, \u201cEvery aspect of intelligence, including covert action, recruiting agents and protecting officers\u2019 covers, is now linked to information technology.\u201d\nCaption: Examples of trends around the digital revolution and their impact on the intelligence cycle (\u00a9 2017 IHS Markit/Getty images)\nOn 20 September 2016, Alex Younger, the head of the UK\u2019s Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, or MI6) \u2013 which aims to recruit up to 1,000 new personnel by 2020 to address digital challenges \u2013 said, \u201cThe information revolution fundamentally changes our operating environment. In five years\u2019 time, there will be two sorts of intelligence services: those that understand this fact and have prospered, and those that don\u2019t and haven\u2019t.\u201d\nNevertheless, the pace of change threatens to outstrip often slow-moving and change-resistant state agencies. Multiple disruptive new technologies will come on-stream in the coming decade that will have profound implications for their operations, and commercial companies will build capabilities that exceed those of all but the most advanced states. Digitally empowered citizens will test their governments\u2019 informational superiority.\nAs advanced technologies proliferate, old and formerly clear delineations within intelligence work are likely to be strained in many ways: between the different intelligence disciplines such as human intelligence (HUMINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT); between the practices of collection and analysis; between foreign and domestic intelligence; and between online and real-world personas.\nMany changes by 2030 will not be directly technological. Other trends will inform a shifting security environment, such as the demographic ascendancy of the computer-literate millennial generation, rapid urbanisation within megacities, increasing popular scepticism about the state monopolies of power, and the transition to a service-based knowledge economy.\nNevertheless, technology is set to be the pre-eminent driver of change, and this will occur within a context of multiple emerging systems. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies will challenge the established global financial system; US primacy in space-based technologies will face challenges from the rise of genuine state peers, most notably China \u2013 which is pursuing advanced earth observation capabilities and promoting alternative navigation and communication systems \u2013 as well as from private companies taking advantage of reduced technological and financial barriers to entry to place their own satellite constellations into orbit; and the nature of the internet itself is likely to change with differing conceptions about its operation and regulation.\nThis is an extract from an article that appeared in Jane\u2019s Intelligence Review .

I just adjusted for it. I normally used H4350 with the older Barnes 185 XLC in my last 338. ( I haven't messed with another 338 since for 20yrs, starting back for nostalgic reasons.

The Hawk bullets performed like bonded core versions. Both bullets\ndid well in Winchester pre-64 Model 70s in 338-06 and 338 Win magnum. The semi-wildcat 338-06 in the M-70 has the original barrel\nwhich means a riflesmith in Washington State knew his barrel and chamber work. (At least based on the 1 in group it printed today.) Think I have\na lifetime supply of partition bullets\nThat being said, as much as I like the 338-06 and 35 Whelen partition bullets\nAlaska Bullet Works-Juneau;Woodleigh, and Hawk bullets are amazing in the .348 Model 71 Winchester. My last moose went south\nto a well-placed 270 gr Hawk flat point (348 Ackley Imp). The Model 71s are increasingly popular in Canada and Alaska because of bears that show up\nregularly at kill sites. No bolt action can keep up with a smooth 1886 or Model 71 in experienced hands for repeat shots. Fast handling can be critical in\nclose bear encounters.\nA good sled dog Albert Johnson shot Constable Edgar Millen, RCMP- near Rat River, Yukon Territory\n#12440043 - 12/03/17 Re: .338 250gr Accubond Users?

Usually, my hunts have been in cold from maybe 10*F to about warm weather about 65*F. So, I have not noticed any issues of that type using RE-22 or RE-19 in my .338s.\nFor cold weather deer hunting, as it is seldom very cold in southern BC during most hunting seasons, I tend to carry a light .308W, 7x57 or 7-08 and since shots are less than 150 Yds, usually only 50-100 yds and even less, one does not worry about this issue. Finding the deer now is the real problem, due to wolves, Indians and general poor management by governments.\n#12444545 - 12/05/17 Re: .338 250gr Accubond Users?

I see were several users have been using/recommend the 250 anything with 75-76gr R22. I used 76gr R22/180 XBT in a 300 Win mag in Namibia. It was 20 deg in early A.M. and 120 deg by noon!

By not funding employee pension and benefit plans, those communities are still going back on promises made to individuals when they were hired, and some are working for benefits that they may not receive. It\u2019s dangerous for retirees and puts the viability of communities on unstable ground financially.\u201d\u009d \nThe new proposal will stress transparency and proper reporting from local governments each year to pinpoint those who may be at risk of bankruptcy due to underfunded retirement plans. An early detection method that involves local government will increase the chances of heading off potential funding problems long before they reach the point of financial catastrophe. \nThe reporting system follows the specific recommendations of a task force assembled by Gov. Rick Snyder earlier this year. The system created by the task force uses uniform financial and accounting standards for local government retirement plans. Communities will be vetted through a state treasurer\u2019s fiscal impact evaluation and retirement systems will be flagged as underfunded when municipalities aren\u2019t meeting set criteria to alleviate their debts. \n\u201cPensions are constitutionally protected. This plan does not harm pensions and it is not intended to take away benefits through state intervention,\u201d\u009d Rendon said. \u201cOur police officers and firefighters work hard and deserve all of the benefits they were promised. They often retire early because the nature of their work can lead to problems with their backs, shoulders and knees. They are relying on promised retirement benefits that must be there 30-40 years down the line. We need a plan to protect those futures, because the current method of avoidance is kicking the can down the road. Communities are just trying to stay above water after the last decade of shrinking property values and lost revenue sharing. We need a real change to protect the benefits of those who protect us.\u201d\u009d \nRendon helped advance House Bill 5298 and companion legislation through the House Michigan Competitiveness Committee on Tuesday.

Rick Snyder earlier this year. The task force stressed transparency and proper reporting from local governments to pinpoint those who may be struggling financially due to underfunded retirement plans. An early detection method will increase the chances of heading off funding problems before they reach the point of financial catastrophe. \nCommunities will be vetted through a state treasurer\u2019s fiscal impact evaluation and retirement systems will be flagged as underfunded when municipalities aren\u2019t meeting set criteria to alleviate their debts. Local governments will be charged with remedying any evidence of underfunding. \n\u201cThis system provides an early warning for local jurisdictions each year and maintains local control if a fix is needed,\u201d\u009d Garc\u00ed\u00ada said. \u201cIrresponsible communities need to be examined so that promises made to police and fire for their retirement and health care benefits are kept. That is why this bill is so important and why I voted in support of it.\u201d\u009d \nHouse Bill 5298 and companion legislation advance to the Senate for consideration.

Even though we just wouldn't work out.\"\r\n[21:58]\t<Stevimaru>\t\"Oh, she was interested romantically, huh?\"\r\n[21:59]\t<Happymancer>\t\"Yes, beyond just stress relief or comfort.\"\r\n[21:59]\t<Stevimaru>\t\"Oh, huh...\"\r\n[22:00]\t<Stevimaru>\t\"Why do you say you wouldn't have worked out?\"\r\n[22:02]\t<Happymancer>\t\"What's the most innocent pokemon you can think of, like a cherrim.\"\r\n[22:03]\t<Stevimaru>\t\"I would have said Chansey or something but then I met Sumoto.\"\r\n[22:03]\t<Stevimaru>\t\"But go on.\"\r\n[22:03]\t<Happymancer>\t\"It's cute, it's friendly, it's smart in some cases, but you just can't throw it into something like a deep lake, as it can't comprehend the dangers that holds.\"\r\n[22:04]\t<Happymancer>\t\"Even if it wants to jump in, eager to experience what it's found out about the edge of the lake.\"\r\n[22:05]\t<Stevimaru>\t\"In other words, you think she couldn't have handled everything about you.\"\r\n[22:05]\t<Happymancer>\t\"Probably.\"\r\n[22:05]\t<Stevimaru>\t\"Your past with Sol, your powers flaring up like that...\"\r\n[22:06]\t<Stevimaru>\t\"Mm.\"\r\n[22:06]\t<Happymancer>\t\"I've done my best to hide most of my flaws from them, Phil knows, Grover knows, Maya knows, Calibos and Daphnae don't.\"\r\n[22:06]\t<Happymancer>\t\"None of them know the full past.\"\r\n[22:06]\t<Stevimaru>\t\"I guess I can understand why you'd want to keep her at arm's length.

Hm.\"\r\n[22:19]\t<Happymancer>\t\"He needed a mystic to help him search for something.\"\r\n[22:20]\t<Stevimaru>\t\"Well, I imagine he's in good hands then.\"\r\n[22:20]\t<Happymancer>\tShe snorts, \"If you had tried to get your hands on Daphnae I might have taken you out back and used the old whipping post.\"\r\n[22:20]\t* Stevimaru\tlaughs.\r\n[22:20]\t<Happymancer>\t\"Without knowing you, I mean.\"\r\n[22:22]\t<Stevimaru>\t\"Also, you have a whipping post?

(AP) \u2014 The mother of former NBA player Lorenzen Wright stood up Thursday during a court hearing for a man charged with killing him and shouted, \u201cHow could you have murdered my son?\u201d\nWearing a red sweater with a drawing of her son\u2019s face on it, Deborah Marion made the outburst during an arraignment for Billy R. Turner in a Memphis courtroom. Judge Lee Coffee told her he would not allow another such interruption, but he did not charge her with contempt of court.\nTurner was indicted Tuesday on a first-degree murder charge. His bail is set at $1 million. Turner told the judge that he was planning to hire an attorney and Coffee set a hearing for Tuesday.\nWright\u2019s body was found in a swampy field in suburban Memphis on July 28, 2010, 10 days after the 34-year-old was reported missing. He was shot multiple times. The seven-year investigation into his death has been one of the Memphis Police Department\u2019s most high-profile unsolved cases.\nMost Read Stories Seahawks broadcaster and former Husky star Warren Moon sued for sexual harassment If sexual harassment and misconduct allegations are true, Warren Moon is finished | Matt Calkins Neil deGrasse Tyson responds, says Seahawks' lateral was just the 'Galilean transformation' Saying goodbye to Seattle\u2019s beloved 13 Coins Say what?

Although 2019 may seem like a long way off for most, the 2019 UG prospectus will be appearing at a recruitment event near you from March. \nWe\u2019ve been co-ordinating the list of courses that we offer, placing bets on how many times I will have to re-do the flat plan this year (my guess is eight \u2013 I\u2019ll keep you updated), and liaising with various departments across the University to ensure that all of the information we hold is correct and up-to-date. \nOne of my favourite aspects of working on the prospectuses is working with the photographers to capture new images. We work with two freelance photographers ( Roy Meta and Scene ) who capture a range of images for us, from profile shots, to shots of students in situ. \nIt\u2019s great to be able to get into some of the sessions and see first-hand what our students are working on, as well as the facilities available. This year we were able to see the new nursing simulation labs at both Luton and Bedford, and had the opportunity to explore the Forest School at our Bedford campus. We also had the opportunity to see some of our media and dance students in action. \nThis year we have renewed the profiles for most of the subject areas within the prospectus too. This provides us with a great opportunity to meet with some of our students and talk to them about their experiences at Bedfordshire, which we can then use to influence future communications. \nWe\u2019ve also been getting into the Christmas spirit here in the Marketing department with Christmas jumpers and inflatable Christmas characters galore! As this will be my last blog before the holidays I'd like to wish you all happy holidays and I will see you in the New Year!  \nSara Marketing Officer ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roy meta", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "forest school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bedford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luton", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bedfordshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bedford", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:31.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df896bd57e417716236119b95d94d2a310468668", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0kR6z40hO8sKrs2mJivcFF", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=steven spielberg", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "steven%20spielberg News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "10 Celebrities Named in the Communist Scare | Mental Floss", "title_full": "10 Celebrities Named in the Communist Scare | Mental Floss : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-11-29T12:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df896bd57e417716236119b95d94d2a310468668", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0kR6z40hO8sKrs2mJivcFF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mental Floss", "published": "2017-11-29T12:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "10 Celebrities Named in the Communist Scare | Mental Floss", "text": "To millions, Norman Rockwell's name carries the warmth of nostalgia.

Headsets, speakers, and earphones continue to get louder and more immersive but are they more experiential? Over the past five years wires have been removed and design has become more attractive but experience has yet to advance; until one company came to rescue. Sabinetek as a official partner with Qualcomm, has multiple patents and already delivered successful acoustic solutions to many industry giants in China. Next month, Sabinetek will exhibit at CES 2018 as Innovation Awards Honoree to release its brand new product MIKE. MIKE, a new portable microphone, is changing the way we produce and record sound. Unlike traditional microphones which transfer file after the recording, MIKE can transfer data with mobile phone in real-time. This function makes all the difference among the microphone category because functions are not experience. Functions such as stereo sound quality, long distant recording, powerful editing APP, and noise suppression technology are needed together and at the same time. Real-time transmission technology enriches MIKE to replace the mic on mobile phone to make that experience happens. The product comes with an accessory that makes it easily attachable to the musical instrument that the user plays with; another accessory, a hand band, allows the user to wear it while playing certain instruments when needed to (for instance: saxophone, violin), to catch the closest source of the sound. Whether a musician, a speaker, educator, reporter, or everyday person MIKE can be used to create a better experience. Music and composers can compose to record demos whenever they feel inspired using the high-quality recording and immediate app sharing function will dramatically improve their production process. Presenters, reporters, and educators can experience the freedom of hands free recordings in real time, taking their listeners even closer to sound. The average Joe can easily record moments and laughs experienced while traveling and throughout life; creating a track record of the amazing memories that shape our life. With the product\u2019s function being fully recognized, the product will likely bring about a revolution to the listening experiences of serious-music-lovers or sound-quality-cravers, and many more.

By: PTI | New Delhi | Published: December 7, 2017 2:51 PM Some of the India-centric features developed by the local teams include S-bike mode and Ultra Data Saving mode for smartphones and ActivWash+ for washing machines. (Reuters) \nSamsung India plans to hire 1,000 graduates from top engineering colleges across the country in 2018 with over 300 of them coming in from various IITs, a top company official said. A majority of these engineers are expected to be hired for new-age domains like artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), biometrics, natural language processing, augmented reality and networks including 5G. Apart from IITs, Samsung will also be hiring talent from premier institutes like Delhi College of Engineering, BITS Pilani, Manipal Institute of Technology and IIITs among others. \u201cSamsung is extremely bullish on R&D in India. We have been here for over 22 years. The three R&D centres in India work on several cutting-edge technologies,\u201d Samsung Global SVP and MD of Samsung R&D Institute India, Bengaluru Dipesh Shah told PTI. He added that the India centres not only work on innovation for Indian consumers but also contribute to global products. \nSome of the India-centric features developed by the local teams include S-bike mode and Ultra Data Saving mode for smartphones and ActivWash+ for washing machines. \u201cSamsung R&D centres in India have worked on several global products of Samsung, including the high-end camera modules for flagship smartphones, intelligent interface Bixby that was launched with Galaxy S8 and Samsung Pay,\u201d Shah said. Last year, the Korean company had hired 800 engineers for its R&D facilities, out of which 300 were from IITs. \nSamsung has three R&D centres in India at Bengaluru (largest outside Korea), Noida and Delhi. Globally, it has a total of 32 R&D centres. While the Bengaluru centre has expertise in areas like AI, ML and IoT, the Noida facility plays key role in development of biometrics, mobile software development, multimedia and data security. The Delhi centre works primarily on research related to high-end televisions, other consumer electronics products as well as Samsung\u2019s operating system, Tizen. No Comments.
