The report, titled \u201c Drill Pipe Market \u2013 Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Trends, Analysis, Growth, and Forecast 2017\u20132025,\u201d presents methodical presentation of every key element of this market, with prime focus on reigning trends, key opportunities, threats, and the competitive landscape of the market. \nThe report states that the rising demand for energy on a global front and the consecutive rise in offshore oil and gas exploration activities are some of the key factors acting in the favor of the market. Massive advancements in drilling technologies in the recent years, leading to the introduction of technologies such as horizontal drilling and pad drilling, have also fuelled the overall development of the global drill pipe market in the recent years. These factors are also expected to act as key growth drivers for the market in the next few years. \nHowever, the unsteady costs of crude oil in the global marketplace are countering the growth prospects of the global drill pipe market. The massive drop in crude oil costs in the recent past has led to a steady reduction in rig rental costs in the offshore drilling industry. Customers have been enjoying a strong bargaining power on account of the downward cost pressures. This could continue to rein in market in the next few years. \nThe onshore oil and gas exploration sector is expected to provide promising growth opportunities for the drill pipe market owing to the rising growth opportunities in the fields of coal bed methane, shale reserves, and tar sands. Moreover, the continuous rise in global consumption of petroleum is also expected to create growth opportunities for the global drill pipe market in the near future. \nIn the near future, the segment of premium grade drill pipe is expected to emerge as one of the most promising product segment owing to the vast rise in exploration activities in deepwater and ultra deepwater areas in regions such as Africa and Europe, where vast reserves of oil and gas have been discovered in offshore regions. \nFrom a geographical standpoint, the market in North America is presently a key contributor of revenue to the global market owing to the thriving shale gas exploration and production sector in the U.S. The burgeoning industry has significantly benefitted the drill pipe market in the recent past and is expected to continue doing so in the future years as well. The market in Canada is also highly promising and will make further progress over the report\u2019s forecast period. \nThe markets in Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific are highly promising owing to the presence of vast reserves and rising demand for oil and gas. The Asia Pacific market, however, will dominate in terms of growth rate, powered mostly by the market in China. \nThe report also presents a snapshot of the competitive landscape of the global drill pipe market, providing detailed analysis of the market\u2019s developmental backdrop and the role of key vendors and developments in shaping its current state. A detailed financial profile of some of the key vendors in the global drill pipe market is also included in the report, including Oil Country Tubular Limited, Vallourec S.A., TMK Group, Tenaris S. A, Superior Manufacturing, National Oilwell Varco, Hilong Group of Companies, Drill Pipe International, DP Master, Jiangyin Long Bright, Texas Steel Conversion, Inc., and Tejas Tubular Products, Inc. \nGet Sample Copy of this Report", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "national oilwell varco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drill pipe international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas steel conversion, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oil country tubular limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global industry analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tenaris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hilong group of companies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tmr research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tmk group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tejas tubular products, inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vallourec s.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "superior manufacturing", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jiangyin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:46.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3ee76206fd3149cc2727350613f7955b632b34f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOp0wr_ZzDXeQVHO5UHidPd_Hi7ogv7UGxyZCTU6mmWLByzjSxYz2Pfz7Qu4Wq2BOhM-", "site_full": "sell.foodmate.com", "site": "foodmate.com", "site_section": "http://www.foodmate.com/feed/rss.php?mid=5", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Selling Leads-Global FoodMate", "title": "High Resolution Indoor Display", "title_full": "High Resolution Indoor Display", "published": "2017-12-07T11:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3ee76206fd3149cc2727350613f7955b632b34f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOp0wr_ZzDXeQVHO5UHidPd_Hi7ogv7UGxyZCTU6mmWLByzjSxYz2Pfz7Qu4Wq2BOhM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "High Resolution Indoor Display", "text": "Product Details Our process begins with your vision.

The constant rise in affluent people globally is expected to continue to reflect positively on the consumer-base of leisure boats and luxury yachts in the next few years as well, driving the market for marine sealants. \nWhile the market has mostly positive growth prospects, its potential growth dynamics in the next few years could be negatively affected to a certain extent owing to the sluggish economic expansion of several key nations involved in marine trade and shipbuilding activities. The reduction in volumes of imports and exports through the marine transport line owing to these factors could act a negative force for the global marine sealants market, reining in its future growth. Moreover, constant fluctuations in the costs of raw materials and freight rates could also negatively impact the overall development of the global shipbuilding industry, thus hampering the expansion of the global marine sealants market to a certain extent in the near future. \nThe report presents an overview of the marine sealants market and its growth prospects across regions such as North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and Middle East and Africa. The report states that of these markets, the market in Europe is presently one of the most prominent regional markets for marine sealants owing to the well-established yacht building and marine transport industries in the region. Presence of some of the world\u2019s leading international marine ports in the region could also add to its growth potential in the near future. However, the Europe marine sealants market could be challenged due to sluggish economic development of several countries and strict emission-relations norms that are compelling the shift towards costlier but cleaner bio-based products. \nOver the report\u2019s forecast period, the report states that the market in Asia Pacific could emerge as one of the most promising regional markets for marine sealants. Factors such as the steady expansion of the region\u2019s shipbuilding industry and a significant rise in marine trade in the region in the recent past owing to the massive rise in demand for oil and gas products are also likely to drive the market for marine sealants in the region. \nThe report states that the global marine sealants market features a highly competitive vendor landscape owing to several large and small players on international as well as regional levels. Owing to the increased demand for bio-based products across key regional markets, companies are focusing on the development of cleaner and greener products. The trend is likely to remain strong in the future years as well. Some of the leading companies in the global marine sealants market are Henkel AG & Company, H.B. Fuller, 3M, Illinois Tool Works Inc, Royal Adhesives & Sealants, Avery Dennison, RPM International Inc., H.B. Fuller, Sika AG, and Franklin International. \nGet Sample Copy of this Report", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avery dennison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "h.b. fuller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "luxury yachts driving demand for marine sealants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tmr research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global industry analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois tool works inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sika ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "3m", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rpm international inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal adhesives & sealants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franklin international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henkel ag & company", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:46.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5cf262660fbb6e29af7d6fdc557758a7f82079b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSR9W.wFDnU_SWHaMYSEXcD_H_u15ezSUZzlKAIKnTrkzAVOphtJnYYNQg2Zn26ZjZjomwRtKE8UeOafeWn.eQeCeO4rQZiTsepa11OzLL7XA--", "site_full": "richmondin.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://richmondin.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "craigslist richmond, IN | for sale search", "title": "CJ-YJ 2 inch lift kit heavy duty shackles (Winchester) $50", "title_full": "CJ-YJ 2 inch lift kit heavy duty shackles (Winchester) $50", "published": "2017-12-07T03:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/01111_8jHoDTaBqXZ_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5cf262660fbb6e29af7d6fdc557758a7f82079b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSR9W.wFDnU_SWHaMYSEXcD_H_u15ezSUZzlKAIKnTrkzAVOphtJnYYNQg2Zn26ZjZjomwRtKE8UeOafeWn.eQeCeO4rQZiTsepa11OzLL7XA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T03:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "CJ-YJ 2 inch lift kit heavy duty shackles (Winchester) $50", "text": "( google map ) QR Code Link to This Post These are well constructed heavy duty 8 inch shackles.

Getty Images The Rubik\u2019s cube, which was invented by Erno Rubik in 1974 and gained popularity in the 1980s What is a Rubik\u2019s cube and who invented it? \nA Rubik\u2019s cube is a 3D-combination puzzle that sees coloured squares printed on the side of a cube. \nThe aim of the quiz is to get all of the colours on each side of the cube to match up. \nIt was invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and architecture professor Erno Rubik, who originally called it the Magic Cube. \nBut its name was changed to the Rubik\u2019s cube shortly after became one of the best selling toys of the 1980s. \nMore than 30 years on, people still love the brainteasing puzzle and more than 350million cubes have been sold worldwide. \nPeople even take part in Rubik\u2019s cube competitions to see who can solve them in the quickest time. Getty Images People are often left baffled over how to solve the notoriously difficult 3D puzzle How can I solve a Rubik\u2019s cube? \nThere are several ways in which you can solve a Rubik\u2019s cube. But experts agree that this is the best way. \n1. Arrange the cube so the side facing up has a cross made from white cubes with the side of the cross having matching colours. \n2. Then insert the rest of the white cubes to complete the first layer of the cube \u2013 meaning it is all white in colour. \n3. After making all the edges correct this means the first two layers of the cube should be completed. \n4. Then flip the cube over and repeat the process but instead of making a white cross, make a yellow cross. \n5. Again move the top edges around so that they match all of the sides. \n6. Move the corners so that they match up and flip any edges until all sides of the cube are correct. What is the record time for solving a Rubik\u2019s cube? \nThe shortest time in which someone has solved a Rubik\u2019s cube is 4.73 seconds. \nAccording to Guinness World Records, the record was set by Australian student Feliks Zemdges at a competition in Melbourne in December 2016. \nFeliks shaved a hundredth of a second of the previous record set by Dutchman Mats Valk just five weeks earlier.

In association with Aldi. Sponsored By Danni Deibe, Digital Commercial Editor 7th December 2017, 9:17 am WE can\u2019t all be as painstakingly perfect as the families in Christmas adverts when it comes to hosting parties. \nKnowing what to serve with what and how to make it look \u2018artfully thrown together\u2019 takes years of practice and experience. Aldi 6 \nYes we all know that white wine goes with fish and red wine with meat, but in an era of artisan cocktails in jam jars and canapes served on everything but a plate it\u2019s a lot more complicated. \nNot to worry though, we\u2019ve teamed up with Aldi, who have two Good Housekeeping Awards, to show you how you can fake your way from domestic disaster to canape queen in an instant. \nEverything here is already made up at Aldi , all you need to do is pick it up in store and pop it on a pretty plate, and hey presto, you\u2019ve got it nailed. Fish n Fizz \nNothing says party time like a cold glass of fizz . This Christmas step away from the prosecco and head straight for the 2006 Vintage Blanc de Blancs Champagne, \u00a319.99, for something sparkly and special. \nIt goes really well with seafood, which is great, because Aldi\u2019s smoked salmon canapes, \u00a32.99. \nThe light cream cheese and parsley mousse hand-wrapped with Scottish smoked salmon, or bite-sized blinis topped with a cream cheese with a hint of lemon mousse, garnished with strips of smoked Scottish salmon. are the perfect start to Christmas day festivities or for passing around a party. Aldi Smoked salmon canapes are sure to be popular at Christmas Red and Veg \nTraditionally we serve red wine with red meat, and it\u2019s a delicious pairing we\u2019ve been used to since the year dot. But, with 3 times more vegetarians and vegans in the UK now than there were 10 years ago it\u2019s time to start thinking differently. \nAldi\u2019s Argentinian Malbec, \u00a36.29, works a treat with veggie dishes because of its fruity flavour. It goes great with all sorts of vegetarian main courses, and also nibbles like these mini goats cheese and roasted red pepper quiches, \u00a31.39. \nThe specially selected mini quiches are available in a variety of flavours. \nChoose from British Maple Bacon & Barber\u2019s Coastal Cheddar Quiche Lorraine, Wiltshire Ham, West Country Cheddar & Leek or British Goats\u2019 Cheese & Roasted Red Pepper. Aldi These mini quiches are perfect for passing around at parties Cake and Bubbles \nThey say a party without a cake is just a meeting. Well, cake without bubbles just isn\u2019t Christmas! \nThroughout the festive period you\u2019re bound to have friends and family pop in unexpected for a cuppa. Surprise and delight them by keeping this Exquisite Christmas Cake, \u00a39.99 in the cupboard and serve them up a slice of this truly exquisite fruitcake with a glass of prosecco (\u00a312.99 for a magnum of Ca\u2019di Pietra Prosecco DOC). If you don\u2019t need a magnum you can grab a bottle of Belletti Proseco Spumante DOC for just \u00a35.79. You could even have a go at making your own prosecco cocktails. Does anyone fancy a bellini? Aldi It\u2019s not Christmas without cake. Cheese and Port \nIs there a more classic combo than cheese and port? Christmas is a time for tradition and this isn\u2019t one we ever want to break. Aldi\u2019s Classic British Cheese Selection is just \u00a34.49 and is the perfect partner to Maynard\u2019s 10 Year Tawny Port, \u00a39.99. Cheese and port are the natural conclusion to Christmas dinner and best served over board games and cards. \nThe cheese selection includes Cornish Brie, Long Clawson White Stilton & Blueberry, Belton Farm Mature Red Leicester, Shropshire Blue and Coastal Bite Mature Cheddar, so there\u2019s something for everyone. Aldi There\u2019s no pairing quite like cheese and port Champagne and Pudding \nNo matter how many nibbles or courses you eat, there\u2019s always room for pudding! These light, moist, bitsize Christmas puddings, \u00a33.49, come in mulled wine or cherry kirsch flavour and are super sparkly so they\u2019ll look great on a buffet table or canape tray.

Our story picks up where we left off, at the beginning of both the atomic and jet ages. The rugged leather flight jackets that had been rapidly churned out to align with the technologically unprecedented aircraft of World War II had by this point been mostly phased out. \nAt the end of our last article, test pilot Chuck Yeager had broken the sound barrier on October 14, 1947 beginning an entirely new age of flight for the United States Air Force. Within ten years, jets would be capable of flying over 1,000 mph, dramatically shrinking the distance between the now atomically-capable Cold War powers of the USA and USSR. In an age of potential nuclear holocaust, the leather-clad flying aces of World War II seemed suddenly quaint in their propeller-aircraft. Like this? Read these: \u2018Tis the Seasoning \u2013 All About Cast Iron Skillets \nTest pilots of both powers were hurtling across the sky at supersonic speeds and would soon even direct their gaze upwards, out of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Jackets would need to be made to clad the warriors and explorers of a new, terrifying age as they simultaneously prepared to lay waste to their enemy and go boldly where no one had gone before. L-2/ L-2A (1945 \u2013 1949) L-2A Flight Jackets on the two pilots on the right hands side. Image via Cold Smoke Co. \nThe first jacket widely distributed to the pilots of the jet age was the L-2 and despite its place in the history of military aviation, surprisingly little has been written about it. The experts at Buzz Rickson declare that it is \u201cthe most rare of all the U.S. Air Force nylon flying jackets.\u201d The jacket came into being near the end of the war in 1945 and was produced until around 1949. L-2 Flight Jacket. Image vie Buzz Rickson. \nThe reason for the L-2s scarcity is that it was superseded by an Air Force vanity project in the form of the L-2A. The L-2A was exactly the same as the L-2 in almost every regard except it was produced in a color suitably titled \u201cAir Force Blue\u201d in order to further distinguish the nascent USAF from the Army. As rare as the L-2 may be today, its blue brother, the L-2A had an even shorter production run. Major Robert C. Ruby doing some sight-seeing in his L-2A jacket. Image via Jet Pilots Overseas. \nThe L-2A arrived in 1950 just as American pilots were engaging in the first jet-on-jet combat in the skies above Korea, but it quickly became clear that a pilot stranded in enemy territory had a much better chance of making it home uncaptured if he was camouflaged in olive drab. Unfortunately enemy territory isn\u2019t Air Force Blue. \nBoth jackets were made from nylon with wool knit collars, cuffs, and waist. The shoulders featured snap down epaulets and the left sleeve had a zip pocket and pen-holders. The last salient detail here is the small triangular snap at the waist, something important to look for later. \nSo similar are the L-2 and L-2A that the Buzz Rickson repros are exactly the same price on the History Preservation website. You can make either one yours for $410. MA-1 (1950 \u2013 1990) (Left to Right) L-2 and MA-1 Flight Jackets. You can tell by the missing epaulets. Image via Jet Pilots Overseas. \nThe next flight jacket, the MA-1, arrived in the cockpits of the same Korean War pilots around 1949 or 1950. What would prove to be another of the most beloved designs on the list was closely based on the B-15 jacket, albeit without the large fur collar. \nWhile the MA-1 closely resembles the L-2 and L-2A jackets in color (the daring Air Force Blue and more conservative Olive Drab) and substance (high quality nylon with wool collar, cuff, and waist), upon closer inspection, there are a few minor changes. The MA-1 has no snap down epaulets on the shoulders, nor does it have the small triangular flap pockets that clasps closed at the center front of the waist band. Although these differences are minute, the MA-1 looks somehow more somber and more serious. Perhaps it\u2019s then appropriate that these would be worn by the pilots conducting two of the most devastating American bombing campaigns in military history, those of the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Real McCoy\u2019s MA-1 Flight Jacket. Image via The Real McCoy\u2019s. \nThe MA-1 would remain in service until the 1980s and due to its lighter-weight nature, was a layering piece that quickly became popular for non-military folks as well. You can get your dirty, civilian hands on your own repro for $883 at The Real McCoy\u2019s . MA-2 or CWU 36/P and 45/P (1972 \u2013 Present) Brig. Gen William H. Best, Jr. shakes hands with two pilots in MA-2 jackets. \nUh oh, folks. Guess what the Air Force learned? Nylon burns. And what had the Air Force made the last several flight jackets out of? Why nylon, unfortunately. \nThis rather concerning technical issue was resolved in 1972 with the adoption of the MA-2 flight jacket, also known as the CWU jacket, which was made in two variations, the lightweight 36/P and more insulated 45/P. CWU stands for Cold Weather Uniform, but the new flight jacket was of course much more than that, the Nomex fabric from which it was made was flame retardant! That\u2019s not all, Nomex also protects against chemical threats and to a degree, even radiation. \nThe 36/P was lighter-weight and the 45/P heavier, but they were fundamentally the same. But with the jackets\u2019 new material, came two major design changes, namely the addition of large cargo pockets and the new rounded collar. The cuffs and waist stayed knit and the fit stayed largely the same, but it is the first of the late twentieth century flight jackets to be immediately recognizably different from the knit collar and slash pockets design. The collar of the MA-2 jacket peaks out from beneath this pilot\u2019s gear. Image via Stripes. \nThe MA-2, in both its weights, is still the active duty flight jacket for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy. Alpha Industries was first contracted to make these jackets for the Air Force in 1996 and they offer military-spec versions of the CWU 36/P and the CWU 45/P for $850.

Al Worden, above, missed his jacket so much after it wore out that he set out to recreate the original. Neil Armstrong in the Apollo Flight Jacket. Image via The RPF. \nThe astronauts wore these jackets in training missions, flying in supersonic jets or visiting the far reaches of earth to study geology they might encounter on the moon. \nThe jacket is an absolutely delightful mix of all of the jackets discussed from the postwar era. It features a classic collar and front zip and is complemented by slash pockets with a clasping flap and the small triangular detail on the waist from the L-2. The fact that these pilots had no fear of landing in enemy territory allowed for a more vibrant blue and a lower weight cotton shell, although a \u201cflame orange\u201d rayon interior could be reversed if a pilot was downed and needed assistance. The jacket also features the arm pocket and the ubiquitous cuff and waist knitting, except in this edition, they serve as contrasting details, colored a darker blue.

Image via Collectspace. \nNew clothing brand, Still The Right Stuff , was founded by Al Worden and a friend with the mission of making a 100% accurate reproduction of his favorite jacket. The textiles and dyes were reproduced and hardware was found from the original NASA contractor. Available for pre-order from for \u00a3375 Simmons Bilt . \nThis jacket feels like an appropriate way to close the second chapter of a century\u2019s military fashion history. As humanity climbed relentlessly higher into our atmosphere and eventually even out of orbit, our clothes came with us, rising to the challenge. With the exception of a few flammable flukes, the flight jackets of America\u2019s pilots have become some of the most practical and sought-after clothing items of all time. \nNo matter the outcome, be it victory or defeat, science or war, the flight jackets of the twentieth century reflect the exponential technological advances made since the dark ages of the Wright Flyer. Within their fibers there is still some of that magic of those early days of flight and the heroism of the first of us bold enough to take to the sky.

marking the loss of two local men. comments NEW BEDFORD \u2014 The loss of two fishermen in the sinking of a clamming boat this week stunned this port city long familiar with the dangers of the sea.\nNew Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell called the Misty Blue tragedy \u201ca stark reminder of the dangers inherent in commercial fishing,\u201d adding that it \u201cunderscores the respect and appreciation we have for those who make their living at sea.\u201d\nHe said the city pledges its support for the families of the lost crew members of the Misty Blue \u2014 Jonathan Saraiva and Michael Roberts.\nFred Toomey, president of the New Bedford Port Society, said the memory of lost mariners most recently took the form of a service at the nonprofit\u2019s Seamen\u2019s Bethel, where the names of seamen lost are engraved on large marble tablets and displayed for family and the fishing community to remember.\n\u201cThree weeks ago, we added six names,\u201d Toomey said \u2014 three for sailors lost in 2016, two who were lost this year, and one from 1955.\nThe tablets in the chapel hold the names of more than 400 seamen lost since the 1830s, a list written in stone that\u2019s read out every Memorial Day in New Bedford.\n\u201cWe are trying to bring them closure,\u201d Toomey added. \u201cThey know there\u2019s no grave markers. There\u2019s no body.

The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which called for the U.S. Embassy to be moved to Jerusalem, passed by a large bipartisan margin and was strongly supported by Jewish-American groups. \n\"It's been the consensus mainline view for decades,\" said Nathan Diament, executive director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, \"because Jerusalem is the capital city for Israel and the Jewish people. ... The United States puts its embassies in capital cities, and it's unjust and discriminatory to say we're going to single out Israel as the one country where we don't put our embassy [in the capital].\" \nWhen President Trump on Wednesday ordered the State Department to begin preparations to move the embassy to Jerusalem, several Jewish-American groups welcomed the move. \n\"By stating the truth of Jerusalem's status as the capital of the State of Israel, President Trump has asserted U.S. global leadership towards ending a longstanding, senseless anomaly,\" said David Harris, chief executive officer of the American Jewish Committee. \nThe Anti-Defamation League, while urging a \"rapid resumption\" of peace negotiations, called the move a \"significant step,\" coming at a time \"when international organizations and other detractors delegitimize the Jewish state and deny any Jewish connection to the holy city.\" \nBut there were also misgivings from some Jewish-American groups. The Reform Jewish Movement, representing nearly 900 congregations, noted that it has long supported the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital but also believed that moving the U.S. Embassy there should happen only \"at the right time.\" Without a comprehensive peace plan, the movement said it cannot support the president's decision to move the embassy now. \nConservative evangelical Christian leaders had fewer qualms. \n\"This decision will be met by political praise and theological conviction,\" said Johnnie Moore, an informal spokesman for Trump's evangelical advisory group. \"Evangelicals in every corner of the United States will be ecstatic,\" he said. \nEvangelicals feel a special kinship with Jerusalem as the city where they believe Jesus Christ was crucified and rose again. Some sects even take an eschatological view, arguing that Jesus will return to Earth in Jerusalem, once all Jews are reunited there. \nFor Trump's evangelical advisory group, said Moore, the only issue more important than the status of Jerusalem is the question of who will be appointed as federal judges. \n\"In our various meetings with the White House, this issue has always come up,\" Moore said. \"And it has always been an extended discussion around the table. I mean, at the heart of the relationship between the United States and Israel has been the friendship between evangelical Christians and the Jewish people.\" \nSome evangelical leaders who generally support the president's Jerusalem decision, however, fear the repercussions for their own Palestinian Christian followers. Muslim leaders in the Palestinian territories have warned there will be a reaction there to the president's announcement. The governments of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey all expressed alarm at Trump's decision, as did Muslim leaders in the U.S. \n\"The reality is that Palestinians have existed for generations on the land of Palestine [and] in Jerusalem,\" said Osama Abuirshaid, a board member of the American Muslims for Palestine, at a news conference near the White House. \"[Trump] cannot deny this reality,\" Abuirshaid said. \"He spoke about the Jewish connection to Jerusalem while negating the Christian and Muslim connection to the land and to the holy city.\" \nPope Francis advised against \"adding new elements of tension in a world already shaken and scarred by many cruel conflicts.\" The heads of several Christian churches in Jerusalem, in a joint letter to Trump, said a unilateral change in the status of Jerusalem by the U.S. government \"will yield increased hatred, conflict, violence, and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land ... [and] cause irreparable harm.\" \nA similar warning came from Elizabeth Eaton, the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran group in the U.S. \n\"This announcement,\" Eaton said, \"has a high probability of leading to violence and bloodshed and not ... getting any closer to having the two parties come to the table again.\" \nEaton spoke following a meeting in Geneva with fellow Lutheran chuch leaders from around the world, including those in Jordan and other Arab countries.

And the bills would do so without repealing the so-called \"stepped-up basis\" provision. \nOrdinarily, people have to pay taxes when they sell off assets that have appreciated in value, like shares of stock or real estate. But heirs are exempted from that tax. That's because they already pay the estate tax. \nThe bills approved by Congress recently would eliminate or reduce the estate tax, while leaving the exemption in place. \nIn other words, you would be able to pass on assets that have gained a lot in value \u2014 like those Apple shares you bought years ago \u2014 and, unlike everyone else, your heirs never have to pay tax on the appreciation. \nTo put it another way: Someone could inherit her grandfather's large beachfront mansion without paying estate tax, and sell it off right away without paying any capital gains tax. \nIt's a much more generous policy than previous tax overhauls, says Lily Batchelder, a professor of law and public policy at New York University Law School. \n\"We've never seen a proposal like this,\" she says. \"I don't recall ever seeing a proposal that would both fully repeal the estate tax and fully exempt from tax all the accrued gains on these giant estates.\" \nThe bill passed by the Senate early Saturday would double the exemption on large estates, allowing people to pass on estates worth $11 million to their heirs tax-free. \nThe exemption for married couples would be $22 million. The House bill would gradually reduce the estate tax and then scrap it altogether in 2023. \nHouse and Senate leaders are now trying to reconcile the two versions of the tax overhaul, with a vote expected by the end of the month. \nThe estate tax has long been the bane of conservatives. Congress briefly eliminated the tax in 2010, but it came back the following year and remains in place today. \n\"We just think it's unfair. Death should not be a taxable event. And we should not be stopping people from being able to pass their life's work on to their kids,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox News recently. \nThe estate tax brings in a relatively small amount of money to the federal Treasury, about $19 billion a year, even as it hurts the large economy, says Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation. \nBecause of the tax, people end up pouring money into tax shelters and paying hefty bills to tax lawyers, he says. \nThe tax is especially onerous for assets that may be worth a lot on paper but are cash poor, such as certain kinds of businesses, Hodge says. In some cases, heirs have to break up or sell businesses to pay taxes, he says. \nPeople who want to keep the tax say such cases are extremely rare. They also say that at a time of growing income inequality, the estate tax plays an important role in making the economy fair. \n\"The estate tax is basically a way of partially leveling the playing field, so that these heirs of massive estates don't have quite as gigantic a leg up in life,\" Batchelder says.

The House and Senate have passed bills that would eliminate or reduce the tax that people pay when they inherit large estates - larger than $5.5 million. It's part of the massive tax overhaul legislation that is in its final stages in Congress right now. And even though Republicans have tried for years to scale back this tax, NPR's Jim Zarroli says this effort goes further. \nJIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The last time the estate tax was repealed, the move was temporary. During the George W. Bush administration, Congress gradually reduced the tax and then ended it altogether in 2010. But the tax came back the next year and remains in place today. Now Republicans are pushing a permanent repeal. Here was House Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News recently. \n(SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS BROADCAST) \nPAUL RYAN: We just think it's unfair. Death should not be a taxable event, and we should not be stopping people from being able to pass their life's work onto their kids. \nZARROLI: This time, Republicans could get their way. The bill approved by the Senate would double the estate tax exemption, which means many fewer people would have to pay it. The House version would reduce the tax and then scrap it in 2023. And these bills would be more generous to heirs than previous repeal attempts because of a provision in the tax code. That provision means, if you have an asset that's climbed a lot in value over the years, like your Apple stock or a Warhol print, you can leave it to your heirs, and they don't have to pay taxes on the appreciation. New York University law professor Lily Batchelder says this goes beyond previous repeal bills. \nLILY BATCHELDER: It would really mean that these giant estates - a lot of them would have never been taxed under the income tax, and then there no longer would be an estate tax. \nZARROLI: Critics of the estate tax, like Scott Hodge of the Tax Foundation, point out that it only raises about $19 billion for the Treasury each year, but it hurts the economy. \nSCOTT HODGE: Its effect on the economy is outsized, in terms of what it does to change people's decision-making, in terms of the kind of investments they make, how they set up their affairs and other things. And so it can have a pretty serious consequence on economic growth. \nZARROLI: Hodge says the estate tax encourages people to spend money on tax lawyers and tax shelters. He says it can be really burdensome for people who inherit assets that are worth a lot but are cash poor, like certain kinds of businesses, so people who inherit them may be forced to break them up or sell them off. But people who want to keep the estate tax point out that such cases are really rare. NYU's Lily Batchelder says the estate tax has an important function. \nBATCHELDER: The estate tax is basically a way of partially leveling the playing field so that these heirs of massive estates don't have quite as gigantic a leg up in life. \nZARROLI: That's important, she says, at a time of growing inequality. But if the repeal effort fails, it could be less about the wealth gap than the budget deficit. Numerous analysts say the tax overhaul will increase government debt. That means Republicans could once again be forced to reduce the estate tax but not eliminate it altogether.

Sambani is with the Under-20 national team in Zambia \n\u201cWe have a two-year agreement with Namiwawa for Precious [Sambani] and Francisco [Madinga] which stipulates that we should be paying K500 000 for each player for each season,\u201d he said. \nButao said the payment of the loan fee was delayed because the players joined outside their budget. \nHe said: \u201cWe already paid for Madinga, but we delayed to pay for Sambani because we had to use other means to source money to pay Namiwawa. \n\u201cIt should also be mentioned that apart from paying Namiwawa, there is also money we agreed to be paying the players.\u201d \nNamiwawa FC official Sylus Liwindo confirmed that the Nomads had settled the outstanding loan fee for Sambani. \n\u201cThey indeed paid the outstanding loan fee last week which will help us to pay players\u2019 outstanding dues. We are grateful to Wanderers for heeding our call,\u201d he said. \nMeanwhile, both players are with the Malawi Under-20 national football teams at Council For Southern Africa Football Associations

But Trinity Samden\u2019s adventure crashed when she was just 16 years old. \n\u201cI lost hope,\u201d she says. \u201cI just wanted to find other ways of surviving in order to fend for myself. I was ready to take risks that would endanger my life.\u201d \nAt 20, she has a four-year-old child. She was impregnated by a fellow teenager before they sat Primary School Leaving Certificate Examinations (PLSCE) at Senzani Primary School in Ntcheu. Trinity: Going back to school is the best decision I made \n\u201cThe future looked bleak. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I could have done anything to survive,\u201d she says. \nFour years on, Trinity is putting her life back on track. \nThanks to the re-admission policy, the girl, who re-enrolled, is in Form Four at New Vision Private Secondary School in the district. \nShe is one of learners in poverty supported by World Vision Malawi (WVM) through Senzani Community Development Organisation (Secodo) mother group. \nThe concerned mothers traced the teen mother and convinced her to return to school. \n\u201cI never thought of returning to school. But this is the best decision I made. I am happy and my mother is always eager to support me,\u201d she says. \nThe mother group, trained by World Vision, promotes girls\u2019 education through a Get Back to School Project. \nIt is also credited with halving the number of girls dropping out of school in the past decade. \n\u201cWe have realised that teen mothers have a full life ahead of them, but the future looks scary without education,\u201d says Secodo chairperson Patricia Biliati. \nConvincing a girl\u2019s parents and husband to let her get back to school is not easy. \n\u201cWe first approach the parents to find out what they think about their daughter\u2019s future. Some support our vision as was the case with Trinity whose mother pays school fees for her. Others need more time,\u201d she says. \nThe initiative is stimulating interest among girls to return to school. \nNew Vision Secondary School director Fanwell Katete says about 90 percent of teen mothers learning at the institution study harder \u201cto make it big in life\u201d than their younger classmates. \n\u201cI have been a patron before and I offer counseling and guidance skills. When I feel they are not concentrating on their studies, I encourage them to remain in school and push harder,\u201d Katete says. \nWorld Vision has been running various projects to improve access to quality education in Senzani since 1983. \nApart from the Get Back to School Initiative and bursaries, the inroads include construction of teachers\u2019 houses and school blocks. \n\u201cWe celebrate our achievement in working with the parents and leaders of this community in creating a better environment for their children. This is the environment where the children are not just living but thriving,\u201d says World Vision national director Hazel Nyathi. \nThe Christian organisation ended its 34-year-old work in Senzani. \nJames Manyetera, the director of special duties in the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development, commends World Vision for supporting government in changing lives of the rural population. \nHe said teen mothers like Trinity deserve a second chance in life. \n\u201cIt is only through good education that people can become productive citizens of the county and fend for themselves,\u201d says Manyetera. \nSince 1983, the organisation has reached out to almost 46 000 people with different transformative initiatives. \nInterestingly, traditional leaders are buying into the push to ensure girls return to school after falling pregnant. \nFor Trinity, being back in school has rekindled her childhood dream that was almost dead and buried when the burdens of a teen pregnancy almost pushed her into sex work. \nTransactional sex exposes girls to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. \nSays Trinity: \u201cWith education, I can be whatever I want. However, I want to become a journalist, a teacher or a scientist.\u201dn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fanwell katete", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hazel nyathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manyetera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "secodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patricia biliati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james manyetera", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trinity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senzani primary school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world vision", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senzani community development organisation (secodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trinity samden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new vision secondary school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new vision private secondary school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of local government and community development", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ntcheu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katete", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malawi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senzani", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:51.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc3e24526076def9213628f40b1eeb0c09ac1ab8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptFLXyEyJMBcEwQbHZGiSsgdoLBn3.DKBM8mEN55.NrR8PssmkqdzwWDuUabuXbzNJ04miqYc3lCwd8Jkt31opD", "site_full": "mwnation.com", "site": "mwnation.com", "site_section": "http://mwnation.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Nation Online", "title": "Malawi Pen hosts international writers\u2019 workshop", "title_full": "Malawi Pen hosts international writers\u2019 workshop", "published": "2017-12-07T10:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mwnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Msadala.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bc3e24526076def9213628f40b1eeb0c09ac1ab8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptFLXyEyJMBcEwQbHZGiSsgdoLBn3.DKBM8mEN55.NrR8PssmkqdzwWDuUabuXbzNJ04miqYc3lCwd8Jkt31opD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CORRESPONDENT .", "published": "2017-12-07T10:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "Malawi Pen hosts international writers\u2019 workshop", "text": "You Are Here: Home \u2192 Malawi Pen hosts international writers\u2019 workshop Malawi Pen hosts international writers\u2019 workshop 0 Comment \n\nMalawi Pen is hosting a training workshop in project management in Blantyre for African PEN Centres involved in its civil society programme which has attracted 25 participants. \nOrganised by PEN International, the workshop ends tomorrow.

We are in December, the 12th month in the calendar year. Not so long ago we celebrated the dawn of the New Year 2017 on January 1. \nWith each New Year come plans and resolutions individuals and corporate bodies set to achieve. \nMany people set targets to achieve in both their personal and professional life. For entrepreneurs, the goals mostly revolve around growing their businesses and making profits. Working professionals aspire for promotion and set goals such as upgrading their qualifications or indeed working harder than before to impress their superiors to go a notch up the corporate ladder. \nIn personal lives, some households set goals to build houses, buy plots, move into their own houses, have more children or indeed send their children and dependents to good schools. \nI will not ask you how many of the New Year resolutions you have fulfilled. But, at the end of the day, each one of us should do an honest reflection and assessment of the plans set at the start of 2017 and what worked or what did not work. Do not discard the plans that did not work, see where things went wrong and improve. In Chichewa they say pendapenda sikugwa (Fall seven times, stand up eight times; Don\u2019t give up). \nIt is worth appreciating that planning is good and achieving the objectives of the plans is an icing on the cake. \nNearly a decade ago, I read the personal finance management best-seller Rich Dad Poor Dad by one Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It is a simple, but inspiring book on how one can attain financial independence. \nThe book is widely touted to have challenged and changed people\u2019s perception of money and how to spend the same. \nSince publication of the book, Kiyosaki became one of the popular investment and financial advisers for individuals. Today, he runs a series of Rich Dad coaching sessions online, of course at a fee. \nIn under 25 days, the world will bid bye to 2017 forever and usher in yet another New Year, 2018. \nIn our daily lives we mostly strive to attain financial independence. It is important and gives us the peace of mind. In that regard, it is important to get good financial or investment advice as bad financial advice and decisions can cost us more than just money. \nIn one of the Rich Dad coaching series, Kiyosaki wrote: \u201cWhen someone offers you financial advice, you need to ask yourself: \n\u2018Is this person giving me advice to make me rich, or giving me advice to make themselves rich. \n\u201cMy rich dad said: \u2018Most people struggle financially because they take advice from salespeople, not rich people. They take financial advice from salespeople such as stockbrokers and real estate brokers. As my rich dad said: \u2018The reason they are called brokers is because they are broker than you are.\u201d \nTo have a peace of mind and move towards financial independence you need to start investing today, not tomorrow. You do not need to accumulate millions or billions to invest. Make it a habit to save for a rainy day a portion of your earnings. \nIn whatever endeavour you undertake, learn to never depend on single income sources and avoid buying things you do not need. \nWe plan, but God fulfills. Things may not always work out according to our plans. In such situations, when bad things happen in your life, you have three choices.

Police intercept chamba transporters in this file photograph \nAfter a five-kilometre chase, the officers had cornered Banda to a stop. When Banda initially responded that he was carrying stationery from Mzuzu to Lilongwe, the officers expressed reservations even before they inspected the load locked away in the van. \nThat is how the officers found, and impounded, 68 bags of suspected Indian hemp ( chamba) . There was no stationery found. \nMRA, which sets up such patrols based on intelligence information that illicit goods are transported in the wee hours of the night in certain \u2018porous\u2019 areas, handed over the suspected chamba to Lilongwe Police Station on Monday morning. \nLilongwe Police Station spokesperson Kingsley Dandaula said samples of the haul will be sent to Chitedze Research Station for analysis before a charge can be pressed against Banda, who is being kept at the station\u2019s cells. \nDandaula praised MRA for their innovative special patrols nationwide which he said are helping the Malawi Police Service (MPS) in clamping down on criminal activities. \nMRA head of corporate affairs Steve Kapoloma yesterday saluted the police for helping his organisation to put a stop to the movement of illicit goods. \n\u201cOur special patrols, which also target border areas where Indian hemp and other drugs may be easily moved in or outside Malawi through uncharted routes, have proved very successful. This latest catch is proof that we need to work harder in securing our roads and our nation,\u201d he said. n Share This Post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kingsley dandaula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve kapoloma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noel banda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dandaula", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toyota dyna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malawi police service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chitedze research station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lilongwe police station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malawi revenue authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "madisi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lilongwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malawi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:51.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b5c098e2e140dc2331b8a13bccc3f23a3c8389f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptFLXyEyJMBcILAAnBkyg3tzudOXs6SRXV9I2.hYistDXH9JNmWWPN1nDKBtjKyu4uzBniaD_FDMg--", "site_full": "mwnation.com", "site": "mwnation.com", "site_section": "http://mwnation.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Nation Online", "title": "WVM winds up project in Thyolo, donates vehicles", "title_full": "WVM winds up project in Thyolo, donates vehicles", "published": "2017-12-07T10:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mwnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/world-vision.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b5c098e2e140dc2331b8a13bccc3f23a3c8389f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptFLXyEyJMBcILAAnBkyg3tzudOXs6SRXV9I2.hYistDXH9JNmWWPN1nDKBtjKyu4uzBniaD_FDMg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ayami Mkwanda", "published": "2017-12-07T10:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "WVM winds up project in Thyolo, donates vehicles", "text": "You Are Here: Home \u2192 WVM winds up project in Thyolo, donates vehicles WVM winds up project in Thyolo, donates vehicles 0 Comment \n\nWorld Vision Malawi (WVM) has handed over vehicles and other equipment to Thyolo District Council to enable it continue with the nutrition project which the organisation wound up in the district. \nThe equipment, which included three vehicles, nine motorcycles, nine office desks, 13 laptops and chairs and other office accessories, will help the council to sustain the project as WVM bids farewell following the expiry of the project which started in February 2015 up to August 2017.

Victor Cheng writes about a smart tactic that you can use to solve this puzzle. He calls it leadership vacuum. Victor is a former employee of McKinsey, a leading strategy and management consulting firm in the world. Those who want further engagement with Victor can use the link at the bottom to make contact. \n\u2014\u2014\u2013 \nHi Matthews, \nNo organisation is perfect. Gaps always exist. I have made an entire career out of \u2018filling\u2019 gaps, and I think you should too. A market gap exists when customers demand to have a particular problem solved, but suppliers have not caught up. \nNearly all of the interesting marketing opportunities in business centre around this market gap. \nThe more you realise such gaps exist, the more you will look for them. The more you look for them, the more you are likely to pursue them. \nOrganisational charts have gaps too. Most organisations have a chief executive officer with a team of senior executives reporting to her. There is often a chief finance officer, VP of marketing, VP of engineering, and the like. \nWhen organisational charts are drawn up, you see lots of boxes indicating formal roles within departments. \nMost people focus on getting promoted to the next box above them in the organisational chart. I never did. \nInstead of focusing on the boxes that were already there, I always focused on the \u201cwhite space\u201d between the boxes. These were the gaps in organisational staffing. \nBusiness problems do not always neatly fall into categories that only impact a single department like sales, finance or engineering. \nWhen you try to take over the VP of sales\u2019 responsibilities, he is going to object. However, if you take the lead in solving a problem that negatively impacts the sales department, but isn\u2019t solely a sales department issue, rarely does anyone object. \nIt has to do with a concept I call the Leadership Vacuum. A leadership vacuum exists when many people agree a problem exists, it needs to be solved, but there is no obvious person whose responsibility it is to solve the problem. \nIn short, the problem is everybody\u2019s problem and nobody\u2019s problem all at the same time. For example: Customers buy a product and complain the product does not do what the salesperson said it would do. \nThe sales team is upset because this \u201cproduct problem\u201d negatively impacts repeat sales, but the sales department alone cannot change what is in the product. \nCustomer support confirms the complaint is pervasive and costs the department a lot of money in processing support tickets. \nEngineering researches the claim and finds it\u2019s not true. The product does exactly what it is supposed to and as per engineering design. The engineering department concludes the sales team must be \u201coverselling\u201d the product. \nSo, whose job is it to figure out what\u2019s going wrong? In a sense, it is nobody\u2019s job. In another, it is everybody\u2019s. \nThis is a classic example of a leadership vacuum. It is a problem everyone agrees is a problem. \nIt is usually a problem that is messy without an obvious or easy solution. It is a problem everyone wants to go away, but nobody wants to take the lead on because it is not fully their responsibility and they are busy. \nIf you want to grow your network, stretch your skills and rise in your company (without threatening those already in power), you look for leadership vacuums- and you fill them. \nMost organisational charts are designed to solve the most commonly recurring 80 percent of problems. \nSpend your career in the other 20 percent-the annoying stuff that everybody hates, but the organisation isn\u2019t well suited to handle automatically. \nAt every stage of your career, there is always\u2026 and I mean always\u2026 a leadership vacuum somewhere. n Share This Post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "victor cheng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthews", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mckinsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:51.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6814366632cf1e93b404ab57f9205dd76aae008f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptFLXyEyJMBcIfQK2vxx5UCpoNdT2m.FO.xxt6s7vZ.CIM4JjkeKHSagFUfW.LrsA1JPxudAIImAg--", "site_full": "mwnation.com", "site": "mwnation.com", "site_section": "http://mwnation.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Nation Online", "title": "SMEs shun commercial banks, report shows", "title_full": "SMEs shun commercial banks, report shows", "published": "2017-12-07T09:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mwnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sme.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6814366632cf1e93b404ab57f9205dd76aae008f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptFLXyEyJMBcIfQK2vxx5UCpoNdT2m.FO.xxt6s7vZ.CIM4JjkeKHSagFUfW.LrsA1JPxudAIImAg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tinenenji Chalanda", "published": "2017-12-07T09:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "SMEs shun commercial banks, report shows", "text": "You Are Here: Home \u2192 SMEs shun commercial banks, report shows SMEs shun commercial banks, report shows 0 Comment \n\nWhile access to credit seems to be marginally improving in the country, many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) seem to be comfortable borrowing from the informal sector than the formal sector. \nResults from the fourth Integrated Household Survey (IHS4) indicate that out of the 12.5 percent of people that had access to credit during the survey period\u2014 mostly for business start-ups\u2014about 38 percent of the people borrowed from Village Savings and Loans (VSLs) groups compared to only 3.3 percent that borrowed from the formal financial sector. Most SMEs prefer to borrow from the informal sector to banks \nVSLs are an important aspect of financial inclusion and they have helped poor communities to start and expand business, but also increase investments in different areas of their socio-economic status. \nWhile banks and microfinance institutions have provided millions of people of the same services to financial services, provision of access in rural areas remains a major challenge. \nIt is costly for microfinance organisations to reach the rural poor, and as a consequence, the majority of them lack any access to formal financial services. \nBut VSLs have not only dominated the rural areas. \nAccording to IHS4, VSLs provided credit to 39 percent of the people in the rural areas and 35 percent in the urban areas. \nHowever, it has been argued that comparatively, VSLs offer exorbitant interest rates as compared to commercial banks and other money lending institutions. \nThey are said to charge between 10 to 15 percent per month compared to 26.5 percent charged by banks annually. \nIn an interview, Small and Medium Enterprises Association (Smea) president James Chiutsi said the informal sector, apart from providing business services, also offers value- added services including business advisory. \nHe said: \u201cThe informal sector offers more tailor-made solutions and encourages members to work as a team. The VSLs can lend even a start-up enterprise while banks would require a reasonable period of trading before one can qualify to get a loan. \n\u201cThe other reason is that some informal lenders allow members to hold shares in the ventures, which is more enticing. However, SMEs fall prey to loan sharks ( katapila ) who charge in excess of 50 percent interest rate per month. This is rampant and is destroying SMEs.\u201d \nFor the longest time, access to finance by most SMEs has been barred by collateral requirements. But in 2016, Malawi became the third country in sub-Saharan Africa after Ghana and Liberia to establish a modern online collateral registry system to enable businesses and individuals access loans using movable assets. \nBut Chiutsi noted that more needs to be done to educate SMEs on the collateral registry facility. \nRecently, the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) announced that 65 percent, or about K900 billion, of the country\u2019s currency is outside the banking system, a development which might affect the operations of the monetary policy. \nIn an interview, RBM spokesperson Mbane Ngwira said there are several risks involved if businesses transact in the informal sector. \n\u201cWhen you look at development, there is the issue of saving. Banks are supposed to collect all the money and direct it to people who can invest. \n\u201cMoney being outside the banking system means the savings will be low and investments will also be low. This also affects the growth of the economy,\u201d he said. \nIn the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion for 2016-2020, government targets to increase the delivery of financial services at affordable costs to low-income segments of the society from the current 34 percent to 55 percent by 2020. \nIn Malawi, commercial banks remain the largest providers of financial services accounting to more than 50 percent of financial assets, 92 percent of total credit and 89 percent of total deposits. n Share This Post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chiutsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mbane ngwira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james chiutsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "smea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "small and medium enterprises association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of malawi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rbm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "village savings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national strategy for financial inclusion", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "liberia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malawi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghana", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:51.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c23c480045df6b0b5d15abaf6fe9ce7871263a75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOp0wr_ZzDXeQVHO5UHidPd_Hi7ogv7UGxyZCTU6mmWLB8eirzs36jNA.bm64FDzX7c-", "site_full": "sell.foodmate.com", "site": "foodmate.com", "site_section": "http://www.foodmate.com/feed/rss.php?mid=5", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Selling Leads-Global FoodMate", "title": "Women Strappy Back Club Bodycon Dress With Sleeve In 2017 Autumn Spring", "title_full": "Women Strappy Back Club Bodycon Dress With Sleeve In 2017 Autumn Spring", "published": "2017-12-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c23c480045df6b0b5d15abaf6fe9ce7871263a75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOp0wr_ZzDXeQVHO5UHidPd_Hi7ogv7UGxyZCTU6mmWLB8eirzs36jNA.bm64FDzX7c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Women Strappy Back Club Bodycon Dress With Sleeve In 2017 Autumn Spring", "text": "Women Strappy Back Club Bodycon Dress With Sleeve In 2017 Autumn Spring View Original Size Product Details This dress features half sleeve, knee length, o-ring and strappy back bodycon dress.

Kapichila-Banda: Invest inagricultural extenstion \nIn the recent Country Economic Memorandum for Malawi, the World Bank noted that the country continues to spend heavily on coping strategies such as food aid and emergency cash transfers while investing relatively little in mitigation strategies such as irrigation and extension services. \nThe report states that given the various challenges and risks faced by the sector, it is important to allocate more funds for investment purposes, such as market information systems, communication and transport infrastructure and agricultural research. \nIn their concept note for the 2017 annual policy conference, the Civil Society Agriculture Network (CisaNet) noted that the country continues to lack a clear long-term inclusive vision for the sector to guide the development of its medium term frameworks such as the Agriculture Sector Wide Approach and the National Agricultural Investment Plan. \nIn an interview, Farmers Union of Malawi (FUM) president Alfred Kapichira- Banda urged government to invest in agricultural extension services that will enable swift operations of farmers in the rural areas. \n\u201cWe are saying government should remove this demand-driven concept on extension workers. We want to work closely with the extension workers in the rural areas,\u201d he said. \nIn the current budget, 33 percent of the K109 billion allocated to the agriculture sector are loans approved by Parliament. n Share This Post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alfred kapichira- banda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "farmers union of malawi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "civil society agriculture network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "malawi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kapichila-banda", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:51.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27dba63d378dde2c7c341db514bcab2f6be88013", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsK3fCbqUb2mOhVSL84b51sAYxTuDbXgeEIVN85pCPaUuK", "site_full": "community.amd.com", "site": "amd.com", "site_section": "https://community.amd.com/news", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "News | Community", "title": "Computer Froze while installing latest version ... | Community", "title_full": "Computer Froze while installing latest version ... | Community", "published": "2017-12-06T15:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3096, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6aed41f50974e7888f27a2568c62552100f4424b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsK3fCbqUb2mOhVSL84b51sAYxTuDbXgeEIb_hpLLdBEkSnrme9w_Ow0E-", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "atlasminor", "published": "2017-12-07T08:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If your new to the now new DDU interface, try heading to the DDU options , uncheck restore points, and Check Mark Remove all AMD Folder( Not Recommended ) Check box, that way if any old folders are still on the system it will take care of it, also might want to check the boot variables.\nMy spelling is horrible tonight, flex keyboard.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:51.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "841c75eaf6c4fae92b2cd3934c2b3489f311ea1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptFLXyEyJMBcKaodAWngtxapuxigslv_Mez_ZeT_qiaEgtwaOdcIJkLCEaKzl2yD84-", "site_full": "mwnation.com", "site": "mwnation.com", "site_section": "http://mwnation.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Nation Online", "title": "Ministry engages Treasury on BNS woes", "title_full": "Ministry engages Treasury on BNS woes", "published": "2017-12-07T09:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mwnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Francis-Kasaila.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "841c75eaf6c4fae92b2cd3934c2b3489f311ea1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptFLXyEyJMBcKaodAWngtxapuxigslv_Mez_ZeT_qiaEgtwaOdcIJkLCEaKzl2yD84-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Clement Chinoko", "published": "2017-12-07T09:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ministry engages Treasury on BNS woes", "text": "You Are Here: Home \u2192 Ministry engages Treasury on BNS woes Ministry engages Treasury on BNS woes 0 Comment \n\nMinistry of Labour, Youth, Sports and Manpower Development has asked Treasury to allow Bingu National Stadium (BNS) management to be using part of the gate takings share for its operations. \nThe minister responsible, Francis Kasaila, confirmed the development in the wake of financial challenges facing the multi-billion kwacha sports facility which has seen it struggling to pay bills. \nRecently, Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (Escom) disconnected the facility for an outstanding bill of over K22 million. Kasaila: Confirmed the development in the wake of financial challenges \nBNS, which hosts high-profile sports games and other activities, deposits the proceeds like its share of football gate collections and booking fees to government\u2019s main account number one. \nTreasury gives BNS around K3 million every month for its operations which, according to management, is not enough to meet water and electricity bills which total over K8 million every month. \nMeanwhile, Kasaila admitted that the funding towards the stadium is not enough. \nHe said the ministry has since approached Treasury to consider allowing BNS management to be saving part of the money it generates. \n\u201cWe have asked our colleagues in finance to give us more resources or allow us, in the interim, keep some of the resources that we generate from the stadium. If we are allowed to keep some money, then we should be able to pay some of our bills,\u201d he said. \nKasaila also said his ministry has asked Escom to stop billing them as a commercial entity; a system he argued has led to the stadium incurring huge electricity bills. \n\u201cThis stadium is not entirely a commercial entity as Escom has categorised it. We want it to be billed as an ordinary institution because the stadium\u2019s purpose is to serve the public and not run wholly as a company,\u201d he said. \nCommenting on the proposal, Treasury spokesperson Davis Sado said they are in receipt of the proposal, saying: \u201cWe are doing an assessment and we will advise them accordingly on how best they can manage the stadium.

Nomura", "text": "\nAs we approach 2018, there is a broad consensus positive view on the global economic environment, points out the research team at Nomura. \nKey Quotes \n\u201cOur economics team believes we are currently in a \u2018sweet spot\u2019 of steady global growth and subdued inflation (especially in the US), which could continue through H1 2018. Risks (for EM markets) from Trump administration trade/fiscal policies and/or a significant rise in geopolitical (Middle East or North Korea) concerns seem remote for now and have lacked any indication of imminent market impact.\u201d \n\u201cOverall, with the relatively sanguine environment likely to remain intact into 2018, our core FX recommendations include long THB and KRW (versus USD) and long CE-3 (versus USD). In rates, we receive Jan 2019 Brazil DI and 5Y SGD (versus a US 5Y).\u201d \n\u201cHowever, EM markets appear subject to local idiosyncratic factors (some common local themes include favourable current account/flow dynamics, FX valuations, potential central bank tightening) and significant global risks. We see the two most pressing as China financial/macro stability concerns and a pricing in of more US rate hikes in 2018.\u201d \n\u201cBased on these views, we suggest some relative value FX trades/hedges and rates curve trades. These include short MXN/CLP (NAFTA risk for MXN versus CLP positive macro/politics), long KRW against short TWD and long USD/CNY spreads, and long USD/SGD to hedge our short USD/THB (more details in the trade sections below). In rates, we recommend curve trades such as a 2s5s CNY NDIRS steepener (stable liquidity and higher term premia from deleveraging) and a 2s10s PLN IRS flattener (rate hike cycle).\u201d \nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
