We have no choice.\u201d \nCurry, wearing a blue Warriors hoodie, took in the latter part of the Warriors\u2019 morning shoot around from the tunnel next to the court, but declined interview requests through the team\u2019s public relations department. \nHe was on crutches and had his right ankle in a protective boot. \nThe two-time league MVP Curry landed awkwardly on the E\u2019Twaun Moore\u2019s foot while going for a late steal in a 125-115 comeback win Monday night at New Orleans. He scored 31 points before the injury and is averaging 26.3 points, 6.6 assists and 5.1 rebounds per game this season. \nCurry said after the game it was a \u201cdumb play. I got caught on E\u2019Twaun\u2019s shoe as I went by him and couldn\u2019t catch myself.\u201d \nKerr confirmed Wednesday that Curry\u2019s ankle is structurally intact. \n\u201cAll things considered it was good news,\u201d Kerr said of the MRI results. \u201cHopefully it will be a couple, or a few weeks, and he will be back. It\u2019s not anything that\u2019s too serious.\u201d \nKerr said Patrick McCaw will miss the Hornets game with a nose contusion and Draymond Green is listed as doubtful with a shoulder injury. \nKerr would not say who\u2019ll start for Curry, but it\u2019s possible Shaun Livingston will take his place in the lineup. The team also recalled point guard Quinn Cook from the G-League to join the roster. \n\u201cA team like ours, I think we will respond well without Steph because you feel threatened when all of a sudden you are without one of your best guys and you realize you are vulnerable,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWhen you are vulnerable you tend to have your guard up a little bit. I anticipate that will happen.\u201d \nWhile the Warriors have another league MVP they can turn to in Kevin Durant to carry the load, Kerr made it clear that Curry is the \u201cguy who makes us go.\u201d \n\u201cWe have great players but Steph is the engineer, Everything revolves around him so we are going to have adapt and execute better,\u201d Kerr said. \nKerr points to last year when Durant got hurt and the Warriors got better as a team, which he said helped the team in the playoffs. \n\u201cWe have to take the same approach with Steph out,\u201d Kerr said. \nDurant knows it\u2019s his time to step up. \n\u201cWe will have to play a little different,\u201d Durant said. \u201cThe way shoots off the dribble and shoots off the catch, it can\u2019t be duplicated by anyone who has ever played the game.

Jenn here today sharing my Holiday Spirit by getting festive with Creative Paperclay\u00ae!! Using Creative Paperclay\u00ae Modeling Material and some simple holiday cookie cutters I have created a few different things today to share. First, here is how I started with all the fun shapes! First, roll out a nice even layer of Creative Paperclay\u00ae with a rolling pin onto wax paper. Cut each shape desired with cookie cutter. Let these dry for at least one night.  As an added tip***lightly brush some corn starch on your rolling pin to prevent any sticking when rolling out your clay. \nNow we are on to the painting and adding hangers! All of the pieces were painted using acrylics. The tree was assembled as an ornament using ribbon adhered to the back. The stars were assembled using a string of metallic red beads which were embedded into the clay before drying. The other pieces were painted and set aside to use as embellishments for another crafty creation! \nAs you can see creating these lovely ornaments and embellishments is simple and fun using Creative Paperclay\u00ae !! This would be a fun holiday project to do with your children as well!! \nCreative Paperclay\u00ae is available to purchase at the online store as well as Michael's , Hobby Lobby , and Joann's . \nThanks so much for viewing my post today and Happy Holidays!! \n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jenn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joann", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:36.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5015445a2c7c34ae09265fd0fcf71ddb99db548e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxZPUIkA7xknAg--", "site_full": "forums.moneysavingexpert.com", "site": "moneysavingexpert.com", "site_section": "http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.php?f=28", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Overseas Holidays &amp;

Carani\nlettering : Pat Brosseau\ncolorist: Tom McCraw assistant editor: Frank Berrios\neditor: KC Carlson\nadult legionnaire: Carmela Merlo cover: Jeffrey Moy\nreviewers: Siskoid & Shotgun \nMission Monitor Board:    \nChameleon, Element Lad, Invisible Kid, Kinetix, Leviathan (flashback), Live Wire, M'Onel, Magno, Monstress, Sensor, Star Boy, Umbra, Violet, XS\n\nGuests:   \nDragonmage, Kid Quantum II, Mysa, Night Girl, Polar Boy, Prefect Lamar, R.J. Brande; medical staff, U.P. Marines\n\nOpponents:   \nEmerald Eye of Ekron (flashback)\n\n\nRecap:  \nThe Legion, with the help of Workforce and the Amazers, has just recently defeated Mordru... with some last effects: The witch Mysa is now young, Element Lad has been turned into living crystal, Magno's powers are gone, Monstress has decided to leave the Amazers, and Violet, now free of the Emerald Eye, collapses, convulses, and has a growth spurt! \n\nSynopsis:  \nThe U.P. ships bearing the Legionnaires are en route for Earth as M'Onel rejoins them with the news that he wasn't able to convince Andromeda to stick around. No matter, there are more important things to worry about, like the size-changing Violet in the throes of a seizure. The working theory is that when she tried to make the Eye resurrect Leviathan after he died from his wounds at the hands of Dr. Regulus, it instead stole his powers for later use. Now, Violet has withdrawn into her mind, and Sensor manages to sense she's created a reality where Gim Allon is alive, but can't bring her out of it.\nAs the ships change their heading for Titan where a greater telepath might be found, R.J. Brande, for fear they won't get there in time, reveals he has some telepathic ability himself, and with the help of Sensor, enters Violet's mind, convinces her that Gim is well and truly dead, and that it wasn't her fault. She comes out of it with both her and Leviathan's powers.\nBy the time the Legion reaches Earth, Monstress has been voted into the Legion, Mysa and Dragonmage have said their goodbyes and are on the cusp of becoming a couple, Magno has left to seek the help of Braalian doctors, and Violet is ready to be introduced as the new LeVIathan.\nCommentary:  \nShotgun \nIt\u2019s been such a long time since we lost Violet to the Emerald Eye that I had completely forgotten that Gim\u2019s death was associated with it. Even after she took control of it, was able to send it away, Violet still has to deal with the Eye\u2019s influence. Keeping Gim alive by giving Violet the same power he had is pretty sad for our heroine. Now her own powers will remind her of the passing of the one she loved. Please tell me they\u2019re not really going to refer to her as LeVIathan again. Using Gim\u2019s code name to describe her would just be even more cruel to poor Violet.\nI liked the way the comic was written and drawn. I was almost stressed while reading because of it. The expressions, the panic in the characters' dialogue, yeah\u2026 It worked with me. I also felt the annoyance expressed by Invisible Kid towards Brande. I figured that there was more than met the eye when it came to good old R.J. but a telepath\u2026 This is getting interesting. Could he be powerful enough to read minds without people noticing? No wonder he\u2019s so successful! Good thing he was there and was able to help Violet get back. The gang is back on Earth, they\u2019ve brought back their lost member and have a new addition in Monstress, and they gain a lot of prestige after their fight with Mordru. With everything being less chaotic in the 30th Century, maybe we\u2019ll see another try at bringing back the rest of the group. I don\u2019t know\u2026 during a wedding maybe? I would love to see Rokk and Imra having to explain all this to their teammates mid-vows! Have you noticed that I\u2019m not too fond of the idea of their marriage yet?\n\nSiskoid \nYou've made several predictions about the upcoming Legion wedding, so at least one of them is bound to be correct, right? We'll find out NEXT WEEK! Oh my! Meanwhile, Legionnaires is also the host to changes in the status quo. New powers for Violet (I refuse to call her LeVIathan as well), which will make more versatile, and for Element Lad too, let's not forget. If anything signals the return of Cosmic Boy sooner than later, it's the departure of Magno, a broken hero. And adding Monstress to the cast? I think she's an effervescent character, probably a good addition even if I'm not too clear on her power set, but I wish she had had a few more hoops to jump through before being voted in between panels. She wants it too much for it to be this easy.\nI don't know what the deal is with R.J. Brande - is this an echo of the previous continuity's reveal that he was a Durlan? can't he just be good at business without a super-powered advantage? - but at least he needs Umbra, Sensor and Kinetix to work his magic. It's a team effort in a team book; I lie to see that. His mental operation finally puts an end to a storyline that's been going on for ages (from way back even before it was happening!) and I for one am ready for the next chapter. One panel I dearly love is Sensor flicking her tongue at Vi's forehead, like she's tasting her mind. Imagine the old Princess Projectra doing that!\nAnd while I'm dishing out the love, my VERY FAVORITE panels are the Polar Boy and Night Girl cameos in the home crowd, and how Night Girl hits the person behind her with her beehive hairdo when she looks up at tall Violet. He's only doing half the books, but Jeffrey Moy really is the defining artist of this era. Cute and expressive and full of fun detail.\nScience Police Notes:   \nAll-inclusive Legion numbering: 1997/17. Magno leaves the Legion in this issue. Monstress joins the Legion in this issue. Shrinking Violet becomes the new Leviathan in this issue, gaining growth powers. She will be referred to simply as \"Violet\" in these articles for clarity and continuity's sake.

Deception by Karen Tuft \nKindle Edition Published December 1st 2017 by Covenant Communications      Renowned actress Ruby Chadwick, The Darling of Drury Lane, has long planned and prepared for her final performance. With exceptional beauty comes the unwanted attention of men, and after years of fending off odious suitors, Ruby is ready to leave it all behind in favor of a quiet life. The first step is to reclaim a piece of her past: her true identity as Lavinia Fernley. But leaving town unnoticed proves impossible, and in one desperate moment, she embarks on the greatest act of her life when she throws herself into the arms of a stranger to avoid recognition. \nLucas Jennings is shocked to find the stunning redhead in his arms, but something moves him to play along with her ruse when she calls him her husband. This charade marks the start of an unpredictable journey as he escorts the lovely Lavinia and her traveling companions to Primrose Farm, far from the glaring lights of London. Soon, the tables are turned when Lucas introduces Lavinia to his family\u2014as his fianc\u00e9e. Before long, their mutual deception begins to feel all too real. But when the truth of her past is revealed, will Lavinia\u2019s dream of a happy ending slip through her fingers?  \n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\nMy Review: 5 Stars \n\nI love to read Regency romances and was delighted at the twists that I found in this story, as it's not typical. Lavinia is the great stage actress named Ruby. She desires to escape the stage and find her true self. I don't recall ever reading a story about a Regency actress before and was immediately captured.\n\nI'm also a huge fan of fake relationships and this story provided more than one. Although Lavinia is alone in the world as far as family goes, she's got three faithful friends who provided much entertainment through their words and actions. I found them to be charming and hilarious and their dedication to Lavinia is endearing. Let's not forget the romantic relationship--gradual and sweet, with some sparks.\n\nThe plot is unwavering and marches on to a good pace. Through it all, Lucas is right there and wow, he's a keeper for sure. I love how gentlemanly he was, especially through the rough patches. This tall, dark, and handsome guy won me over too.   \n\nI loved it all from beginning to end and was utterly charmed.\n\nContent: mild romance (very vague innuendo)\n\n*I received a copy to review, which didn't influence my thoughts and opinions in any way*\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nBuy Link: \n\n  \nSchedule: \n  *Dec. 4 th : http://www.singinglibrarianbooks.com/ , http://melsshelves.blogspot.com/ *Dec. 5 th : http://thoroughlyhere.blogspot.com/ , http://lisaisabookworm.blogspot.com/ , http://bonnieharris.blogspot.com/  , http://empowermoms.net/ *Dec. 6 th : http://heidi-reads.blogspot.com/ , https://brightlystreet.com/ , https://www.rockinbookreviews.com/ , http://ldswritermom.blogspot.com/ , http://thethingsilovemost.com/ *Dec. 7 th : http://mybookaday.blogspot.com/ , http://fireandicereads.com/ , https://ldsandlovinit.blogspot.com/ , http://www.wishfulendings.com/ , http://katiescleanbookcollection.blogspot.com/ *Dec. 8 th : https://joyinthemoments.wordpress.com/ , http://booksaresanity.blogspot.com/ , http://gettingyourreadonaimeebrown.blogspot.com/ , http://www.kindleandme.com/ , http://literarytimeout.blogspot.com/ \n\na Rafflecopter giveaway ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "karen tuft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucas jennings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lavinia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruby chadwick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lavinia fernley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "darling of drury lane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "primrose farm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:37.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13794dd2d3a3a0a6f71410ab164b8e596d476be1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94orQZ9QJAYI0m5hWg7ndh3JrAAZ4MgDA_4nhRk2HepqOenAFm3z4RL2r2RBdUE._afI2XSejd5ujuOwA85o9VhMKG9ORsMjnjZcdjMr2rgn.uNWef6zgC36NY11RvDwFsMpHNy4xGIpUkX8XN6TbFDR.9NFxfLHprttoGdHa2O6SYwpdOvjqadvotbeEyRPuwRBmcv.KVXdO97UzJh9DcvIgT55gzOCHnRQ--", "site_full": "www.amazon.ca", "site": "amazon.ca", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.ca/Cambridge-SoundWorks-Angle-Bluetooth-Playtime/product-reviews/B01LZV6TYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt_lft?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&sortBy=recent", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality &amp; 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "title": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality & 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "title_full": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality & 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "published": "2017-12-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.038, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13794dd2d3a3a0a6f71410ab164b8e596d476be1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94orQZ9QJAYI0m5hWg7ndh3JrAAZ4MgDA_4nhRk2HepqOenAFm3z4RL2r2RBdUE._afI2XSejd5ujuOwA85o9VhMKG9ORsMjnjZcdjMr2rgn.uNWef6zgC36NY11RvDwFsMpHNy4xGIpUkX8XN6TbFDR.9NFxfLHprttoGdHa2O6SYwpdOvjqadvotbeEyRPuwRBmcv.KVXdO97UzJh9DcvIgT55gzOCHnRQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Amazon Customer", "published": "2017-12-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality & 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "text": "Got it for $30.

Though I do like to have second helpings of beans and plantain (my \u2018bestest\u2019 food in the whole wide world) and jollof rice (cooked Nigerian style). But no, this is not a food blog. I am talking about second helpings of books people! Has anyone ever felt like reading a book several times over? And in reading it the second, third and maybe fourth time finding that there are parts of the book that didn\u2019t have as profound an effect as it does when you read it again? Yes. Me! Over here! Yes, me!\n \n\nIn June, something happened to me. I felt a very sudden urge to read a certain book again. It was such a deep urge that I couldn\u2019t resist it even though I had new books to read. So I went ahead to pick up the book. It was a copy of the book Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert. Have you read? Fantastic book. Now, when I read this book back in 2014 or so I liked it very much but not as much as I did when I read it again this year. It was as though I needed to hear those words again, read them again and grasp them better. Second time around Eat, Pray, Love ministered to me. I took away so many wise nuggets and a very simple life lesson which I am now practicing. Elizabeth Gilbert, at the depth of depression and going through a nasty divorce said to herself- \u201cWhat will make you happy today Liz? And then she just went ahead and did it! So what do I do now? I simply ask myself \u201cWhat will make Kemi happy today?\u201d Then I do it! You won\u2019t believe how beautiful that experience has been.\n\n \n \n \nAfter reading Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s Eat, Pray, Love, I was quickly drawn to Julie, Julia by Julie Powell. It is a non fictional story about the author and how she cooked through Julia Child\u2019s recipe book \u201cMastering the Art of French Cooking\u201d while juggling a boring day job and a stressful apartment. She was very real, I could relate to her frustrations on some levels. I think anyone who reads the book would. Needless to say that it was a delicious read (Think finger-licking recipes). The writer was so sincere in her narrations and she heaped humor and blunt honesty in her lines.\nShortly after Ghana Must Go loomed in my reading future and I reached out earnestly to be pampered by the poetic lines and be washed away in the aftermath of the tragic end of Dr. Kweku Sai. Each character\u2019s story now became more important, more urgent and more profound. I drank from the wisdom in the experiences and cried once as the love making of Olu Sai and his wife Ling reminded me of days in my past. Regretfully I had to finish the book.\nSoon The Wizard of the Crow whispered to me and I seized it with delight and mirth. Remembering how hilarious the satire had been I quickly settled in to savor the incredulous tale. As Nyawira and Kamiti met and danced around each other in conversations I settled it in my heart that love was and will always be something to be aspired to. The ruler of Aburiria in all his stupid megalomania made me think of Nigeria and the political dramas revealed every single day.\nI have books that I read only once and never touch again. Then there are books that take a piece of me away such that I always want to go back to soak myself in the words lying there. For me, reading is much more than a hobby, it\u2019s an experience, one which I embrace anew with every book I read a second time. I will always have the satisfying experience of seconds!\n \n\nKemibon", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "julie powell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kemi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kemibon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyawira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth gilbert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julia child", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kweku sai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olu sai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kamiti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aburiria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:37.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13794dd2d3a3a0a6f71410ab164b8e596d476be1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94orQZ9QJAYI0m5hWg7ndh3JrAAZ4MgDA_4nhRk2HepqOenAFm3z4RL2r2RBdUE._afI2XSejd5ujuOwA85o9VhMKG9ORsMjnjZcdjMr2rgn.uNWef6zgC36NY11RvDwFsMpHNy4xGIpUkX8XN6TbFDR.9NFxfLHprttoGdHa2O6SYwpdOvjqadvotbeEyRPuwRBmcv.KVXdO97UzJh9DcvIgT55gzOCHnRQ--", "site_full": "www.amazon.ca", "site": "amazon.ca", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.ca/Cambridge-SoundWorks-Angle-Bluetooth-Playtime/product-reviews/B01LZV6TYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt_lft?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&sortBy=recent", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality &amp; 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "title": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality & 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "title_full": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality & 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "published": "2017-12-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.038, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ed467b004ecb1c69da874590748f6b8f15aaf6ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94orQZ9QJAYI0m5hWg7ndh3JrAAZ4MgDA_4nhRk2HepqOenAFm3z4RL2r2RBdUE._afI2XSejd5ujuOwA85o9VhMKG9ORsMjnjZcdjMr2rgn.uNWef6zgC36NY11RvDwFsMpHNy4xGIpUkX8XN6TbFDR.9NFxfLHprttoGdHa2O6SYwpdOvjqadvotbeEyRPuwRBmcv.KVXdO97UzJh9DcvIjSNNhZ51rJ5UhuVEo_Gu2e", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "Robert W.

Jump to... Just Questions \n(by John Podhoretz, NY Post) \u2013 \u2018This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality,\u201d President Trump said in announcing America\u2019s recognition of   Never have truer words been spoken, and they were delivered in the best speech Trump has ever given. \nWhat Trump did was stunning. He could just have signed the waiver of the law passed in 1995 compelling the executive branch to move America\u2019s   He did it six months ago, just like his three immediate predecessors did every six months since 1996. Or he could have not signed the waiver and simply said he was going to start the process of building the new embassy. \nInstead, he called the international community\u2019s seven-decade bluff and ended a delusion about the future that has prevented Palestinians from seeing the world and their own geopolitical situation clearly. It is a bold shift. \nThe idea that Jerusalem is not Israel\u2019s capital has been a global pretense for decades, including here in the United States. It\u2019s a pretense because Jerusalem has been Israel\u2019s capital from the moment the new country secured a future by winning a bloody war for independence waged against it by Arab nations after they rejected the UN partition of the old British mandate into a Jewish state and an Arab state. \nUnder the plan, Jerusalem was to be an international city governed by the United Nations. But the Arab effort to push the Jews into the sea \u2014 an effort no other nation on earth intervened in to prevent \u2014 left a divided Jerusalem in the hands of the Jews in the West and Jordan in the East. \nThere would be no \u201cinternational\u201d Jerusalem because the Arabs made sure there could not be one. \nSo, in 1949, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion moved the government from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \u201cThe people which faithfully honored for 2,500 years the oath sworn by the Rivers of Babylon not to forget Jerusalem \u2014 this people will never reconcile itself with separation from Jerusalem,\u201d Ben-Gurion told the United Nations at the time. \nAfter Israel\u2019s triumph in the Six-Day War in 1967, Jerusalem was unified and became, in the words spoken by every Israeli prime minister, the \u201ceternal and undivided capital\u201d of the Jewish state. \nAnd yet the international fiction that Jerusalem is not only not Israel\u2019s capital but isn\u2019t even to be considered formally part of Israel has persisted for 50 years now. \nNominally, the idea is that Palestinians need to be allowed to believe they\u2019ll secure sovereignty over at least a part of Jerusalem for them to pursue a final peace deal with the Israelis. And so most of the world has chosen to act as though Israel has no legal dominion over any part of Jerusalem. \nThat is, in a word, insane. Jerusalem is now home to 860,000 people \u2014 10 percent of Israel\u2019s population, nearly double that of its second city, Tel Aviv. Every one of them, Jew and Arab, is a citizen of the state. (The city is 60 percent Jewish and 35 percent Muslim.) It is the locus of Israel\u2019s government, where the parliament sits, where the prime minister lives and where most government agencies are located. \nThe pretense has been allowed to continue for two reasons. The most rational reason is this: There has always been fear that any change in Jerusalem\u2019s status might ignite a violent Palestinian response, retard peace efforts and inflame the \u201cArab street\u201d throughout the Middle East. So why create a crisis when the status quo is at least stable? \nThen there are those who simply believe Israel is a bad actor deserving of international scorn and isolation and should not be allowed to get away with it \u2014 it, in this case, being Jerusalem. \nTrump rightly scorns the latter view and has an answer for the former: \u201cThis is a long overdue step to advance the peace process. And to work towards a lasting agreement.\u201d \nThe Palestinians need to accept reality. They continue to act as though they will get what they want through rejection and resistance and rage. \u201cIt is time,\u201d Trump said, \u201cfor the   midsts.   nations and people   debate, not violence.\u201d \nThe Palestinian refusal to accept Israel for what it is and what it has become has been the greatest bar to peace. And there are reasons to believe the so-called Arab street has bigger problems to concern itself with right now than Israel\u2019s capital. \nAnd not just the street \u2014 the capitals as well. Trump\u2019s act comes at a time when there is a tectonic shift in the Middle East. If I had told you 20 years ago that Israel would one day find itself in a de facto alliance with Saudi Arabia and Egypt, you would\u2019ve had me committed. But two weeks ago, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) reportedly urged Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to sign on to a peace deal Israel actually likes. MBS isn\u2019t happy about Trump\u2019s move, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the sands are shifting rapidly after decades of stagnation. \nIn the end, as Trump said, \u201cIsrael is a sovereign nation with the right,   nation, to determine its own capital.\u201d Indeed it is. Indeed it does. Bravo. \nPublished December 6, 2017 at The New York Post. Reprinted here on December 7 for educational purposes only. Questions \n1.

Updated: 4:54 AM EST Dec 7, 2017 Australia legalizes same-sex marriage {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! Updated: 4:54 AM EST Dec 7, 2017 CANBERRA, Australia (CNN) \u2014 \nAustralia's parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage Thursday after years of political jockeying and fierce public debate. \nCheers and applause broke out as ministers voted in favor of the bill following hours of debate and emotional speeches at Parliament House in Canberra. Advertisement \n\"This is Australia: Fair, diverse, loving and filled for respect for everyone,\" said an effusive Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, as he introduced the bill for a final vote. \n\"This is a great day, it belongs to every Australian.\" \nThe move follows a two-month national postal survey that showed 61% of more than 12 million respondents were in favor of marriage equality. \nThe country is now the 24th in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry, according to Pew Research. \nAustralia's first same-sex weddings will not take place until at least January, however, due to a longstanding requirement for all Australian couples to provide a full month's notice of their intention to get married. \nHistoric moment \nMarriage equality campaigners have fought for years for Thursday's vote. Though the bill was expected to pass into law without significant opposition, the lengthy legislative process was excruciatingly slow for the hundreds of advocates watching from the public gallery. \nAmong them was Christine Forster, the gay sister of Tony Abbott, the former Australian Prime Minister who has long been seen as the face of the \"no\" campaign. \nForster was joined in the public gallery by her partner, Virginia Edwards. They plan to marry next year, and Abbott has said he'll attend despite his personal views. \nAbbott and other conservatives proposed amendments to the bill to include further religious protections, all of which were voted down. \n\"These amendments are important and I stress they are not against same-sex marriage, they are simply in favor of the rights of religious organizations to keep doing what their doing,\" Abbott said. \nOpponents of the changes argued they would legalize discrimination against the gay community. The 500 or so people in the gallery were vocal in their disapproval of the amendments. They were warned multiple times that parliamentary rules prohibit them making noise and even applauding. \nAn emotional week \nAfter the bill passed the Senate last week, House proceedings kicked off with fireworks Monday when Liberal MP Tim Wilson surprised his colleagues by proposing to his long-time partner Ryan Bolger. \nThe next day, Liberal MP Andrew Wallace, who is a devout Catholic, shared with his colleagues how his gay daughter helped change his position on same-sex marriage. \n\"She said: Dad, in the years to come, my generation will look back and judge your generation about how you deal with the issue of homosexuality in the same way that your generation considered your parents' generation in the way that they dealt with our Indigenous people,\" Wallace said. \nFighting back tears, Liberal MP Sarah Henderson told the story Wednesday night of a close gay friend of hers who died months ago and who, in one of their last conversations, asked her to continue to push for same-sex marriage. \nSurvey says yes \nThursday's vote comes three weeks after Australia voted overwhelmingly to legalize same-sex marriage as part of a national postal survey lasting two months. \nUnder political pressure to find a solution, the ruling Liberal National Coalition government announced the non-compulsory survey in August, saying if the result was \"yes\" they would allow a free vote in Parliament. \nIn the end, 61.6% of Australia voted in favor of allowing same-sex marriage, with 38.4% saying \"no.\" \nAbout 12.7 million people participated in the survey, which had a response rate of nearly 80% -- which is considered very high. \nAustralians have long been in favor of same-sex marriage, with polling from as long as 10 years ago showing a majority support for legalizing marriage equality.

Bout this over the Anker and JBL because of the overall best bang for the buck value, considering sound and build quality.\nThanks Cambridge SoundWorks for making such a great product available to Canadians without jacking up the price!!\nBelieve it or not it's sometimes hard to get popular US items in Canada without going through some random 3rd party seller who jacks up the price like 10x! stars: 5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:37.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa8a6b0b513c42a4153196e76756cba87b38c8c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeC3h7Io5eurx2zGXfjayhEqRNFYDgqzRsNe4yf99xu7TrWUETR.LdcsDg4OPA5km._F4vVVdXEvrWWwC1qNAYNiOFvDsD.OTh5RRmsqtc2oPrJqrghOyqtQ--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/sports-outdoors-accessories/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Sports Accessories With Best Price At Lazada Malaysia", "title": "SOKANO Adjustable Knee Guard For Sports", "title_full": "SOKANO Adjustable Knee Guard For Sports | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-01-09T01:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 74, "participants_count": 64, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.119, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "00320e9cb1b21e1eb711f1ef8f38d83400b9af94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeC3h7Io5eurx2zGXfjayhEqRNFYDgqzRsNe4yf99xu7TrWUETR.LdcsDg4OPA5km._F4vVVdXEvrWWwC1qNAYNiOFvDsD.OTh5RRmsqtc2oO6VSW5ImbAqwlo1yonz9Ld", "ord_in_thread": 74, "author": "Yuslan Yusoff", "published": "2017-11-29T03:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Suitable for me", "text": "I just received the product is very suitable,Nice and perfect", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:37.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10c948b07f70614cee91c40203502d59dbb22485", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju37TSYthDL5LONy4I43qy0JgOnmDaKm3ra_LN75iJjcsiPnF8MiWU8cA.1E1MFkfRr_RPWN1L9Vh0cC_Yph3SwHQ", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/-/index.rss", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "IGN Boards", "title": "Warren Moon Now Accused of Sexual Harassment...", "title_full": "Warren Moon Now Accused of Sexual Harassment...", "published": "2017-12-07T11:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10c948b07f70614cee91c40203502d59dbb22485", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju37TSYthDL5LONy4I43qy0JgOnmDaKm3ra_LN75iJjcsiPnF8MiWU8cA.1E1MFkfRr_RPWN1L9Vh0cC_Yph3SwHQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WhiteKnight77 (invalid@example.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "Warren Moon Now Accused of Sexual Harassment...", "text": "Former NFL quarterback Warren Moon accused of sexual harassment and the accuser states that she woke up one night with his hand between her legs after \"making\" her sleep in the same bed on a trip as well as him stripping her out of her bikini after allegedly drugging her.\nAccording to the lawsuit:\n\"Soon after she began her employment, Moon demanded Ms. Haskell submit to a variety of unnerving sexual and perverse controlling arrangements, including sleeping in the same bed with him on all business trips, providing him unfettered access to the bathroom every time she showered, wearing skimpy lingerie while in the obligatory single room, obtaining prior approval for her wardrobe, and being subjected to continuous unwanted and unsolicited sexual advances.\nWhenever Ms. Haskell expressed reservations about these outrageous \u201cjob duties\u201d, Moon insisted this was \u201cjust the way it is\u201d, and threatened Ms. Haskell that unless she was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with him, he\u2019d \u201cfind someone else who was\u201d.

Graves warns of imminent danger from the estate tax causing many, if not most, farmers to believe their own estate will need to be split apart and sold in order for their heirs to pay the inheritance tax due upon the their death. \n*Editor\u2019s Note: This opinion is in response to a column by Rep. Sam Graves titled \u201cSaving the Family Farm\u201d published in the Nov. 22 Courier-Post. \nOne word comes to mind after reading Representative Sam Graves Capital Report in the November 22 issue of the Salt River Journal and Courier-Post; fear-mongering. \nFear-mongering is the spreading of frightening and exaggerated rumors of an impending danger. Rep. Graves warns of imminent danger from the estate tax causing many, if not most, farmers to believe their own estate will need to be split apart and sold in order for their heirs to pay the inheritance tax due upon the their death. \nWe\u2019ve heard this claim for years and family farmers (and small business owners) are conveniently portrayed as victims of this tax because most rural residents have family and friends who farm and will be affected. \nAccording to the Tax Policy Center out of 2.7 million estates that will be settled this year only 5,200 estates will pay estate taxes. Furthermore, of these 5,200 estates only 50 will list a farm or small business as an asset. The estate tax affects so few small farms and businesses because the first $5.49 million of assets per person ($10.98 million per couple) are entirely exempt from it. In case you\u2019re wondering the Tax Policy Center is a nonpartisan think tank and was established by economist who worked in the Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations. \nAdditionally, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2015 it was estimated only 1.7 percent of farm estates would be required to file an estate tax return for the 2016 tax year. A much smaller share of those estates (0.42 percent) is estimated to actually owe any Federal estate tax. \nSo why should this concern you? The Federal debt has spurned budget hawks to require offsets with most new spending and/or tax cuts. This cut will need to have offsetting components before these hawks will vote for it. \nOne such offset could be the loss of the \u201cstepped up basis\u201d on inherited assets. This has always been mentioned when the discussion turns to repealing the estate tax. In fact this was rumored to be part of the Trump tax plan being considered currently. As of today the loss of this provision has been taken off the table but that doesn\u2019t mean with the regularity of it being discussed it could not be put back up for offsetting the estate tax repeal. \nThe step-up basis rule is the readjustment of the value of an appreciated asset for tax purposes upon inheritance, determined to be the higher market value of the asset at the time of inheritance. When an asset is passed on to a beneficiary, its value is typically more than what it was when the original owner acquired it. \nWhat this means is a very meager estate containing real estate, perhaps a house, that was purchased many decades ago would be taxed on the capital gain when the heirs sell that house. Without the step-up basis rule the heirs will inherit not only the property but also the original basis (cost). So, a house purchased several decades ago that has appreciated perhaps 300 to 400 percent will required the heirs to pay a capital gain on the sale of that house even though it is well below the estate tax threshold. \nThe loss of the step-up basis rule will cause most estates where property passes through to heirs to pay capital gains. If the estate tax is this evil tax on hard work and savings what would you describe the tax on the sale of a gain on a modest house that could be the only asset passed on to future generations? \nIf the estate tax affects less than one percent of all estates nationally compared to the step-up basis rule affecting possibly a majority of estates which one affects the most citizens? \nPersonally, I don\u2019t care if they repeal the estate tax or not. This shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue. Politicians on both sides of the isle have been on both sides of this issue. But, often and loudly, we should remind our elected representative that the step-up basis rule should not be sacrificed to pay for the repeal of the estate tax. And although today it isn\u2019t being offered, it was just several months ago and we must be vigilant that it won\u2019t be at a later date. \n\u2014 Keith Mudd, Monroe City", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "grav", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monroe city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith mudd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam graves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tax policy center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states department of agriculture", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:37.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bfb76e0d5a4f8f4cf1d6364174b77db1f59b0a43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ohX6wSzsXwEGJ53bjSu_vYCI3HjPKyFHBDi4lQuKvbQEuiFjAJp7uoz7cIGlq.d67kbjE7GuY88h9lrIpPbQbCpjjTufmhRqMIh.9d01Uoe1DwU5KdYjrD2eXlElHxhrV_kcpZHC0QJkplNQArlR_", "site_full": "www.king5.com", "site": "king5.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "king5.com | US homeless population increases for 1st time in 7 years", "title_full": "king5.com | US homeless population increases for 1st time in 7 years", "published": "2017-12-07T09:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "http://content.king5.com/photo/2017/11/02/homelesscrisis_1509672361182_11586546_ver1.0.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8428, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bfb76e0d5a4f8f4cf1d6364174b77db1f59b0a43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ohX6wSzsXwEGJ53bjSu_vYCI3HjPKyFHBDi4lQuKvbQEuiFjAJp7uoz7cIGlq.d67kbjE7GuY88h9lrIpPbQbCpjjTufmhRqMIh.9d01Uoe1DwU5KdYjrD2eXlElHxhrV_kcpZHC0QJkplNQArlR_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Author", "published": "2017-12-07T09:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "king5.com | US homeless population increases for 1st time in 7 years", "text": "\u00a9 2017 KING-TV. All Rights Reserved. Follow Story US homeless population increases for 1st time in 7 years Seattle's unsheltered population has grown 44 percent in two years. Author: Natalie Swaby Published: 11:07 PM PST December 6, 2017 \nFor the first time since 2010, America's homeless population has increased. \nIn January, cities across the U.S. conduct an annual Point in Time count. This year's collected data is now a part of a report that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released Wednesday. \nThe report revealed nearly 554,000 homeless people across the nation. That is up 1 percent from 2016. \nIn Seattle, the unsheltered population grew by 44 percent over two years to nearly 5,500. \nWednesday night, a homeless man named Edward said for him it was the \"rent factor.\" \n\"Cost of living is too high in Seattle, and I was forced out of my place, because of rent increases. I couldn't pay it anymore, which drives me further away from Seattle to find affordable housing,\" said Edward. \nHe's been living on the streets for a year. Every night he waits in a long line, hoping to secure a spot in one of Seattle's shelters. \nAt city hall, homelessness has been called a crisis. \nRecently, former Mayor Tim Burgess announced $34 million in new funding. The plan is for more money to be spent on enhanced shelters, which provide support services including treatment, case management, and housing connections. \nThe Associated Press contributed.

There, the professor\u2019s 17-year-old son, Elio (Timothee Chalamet), discovers his sexuality and pursues Oliver.\n\u201cCall Me\u201d is a passion project that\u2019s taken several years for legendary filmmaker James Ivory (\u201cA Room with a View\u201d), 89, to make.\nFor the 6-foot-5 Hammer, this intimate film arrived after big-budget flops \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d and \u201cThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.\u201d\nHaving failed to ignite as a conventional Hollywood hunk, Hammer was ready for a challenge.\n\u201cIf I started really caring how my movies did at the box office, I think I\u2019d lose sight about why I do this. I don\u2019t do this because I want to see how much box office I do opening weekend. I do this because I just love making movies and I can\u2019t imagine doing anything else.\n\u201cThis was really a case of I would have done anything to work with (director Luca Guadagnino, \u2018I Am Love.\u2019). I love his movies. Also, I read the book and as my wife pushed me to do it, she said, \u2018This is the sexiest book I\u2019ve ever read.\u2019\n\u201cIt seemed like an amazing opportunity, like a no-brainer.\u201d\nHammer was just 12 when the acting bug bit.

Those offers will be made in Buenos Aires, most likely on Sunday before the WTO meeting gets off, the official said. \nMercosur members Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay are pushing for an improvement on the EU offer of tariff-free imports for 70,000 tons a year of beef and 600,000 tons of ethanol a year. They complain that it is lower than the 100,000-ton offer the EU made in 2004, though EU negotiators say Europeans eat less meat today. \n\u201cI\u2018m pretty confident that things are on a good track,\u201d the Mercosur official said. \u201cBeef and ethanol will be tough issues for ministers next week but finding quotas for both is not beyond reach.\u201d He added, however, that he did not expect Mercosur would be willing to close at anything below 100,000 tons of beef. \nFailure to end the battle over beef has threatened to push the trade talks beyond a year-end deadline and lead to further years of delays. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said on Tuesday that the parties are close to an agreement. \n\u201cWe are committed to doing this as soon as possible because we are almost there and because there is a momentum and because next year, if it drags on too long, there will be election campaigns and we will risk losing that momentum,\u201d she said. \nResistance to Mercosur beef imports has come from farming countries such as France, Ireland and Poland. French President Emmanuel Macron has said France was in no hurry to reach a deal with the Mercosur. \nThe Irish Farmers\u2019 Association has called the trade negotiations with Mercosur \u201ctoxic\u201d and said the European meat market is being sacrificed for the sake of a deal with the South American bloc. Brazil\u2019s powerful farm lobby CNA refutes that claim. \n\u201cOur beef exports to the EU are only 5% of the European market.

Of those, the longest someone has been waiting was 595 days. \nThe news comes after DevonLive reported calls to stop taking on more patients at the clinic over fears that it is taking on more patients than it can safely treat. Wonford House, the headquarters of Devon Partnership Trust \nConcerns have been raised by senior medics because of the massive growth in demand for people wanting to use the service run by Devon Partnership Trust (DPT). \nAn employee, who asked not to be named, claimed a request was put before DPT to have a moratorium on taking on new patients about four months ago was 'ignored', and a second request was declined this week so appointments are still being sent out to new patients. Read More Calls to stop taking on new patients at Exeter's oversubscribed gender clinic are 'ignored' \nData obtained by the FOI shows referrals have significantly increased over the past 10 years. In 2007, the service had 21 users. By 2010, it had increased to around 131. \nHowever, the latest annual figures available show referrals are higher than ever. In 2015, numbers increased to 722 and then again in 2016 to 867. \nThe city centre-based clinic in Dix's Field is one of only seven gender clinics in the country, the next nearest being London, and it welcomes people from all over the UK.

The data also shows that the biggest age group for 2016 was 18 to 25-year-olds amounting to 636 people. The biggest gender was males amounting to 359 and the number of females were 277. \nMost treatment pathways at The Laurels last four years, during which time people receive varied help including psychological support, speech therapy, family therapy and physical support such as hair removal advice. \nThe growth in demand at the Exeter clinic is believed to be due to a number of reasons, including it being located in more of a central and accessible location now, and society gradually becoming more acceptable of people wanting to change their gender.

Your MISTI will help you restamping the image to get a perfect impression. Die-cut the middle are using a heart shape Or any shape you like.

This roundabout was planned as part of a Section 106 agreement (between EDDC and a developer as part of the planning application process) to reduce congestion and improve air quality in Honiton. \n\u201cThe developer\u2019s air quality assessment indicated that it should reduce nitrogen dioxide levels by approximately seven per cent.\u201d Read More Exeter needs to tackle the avoidable killer that is air pollution \nIt add that readings in the town had improved, although the report said: \u201cThe levels in the town centre have naturally reduced although we cannot identify a specific cause. There have been no exceedances for three years. \n\u201cThis is most likely to be a result of improvements in vehicle technology and a reduction in the number of heavy goods vehicles using the town centre roads. The monitoring strategy has shown that levels at all receptor locations are below the exceedance levels.

God help me, that moronic son of a bitch. \n\nI think to save time, I\u2019m just going to cut \u2018n\u2019 paste that opening line to every Trump centric post  I make here on I\u2019m So Glad My Suffering Amuses You.   \n\nBut is it strong enough to properly convey my disdain for Li\u2019l Donnie?     \n\nSo, Trump... God help me, that moronic son of a bitch. \n\nI think it might be a bit lacking. Let\u2019s try this:  \n\nSo, Trump... God help me, that stupid, simpering, cowardly moronic, ignorant, pathetic man-child son of a fucking bitch. \n\nI still feel like I\u2019m going too easy on him,  \n\nSo, Trump... God help me, that moronic son of a bitch is once more playing to his base at the expense of U.S. interests and credibility,   \n\nYou know how Li\u2019l Donnie is always going on about the United States being caught up in bad deals because the U.S. doesn\u2019t get anything out of it.  But Li\u2019l Donnie, self professed deal maker extraordinaire will make the best deals where the U.S. doesn\u2019t get screwed.   \n\nSo what does the United States get out of Trump recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. and eventually moving the U.S. Embassy there?  \n\nThe United States gets screwed.   \n\nFirst of all, we piss off every single country in the world. Not one government on the entire planet recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  \n\nThis is important because the status of Jerusalem is in dispute. Both Israel and the Palestinian have a claim on Israel and until some kind of lasting peace agreement can be worked out, neither side can completely claim Jerusalem as theirs.   \n\nSo why does Trump get out of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. and eventually moving the U.S. Embassy there?  \n\nOthers have that same question.   \n\nDana Allin, International Institute for Strategic Studies: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to imagine what U.S. interest it serves if you assume it has a basic interest in promoting a peaceful settlement to the conflict,\u201d \n\nLeslie Vinjamuri, associate fellow in U.S. and Americas program at the London-based Chatham House think tank: \u201cIt flies in the face of his goal of peace in the region. It\u2019s going to undermine U.S. interests to bring peace and stability to the region.\" \n\nYossi Mekelberg, head of the International Relations and Politics Program at Regent's University London: \u201cYou\u2019ve prejudiced one of the most sensitive, most delicate, one of the most explosive issues between the Israelis and Palestinians, in the Arab World, in the Muslim world, and all three monotheistic religions in one go. So, well done, Mr. President!\u201d   \n\nSince the 1979 Camp David Accords, American presidents have refused to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or move the U.S. Embassy. The U.S. approach has been that Jerusalem's status should be negotiated between the Israelis and Palestinians.  \n\nThe Palestinians seek the city's eastern sector, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of a future independent state. They fear that Trump's declaration essentially imposes on them a disastrous solution for one of the core issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \n\nSo why would Trump make such a move?  \n\nOoh! Ooh! Let me take that one!  \n\nDave-El, I\u2019m So Glad My Suffering Amuses You: \u201cHe\u2019s a stupid, simpering, cowardly moronic, ignorant, pathetic man-child son of a fucking bitch!\u201d   \n\nBasically, it plays to his base of Bible thumping evangelicals and Muslim hating fear mongerers.  \n\nLeslie Vinjamuri: \" He\u2019s made these pledges on the campaign trail and he\u2019s had a lot of criticism that he\u2019s not delivering. It\u2019s driven by domestic politics, he\u2019s speaking to his base.\u201d  \n\nAlso, it's the opposite of what Obama would do.     \n\nLeslie Vinjamuri: \" It also feeds into his desire to be seen as the anti-Obama by evangelicals and hardliners who saw Obama as too pro-Palestine. He wants to say to his base that he is bringing America back to before Obama. But of course he\u2019s not, because all presidents have recognized the complexity of Jerusalem.\u201d \n\nOf course, it all can come down to the simple madness of King Donnie who does whatever pops into his head or whatever is put their by Sean Hannity, Alex Jones or the gang on Fox & Friends.   \n\nYossi Mekelberg:  \u201cThe timing of it, the need for it, baffles most of us. I think we are in a completely in uncharted territory with the Trump administration and that rationality and logical decisions are hard to come by.\"  \n\nDana Allin: \"Trump's   decision appears more impulsive than methodical.

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now \nJones had said he did not feel the committee understood his demand that all owners - not just the ones who served on the committee that were negotiating the contract - have a voice in approving the terms of Goodell\u2019s extension. \nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell shares a laugh with former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch at Heinz Field, Pittsburgh, September 17. Goodell has signed a new $200 million contract, according to reports. Justin K. Aller/Getty \n\u201cOur Committee unanimously supports the contract and believes that it is fully consistent with \u201dmarket\u201c compensation and the financial and other parameters outlined to the owners at our May 2017 meeting, as well as in the best interests of ownership,\u201d the committee said in the letter. \n\u201cWe also have expressed in those conversations our strong and unanimous belief that we should proceed to sign the agreement now, consistent with the unanimous May resolution and to avoid further controversy surrounding this issue.\u201d \nAccording to the six-person compensation committee, there was a nearly unanimous consensus among the ownership in favor of signing the contract extension now. \nGoodell has overseen significant revenue growth for the NFL but has also been the subject of major scrutiny in recent years for his handling of sensitive issues such as domestic violence and concussions.

As his eyes opened flashes of blue light filled his room. He turned his head to check the common area between the cells. Arcs of lightening sizzled through the room. Kakogo cherta, he thought, watching the dancing discharge.\n\nIt\u2019s Mike. He\u2019s having a nightmare. Mary sounded frantic inside his mind.\n\nCan\u2019t you switch him off?\n\nHe can\u2019t hear me.\n\nPieter stood and approached the barrier between his cell and the common room. The crackling discharge reminded him of a small Tesla coil his teacher brought to class. The lightning followed any hand or finger that touched the glass sphere. But this was on a scale he had never seen.\n\nHis eyes focused on the room across from his and caught sight of Joan watching the lights. They were all watching, too terrified to do anything to stop it. \n\nPieter pressed his hand to the clear wall and immediately the blue, static lights flowed to the spot. He felt no pain. The electrical discharge stopped at the other side of the wall, just like the Tesla coil in school. The pops and crackles from the common room made him wary. As he listened he could hear the electric lock mechanism on his door cycle on and off every few seconds.\n\nHas he ever done this before? He asked.\n\nNot like this, Mary replied. Not this bad.\n\nPieter listened for his door to open and pushed his hand against the clear panel.\n\nMEET THE AUTHOR \n\nArcher Miller emerged from the East Texas hill country and set his sights on finding the life of which few of his contemporaries dreamed. In 1974, he migrated to Boulder, Colorado to enroll at the Naropa Institute \u2013 now known as the Naropa University, a tiny Liberal Arts college founded by the renowned Tibetan Buddhist scholar and lineage holder, the Ven. Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche (1940-1987). Rinpoche was enormously influential in spreading the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism to the West.\n\nArcher earned a degree in herbs and creative writing.

Two front runners \u2013 beetroot and broccoli \u2013 we can grow ourselves. Another two \u2013 pomegranates and blood oranges \u2013 are in supermarkets now, and they're all ideal cold-weather fare. Broccoli in general is good for us. It is rich in the fibre and nutrients associated with all green veg, but it has another value. The florets are packed full with glucoraphanin, a compound used in the plant's defence system that is especially beneficial for our health. The only other vegetable it is found in is cauliflower. Eat broccoli and you are likely to reduce your chances of cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. With most varieties, you'll need to eat platefuls to derive the benefits, but now a newly bred form, Benefort\u00e9 broccoli, contains more than twice the level of the good stuff. From analysis of wild brassicas collected in Sicily, scientists at the John Innes Centre and the Institute of Food Research in Norwich found that these native forms had exceptionally high levels of glucosinolates, many times greater than their long-cultivated cousins. But the wild varieties are insubstantial, weedy things you'd hardly want to eat, so how are we to get the best of both worlds, a tender and tasty broccoli, with high levels of protective chemicals in every meal? That's Benefort\u00e9, the result of 30 years of research and crossbreeding cultivated broccolis with their wildflower ancestors. This new form has glucoraphanin levels high enough that eating only two portions a week will help protect against disease. There are ongoing clinical trials taking place in Norwich with Benefort\u00e9 broccoli. Earlier pilot studies have suggested that eating this type of broccoli can improve your metabolism and reduce the levels of LDL cholesterol in your blood, as well as slowing the progression of early-stage prostate cancer. Larger studies are now in progress to confirm these results. \nSeeds and plants of Benefort\u00e9 broccoli are not yet available, but they should be soon, so let's hope we'll be growing our own within the next couple of years. For now, we can buy it by the bag from some supermarkets. Juice the job Interesting things have also recently emerged about the health benefits of beetroot . As well as containing calcium, magnesium, iron, phosphorous, potassium, manganese, folic acid and vitamin C, the natural dietary nitrates in beetroot \u2013 more specifically in beetroot juice \u2013 have been found to have two powerful physiological effects. They dilate (widen) the blood vessels, which can both reduce blood pressure and increase blood flow to muscles and the brain. In turn, this increases oxygen supply to the muscles for energy production which is especially beneficial during intensive exercise. Team GB put the properties of beetroot to good use in the 2012 Olympics, with athletes supplied with small shots (7cl) of concentrated juice a day. Many international rugby teams also use it. However, besides sport, beetroot juice is expected to have widespread implications for the treatment of high blood pressure. Most currently available antihypertensive drugs work in just this way \u2013 dilating blood vessels and so decreasing the pressure within them. I know which I'd rather consume. You can make your own beetroot juice, or buy James White Beet It or Cawston Press Brilliant Beetroot, or try the concentrated shots which have the great advantage of a controlled nitrate dose (0.4g), about the equivalent of 400ml juice. I like it straight, just as it is, but for the doubters, pre-dinner, add a shot of vodka and a splash of Tabasco and you'll have a delicious Crimson Mary. The beneficial nitrates are very soluble and easily lost in cooking, so either eat it raw (peel, grate and dress) or roast the roots, making sure that you do not waste the juice. Season's winners This is also the season for pomegranates, ripe now all around the Mediterranean, and these are emerging as another natural wonder-food. Originally from Persia (Iran), the pomegranate is one of the oldest known fruits, long revered as super-healthy, but is there a scientific base for this claim? Pomegranate juice is rich in potassium, Vitamin C, polyphenols and Vitamin B6. Clinical trials have shown it to reverse atherosclerosis \u2013 arterial disease from the formation of sticky plaques in our blood vessels \u2013 which leads to heart attacks and strokes. Compounds called punicalagins, found only in pomegranates, lower cholesterol and blood pressure and increase the speed at which arterial blockages melt away. Half a cup a day \u2013 or the seeds of a fruit \u2013 is recommended for those with cardiovascular disease. Eat a couple of tablespoons of pomegranate for breakfast with yogurt, scattered with a few walnuts and a drizzle of honey and add them over the top of a winter salad . Coming into season early in the new year is the final winter wonder-food, the blood orange. The red colouring comes mostly from anthocyanin pigments \u2013 important antioxidants \u2013 not usually found in citrus fruits. The same pigment gives blueberries their intense colour and antioxidant properties. Anthocyanins help to prevent cancer and decrease arterial disease, keeping blood vessels flexible and strong, so improving the outcome for those with cardiovascular illness. Peel and eat them as they are, drink their juice, or slice them into a salad with watercress and avocado. Integrating these four foods into our diet seems to be not just delicious but a wise thing to do. And as with all produce, the fresher the better, so where possible, grow your own.

Bishop S Singorayan of Salem Diocese, who is also the Chairman of the St Peter\u2019s Pontifical Seminary in Bengaluru, in his homily on the gospel readings for the mass, spoke on the importance of priestly ministry as was preached, practiced and instituted by Jesus Christ.\u201cChrist asked all his followers to a life of rendering exemplary service filled with humility and love,\u2019\u2019 Bishop Singorayan said and pointed out that all faithful, including the ordained priests, who followed the example of Jesus washing the feet of his disciples despite being their teacher and preacher so that they too did likewise belonged to the priestly class as propounded by the Second Vatican Council.Archbishop Bernard Moras, who had the rare privilege of completing 50 years of his priesthood, literally followed Christ\u2019s example in all his work and service to humanity with love, humility and compassion and thereby helped in bringing a change in the lives of all he served or worked with, the Bishop said and mentioned that it was possible because of the grace of God and abiding desire to follow Christ\u2019s teachings and example.His ministry helped people to bring about change in their personality, attitude and approach to life among others and was fruitful, the Bishop observed. \n\u201cThe world sees serving others as different and \u2018that is not for me.\u2019The approach and attitude of Jesus was different and we need to have the same mind-set of Jesus. We are called to do priestly service. If we do not have Jesus\u2019 mentality, we cannot serve others. We are called to serve others with humility. Jesus became humble. Serving with command is easier than serving with humility,\u2019\u2019 he said, adding: ``Jesus loved his disciples and washed their feet. All are called to serve with love, not so much with respect.\u2019\u2019 \n\u201cThe third aspect of service is to be exemplary. The service one should bring forth change in people. It was disgusting for Peter to let Jesus wash his feet. But Jesus refused Peter\u2019s request and did it. This brought about a great change in Peter. The disciples had arguments among themselves as to who was the greatest. We also need to bring about fruitful changes in people,\u2019\u2019 he said and pointed out that Archbishop Moras did exactly this. \n\u201cMany people were touched by his fruitful ministry. He made changes in the lives of many people through his service. Our service should leave an example to others. If I (Jesus), a teacher could do it, you also should be able to do it. So that it touches and changes the lives of others. The Jubilee is to be a moment of what is expected of everyone to do,\u2019\u2019 he said. \nThe other concelebrants at the mass were Archbishops of Nagpur, Bhopal, Madras-Myalapur and Bishops from several dioceses in Karnataka along with scores of priests, who included Msgr Jayananathan, C Francis and A S Anothonyswamy of the Archdiocese of Bangalore. \nMangaluru South MLA J R Lobo was among the faithful who took part in the Eucharistic Mass from the beginning, MLA N A Harris, Ivan D\u2019Souza, MLC and Government Chief Whip in the Council, Home Minister B Ramalinga Reddy and Bengaluru Development Minister K J George as well as senior police officers and top bureaucrats were among the prominent persons who joined the felicitation programme held soon after the mass. \nArchbishop Bernard Moras, while replying to the warm felicitation accorded to him, said he derived \u201cimmense joy and satisfaction\u2019\u2019 in all the challenging assignments that he held and acknowledged the support, encouragement and goodwill extended to him throughout his life. \nHe particularly mentioned his parents, family members and Fr John Pinto, the parish priest of his Kuppepadavu parish, who had encouraged him and the then Bishop of Mangalore Diocese Raymond D\u2019Mello, who was instrumental in his joining the St Joseph\u2019s Seminary in Mangalore for his priestly studies and Bishop Basil S D\u2019Souza, who ordained him. \nBengaluru Development Minister K J George described the Archbishop as a \u201cguide, philosopher and mentor, who served all sections of society without any discrimination of caste, religion or status.\u2019\u2019 \nGeorge also was full of praise for Archbishop for his tireless and dedicated service to people during the last 50 years and wished him good health and many more years of service to people. He also wished the Archbishop on behalf of the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. \nBishop Anthony Kariyil of Mandya Diocese said he had several occasions to interact with Archbishop Moras and said he had blessed the Bishop\u2019s House and the priests of the archdiocese cooperated with the priests of Mandya diocese in several ways. Archbishop Moras was always helpful and was an inspiration, he said. \nCSI Bishop also extended greetings to Archbishop Moras. \nThe Archbishop, who cut a cake to mark his sacerdotal golden jubilee, also laid the foundation stone for the construction of the Community Hall of St Francis Xavier\u2019s Cathedral. He also released the Bangalore Archdiocesan Pastoral Hand Book.A video clipping depicting various stages of life from his younger days and his engagements after ordination was screened to the public. \nEarlier, Fr Anthonyswamy, Chancellor and Parish Priest of St Francis Xavier Cathedral, welcomed all the bishops, dignitaries and others. He thanked God for 50 years of priesthood of Archbishop Moras, who he said ``is a pastor with courage and conviction. His care and concern for the flock is well known. He is a beacon of light. He is a consolation to those in trouble and difficulties. He has served 50 years faithfully and fruitfully.\u2019\u2019Msgr Jayanathan and Msgr C Francis read out messages from Pope, Vatican Prefect of the Congregation of Faith, Cardinals, Governor of Karnataka, president and vice president of CBCI, Methodist Bishop, Bishop of Believers\u2019 church, Malankara Syrian Church and many others. \nMsgr Jayanathan also presented a brief background of Archbishop, his studies, academics and other aspects of life. Several felicitations were read out by various language groups. He was presented with gifts and bouquets by various people since morning. Both Vicars General and Chancellor presented him with a citation, garlands and Peta (traditional cap). \nAll the bishops were also honoured with shawls and garlands. Bishop Antony Kariyil felicitating the Archbishop Fr Xavier E Manavath, Episcopal Vicar for Religious, felicitated Dr Moras on behalf of himself, priests, Religious and the lay faithful. \nKantharaj compered the programme. Msgr C Francis proposed a vote thanks. Leave a Comment Your Email address will not be published.

What can you do?", "text": "Flying with gout. What can you do if you forgot your gout medicine? \nThis page about flying with gout was last reviewed, or updated, on 9 May 2013. \nCan you fly with gout? It may not be something you have given consideration to, but if you get an attack of inflight gout, and you have forgotten your medicine for gout attacks, you'll wish you had. And there's at least two gout triggers inherent in flying, which are not as common on terra firma. There's the possibility of a nasty experience. \nAnd I have met a gout sufferer who had an attack immediately <i> after </i> a very long flight. It seems the flight built up the symptoms. \nSo what are the inflight gout triggers? \nFlying with gout trigger No.1 is your lack of mobility. Economy class aircraft seats are small and so is the leg room. It's a cramped location. \nKeeping blood circulating well is one of the ways of delaying/preventing gout attacks. The theory is that sluggish blood circulation, especially with plasma over saturated with uric acid, is more likely to trigger an attack of gout. That is to say, uric acid is more likely to crystallize into the MSU crystals. The immune system\u2019s response causes the pain and inflammation of acute gout attacks. \nAnd circulation is more sluggish in the feet than elsewhere, one reason for the tendency for attacks of gout to occur first in the big toe. \nTake extra care if your feet are cold. It's thought that coldness is another reason why uric acid crystallizes. The feet are the coldest part of the body. \nSo to get, or keep, blood circulating better you need to get walking - up and down the cabin's aisles. At stop-overs, a walk is a much better idea than propping up a bar, lounging on seats, eating in a restaurant. Go searching for medicine for gout attacks for example, and wander around the shops. \nThis page, at the Qantas airline website, explains some inflight exercises you can do, which it says may be effective at increasing blood circulation. \nFlying with gout trigger No.2 is dehydration. Aircraft are dehydrating places because their cabin's air has much less humidity than the air most of us breathe elsewhere. \nDehydration is NOT good for gout. It can trigger a gout attack. The risk grows with a longer flight. Uric acid is not very soluble but drinking water dilutes it. This dilution makes it less likely to crystallize, the event you must avoid. The usual recommendation is 6-8 x 8 fluid ozs glasses of water a day. If you are on board an aeroplane this amount of water (a lot for most people who haven't become used to it) is crucial. \nOn a plane, don't count the water in coffee, tea or juices. Just count the plain water or alkaline water. And make sure you are well hydrated before you board. \nIf you don't know why water drinking is so important in preventing gout attacks, visit this page at www.best-gout-remedies.com \nFlying with gout trigger No.3 is the wine or other alcohol. Unless you've experienced differently, a couple of glasses of wine a day aren't going to trigger an acute gout attack. But an alcoholic binge might, and if the airline you're flying with is generous with the drinks you might just trigger your first attacks for some time. In other words a few over your limit - in this case your uric acid crystallisation limit - could trigger an attack. \nWhat is the uric acid crystallisation limit? At 7.0mg/dL (0.416 mmol/L)or higher, uric acid is more likely to crystallise (crystallize). \nUse a uric acid meter to check your level before you fly. \nINFLIGHT GOUT ATTACKS - WHAT CAN YOU DO IF YOU FORGET YOUR MEDICINES? \nSo you forgot your gout medicine. You are flying and gout rears its ugly head. What can you do? Is there a worse place to have a gout attack than an aeroplane? It's the lack of freedom and mobility. You can't even make a beeline for a hospital's accident and emergency unit (emergency room, ER), or your doctor's surgery or clinic. You are trapped in a flying tube. \nHere's some ideas for what you might do. \n* Make sure your attack is known to the flight attendants. Don't suffer in silence. They can find out if there is a doctor on the flight. \n* Ask the flight attendants if they have any pain killing medicine on board. For gout, best is probably indomethacin or voltaren. \n* Ask around with other passengers. As long as the flight is reasonably full someone should have at least Ibuprofen. \n* Remember, remember. Don't use low dose aspirin. It increases your risk of a gout attack and it can worsen it. And paracetamol (acetaminophen) has no anti inflammatory action, but may help if you feel a fever coming on. \n* If you are on a long haul, intercontinental, flight at the next stop airport there will be a pharmacy, or a shop selling some pharmacy products. Ask for its gout medicine or strongest pain killer, but it may only be Ibuprofen. \n* If you're travelling economy, ask the flight attendant if you can move to one of the rows at the beginning of a cabin. (There's usually an adjacent emergency exit). You won't be parachuting out, although you might feel like it, but these rows have more leg room and you can raise your legs higher than in other economy seats, which only have those tiny foot rests. These aren't much good. You want to raise your legs if possible. \n* For a gout attack, first and business class are clearly better to be in. If you\u2019re in economy you could try your luck, tell the attendant the story, and ask if you can move to first or business class. Or ask to move to a seat where there are one or two (better) spare seats next to it. \n* If a meal is served, do not drink wine, nor any other alcohol, and only eat low purine foods. If you don't know which they are, visit this page for a list. \n* If you are flying beyond the next stop, ask the flight attendants (if you're lucky they will have dealt with an acute gout attack before) to get you a wheelchair if you think you need it. \n* If putting your foot (if that's where the attack of gout is) in ice cold water dampens the pain, ask the attendants for it. They have the ice and they have the water. \n* If you suffer from cold feet (which might just have something to do with your gout) take an extra pair of socks, or wear two pairs. \n* Next time you're on a flight, ask the flight attendant what they do for a gout attack. Partly play the role before it happens, and you find it easier to deal with if it actually happens. \n* Consider taking your own special drinks e.g. alkaline water, cherry juice, or celery juice on board. Especially if it's a long intercontinental flight. If you want to do this, these days you had better first check if there are any security issues about doing this. \nRelated pages", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "qantas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:40.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3f7a5a68f312f7f68ccfc58f617e654e6f6eca97", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9soV4T7Mg_PVxn4lLvCXOWP93RidcbOMshCwiEJj.KZx2jXLiKUHSqMQjxbj.WaBprG6KLqaLEeA--", "site_full": "www.therepublic.com", "site": "therepublic.com", "site_section": "http://www.therepublic.com/feed/cat/6720", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Pro Basketball (NBA) \u2013 The Republic", "title": "Hornets coach Clifford out indefinitely with \u2018health issue\u2019", "title_full": "Hornets coach Clifford out indefinitely with \u2018health issue\u2019", "published": "2017-12-06T19:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://d1bdhkmqqz901h.cloudfront.net/1200x630/smart/http://s3.amazonaws.com/new-smedia/bbff1596b6854d5aaed2be9ac5d4337f/5da736c52e5a471e907008feec72852a.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 79823, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f7a5a68f312f7f68ccfc58f617e654e6f6eca97", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9soV4T7Mg_PVxn4lLvCXOWP93RidcbOMshCwiEJj.KZx2jXLiKUHSqMQjxbj.WaBprG6KLqaLEeA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-06T19:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hornets coach Clifford out indefinitely with \u2018health issue\u2019", "text": "Hornets coach Clifford out indefinitely with \u2018health issue\u2019 By STEVE REED - 12/6/17 11:36 PM \nCHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 Hornets coach Steve Clifford will be away from the team for an undetermined period of time to deal with a \u201chealth issue.\u201d \nThe team made the announcement Wednesday in a release. \nThe 56-year-old Clifford missed Monday night\u2019s game against Orlando because he was not feeling well. Associate head coach Stephen Silas filled in for Clifford against the Magic. \nClifford has battled heart problems in the past, but a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press the issue was not a heart-related. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team has not released details of Clifford\u2019s health issue. \nThe team said there is no timetable for Clifford\u2019s return and that officials would have no further comment. \nSilas will continue to coach the team with Clifford out. The Hornets host Golden State Wednesday night. \n\u201cI just want to send him my best wishes,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cObviously I have been through some issues, and I don\u2019t know what his health issues are, but it\u2019s no fun. I\u2019m wishing him well and I hope he gets back on the sideline soon. But more importantly I hope that he\u2019s healthy.\u201d \nIf the players know what is wrong with Clifford, they aren\u2019t saying. \n\u201cI feel like Cliff is one of those guys, no matter what is going on his life, he\u2019s always going to be here,\u201d Hornets forward Marvin Williams said. \u201cSo for him to not be here now is a little bit concerning. I have texted back and forth with him a couple of times and he\u2019s texted back every time. He seems in good spirits. Whatever is going on with him I\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine. If he has to step away to make sure he\u2019s OK, that\u2019s what is most important.\u201d \nWilliams said the team has confidence in Silas. \n\u201cWe will continue to follow his lead,\u201d Williams said. \nClifford underwent a procedure in 2013 \u2014 his first year as Charlotte\u2019s head coach \u2014 to have two stents placed in his heart, but returned to coaching just three days later. The procedure came after Clifford began experiencing chest pain while eating at a Charlotte restaurant and had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital. \nClifford has since changed his diet and has been eating healthier. \nThe Hornets were playing well at home under Clifford, but are just 9-13 overall heading into Wednesday night\u2019s game. They have struggled on the road, where they are 1-10 this season despite the play of All-Star Kemba Walker. The point guard is turning in another impressive season, averaging 22.7 points and 6.3 assists per game. \nFor more NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball TAGS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve reed", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "clifford", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kemba walker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marvin williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve clifford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen silas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve kerr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "the associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "charlo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:40.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ec080ad252e1c24e4760bc5cc0fdc052371e965a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4kcwEST15E2K4a3McpAlnR8XtvRlV3RCJuxuEkE7iAxxfjjVUPVsH4xf.02DzZ4JsIvdM7wF11A--", "site_full": "www.ft.com", "site": "ft.com", "site_section": "http://app.feed.informer.com/digest3/VLZEFJTITH.atom", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "World News Review", "title": "Norway oil fund makes first Asia property purchase", "title_full": "Norway oil fund makes first Asia property purchase", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1571, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ec080ad252e1c24e4760bc5cc0fdc052371e965a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4kcwEST15E2K4a3McpAlnR8XtvRlV3RCJuxuEkE7iAxxfjjVUPVsH4xf.02DzZ4JsIvdM7wF11A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Norway oil fund makes first Asia property purchase", "text": "All the benefits of Standard Digital, plus: Unlimited access to all content FT Confidential Research - in-depth China and Southeast Asia analysis ePaper - the digital replica of the printed newspaper Full access to LEX - our agenda setting daily commentary Exclusive emails, including a weekly email from our Editor, Lionel Barber Full access to EM Squared- news and analysis service on emerging markets Purchase a Standard Digital subscription for", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "standard digital", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lionel barber full", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:40.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c89475c27845f30a8b96f9797c91981c381fa966", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT5HuIrY93qtOkgQ5kwe667sI0Ha_dta2jPY1Mb77euez5DCPKM0xyelPsvgEx8sQrxA_55F5aSMWrj3B3fioVx0pCC_rYVEdc-", "site_full": "www.ignant.com", "site": "ignant.com", "site_section": "https://www.ignant.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "iGNANT.com", "title": "Atelier G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Creates An Aerial Home", "title_full": "Atelier G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Creates An Aerial Home", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c89475c27845f30a8b96f9797c91981c381fa966", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT5HuIrY93qtOkgQ5kwe667sI0Ha_dta2jPY1Mb77euez5DCPKM0xyelPsvgEx8sQrxA_55F5aSMWrj3B3fioVx0pCC_rYVEdc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rosie Flanagan", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Atelier G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Creates An Aerial Home", "text": "by Rosie Flanagan December 07, 2017 \nAs Mount Shefford\u2019s slope gives way to a dense maple forest, a black-clad minimalist home cantilevers above the trees.

Columbia Council is considering a law that would change the name of the block in front of the Russian Embassy in remembrance of the former Russian dissident. The Kremlin is not amused. \n\"We are not allowed to honor a Russian statesman in Russia. Russian officials are fighting Boris Nemtsov even after his death.\" \nVladimir Kara-Murza, a longtime Nemtsov aide, did not mince his words at a city council hearing on renaming a stretch of the road outside the Washington Russian Embassy compound to Boris Nemtsov Plazaon Wednesday. \nThe new legislation sponsored by two D.C. Council members, Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, and Mary M. Cheh, would symbolically honor the pro-democracy Russian dissident and influential opposition leader who was gunned down in Moscow in 2015 . Watch video 01:25 \nPermalink http://p.dw.com/p/2YLxp A fearless rebel: Second anniversary of Boris Nemtsov's murder \nMany believe the 55-year-old former deputy prime minister was assassinated for his opposition to Vladimir Putin's regime, or by dubious nationalist forces who were inspired by a state-controlled propaganda campaign calling the political opposition traitors. \n\"There is no doubt the murder was motivated by his political beliefs, his popularity and his frequent criticism of the Russian government,\" Cheh declared during the public hearing. \nAccording to Mendelson this new legislation is a strong \"statement in support of democratic values,\" and would send a clear signal to Russia. The honorary naming would also support those who \"show courage, tenacity and risk their freedom or even their very lives for the principles of democracy,\" Cheh added. \nHigh-profile murder \nNemtsov, a star politician whose career flourished during the 1990s, was long considered a potential successor to Boris Yeltsin, the first President of the Russian Federation. With Putin's rise to power and efforts to dismantle the the country's fragile new institutions, Nemtsov grew into a determined opponent of the president. \nRead more : Opinion: Political assassination of Boris Nemtsov still not solved \nOne of his final acts was to denounce the invasion of Ukraine. Just hours before his assassination, he had called on Muscovites to protest against the economic crisis and the war in Ukraine during a radio appearance. He was also supposed to lead a major protest march later that week. \nThe move to name a plaza in Nemtsov's name is unlikely to go down well in Moscow \nOn Feb. 27, 2015, Nemtsov was walking across a heavily guarded bridge, meters from one of the Kremlin towers, when he was shot four times from a passing car late at night. \n\"He [Nemstov] was smeared by state media as a traitor, he was arrested and jailed for peaceful demonstrations. He was silenced the only way he could have been,\" Kara-Murza said, who says he himself has been poisoned twice , presumably because of his political beliefs. \nThe murder is considered the most high-profile political killing in Russia since Putin's rise to power in 2000. \nNo justice for Nemtsov \nAuthorities later arrested five men , all ethnic Chechens from the volatile North Caucasus region. In June last year, a jury convicted them of murdering Nemtsov in exchange for a payment of 15 million rubles ($253,000, \u20ac215,000) offered by a Chechen security official named Ruslan Mukhudinov, who is still at large. Zaur Dadaev was found guilty of murdering Nemtsov while the other four were convicted of aiding in the assassination. \nAs a former officer in the security forces, Dadaev was closely connected to to Chechnya's Kremlin-backed, and notoriously brutal leader Ramzan Kadyrov who is a fierce defender of Putin. To date, the Putin regime has not identified or held responsible those who ordered Nemtsov's murder more than two years ago. \nNemtsov's followers are still seeking justice and keeping his memory alive. \"For more than 1,000 days, whether its snowing or raining, a group of volunteers has been bringing flowers, portrait and candles for my father to the Bolshoi Moskvoretsky Bridge, where he was killed,\" Zhanna Nemtsova, Nemtsov's daughter, who works as a journalist at DW, said during the hearing. According to her, the anti-democratic nationalist movement, presumably on the orders of high-ranking Russian officials, has dismantled the makeshift memorial more than 70 times since. \"The current political Russian regime wants to eradicate all memories of my father, since it believes correctly that symbols are important,\" she said. \nAn act of remembrance \nMembers of Congress and D.C. Council members have a history of renaming or attempting to rename streets in the city to make political statements. In the 1980s Congress moved to name a block in front of the Russian Embassy the Andrei Sakharov Plaza , honoring the Soviet Union's best-known dissident \u2014 a move that infuriated Moscow.

In their order dated December 1, 2017, Justice AK Tripathi and Justice Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said, \"The collector, Gaya will have to appear in person on the next date on December 15 and explain to the court in person as to the current status and the steps taken for getting rid of encroachment etc. in the famous Gandhi Maidan of Gaya. The earlier show cause reply does not satisfy this court for the reason that there seems to be some kind of effort to regularize those constructions instead of getting rid of the construction in the Gandhi Maidan\".\nThe order was passed during the hearing of a petition no. 1515/2015.\nPratinjya, a citizen group, in 2012 filed a PIL in the high court seeking removal of all encroachments from Gaya Gandhi Maidan as it was the only open space in the city. Disposing off the PIL, the high court, on February 2013 directed the chief secretary to take effective steps for encroachment removal.\nAs the high court order was not complied with, a contempt petition was filed by the citizen body. According to Brajnandan Pathak, an RTI activist and chief of Pratinjya, the failure of the administrative machinery to ensure removal of all encroachments from the Gandhi Maidan is a matter of concern.\nAs per official records, about one dozen concrete structures have come up on Gaya Gandhi Maidan without the mandatory approval of the revenue department or Gaya Municipal Corporation , the agency responsible for regulation of construction work in the corporation area. Sources said the Gandhi Maidan is one of the only four places in the country where Mahatma Gandhi's urns have been preserved.\nBefore filing the PIL, Pathak through an RTI petition sought information on six different points including the status and area of the Gandhi Maidan as per the survey records of 1914 and 1985-86. Records of the 1914 survey were not made available on the alibi that they were not traceable.\nAccording to old timers, the 1914 survey records showed Gandhi Maidan (then known as Church Yard) as the property of the 'Qaiser-e-Hind' (Crown of India) i.e. the Govt of India. However, according to Rai Madan Kishor, former district survey and settlement officer, as per the provisions of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, unmarked property of the 'Qaiser-e-Hind' automatically vested in the state government.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brajnandan pathak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahatma gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajiv ranjan prasad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gandhi maidan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rai madan kishor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pratinjya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pathak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice ak tripathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaya municipal corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rti", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaya gandhi maidan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gandhi maidan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pratinjya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:40.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "447a3b920b40102a4ee09fcd63f77ea77a92787e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED82VwYLDn_1XFN9rRPeDOZvrW7280w4hLzgrgXA81CwAZyNc9V2N6oWuDEs4OYq3crxdTBvh7Uabg--", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9829974) White is not a shared ethnic identity", "title_full": "FARK.com: (9829974) White is not a shared ethnic identity", "published": "2017-12-07T05:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 102, "participants_count": 95, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "http://img.fark.net/images/cache/orig/E/EJ/fark_EJEldwAs4WOjqLmndzlwGsZSIgU.jpg?t=3LoRk8CqeckQiETlCpiTPA&amp;f=1512968400", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3382, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c6a081c7f940b00c9478d4b2643337dc3dd3c82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED82VwYLDn_1XFN9rRPeDOZvrW7280w4hLzgrgXA81CwAZyNc9V2N6oWuDEs4OYq3cpxJn8u2V2IaoGeCSezkSpT", "ord_in_thread": 58, "author": "spamdog", "published": "2017-12-07T07:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "thismomentinblackhistory : Good questions.
