Burntstrobe and the Shapers \nModdb.com \nEven though they are considered out of the running for this year\u2019s Moddb award because of last years most anticipated mod win, they are a vital component to our success and provide a lot of support to the entire EaWmodding community. \nWe will also be doing a special event for this year\u2019s mod of the year event. Starting from now until the end of the year, we will be doing daily unit updates showing off our updated units and unit roster. These images will also be used for the mod\u2019s manual that will release along with the mod. So enjoy the sneak peek and once again, don\u2019t forget to vote! AotR 2.6 Steam Workshop Support \nAs many of you know, Petroglyph and Disney have been very kind to restart support for Empire at War on Steam. The new patch adds multiplayer support and a lot of additional bugfixes, the most impactful for this mod being that the AI can now be fully loaded from the Mods directory. Because of this, we have released an updated version of AotR 2.6 onto the Steam Workshop, which has no additional steps for AI installation. Simply load the mod from the in game launcher, or use the provided launch options in the description. The mod also fixes the minor issue of the Death Star spawning for the AI after a successful Rebel story completion. \nWe also are looking into releasing a version here for Moddb for all you non-steam user folks. Thanks to Corey from Thrawn\u2019s Revenge, who has many times repeated (to my blissful forgetfulness) that we can try and compile the AI and XML files into a Meg file to load the AI without any additional installation on your part. Hopefully, we can get that fix in along with the additional fix for the Death Star story for everyone to enjoy. \nNow on to 2.7\u2026 Alpha, what Alpha? \nOver the past few months, the much fabled AotR 2.7 Alpha has circled around various testers and YouTube personalities. The goal of the closed alpha was to help ensure general stability and overall feedback on the new AI and design changes. We have plans for a third and (hopefully) final alpha which will have some more core features and updates that need testing. But before we talk about that, I wanted to share some of the high level learnings that the team has taken from the closed alpha. \nWe found that the AI from the alpha has lost a lot of aggressiveness than what was expected out of an AotR experience. Instead the AI opted to put more effort into defenses and especially in the late game, had the tendency to be able to build things they should not be able to. To remedy this problem, the AI attack scripts and evaluations have already received a major overhaul. More focus was put on the AI aggressiveness into back systems, so they are always moving towards the galaxy edge from their starting positions. \nAnother minor adjustment with a lot of impact is the fact that the AI can now attack planets through systems that are not defended in space. Meaning that holding the ground on a world will no longer prevent them from attacking weaker planets in the back. This small change has already made huge impacts into how difficult the AI is, and it causes some very interesting encounters to happen. \nOn top of this, we reworked how the AI gets its units. They will no longer be able to build a unit they do not have the required structure for, preventing the late game slog of large ship stacks. However, because of this change, we have made the Empire\u2019s basic frigate shipyards buildable on all planets in order to keep them from getting \u201cunit locked\u201d without a shipyard planet. This brings them on the same playing field as the other two factions. \u201cDifficult to see, the future is\u201d \nThere are a couple of additional features that have found their way late into the game for AotR. Spearheaded by Maxim, and with the help of YvaW\u2019s very own KadVenku, we were able to add some features that were previously a challenge for us. Because of this, we are going ever so slightly delay working on the beta for a short bit, and instead work on releasing a third alpha. Many of the new features use completely new Lua architecture that needs to be tested for stability. Keep in mind that without these new Lua discoveries, these items were previously not going to be in AotR! Hero Rescue Missions \nEver since the moment I began working on AotR, I had an idea to change how the normal hero respawn system worked. The problem with heroes in Empire at War stems from the fact that you can use them with a lack of regard for their survival and always get them back after a simple respawn timer. While this is an alright system for heroes that don\u2019t provide much combat bonuses, it becomes a problem with heroes such as Admiral Akbar or the Executor. Many players have complained that they would kill either of these two heroes, sacrificing a majority of their fleet only to have their hard work be annulled with the hero respawning. \nSo the next option would be to remove hero respawns all together. While that would be an easy solution, it presents two more gameplay concerns. Firstly, an infinite death system causes players to be far too cautious in using their heroes for combat, favoring to keep units in the back lines to keep their galactic bonuses. We don\u2019t want all heroes to become just stat boosts, and we don\u2019t want to make the player fear using them. The second issue here is that AotR has an in depth story element that requires certain heroes to be alive in order for the story to progress. In a way, we need certain heroes to come back so the story can continue. \nWhich is where Hero Rescue Missions come into play. Major story characters, such as Leia or Darth Vader, have been given an alternate respawn system. As soon as your hero has been killed in either the galactic map or during combat, you will now receive a mission that informs you that your hero has been captured by the enemy. A \u201csemi-random\u201d location is chosen based on the enemy you just fought, and you will be tasked to take back the planet to get your hero back. This system is only on heroes that are story mission specific and do not have a major impact on combat. Heroes like Akbar or Garm Bel Iblis will not receive these missions, and once killed will be gone forever. Now if your hero is needed for a future mission, you better make some adjustments to your strategy and free them from captivity. \nRight now the AI has a basic respawn mechanic in place to simulate this event for them. It is also only applied to the heroes that need to have it for story reasons. We are still thinking about creating missions for capturing AI hero prisoners, but for now we think a basic respawn system suits our needs just fine. If you kill the Executor, you kill it for good. But that doesn\u2019t mean you or the AI won\u2019t be able to rebuild a similar classed ship\u2026 Unit Filters \nIn order to help reduce the clutter of all the building and unit upgrades and help alleviate the limitation of the number of units in the build bar, we have introduced a new filter system for the GUI. By using the new filter buttons you are able to only look at categories of units you wish to see. This becomes especially useful on large production planets that may have more production options than build bar slots. The biggest blocker before for doing this properly is getting it to work correctly with unlocked units via mission rewards. Maxim has solved this problem, so now the unit filters are fully operational. Mercenary Wages \nWe wanted to make a system for the Black Sun mercenaries (and any other future units using this method) to collect wages on a weekly basis. Mercenaries will now come cheap initially, and will be a great unit to recruit in a pinch. However, each week there will be a recurring mission that pays for the mercenaries. The mission fixes mercenaries not having to be paid if they are enroute to a world, or draining credits from enemy planets when stationed over them. If you are unable to pay the full weeks\u2019 worth of mercenary wages it will result in mercenaries leaving your cause. Structure Upkeep \nWith the upgrade and downgrade base system functional and tested, we are now going to be working on having a downside to keeping planets heavily upgraded. Each building that is not a credit production facility will require weekly upkeep. Cost will be determined based on two categories: building type and upgrade level. Production buildings will cause a small base amount of credits while defensive structures will require more. Anything that requires a power generator will cost the most amount of credits to keep operational. On top of that, the higher the level of building the more it will cost as well. This change will allow us to take full advantage of what the system was designed to do, and that is make sacrifices in order to keep your economy growing positively. \nAlong with this mechanic, we want the AI to be able to figure out good planets to save money on and actively downgrade planets that are in better defensive spots. This should be the final major galactic AI change we need to do, so we would like to test their behavior thoroughly. Space Defense Structures \nMany people have asked about being able to build additional space structures tailored exclusively for additional defenses. We have been on the fence about this idea for a while, but after hearing the large request for it we are going to work on giving each faction some sort of space structure for defense. Right now we are thinking additional Golan platforms for the Empire (provided you already have a Golan space station), additional Rebel XQs, and some special stuff for the Black Sun that we reveal at a later point. Also included in this project is expanding the Space tech levels from 3 to 5 in order to prepare for our larger pool of units. Each of these stations will use the original space station models, but their weapons and loadouts will be rebalanced so that they will only be able to protect themselves from minor attacks. It\u2019s Gonna Get a Lot Beta. \nI also want to take some time to dive more deeply into the development stages for version 2.7. After the final alpha build, we plan to move forward into developing for the Beta stage. In traditional development terminology, reaching Beta involves being \u201ccontent complete.\u201d This means that every feature, unit, story mission, and everything to do with galactic conquest is completed. On the road to beta the team will be focusing on finishing the unit overhaul, overhauling the battle AIs, and finishing the entire story. This will not be a short development cycle. In fact, this next stretch of development will be the longest yet. We have well over 100 units to still redo, and three total campaigns to redo from scratch. And that is just the big ticket items. Don\u2019t worry though, we will be providing constant updates as we always have, and there is definitely going to be some really cool surprises along the way. \nOnce we finish Beta, we will move into the final release candidate development. Here we will focus on balancing, audio, text, and of course, squashing bugs. Once we are confident with the state of the mod, we will then, and only then, release version 2.7. \nThroughout our discussions we have had to sacrifice some big ticket items and push them back into future versions. Two major things that are planned that will not make it into the release of 2.7 are the overhauled ground combat and skirmish mode. Much of this work here can be done at the same time as our work for 2.8, but will release sooner than that version. We have added an additional release of 2.7.5, which will include the things that were mentioned above. \nOur reasoning here is that while we do want these things completed, they require a significant time investment to complete. Right now we do not have an established mapping team, and many of the ground assets discussed are far grander than any ground map has gone before. We like to make sure that the game engine can actually handle the ideas we have via prototype before actually promising what they are. \nOn top of that, while skirmish is a mode that we definitely want to make our own, we don\u2019t really feel that it should hold up the release of version 2.7, which already has enough things on its plate. Skirmish in 2.7.5 will take advantage of a lot of gameplay goodies that AotR is known for. Shipyards, upgraded units, and structure upkeep just to name a few. We are heavily inspired by the skirmish mode in SAU 3.3, so take a look at that mode for a better understanding of what we are aiming for. \nAnyways, that\u2019s all for now. Once again, don't forget to vote for mod of the year. And as always here's a cool little nifty thing I found...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maxim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petroglyph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "black sun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "garm bel iblis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thrawn", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:03.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f4c2961b70f554745daeacb396821748369eaf9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QCjJMm01ny0hSGaU8FgAEjOotfg_dAVKmR7BzfVFl6fvmtb9szsDRxafXTtqgNTANPoZ7xMBLdaT_48.6bag4AaNAdkbAnIzcLL4CLvLB3K4CtaBKN8Hd", "site_full": "www.politicaljack.com", "site": "politicaljack.com", "site_section": "http://www.politicaljack.com/forums/latest-political-news-and-current-events.2/", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Latest Political News and Current Events | PoliticalJack.com", "title": "Jerusalem Capital of Israel and God of Moses | Page 2", "title_full": "Jerusalem Capital of Israel and God of Moses | Page 2 | PoliticalJack.com", "published": "2017-12-06T18:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.politicaljack.com/data/avatars/m/9/9816.jpg?1491244321", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da5c5a15ef1cf0476fba61377fd5f057c11c61f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QCjJMm01ny0hSGaU8FgAEjOotfg_dAVKmR7BzfVFl6fvmtb9szsDRxafXTtqgNTANPoZ7xMBLdaT_48.6bag4AaNAdkbAnIzcLL4CLvLB3N98z6QfLYhYIxF.bgOaqBc-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Caroljo", "published": "2017-12-06T18:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "redtide said: \u2191 those nations do not like the Palestinians and will not allow them in.

He was sentenced to five months in jail and lost his final appeal in September 2000, according to reports.\nSandra Johnson, 18, was killed in Thunder Bay in 1992. Her murder remains unsolved. (Thunder Bay Police Cold Cases)\nDuring Johnston's trial, a Thunder Bay constable named Andre Lichtenfeld testified that he witnessed several prominent Thunder Bay citizens pick up sex trade workers downtown. He testified that the sex workers included underage girls, according to a transcript of the proceedings obtained by CBC News.\nLichtenfeld testified that he witnessed a \"Native youth counselor\" and \"businessmen\" along with \"teachers, restaurant managers, (an) alderman, two judges and another person that is well known in the society. To give the title, you would know who it was.\"\nFirst calls for national inquiry Ontario Provincial Police investigators were first tipped off to Johnston during an investigation into the death of Sandra Johnson, according to disclosure records obtained by CBC News.\nJohnson's still-unsolved killing triggered some the first reported calls for a federal inquiry into murdered and missing Indigenous women.

Here are some screenshots: Here's some gameplay (as well as some listed changes): Download the game here: Second: \nI'd like to talk about the Barlock Games website as well as the Malfunction game page on IndieDB. \nI am aware that the Barlock Games website is out of date and I sincerely apologize for that. I have updated the site and you can now find everything you need on there. \nAs for the Malfunction IndieDB page. Though it will very much stay, I plan on perhaps making a separate page for Hectic's development. Though the Malfunction page may sometimes be a bit....quiet, you can still expect to hear any information regarding Malfunction and it's future titles. \nAnyways, enjoy Hectic's latest update, and have yourselves a lovely day!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hud", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:04.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aeebf56f3205a322392d8101c0a180c4d9f30572", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OnPDzbV.8T.o7GoyEwZFrgr8XAG.6YDEyuTP_Pxg5l55CnX4wamxS.vcVbcC4piQ-", "site_full": "www.outdoorsmenforum.ca", "site": "outdoorsmenforum.ca", "site_section": "http://www.outdoorsmenforum.ca/forumdisplay.php?f=6", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Guns &amp; Ammo Discussion - Alberta Outdoorsmen Forum", "title": "Can't decide on a semi-auto shotgun", "title_full": "Can't decide on a semi-auto shotgun - Alberta Outdoorsmen Forum", "published": "2017-12-07T06:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0d6ed6e3da7e93ead8433dd968552f6d2d8c0146", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OnPDzbV.8T.o7GoyEwZFrgr8XAG.6YDEyuTP_Pxg5l55CnX4wamxSlTlxm5ZV1JXrIakX1MMQcAoRK_crJQh5", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Newview01", "published": "2017-12-07T06:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I have a Beretta A400 Unico that has never jammed, and it has run some pretty cheap loads.

It has much better network code than the original game, adding console commands to online games, fixing most major game-crashing errors and connection problems, allowing permitted clients to log in as \"remote administrators\" in someone else's server and control the gameplay, and adding several new multiplayer gamemodes. It additionally fixes or enhances many of the events in the game, and allows level designers far more power than in regular JJ2 through the addition of an easy-to-use scripting language. JJ2+ takes everything great about JJ2 and adds so much more on top of it; it is truly a must-download. JJ2+ is distributed under the MIT license. Post news Report RSS Jazz Jackrabbit series on GOG.com GOG.com is selling Jazz 1 and Jazz 2, and JJ2+ is included! Click here for more details, plus a roundup of other JJ2+ news: a new public issue tracker, a level editor that lets you use infinite layers and tilesets, a new competitive multiplayer season, and an exclusive preview screenshot of the next(?) JJ2+ release. Posted by Violet_CLM on Dec 7th, 2017 You can buy Jazz Jackrabbit 2 for the first time this century \nHuge news, y'all! Thanks to the impeccable legal prowess of the folks at GOG.com, the Jazz Jackrabbit series is available for purchase again! If you don't own the games legally yet, or if you own the CDs but want digital copies, or you just want to support the games, or for any reason at all , you can buy them right here: Jazz 2 ; Jazz 1 \nNot only that, but JJ2+ is included . You buy Jazz 2 from GOG, you can install JJ2+ directly through the GOG Galaxy client (or from a manual download link from their website). We now have pretty much as close as it's possible to get to official approval from Epic Games as an integral part of the Jazz 2 experience. Epic and GOG contacted me the other week and we tracked down a bunch of people and jumped through some legal hoops etc. and now everything's wonderful! Jazz 2 and Jazz 1 were at the top of GOG's bestsellers list for several days after their initial release and it was great to see. We'd all been waiting for this to happen for so very long. Issue Tracker \nThe next JJ2+ release isn't quite ready yet, but as of today, we have a dedicated public issue tracker . If you've found a bug in our patch, or if there's something you'd like to see changed or added, this is the place for you to go. Previously we'd been making do with a couple forum threads, but those were hard to navigate, and there was no easy way of going back to old reports or suggestions and marking them as having been completed. But now there's a tracker forum! Please fill it up with lots of things that are not yet as perfect as they could be! Use MLLE to make levels with JJ2+ features \nIf you've been following JJ2+ for a while, you know that it brings a lot of awesome new features to the game for level designers to use, such as the ability to use more than eight layers in a level, or use multiple tilesets at the same time, or edit the palette. Such features had always been a little inconvenient to actually set up, though, because JCS, the game's official level editor, never supported any of that stuff. Fortunately, Multi-Layer Level Editor (MLLE) is an unofficial level editor that does almost everything JCS can do, plus lots more . If you want to make a level with five tilesets and dozens of parallax layers, designing your own palette and drawing some of your own tiles in the process, MLLE lets you do all that stuff and more from inside the editor . Check it out and make some of the most graphically rich JJ2+ levels ever seen! Jazz Duelists' Challenge Season 28 starts this weekend \nFor twenty-seven seasons now, Jazz Duelists' Challenge has been the place to go to play Jazz 2 online multiplayer with your friends and rivals. Between duels, challenges, and organized events, no matter your preferred playstyle there's bound to be something there for you. And the next season is starting this very weekend, to celebrate the holiday season and to celebrate Jazz 2 being sold on GOG.com. Grab your blasters, login or register a new account, and get ready to roast some rabbits... there should be some unexpected surprises coming up this season! ;) What's yet to come? \nAs I said earlier, the next JJ2+ release isn't ready yet, but as always we're working to put together cool stuff for you, such as the above screenshot. And in the meantime we have slightly updated the last JJ2+ release , to include a new example level (\"Seasons of Diamondus\") and a new mutator (sejtf.mut, which transforms normal JJ2 gameplay by letting you choose a new character class every time you die, each with its own set of weapons). This was mostly done to get rid of some old copyright-infringing stuff to make it easier to get JJ2+ onto GOG, but as a side benefit, you get more cool Jazzy stuff to play with. :) Though as usual, don't forget to check out Jazz 2 Online's downloads section for more cool Jazzy stuff than it's possible to imagine.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Market attractiveness analysis was carried out for the algae market on the basis of application, cultivation technology, region, and country. Market attractiveness was estimated on the basis of common parameters that directly impact the market. \nThe algae cultivation process focuses on carbon capturing. These innovations have helped several companies involved in algae cultivation and production to generate funds from government and private investors. The governments of several countries are setting targets to minimize their carbon emissions leading to increased demand for algae-based products. Volatility in the supply and prices of crude resulting from geopolitical differences and varying demand from consumers further strengthens the possibility of using algae-based products. Blends of fossil fuels and algae-based biofuels are being utilized in the transportation sector to check the commercial viability of biofuels produced from algae. Full-scale biofuel commercialization requires robust investments on technological developments and more than ten times the expansion of existing production facilities. Minimizing the cost of end products such as jet fuel, kerosene, ethanol, and methanol manufactured from algal biomass is the primary concern. High growth of the algae-to-biofuel market is anticipated by 2035. \nBrowse Full Report with TOC @ www.mrrse.com/algae-market \nThe global algae market has been segmented into two categories: by application and by cultivation technology.

Post news Report RSS Battle Under Trees Year in Review A very popular thing to do in this period is to write a review of the past year, highlight the mod\u2019s ups and downs, pros and cons, give a conclusion and talk about the future. So that\u2019s I\u2019m going to do. Take a journey with me (NewErr) through a recap of what happened in the last years of the mod. Posted by NewErr on Dec 7th, 2017 \nDear friends and followers, \nThe most awaited time of the year has come again, the Mod of the Year awards, here on Moddb. An event in which modders showcase their latest works, announce special news and surprise their fans with new content. \nUsually this was a time of joy and hopefulness and that\u2019s how I was remembering it, a time where I was eager to share content with the fans and discuss loads of stuff with the team and players. However this year is bitter sweet since I am working alone now, not really anyone around to share my ideas, insights and disappointments with. A handful of people seem to still stick around so at least that keeps me motivated. \nI want to share some statistics since we are here, recently several things happened. First of all, we passed 800,000 page visits here, been a long way since we had the prefix changed. We also reached a reasonable number of followers on Facebook (55) which has grown pretty well recently. And last but not least, we reached ~620 followers. Of course, there are people that left 4 years ago but the fact that the number is still growing shows me there is still hope... to not play this mod alone. It\u2019s so interesting how this community still stays strong through different mods, patches, servers. \nA very popular thing to do in this period is to write a review of the past year, highlight the mod\u2019s ups and downs, pros and cons, give a conclusion and talk about the future. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. (Expected something smarter, eh?) \nFirst of all, I will talk mostly about the past 2 years and not just the last. Two years ago, somewhat around this time I announced something that probably changed my modding experience more than my previous 7 years: The Battle Under The Trees. Basically Ridder Clan\u2019s Wood Elven faction. But it was more than just that, Mirkwood was the faction that I always wanted to do and was the first faction I wanted to make when I started modding. Of course what I imagined years ago and what I imagine now are insanely different. Unfortunately 2 years have passed and they\u2019re still not released. Sad but back then I was hyped because we managed to release a beta that year and we were still a team. So much has changed in this time. The main highlight of this is that I learned coding, something I was always afraid. Let me get this straight, I\u2019m a programmer and I was afraid of BFME coding, YES! Those who know me it\u2019s because of my art and that\u2019s what I wanted to do in BFME. But times changed and so did I, to see my work on the screen I had to do this and I did. I also started investing time in other interesting projects on many fields but this evil mod with its lore will always have a place in my heart and draw me back, maybe even after I \u201cfinished\u201d it. \nSecond, the actual development of the Wood Elves (except some elven units shown at the announcement) started roughly at the start of this year, after I finished my bachelor\u2019s project. I invested a lot of time in designing the elven buildings, the faction mechanics and how to make it special and unique but at the same time grounded in the Lord of the Rings lore and Battle for Middle-Earth style. There are a few ideas that stuck from the start (like the units splitting) but that was the moment when the RC Team developing RC Mod transformed in just me. Snap! So I started coding. It was not a pleasant start but months later (now) I feel very confident in delivering what I set up. The initial design of the faction was not what you will see next release. Why? Because I decided upon a stupid idea, make the best release I ever did and do things I never done! That simply transformed the initial plan to dust and added hundreds of extra hours to the development. Snap2! I\u2019m not even going to apologize cause it\u2019s taking so much, you should already know this from RC Mod. \nBut I can say the development is doing great and I can\u2019t wait to show you guys the result (probably/hopefully next year if no meteor hits Earth). The future of the mod will be decided more or less on the next release. But MOTY is about surprises, yes? What do you say about an actual Campaign Mission with Battle Under The Trees? Dunno, just saying. \nI promised ages ago that I will present you how the Wood Elven units will work. I think it\u2019s about time. \nThe Mirkwood units are split in 3 main types: Archers, Spearman and Swordsmen. They don\u2019t have elite units, the basic units are the Elite units, ish... The core units are a battalion for each type, so you have the Archer battalions, the Wardens and the Warriors. Each battalion can be recruited from a weapon-specific building (So you have a building that produces just arches, one for just spearmen, etc.). There are also the mini-hero units and the Lothlorien units but they are obtained in another manner. \nHere is the interesting part, all of your units will spawn as scouts, so with light armor. This means they will have high damage and speed but very low health/armor. In order to make your units more resistant you need to give them upgrades. In this case you have to choose Medium or Heavy armor. Medium will balance the damage, speed and attack of the units while Heavy will bolster the armor of the units at the cost of attack and movement. These are the only upgrades units have since all of the stats are reflected by just 3 states (light, medium, heavy). All these changes are visually suggested. \nMoreover depending on what upgrade units have they may get or lose certain abilities.

Nevertheless, fuel economy will improve thanks to technological advances. There will be a mosaic of other solutions, including hybrids, plug-in hybrids, hydrogen cars and EVs. \nA number of disruptive technologies are already helping make transportation solutions more efficient. In conjunction with Jaguar and Land Rover, Shell has developed a new way to pay for filling up a car while the driver stays behind the wheel. In Rotterdam, they have launched a mobile filling-up service where your car can be filled up while it is parked. Open-end leasing \nAmerican leasing company ARI sent its New Business Development Manager Enrique Montoya to stir up enthusiasm for open-end leasing. \nThe European market is dominated by closed-end leasing, with fixed costs that offer clients simplicity and certainty. Closed-end leasing also does not appear on the balance sheets (although IFRS16 is set to change that) and residual value is no issue for the client. \nOpen-end leasing doesn\u2019t offer these advantages but it can often turn out to be cheaper in the long run. The client only pays an interest rate and a management fee. He is the owner of the car and carries the burden of maintenance, taxes and remarketing. \nAccording to Mr Montoya, traditional European leasing companies book an average of 20 to 25 % ROE, a figure that was disputed by some participants in the audience. Smart cities and smart mobility \nHerv\u00e9 Girardot of Corporate Vehicle Observatory, Arval\u2019s think tank on mobility, stressed the growing importance of smart cities and smart mobility. Air quality is often very bad in European cities, and city councils are starting to take measures to improve it. They are increasingly banning the most polluting vehicles, introducing car-free areas and new infrastructure such as bike share schemes. At the same time, technological innovations are offering new possibilities in terms of autonomous and connected vehicles. \nFleet managers need to take into account these new services and challenges when reviewing their policies. In-car technology can save money and lives \nThe next side presentation was jointly presented by Harman\u2019s St\u00e9phane Lagresle and Maarten Baljet of B\u00e4hr & Fess Forecasts. They went into some details about in-car technology from a user and a cost perspective. \nDriver distraction can be deadly but it is no easy feat to forbid the phone behind the wheel completely. Voice-activated systems, head-up displays and cloud integration can help make traffic safer. This requires high-end navigation systems. \nMr Baljet analysed how safety and financials can be reconciled. His company analysed used-car prices for mid-sized and executive cars. They discovered identical cars commanded prices up to 3 % higher when equipped with high-end navigation systems. \nHe went on to demonstrate how residual values can be optimised by offering market-conform sensibly-equipped business models including high-end navigation systems. Keys as a service \nContinental ended the side presentations. Raj Sundar started by enlightening his audience, most of whom were unaware that a mere 40 % of his company\u2019s sales represent rubber products as his company offers many technological products to a wide range of OEMs. \nHis talk focussed on keys as a service. Continental\u2019s system is compatible with around 60 % of cars on the market today and is future-proof. Their device needs to be kept in the car but requires no installation or wires. A smartphone app connects to the Continental cloud that sends a signal to unlock the car. It is also possible to only give access to the car\u2019s boot, opening the door to delivery services.

Updated: 10:21 | | | \nIrish taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he is willing to consider changes to the post-Brexit border deal which was vetoed by the Northern Ireland's DUP on Monday. \nUK Prime Minister Theresa May has come under increasing pressure from several directions after an apparent agreement earlier this week on the thorny issue of Northern Ireland's border was rebuffed by the DUP over the proposed \"regulatory alignment\" with the south, but Varadkar has hinted the Irish government may allow minor changes to force the deal through. \nVaradkar told reporters however that any changes must not alter the core of the document which was drafted on Monday, which aligned NI with its southern neighbours for market and customs purposes in order to avoid a hard border. \nHe said that he would consider a new proposition from the Conservatives, who are scrambling to craft a paper which pleases both Ireland and governmental partners the DUP. \n\u201cI expressed my willingness to consider that because I want to move things forward as well,\u201d Varadkar said late on Wednesday. \u201cI expressed my willingness to consider that because I want to move things forward as well\" Leo Varadkar \nThe DUP, who are propping up May's Conservative party with a 'confidence and supply' agreement , are adamant that any agreement which provides differing status for NI in comparison to the rest of the UK is unacceptable, threatening to withdraw its support for May and her government if such a deal is pressed through. \nMay has spoken with DUP leader Arlene Foster in attempt to break the impasse but reports suggest no movement has been made, as the EU deadline for \u2018sufficient progress\u2019 in negotiations nears. \nSterling has moved to the tune of the discussions this week after a significant rise on Monday being scuppered by the breakdown, as the currency now trades 1.3% lower than its high at the beginning of the week. \nInvestors remain unconvinced that May can salvage a respectable deal for the UK and maintain her authority in government, according to FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed. \nSayed said: \u201cDespite some optimism that Prime Minister Theresa May will succeed in striking a deal withDUP on the Northern Ireland border, investors still don\u2019t seem convinced.

.\nAccording to the Scottish Sun, Rangers are hopeful of announcing the permanent appointment of Derek McInnes later today , but the current Aberdeen boss would be wise to take a leaf or two out of Graeme Murty, following the 43-year-old's successful spell as interim coach.\nAfter all, Murty has done a great job since taking the reins following the dismissal of Pedro Caixinha, and some of his decisions simply cannot be ignored if McInnes wants the best for Rangers.\nHere take a look at three key decisions ahead of his likely appointment:\nGive McCrorie more chances in midfield\nRoss McCrorie may have burst onto the scene as a centre-back but more recently he has proved his worth as a holding midfielder, and it is there where he can do his best work for Rangers for years to come.\nThe 19-year-old is a sensational talent and McInnes needs to use him effectively, ensuring Murty's parting gift as manager is to show his successor what McCrorie can do further forward.\nUtilise Windass effectively\nJosh Windass has been outstanding in the last few games and McInnes needs to follow Murty's lead and play him in his best position.\nWit complete faith from the boss, the 23-year-old can become one of Rangers modern-day greats and the youth coach has plenty to do with that.\nEmploy the same tactics regarding Holt\nAnother player who has been resurgent under Murty, McInnes needs to speak to Rangers' youth coach to see how he got the best out of the midfielder.\nIf he can do the same, the Gers will be far better off as they bid to close the gap on league leaders Celtic sooner rather than later.\nShow Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

If you want to eat at Michelin star restaurants, that's your prerogative. If you fancy binging on McDonald's or your local takeaway, that's grand also. \nWhat does grate a lot of foodies is the overly pretentious, snobby and elitist attitude to dining, which is why we love the fact that Oobah Butler, 26, made a website for The Shed in Dulwich, and managed to get it ranked as the top restaurant in London on TripAdvisor. \nHow did he do this? Well, the journalist chronicled his entire venture on Vice and he was clever enough to market his 'restaurant' as an exclusive appointment-only eatery. \nThe website proudly boasts that it's: \"An appointment-only restaurant located in South London, The Shed has been operating privately for years. In 2017, it decided to open its doors. As of November that year, it was TripAdvisor\u2019s top-rated restaurant in London.\u201d \nAfter doing so, he and his mates submitted more than 80 five-star fake reviews to TripAdvisor. \nAs for the food on the menu, he said the entire menu was based on his 'mood' while enlisting the help of a photographer to take photos of the restaurant\u2019s 'food.' In reality, these photos were close-ups shots of dishes that were made from shaving foam and bleach. \nDespite the fact that The Shed in Dulwich has never had a single customer, Mr. Butler received hundreds of calls and emails from people that were looking for a reservation. \nIn fact, a food critic for The Guardian even stated that: \u201cAt last: a restaurant that recognises food is all about mood. Of all the shed-based eating experiences out there this one sounds like the best. Or at least second best. (I have my own shed, hence). Personally, I\u2019m eager to try \u2018contemplation\u2019. Advertisement \nWhy did Mr. Butler undertake this experiment? In his own words: \"So there we go: I invited people into a hastily-assembled collection of chairs outside my shed, and they left thinking it really could be the best restaurant in London, just on the basis of a TripAdvisor rating. You could look at this cynically\u2014argue that the odor of the internet is so strong nowadays that people can no longer use their senses properly. But I like to be positive. If I can transform my garden into London\u2019s best restaurant, literally anything is possible.\" \nBravo.

The increasing prevalence of chronic ailments and a rising geriatric population are the key factors boosting the market. The growth witnessed by this market is mainly driven by the role played by hypodermic needles in research activities. These needles also reduce the chances of contamination of fluid used during the injection of a sterile substrate. \nHypodermic needles are hollow and are attached to hypodermic syringes to extract and inject fluids from the body. These needles have a long cylindrical shape with a puncturing point at the tip that pierces the patient\u2019s skin. These needles can be reusable as well as disposable. Reusable needles are mainly used by diabetes patients to administer their insulin shots. However, it is very important to sterilize the reusable needles before using them in order to avoid infections of any kind. The rising prevalence of diabetes has therefore emerged as a crucial factor fuelling demand from the global hypodermic needles market. Report Overview and TOC @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/hypodermic-needles-market.html \nThe report provides a holistic overview of the global hypodermic needles market. It studies the various growth drivers and restraints influencing the market.

The market has been segmented on the basis of various parameters for the purpose of the study. The report includes an overview of the present market dynamics, prevailing trends, historical development, and future outlook of the market across major regional segments. \nGlobal Hypodermic Needles Market: Drivers, Restraints, and Market Segmentation \nGovernments around the world have been implementing various regulations aimed at curtailing the incidence of needle-stick injuries. These legislations mandate the safe usage of needles to avert the risk of infections. The implementation of such stringent regulations has been crucial in stimulating demand from the global hypodermic needles market. The growth exhibited by the market is also supported by the introduction of the latest technologies in hypodermic needle-based delivery of drugs. Request for Broucher @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=12695 \nOn the flip side, the risk of infections associated with administering drugs using hypodermic needles, the increasing incidence of needle-stick injuries, and the presence of alternatives may restrain the growth of the global hypodermic needles market. Nevertheless, the market is expected to gain from the launch of novel products and the growing trend of public\u2013private partnerships between manufacturing companies and government organizations. \nBy type, the global hypodermic needles market can be segmented into safety needles and nonsafety needles. In terms of application, the market can be classified into diagnostic centers, hospitals, and home health care. Regionally, the global hypodermic needles market can be classified into North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and Rest of the World. \nGlobal Hypodermic Needles Market: Regional Outlook \nRegionally, North America dominates the global hypodermic needles market. The increasing geriatric population in the region and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases have been fuelling demand for hypodermic needles in North America. The regional hypodermic needle market is also gaining from the implementation of favorable regulations by governments. Apart from this and driven by increasing demand from India, China, and Japan, Asia Pacific is expected to exhibit attractive opportunities for the market. \nFor Specific and Customized Requirements @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=CR&rep_id=12695 \nSome of the leading companies operating in the market are Terumo Corp., Albert David Ltd., Dickinson and Company, Becton, and Connecticut Hypodermics Inc.

Truth be told, Season 4 has been so good that the absence of Alfie Solomons hasn't been that noticeable and that's saying a lot. \nGiven the fact that Tom Hardy is one of the best actors on the planet, the star of Dunkirk and Bronson has the ability to elevate any scene that he's in and as Peaky Blinders fans will know, he has had some cracking moments in the show. \nThe very first scene when he meets Tommy was brilliantly played by Hardy and Cillian Murphy as both men tried to figure each other out and outmaneuver the other. How about the moment when Alfie torments Arthur, or the scene when he stands face-to-face with the Russians and refuses to back down? \nHardy's character is unpredictable, aggressive, intelligent and playfully scheming - it's clear why he's a fan favourite in Steven Knight's excellent gangster drama. \nAs soon as he arrived in Birmingham, Mr. Solomons was like a tornado of insults, one-liners, and hilarious remarks.

Each Premier League side can be considered a contender for the Champions League this season. Liverpool won 7-0 twice in the group stages, City beat Napoli away, Spurs beat Real Madrid at home and Chelsea recorded an impressive victory away to Atletico Madrid, while United made light work of their group. \nRoy Keane reckons at least one of the English teams have a chance of success in the competition this season, but doesn't see Liverpool mounting a challenge. \nFollowing Liverpool's 7-0 victory over Spartak Moscow at Anfield on Wednesday night, Keane did his best to dampen any excitement around the team. Jurgen Klopp's side served up a feast of brilliant attacking play. Philippe Coutinho scored a hat-trick, Sadio Mane got two and Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah scored a goal each. However, Keane was reluctant to offer any praise, because they have \"beaten nobody yet.\" \n\"They're certainly in great form at the moment, they are scoring for fun and it was a comfortable night for them,\" the former United captain said on ITV's highlights of the Champions League. \n\"Their attacking players enjoyed it, but the big tests are yet to come for Liverpool. Clearly they've beaten these so called lesser teams, but they've beaten nobody yet. It's lovely to watch, but they wouldn't get that time and space against a decent team, it's as simple as that. Give quality players time on the ball like that, and they are going to punish you. The reality is if they are playing a top team in Europe, they won't get the time and space, they won't get those opportunities. If you know this game, then you understand they have so much bigger and tougher tests coming up.\" \nYou can watch Keane speak about Liverpool here.
