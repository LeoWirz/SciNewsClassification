There is more upside to come \u2013 especially if a transition deal were to be signed, sealed and delivered in Q1 2018,\u201d Viraj Patel at ING said.\n\u201cWe sniff an opportunity right now for a positive sterling re-rating were we to see further Brexit progress.\u201d\nCurrency speculators flipped to a net long sterling position for the first time in four weeks in the week to 28 November, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.\nHowever, investors remain hesitant about chasing the rallying pound higher even as the British government said it was close to an agreement with the European Union on how to move Brexit talks onto trade next year.

As a result, MAVENCLAD(R) is now approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses and to delay the progression of physical disability. Following completion of 2 courses of treatment, no further treatment is required in years 3 and 4. The changes bring the Product Information[1] in line with the latest clinical trial evidence supporting MAVENCLAD(R). MAVENCLAD(R) is the first and only oral short-course treatment to provide efficacy across key measures of disease activity in patients with RRMS, including disability progression, annualized relapse rate and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity. (Logo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/472778/Merck_Logo.jpg ) \"Multiple sclerosis is a debilitating disease where new treatments are needed,\" said Professor Bill Carroll, Clinical Professor of Neurology at the University of Western Australia and the Perron Institute, and a consultant neurologist at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital as well as President-elect of the World Federation of Neurology. \"Mavenclad will be a welcomed treatment option for patients with the relapsing-remitting form of MS. As an oral therapy taken in two short courses over a 2-year period, Mavenclad will be convenient for all eligible patients in Australia, including those who may not live close to their treating healthcare professional.\" \"We are pleased the Therapeutic Goods Administration has updated the Product Information for Mavenclad in Australia to reflect additional clinical data,\" said Simon Sturge, Chief Operating Officer at the biopharma business of Merck. \"Our next step is to work closely with the Australian government to bring this treatment advance to patients as quickly as possible.\" MAVENCLAD(R) has been subject to a comprehensive clinical development program in multiple sclerosis (MS), that includes more than 10,000 patient years of data with over 2,700 patients included in the clinical trial programs,[2] and up to 10 years of observation in some patients. MAVENCLAD(R) is a selective immune reconstitution therapy[3],[4] which simplifies treatment administration, by giving patients just 2 short annual courses of tablets with a maximum of 20 days of treatment over 2 years providing a lasting treatment benefit of at least 4 years. MAVENCLAD(R) works by selectively targeting B & T lymphocytes followed by a distinct pattern of lymphocyte reconstitution, without continuous suppression of the immune system.[5] This registration update for MAVENCLAD(R) in Australia follows the recent approval of MAVENCLAD(R) in Europe and in Canada. MS affects more than 23,000 Australians with most people diagnosed between the ages of 20-40.[6] Merck plans additional filings for regulatory approval in other countries, including the United States.

In August 2017, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for cladribine tablets for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in the 28 countries of the European Union (EU) in addition to Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. MAVENCLAD(R) is currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for the treatment for any use in the United States. The clinical development program for MAVENCLAD(R) includes: - The CLARITY (Cladribine Tablets Treating MS Orally) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MAVENCLAD(R) as a monotherapy in patients with RRMS. - The CLARITY extension study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study following on from the CLARITY study, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MAVENCLAD(R) over an extended administration for four years. - The ORACLE MS (Oral Cladribine in Early MS) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MAVENCLAD(R) as a monotherapy in patients at risk of developing MS (patients who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS). - The ONWARD (Oral Cladribine Added ON To Interferon beta-1a in Patients With Active Relapsing Disease) study: a Phase II placebo-controlled study designed primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding MAVENCLAD(R)treatment to patients with relapsing forms of MS, who have experienced breakthrough disease while on established interferon-beta therapy. - PREMIERE (Prospective Observational Long-term Safety Registry of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Have Participated in Cladribine Clinical Studies) study: interim long-term follow-up data from the prospective registry, PREMIERE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MAVENCLAD(R) The clinical development program of Cladribine in MS comprises more than 10,000 patient years of data with over 2,700 patients included in the clinical trial program, and more than 10 years of observation in some patients. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

The 950 is a lighter-weight coil, but you're correct that the rod-mount being closer to the back edge throws it off a little. Also, users should be sure not to extend the rods and position a search coil way out in front as that will definitely cause a nose-heavy balance, and also contribute to less effective sweep and coil presentation. A proper coil position should be about 12\" to 18\" ahead of the toe for best comfort and coil presentation.\nI know some folks have a tendency to extend the rods and get the coil way out there, thinking it will let them cover more ground, but in the long run it doesn't. An extended coil causes nose-heavy fatigue. Also, some do that to try and make a longer side-to-side sweep and that alone can be tiring, but it also encourages an operator to sweep faster to try and cover the area. The faster sweep can be tiring, plus when the arm is moving faster most of the time the feet do also, and that has a person moving too fast to efficiently overlap their sewers for most efficient coverage. That's one reason why I have always stressed using \"a slow and methodical sweep\" for peak efficiency, even with the 3-filter and 4-filter type circuitry models.\nI'm sure you know that, but some readers here are likely newcomers and haven't learned to keep the rod at a shorter length and be more in control of the search coil to maintain a consistent coil height, parallel sweep, and overlap adequately so as not to miss good targets. We know there are still a lot out there, but they are often masked by associated trash and a slow and methodical sweep will increase out success afield.\nThe Detech 7\" DD has a center-mount position for the rod, and the wonderful 6\u00bd Inch Concentric coil is also designed with a very nice rod-mount position. The center-axis of the search coil is right at the front edge of the lower rod/rod-mount. The 6\u00bd Inch Con. is just a bit lighter weight than the Detect offering. Either of these will improve the balance and 'feel' of your MX-7, and my 7\" DD and 950 Concentric are on lower rods and ready-to-go ... if I want and need them ... but the 6\u00bd\" Concentric is just about as ideal as can be for the bulk of my hunting with this very good model so it stays mounted full-time.\nGet either of these smaller coils and I think you'll like the 'feel' better. Get the 6\u00bd Inch Concentric when it's available and I believe you'll also want to settle in with that coil on the MX-7.\nMonte", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "589892f8e1dc95f196cbd66309ad852e27ee8207", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyB5EOYRQpB6st1_59Ma0Ti12974A42X2y7nWCUTWYq86Iv0RPrkzjuGA2niM9ooD4mmm8UfI0k0.7Neb2vfGjh_PtxThSSaMJvJAQtJo.Xl9QVAlIBDMmHcg6t_lRhV8p2VZL5quFCXMG69BHr5k_V2hUA_JQCoyI-", "site_full": "forums.vrzone.com", "site": "vrzone.com", "site_section": "http://forums.vr-zone.com/external.php?type=RSS2", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "VRForums | Singapore Technology Lifestyle Forums", "title": "Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek to expand to Philippines in 2018", "title_full": "Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek to expand to Philippines in 2018", "published": "2017-12-07T09:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "589892f8e1dc95f196cbd66309ad852e27ee8207", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyB5EOYRQpB6st1_59Ma0Ti12974A42X2y7nWCUTWYq86Iv0RPrkzjuGA2niM9ooD4mmm8UfI0k0.7Neb2vfGjh_PtxThSSaMJvJAQtJo.Xl9QVAlIBDMmHcg6t_lRhV8p2VZL5quFCXMG69BHr5k_V2hUA_JQCoyI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "VRNews", "published": "2017-12-07T09:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek to expand to Philippines in 2018", "text": "474,811 Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek to expand to Philippines in 2018   SINGAPORE: Indonesia motorbike-hailing startup Go-Jek plans to set up operations in the Philippines in early 2018, with other Southeast Asian countries to follow later that year, the company's chief technology officer said on Thursday (Dec 7).Go-Jek, backed by private equity firms KKR & Co LP and ...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:49.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0d5c362eb99911eb6bd4d4525ad4d32866da6622", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfi1zLNc4H7An4JTADWFtdALTpKpqTp92yBpJtwolhEZ.jTD09yZqhCLYjBNz554ljiUXdxawyZA73fJA6Iv7cBm_EFXMjcHw-", "site_full": "swva.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://swva.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist southwest VA | for sale search", "title": "Good Gas Mileage - 2009 Honda Rebel 250 $3750", "title_full": "Good Gas Mileage - 2009 Honda Rebel 250 $3750", "published": "2017-12-07T08:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0d5c362eb99911eb6bd4d4525ad4d32866da6622", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfi1zLNc4H7An4JTADWFtdALTpKpqTp92yBpJtwolhEZ.jTD09yZqhCLYjBNz554ljiUXdxawyZA73fJA6Iv7cBm_EFXMjcHw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T08:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Good Gas Mileage - 2009 Honda Rebel 250 $3750", "text": "favorite this post Good Gas Mileage - 2009 Honda Rebel 250 - $3750   2007 Kawasaki transmission: automatic   On the market is a '09 Honda Rebel 250, coated with the captivating red color.

Closed sales of single family homes showed an increase and the price per square foot increased. Closed sales of condos, villas and townhouses decreased while the price per square foot also decreased over the prior month. Interesting to note - condos sold for .99% of their asking price in Delray Beach FL in November. \n\nYou can still get good deal on homes in Delray Beach, but having a good real estate agent who understands the market is a must . Don\u2019t wait on the sidelines for too long. Many of our listings are selling within a few days of hitting the market. \n\nAs you can see from the graph below, listings are not selling exactly for asking price. Some are now selling for less, yet with low inventory, the market remains tough. To make sure you don't overpay for your home, you'll want to have an agent that does a thorough market analysis of the Delray Beach home on which you are making an offer. \n\nIf you are interested in how much current inventory is on the market in Delray Beach , you can find that information by clicking on the link. \n\nLow inventory suggests that homes are not sitting on the market for very long , That is the market we are in at this time. Low inventory in Delray Beach has offers coming in on homes similar to what we saw back in 2007. I wouldn't expect home prices to run up quite as fast as they did back then, as banks have gotten a lot stricter on lending guidelines and are no longer giving a loan to anyone with a pulse. But low inventory is one indicator that prices should continue to rise. \n\nDelray Beach FL Real Estate Report Summary \n\nIn November 2017, the average list price for single family homes in Delray Beach FL was $ 753,579.

But I didn\u2019t rush to open it, because, well, I\u2019ve got a mixer already that I\u2019ve had for ages and love, and on the box it looks all complicated and new-fangled, not homely and quirky like mine. Not wanting to seem ungrateful, though, and because everyone kept complaining that there was a huge box on the kitchen floor, I opened it up and popped it onto the kitchen counter. Well. Cue choirs of angels singing and all that jazz, because this thing is beautiful . Seriously, I sent a pic to Mr E and he replied \u2018erm, wow. It really goes in our kitchen\u2019. To give it a thorough test, though, and make sure it has brains as well as beauty, I attempted some Christmas crumble muffins with my sleek and shiny new baby. Here\u2019s how I got on: \nFirst impressions \nYes, my first impressions were that it\u2019s a bit, well, industrial , but that actually turns out to be a good thing: it\u2019s mega-sturdy, feels really chunky and solid, and everything clicks and clunks into place in a reassuring manner. Comparison being the thief of joy, and all that, I hate to pit one against the other, but the bowl is really wide and fits in really easily (no guessing which way you have to turn to get it out and accidentally tightening it more), there\u2019s a lovely head shield, which is virtually invisible but protects the mechanism from getting full of cake mixture and flour, it\u2019s really to use, there\u2019s a pulse setting, and you can start it off really gently which is perfect for not losing yourself in a cloud of icing sugar when you first start mixing. \nThe two covers you can see in the top picture (also very chunky and solid) hide places where you can attach something like 20 different attachments to do stuff like grating, grinding, dicing, juicing, slicing, processing and blending and it\u2019s got a very powerful 1200w engine under the bonnet too. \nOn to the muffins, then: \nChristmas crumble muffins", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brea", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kenwood", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:50.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8bacca3c11e50074977278f221a730b210b55002", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XYMElmOfZIpg.zB_zq.VobPY4NyKuZfYufSQRcTZBnckj6CssdIi1tuRtX8S7azU-", "site_full": "www.facepunch.com", "site": "facepunch.com", "site_section": "http://www.facepunch.com/forumdisplay.php?f=51", "site_categories": ["entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Sponsored Spambots", "title": "A free Figment demo is now available on Steam", "title_full": "A free Figment demo is now available on Steam", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.021, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 25788, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8bacca3c11e50074977278f221a730b210b55002", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XYMElmOfZIpg.zB_zq.VobPY4NyKuZfYufSQRcTZBnckj6CssdIi1tuRtX8S7azU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PCGamer", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "A free Figment demo is now available on Steam", "text": "http://www.pcgamer.com/a-free-figment-demo-is-now-available-on-steam", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.pcgamer.com/a-free-figment-demo-is-now-available-on-steam"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:50.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06488251a22ca8a22cc02a3b1a13f9c302559d2d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvCRFwKyxnNgHvhJsU6YkN8jngCINHm3YCgF0BQMmANhJmwSxn6xhdDCGTWdXGloi7_d4XEKVzSiHyp50UcHgDTh.MY9A3Lc3G.4cK9DOCMPjWwrIHfXVuJX0jIlmlkgcew--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.za", "site": "tripadvisor.co.za", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/ShowForum-g187886-i343-Sicily.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Sicily Forum, Travel Discussion for Sicily, Italy - TripAdvisor", "title": "Taxi from Catania Airport - Catania", "title_full": "Taxi from Catania Airport - Catania Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-02-11T13:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10000, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f110c8ed5c039222edc946dde87080dd26964a55", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvCRFwKyxnNgHvhJsU6YkN8jngCINHm3YCgF0BQMmANhJmwSxn6xhdDCGTWdXGloi7_d4XEKVzSiHyp50UcHgDTh.MY9A3Lc3G.4cK9DOCMPjWwrIHfXVuJW_je3bSy_TOZpAjVn7671X", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "Salvo P", "published": "2017-12-07T00:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "There are also a lot of NCC (hire with driver), that provide also this service.

Both photos and paintings of landscapes can hold the attention of a viewer for long stretches. This particular one by John Constable, which hangs in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, seems to promise an idyllic experience. Is it the natural beauty of a landscape that captures our attention? Certainly yes, but it is more than that. It is possible to walk or drive by a beautiful scene without being moved. With this painting and others, it is more than the depiction of nature that attracts us\u2013it is the opportunity to contemplate nature as something outside of us, as something not under our control. \nWhat would we think of this estate if we owned it? The homeowner\u2019s eye is quite different than the spectator\u2019s. Would we see needed repairs on the fence or the bridge? Perhaps the position of one of the trees blocks the view from a window in the mansion, and we would want to cut it down. What else would we find dissatisfying? But when we see the scene in a painting, we are not only spectators instead of owners, but viewing a likeness instead of reality. We are at a double remove from any possibility of altering a painted landscape. As viewers we cannot manipulate or change the painting, only enjoy it. In short, a landscape helps even the most restless activist among us become a contemplative. \nTrying to improve the scenery is not limited to homeowners. In our technical age, there is a pervasive utilitarian outlook that makes it difficult to contemplate nature. In one of his essays, \u201cThe Question concerning Technology,\u201d the German philosopher Martin Heidegger describes this utilitarian outlook. He says that for modern man, a field is more a potential source of energy or minerals than an object of beauty: \u201cThe earth now reveals itself as a coal mining district, the soil as a mineral deposit. The field that the peasant formerly cultivated and set in order appears differently than it did when to set in order still meant to take care of and to maintain.\u201d \nIf Heidegger is right, a landscape painting gives us a different way of seeing reality. The artist shares a way of seeing the natural world as beautiful instead of useful. This is not only an enjoyable experience by itself, but a link to contemplation of the divine. Regarding the beauty of nature without being driven to make use of it provides an opening for bigger questions: Why do I find this scene so beautiful? Where did nature come from? Does all of this depend on a cause that I cannot see? Following the path of these questions leads us to a primordial experience of man as he regards nature. This is the experience that allowed St. Paul confidently to say that since the beginning of the world, God\u2019s \u201cinvisible attributes of eternal power and divinity have been able to be understood and perceived in what he has made\u201d (Rom 1:20). \nWe should not expect that every time we see a landscape painting, we will start thinking of God. But, they do provide the possibility of doing so. In the process, we can learn to regard the whole world around us in a different way. We can try to see with an appreciative eye instead of a utilitarian one. This perspective is one that can be educated and developed, and it is an important part of a Christian outlook on the world. If nature cannot remind us of God, then we live a poor life indeed. \nWhen life seems worn down and all too familiar, try looking at a landscape.

Such a district would provide, among other things, a compact and convenient venue for music, entertainment, and food. \nSome city officials are even considering multiple, or rotating, \u201centertainment districts.\u201d With this option, so-called overlay zoning would enable the city to use different downtown locations, depending on the activity or event. \nMost of the seven Palestine City Council members have expressed support for a downtown entertainment district of some kind. \nThe next step, City Manager Michael Hornes said, is to get recommendations from downtown business owners on how to create and develop the district. \u201cWe have ideas, but we need information from stakeholders,\u201d he said. \nHornes supports the idea of a downtown entertainment district, noting that such districts have thrived in other cities. \u201cWe want it to work for everyone,\u201d he said. \nMayor Steve Presley favors an overlay district, with comparable and enabling zoning for all downtown. Such a plan would allow the city to select different locations for different events. \n\u201cAn overlay would help ease some of the red tape,\u201d Hornes said. \u201cWe want to make sure it is a positive impact. It\u2019s in the infancy stages of talking about it.\u201d \nPalestine Police Chief Andy Harvey, formerly of the Dallas Police Department, proposed an entertainment district in Palestine, shortly after taking office on Aug. 28. \n\u201cI think it would be good for our city, as long as we have a security plan in place,\u201d he said. \u201cThe city and stakeholders of the (entertainment) district have to come up with something that is reasonable and safe.\u201d \nHarvey said such a district would benefit the city, but he also said it could create potential problems, including the effects alcohol.

Just recently, Perez just signed a six-month exclusive contact with the new talent agency of Jonas Gaffud called Empire.\n\nTalents of the agency include Miss Universe 2015 Pia Wurtzbach, Daniel Matsunaga, Manhunt Philippines 2017 Daniel Azurin, Miss Philippines USA 2017 Nicole Guerrero,Mister Southeast Asia International 2016 Andrea Biondo, Josh Barfuss and Eduardo Castillo. But the former Mister International admitted that there were times when he would weigh in the benefits of being a policeman and appearing in television shows.\n\n\"Ang plano is hubugin muna ako sa workshop at alam naman ni Jonas na pulis ako. Siguro kung para sa akin talaga yung showbiz, para sa akin. Nag-aantay na lang ako ng go-signal ni God;\n\n\"Minsan nahihirapan din ako pagdating na sa mga schedule ko. Mahirap talaga. Hindi naman siguro maganda 'yung hindi na ako nakikita ng mga tao na-nagta trabaho sa PNP (kahit nandun pa ako),\" he said. Now detailed with the Aviation Security Group of the PNP, Perez also said that he would always be grateful to the Philippine National Police and the Mister International organizations.\n\n\"Nung naging Mister International ako, naging ambassador na ako ng PNP. May invitation din ako sa mga events sa school sa Tondo. Pero alam ng PNP na may mga guesting din ako,\" he said. Given the chance, Perez said that he would like to play a superhero in a teleserye or in the movies.\n\nPerez said that he will celebrate his 9th year as a police officer on December 15.\n\n\"Eligible naman ako for promotion pero plano ko talaga mag board exams kaso busy lang kasi. Gusto ko rin mag school dahil gusto ko rin maging opisyal,\"\n\n\"But you cannot have it all. Kaya pinagdarasal ko kay Lord na gabayan ako at kung saan talaga ako; \"Minsan pag may mga offers na dumarating, iniisip ko para sa showbiz ako. Pero dumarating naman yung mga moment na sa PNP pa rin ako dahil ang dami kong bata na napapasaya at nai-inspire ko sila na mag-pulis. Kaya binibigyan ko sila ng advice,\" Perez said.\n\nAt 32, Perez also said he is thinking of settling down in the near future.\n\n\"Darating tayo dyan. Ipon lang talaga muna. Gusto kong magkaroon ng sariling bahay at bumili ng sasakyan,\" he said. - ROBERT REQUINTINA ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":
