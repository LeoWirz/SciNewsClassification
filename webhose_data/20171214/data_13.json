It\u2019s a time of sparse crowds, crisp air, great views, deep snow, and forests of giants. Head out in the morning on your snowshoes and watch for the tracks of snowy denizens of the forest, or take a heart-pounding skate-ski up a road until the valley vista presents itself. \nOr, ski into a wonderland of some of the grandest trees on earth. It\u2019s a whole different world in the winter. If you\u2019re a fan of muscle-powered winter recreation, one of the best Yosemite activities in the winter is a ski or snowshoe trip into the Tuolumne Grove of Sequoias in the Crane Flat area in the northern part of the park. To access the Tuolumne Grove and its giant trees, park near the Crane Flat Campground. There\u2019s a gate to the north and the trail follows a forest road. There are no groomed ski trails in the Crane Flat area, however, so you may be breaking trail. \nIt\u2019s only a round-trip of two miles, and it\u2019s a gentle grade down, but a bit of hike back up to the trailhead. Plan your trip well and you\u2019ll have a great experience. Once in the grove, you can hear the whumping sound as snow hits the ground, dropped from branches hundreds of feet up. Watch out for falling snow, and even pinecones the size of bread loaves, so you don\u2019t get clobbered. \nYou\u2019ll more than likely find yourself alone with the giant sequoias, unlike the summer months when throngs of tourists walk about with their heads craned back as they try to see the tops of the trees. The trails in the grove are well marked, and the silence is overwhelming. If there\u2019s a slight breeze, you\u2019ll hear the trees themselves groaning under the weight of the snow and creaking in the wind. \nRemember to be courteous and don\u2019t snowshoe in the ski tracks, and vice versa please. Also, hikers post-holing through the snow add an extra hazard. Take along water and snacks for a picnic under these towering behemoths. Winters can turn the Yosemite Valley into a wonderland attractive to snowshoers, skiers, and hikers/NPS \nThe Sequoia is real, but it\u2019s a primeval reality. At first, no one believed Augustus T. Dowd in 1852 when he described finding such giant timber in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada on one of his hunting trips to supply the miners with meat. Fortunately, in 1864 President Abraham Lincoln signed the Yosemite Grant, setting aside a swath of wilderness like no other. \nAnd, though not the oldest trees in the world, the Sequoiadendron giganteum may still have a lifespan exceeding 3,000 years, and by total volume the giant sequoias are the largest living thing on Earth. With their round, overlapping scaled foliage, distinctive cones, and spongy fire-resistant bark, they are symbols of another era. Look for animal tracks too: you may spot a black-tailed deer, bobcat, and sometimes ravens and eagles swoop through the forest. \nThere\u2019s another grove of these tall trees in the park, the Mariposa Grove down near Wawona. However, restoration work there has closed the grove to the public until spring 2018. \nBut if you\u2019re anxious to see more of these big trees, two other sequoia stands can be found in the area: the Merced Grove and Rockefeller Grove just outside the park\u2019s northwest entrance. Both are accessed from the Merced Grove parking lot west of Crane Flat. \nRockefeller Grove is a little more than 2 miles one-way, and in low snow years you may be walking. Merced Grove is a mile-and-a-half, with the first part level, and the last two-thirds a steep, heart-pounding ascent. Save some energy for the walk back up. \nAnd, then, nothing could be better afterwards than getting back to your cozy cabin, condo, or home, reserved ahead of time from Yosemite\u2019s Scenic Wonders Vacation Rentals . With more than 100 rental properties at Yosemite West, Wawona, and Oakhurst, you\u2019ll be able to find the perfect place for you and your family or joined by a passel of your friends. It\u2019s a great time of year to enjoy the snowy forests.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "augustus t. dowd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yosemite grant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abraham lincoln", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "npt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockefeller grove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yosemite west", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "yosemite national park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wawona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tuolumne grove of sequoias", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yosemite valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mariposa grove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockefeller grove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sierra nevada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merced grove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crane flat campground", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yosemite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tuolumne grove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oakhurst", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:03.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1cd85222ede2a54a6e005a71738debe95de313b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_cNbRVLTtd7mRC8rLrYfKCQUhEgHKJt9Rm3MgGFxCj_Bt5yJ0K15LppbiDlP79SvFIiIuZPSTaJVXzIGMoU4uxSgtSscEiG4pdZNzjy24aVHYTx88ax4ov_nT3W030dwopFymM_9DjI.WcZOj33fxC3YUPBFGWYIit4EF0n3eiT_", "site_full": "forums.anandtech.com", "site": "anandtech.com", "site_section": "https://forums.anandtech.com/forums/politics-and-news.24/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Politics and News - AnandTech Forums", "title": "T-Rump admin proposes allowing employers to distribute employee tips to any and other employees - AnandTech Forums", "title_full": "T-Rump admin proposes allowing employers to distribute employee tips to any and other employees - AnandTech Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T01:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.anandtech.com/data/avatars/m/0/687.jpg?1492826282", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3377, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3abd4cbbdb37175b784b20e21b51c7864b80bb46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_cNbRVLTtd7mRC8rLrYfKCQUhEgHKJt9Rm3MgGFxCj_Bt5yJ0K15LppbiDlP79SvFIiIuZPSTaJVXzIGMoU4uxSgtSscEiG4pdZNzjy24aVHYTx88ax4ov_nT3W030dwopFymM_9DjI.WcZOj33fxC3YUPBFGWYIin0_nQNx8cB9Y_IAOqPofjHC59idPNvFnA--", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "woolfe9998", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "sandorski said: \u2191 This video could go into any number of threads, but given how fresh this bit of Trump Admin BS this is\nClick to expand... Reich is spot on. He's absolutely correct that democrats have failed to fully explain why their way isn't just about being compassionate toward the poor or being more \"fair\" or \"equal,\" it's also a much stronger path for economic growth, job growth, and wage growth. Republicans for some reason have sold themselves to many people as the party of economic growth and jobs. They do this by posing themselves as friends of business, and champions of \"free enterprise.\" These are simplistic associations which are easy for average people to digest. But it's all a con, of course.\nThe real problem is, Reich is correct but it's hard for democrats to explain the superior economic outcome of their policies because it is either too complicated or beyond the attention span of the average voter.

The New M\u00e9xico Environment Department is currently working on a plan for utilizing New M\u00e9xico\u2019s nearly $18 million share of the settlement. New M\u00e9xico has been given a great opportunity to use these funds to address critical health issues in some of our poorest communities.\n\u201cMy daughter developed significant health problems from riding the bus to school. Every time she used the school bus, her health issues worsened and I had to stop letting her ride the bus and find another way to take her to school,\u201d said Jessica Ram\u00edrez, mother and Juntos promotora . \u201cI support the Clean Buses for Healthy Ni\u00f1os campaign because I have another child and although he always wants to go to school field trips on a school bus, I cannot let him because I have already had a very difficult experience with my daughter due to the pollution emitted by those school buses. The worry and the fear that the pollution emitted by the buses could affect my children already has me afraid. I do not want someone else to go through what happened to me.\u201d\nIn New M\u00e9xico, there are approximately 166,000 kids who ride school buses each day, over half of whom are children of color. With so many children exposed to pollution, it\u2019s no coincidence that more than 1 in 11 suffer from asthma.\nOn November 30 th , families, faith leaders, community organizations, and decision-makers rallied in Albuquerque to call on Gov. Mart\u00ednez to allocate Volkswagen settlement funds to transition school buses from diesel to electric to protect our children and communities from diesel pollution. Following the rally, a contingent of families travelled to Santa Fe to deliver nearly 2,000 petitions to the New M\u00e9xico Environment Department and Gov. Mart\u00ednez for the public record.\n\u201cThere is currently no formal public comment process for determining the use of these funds. Gov. Mart\u00ednez and the Environment Department should create a formal, transparent and easy to access public input process to ensure that the voices of those most impacted are fully heard and are part of the decision-making process,\u201d said Victor Nevarez, youth organizing contractor for Juntos: Our Air, Our Water . \u201cThis should include a system and timeline for public comment, materials accessible in multiple languages and an outline of how public comment and input, especially from communities heavily impacted by diesel pollution, will ultimately shape the plan.\u201d\n\u201cAllocating Volkswagen Settlement funds to transition school buses from diesel to electric is a way to protect our children and care for creation,\u201d said Sister Joan Brown, osf, Executive Director, New M\u00e9xico Interfaith Power and Light. \u201cPeople of faith are concerned about children, their health and their future as we face climate change. What a perfect way to address these concerns.\u201d\nMore info: facebook.com/JuntosNM or www.CVNMEF.org.\nFor More New Mexico News: elsemanarionewmexico.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joan brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mart\u00ednez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jessica ram\u00edrez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victor nevarez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susana mart\u00ednez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthy ni\u00f1os", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juntos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "communities rally to help new m\u00e9xico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conservation voters new m\u00e9xico education fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volkswagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. environmental protection agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environment department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new m\u00e9xico environment department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new m\u00e9xico interfaith power", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chispa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "santa fe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albuquerque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new m\u00e9xico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:03.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d601f17cef89b87ce92700c8e0efc7ee07e1045", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVW7ggCoBajNELItA63CT7zcG0MSDdLydMg5b10EWhDy4LCWHETPOIxwu5k218vIuCWVcS4GO.oSCg4ShyCigo8FlqWyrZ8Pjg--", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Onondaga-Lake-Park-Hotell.0-l6185539-0.Reseguide-Filter-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotell Onondaga Lake Park, Syracuse | Expedia.se", "title": "Crowne Plaza Syracuse", "title_full": "Crowne Plaza Syracuse (Syracuse, Amerikas F\u00f6renta Stater) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-08-30T19:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a3612c93d26940d68bc1dec49e1d218fbb29d78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVW7ggCoBajNELItA63CT7zcG0MSDdLydMg5b10EWhDy4LCWHETPOIxwu5k218vIuCWVcS4GO.oSCg4ShyCigo8ZlGhNCzbldXirX6vhOHMUx8UOWI4FC23soJQZhdFjNg--", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-27T23:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "it was really awesome, the place was a lot nicer than what I expected, especially from the rate I paid", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:03.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a5fbb31e4079e2966d11167ce1e293dd163bf729", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSADSAlMpirplUTHea9LSNBQcTCkFWiFDeBjDLdYNzLsvg4exXoRTo77t.lGGTMa.LqDw6sVJ2gMQSCw1_L3s3oED3ZKZ1jm9PXSggTOPtS8A--", "site_full": "patch.com", "site": "patch.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Lobster Caught off Canada with Pepsi Logo 'Tattooed' on Its Claw | Santa Monica, CA Patch", "title_full": "Lobster Caught off Canada with Pepsi Logo 'Tattooed' on Its Claw | Santa Monica, CA Patch", "published": "2017-12-01T14:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.098, "main_image": "https://cdn20.patchcdn.com/users/271628/20171201/124419/styles/T800x600/public/processed_images/pepsi_tattoo-1512107028-9714.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 465, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a5fbb31e4079e2966d11167ce1e293dd163bf729", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSADSAlMpirplUTHea9LSNBQcTCkFWiFDeBjDLdYNzLsvg4exXoRTo77t.lGGTMa.LqDw6sVJ2gMQSCw1_L3s3oED3ZKZ1jm9PXSggTOPtS8A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-01T14:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Lobster Caught off Canada with Pepsi Logo 'Tattooed' on Its Claw | Santa Monica, CA Patch", "text": "Lobster Caught off Canada with Pepsi Logo 'Tattooed' on Its Claw A satirical look at current events!

Of course, some are wondering if this is may be fake news, or if \"it's the real thing.\" No, it can't be \"the real thing\" - because its Pepsi - not Coke!

OK, but geez - can't we go anywhere these days - including the bottom of the ocean floor, without being accosted by product advertising? It's getting to the point where one night we'll be driving home, look up in the sky and discover that Amazon has figured out a way to project its ads all over the moon's surface. \nAnd while I'm obviously no marine behaviorist, this really sounds a lot to me like PepsiCo may have decided to bring back the old \"Pepsi Challenge\" - and this lobster went for it \"hook, line and sinker.\" And sure, I realize that everyone is getting tattoos these days, but come on - lobsters too?

The second batch comprised of 65 adult females, 179 adult males, seven children and six infants.\n\nSpokesperson for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), South West Zone, Ibrahim Farinloye, said the returnees were assisted to Nigeria by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the European Union (EU).\n\nFarinloye also confirmed that four of the returnees had medical cases and were promptly taken by a waiting ambulance for treatment in the hospital.It was gathered that the returnees were received by officials of NEMA, Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) and the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN).\n\nAlso on ground were wife of the President, represented by the Lagos State\u2019s first lady, Bolanle Ambode, Senior Special Adviser to the President on the Diaspora, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, among other officials.\n\nMany illegal immigrants, on their way to greener pastures in Europe, got stranded in Libya and at the mercy of traffickers who sold them to slavery. Inability to pay the huge ransom lands several in private prisons, with more than half paying with their lives.\n\nIn the wake of the global outcry against the inhumanity in Libya, the Federal Government said it has recorded 2,778 Nigerian migrants registered in \u201caccessible\u201d detention camps in Libya and ready for repatriation. But much more are in private prisons in the nooks and crannies of Libya, some returnees confirmed.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement signed by the spokesperson, Tiwatope Elias-Fatile, said the country\u2019s embassy in Libya had been visiting detention camps to identify Nigerians for registration.\n\nThe ministry stated that those registered were issued Emergency Travel Certificates. The ministry also explained that the embassy, in collaboration with the IOM, repatriates 250 migrants weekly and had returned 3,000 of them so far.\n\n\u201cThe repatriation is a continuous exercise and the Embassy routinely issues the requisite travel documents to the migrants. The Embassy will continue to engage the legitimate government in Libya and other stakeholders in addressing the plight of Nigerian migrants in that country.\u201d\n\nThe ministry further said the Foreign Affairs Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama, had invited the Nigerian Embassy\u2019s Head of Mission, Iliya Fachano, to Abuja for consultations.\u201cHe is in Abuja already and during the period of the consultations, arrangements have been made for him to address press conferences on the issue.\u2019\u2019 \nsource: guardian.ng ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "iliya fachano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibrahim farinloye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farinloye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geoffrey onyeama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abike dabiri-erewa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tiwatope elias-fatile", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal ministry of foreign affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "immigration service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emergency travel certificates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diaspora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foreign affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international organisation for migration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal airports authority of nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national emergency management agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south west zone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murtala muhammed international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abuja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:03.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d601f17cef89b87ce92700c8e0efc7ee07e1045", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVW7ggCoBajNELItA63CT7zcG0MSDdLydMg5b10EWhDy4LCWHETPOIxwu5k218vIuCWVcS4GO.oSCg4ShyCigo8FlqWyrZ8Pjg--", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Onondaga-Lake-Park-Hotell.0-l6185539-0.Reseguide-Filter-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotell Onondaga Lake Park, Syracuse | Expedia.se", "title": "Crowne Plaza Syracuse", "title_full": "Crowne Plaza Syracuse (Syracuse, Amerikas F\u00f6renta Stater) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-08-30T19:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4aa95e40f00fea3490619a4cc31742bc91b39021", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVW7ggCoBajNELItA63CT7zcG0MSDdLydMg5b10EWhDy4LCWHETPOIxwu5k218vIuCWVcS4GO.oSCg4ShyCigo8ZlGhNCzbldeRcZ617nGaZgSJRYm6rXRAFp2Enht63dA--", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-26T20:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Staff are excellent.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo \nBy Marius Zaharia \nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Tighter monetary policy is coming to Asia next year. Yet it will lag the Federal Reserve's rate hikes as Asian central banks balance an exports-led revival in growth with a slowdown in regional locomotive China. \nThat will mark a shift from a few months ago when most economists expected Asian policy makers to hold their ground or even ease further, but the trade windfall behind a synchronized uptick in global growth is seen lasting longer. \nLast week South Korea took advantage of the trade boom to normalize policy, lifting rates for the first time in more than six years, and analysts expect Malaysia and Philippines - where growth has also benefited from a surge in public investment - to hike in the first quarter. \nWith the benefit of hindsight when the Fed in 2013 signaled it was time to exit ultra-low rates and sparked a taper tantrum, regional central banks should be more confident of looking at the strength of their own economies rather than that of the United States. \n\"The last couple of years has shown us that monetary policy in this region can decouple from the U.S,\" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ. \n\"Obviously they are cognizant of what the Fed does and capital flows ... (but) this is not a case of central banks being forced to act just because the Fed is looking to tighten further.\" \nThat de-coupling has been on show in the past two years as Asia shrugged off four U.S. rate hikes, and some countries even cut rates over that period. \nSouth Korea was the first major Asian economy to lift rates since Indonesia's November 2014 move, which was reversed three months later as markets eventually took the view that a U.S. lift-off won't necessarily derail global growth. \nCHINA FACTOR \nOf course, the Fed cannot be totally ignored as it is expected to hike again next week and two to three more times in 2018. Korea and Malaysia have some of the lowest real interest rates relative to the United States since the global financial crisis and were responsible for most of the net bond market outflows in Asia in October. \nAustralia and New Zealand could hike later next year, China might raise its short-term policy rates, while some analysts expect even India and Indonesia, which have been cutting recently, to reverse their moves. \nChina is emerging as a key driver of Asia's policy track next year, with growth in the world's second-biggest economy set to lose momentum as authorities there extend a year-long crackdown on financial risks. \nThe numbers show Asia is less dependent on American growth than in the past. \nWhile emerging Asia's trade with the United States has gone up by 40 percent since the global financial crisis, its trade with China has risen 120 percent, according to Reuters calculations based on IMF data. Emerging Asia now trades 70 percent more with China than it does with the United States. \nThat means monetary tightening in the region will lag the Fed, as long as any capital outflows driven by the narrower rate differentials do not lead to significantly weaker currencies. Stubbornly low inflation and elevated household debt may also slow rate hikes in some countries. \n\"We have a picture where the average Asian central bank hikes less than the U.S.,\" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics. \n\"We can argue they can do that without putting pressure on their real economy or financial sector because first, in some countries like India or Indonesia rates start from a higher level than in the United States and they have a buffer and secondly, the dollar would not strengthen a lot.\" \nThe good news is that during synchronized global growth the dollar historically tends to be stable or weaker, suggesting that Asian currencies will likely avoid a sharp shakeout. \nKuijs expects the 4-8 percent strengthening in Asian currencies this year to come to a halt in 2018, when some might weaken slightly, but by less than 4 percent. BofA Merrill Lynch sees most currencies flat in 2018. \nFLAT CURVES \nThe other element mitigating the risk of capital outflows is that while short-term bond yields are rising in the U.S. and Asia in anticipation of higher rates, long-term yields have remained stable as markets are yet to be convinced of any global inflationary pressures. \nWhile U.S. two-year yields rose from 1.2 to 1.8 percent this year, 10-year yields dipped 6 basis points to 2.39 percent, still below South Korean yields . \n\"We're pretty comfortable with the monetary policy outlook for Asia,\" said Bryan Collins, portfolio manager, fixed income, at Fidelity International, who sees opportunities in long-dated Asian debt. \n(Reporting by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Shri Navaratnam) More From Business ",
