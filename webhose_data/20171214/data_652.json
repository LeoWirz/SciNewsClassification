He remains in the state legislature despite calls from Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and others that he resign.   \nRep. Wesley Morgan's resolution says Hoover's actions are condemnable and have brought national dishonor and shame to the Kentucky House of Representatives. \nTwo-thirds of the House, or 60 representatives, must approve the resolution for it to pass. \nHoover has denied harassment but said he sent inappropriate but consensual text messages. He said Monday calls for him to resign are premature before all the facts are known. \n___ \n3:45 p.m. \nKentucky's former Republican House speaker says a lawsuit claiming he used money from political donors to pay a sexual harassment settlement is absolutely not true. \nJeff Hoover resigned his leadership position last month after acknowledging he settled a sexual harassment lawsuit with a woman in his office. He denied harassment, but said he sent inappropriate but consensual text messages. \nOn Monday, House GOP Communications Director Daisy Olivo filed a lawsuit saying Hoover had a sexual relationship with the woman and used money from prominent political donors to keep her quiet. \nHoover said later Monday that he has never engaged in sexual contact of any kind with a staff member during his 21 years in the legislature. He said calls for him to resign from the legislature are premature without knowing all of the facts. \n___ \n11:45 a.m. \nThe spokeswoman for Kentucky House Republicans says the former GOP speaker had a sexual relationship with a woman in his office and used money from political donors to help pay her a secret settlement outside of court. \nDaisy Olivo filed a lawsuit Monday saying she was retaliated against for reporting official misconduct. \nFormer Republican House Speaker Jeff Hoover resigned his leadership post last month after acknowledging the settlement. He acknowledged sending inappropriate but consensual text messages, but denied having a sexual relationship with the woman. \nHe didn't immediately return messages for comment Monday. \nOlivo said she reprimanded the woman several times for what she called a consensual but inappropriate relationship.

The phase one of the campus recruitment for 2017-18 is being held between 1 and 10 December. The figures, based on the data of all registered PG students including the course-based and research-based programs, say percentage of students placed has gone up to 49 percent at the end of day four this year from 39 per cent at the same time last year. \"Placement among research scholars has gone up to 44 per cent at the end of day four this year as compared to 25 per cent same time last year. Overall placement figure among all registered student (excluding PPOs) is 52 per cent this year at end of day four compared to 42 per cent at same time last year,\" said a statement here. Overall International offers stand at 22 at end of fourth day this year, compared to 10 for whole of last year, it had added. Commenting on this, Bhaskar Ramamurthi, director, IIT Madras, said, \"Postgraduate placements call for more creative matching of specialised job profiles to the knowledge and skills of candidates. Since IIT-M now has as many and more of PG students as UG students graduating, this significant increase in placement of PG students so early in the season is heartening.\" \"It also demonstrates that companies with high-end engineering and technology positions are thronging to IIT-M to recruit its highly-qualified PG students,\" he further said. Prof Manu Santhanam, advisor, training and placements, IIT Madras, said, \"This increase shows that IIT-M students are being increasingly preferred for research-oriented positions by the industry.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "manu santhanam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "technology-madras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhaskar ramamurthi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "iit madras", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chennai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:03.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "04b259ccf4938f47b2048c5b8a20d104e80f9ebf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoao6Hac_ZkU.n1tntklUXUMkHL39GP8szbLhoW2xE61lrz9q5GOGdl55.SRlE99AWovDzt8bfVyp8lxkWWYhEqYssEMA4zWJZN7qhH5BovXTcoWLwztz91", "site_full": "statusandshayariinhindi.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://statusandshayariinhindi.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Best Quotes and Shayari", "title": "I am not a product of...Stephen Covey...", "title_full": "I am not a product of...Stephen Covey...", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "04b259ccf4938f47b2048c5b8a20d104e80f9ebf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoao6Hac_ZkU.n1tntklUXUMkHL39GP8szbLhoW2xE61lrz9q5GOGdl55.SRlE99AWovDzt8bfVyp8lxkWWYhEqYssEMA4zWJZN7qhH5BovXTcoWLwztz91", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Best quote and shayari (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "I am not a product of...Stephen Covey...", "text": "\nI am not a product of my circumstances.

An owner of Hands On Originals, Blaine Adamson, refused the order, citing his Christian beliefs. \nThe Lexington Human Rights Commission ruled that the company violated the city's fairness ordinance, which outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation. The company appealed to the Fayette Circuit Court, which ruled in its favor. The appeals court affirmed the lower court's decision. Never miss a local story.

Located within the same shoplot but on a different floor, this new eatery serves a good variety of contemporary European offerings. \nThe deco of 2nd Floor is a bit of a quirky combo of bright tropical colors at the outer/al fresco dining space while the inner section is more sedate. A full wall mural featuring colorful flora and fauna greets diners amidst modern mix-and-match furniture. \n\nHelmed by a young kitchen crew, headed by Chef Kelvin Wong, the team is not hesitant to work on dishes served with some creative twists and flair. Take their signature 2NDFLR Salad for example which works its charm from the delicately-charred Romaine leaves which leaves a delicious smoky trail on the tongue. Sprinkled generously with crispy bacon, crunchy croutons and a wobbly poached egg, this deceptively simple salad is a sure winner. 2NDFLR Salad (RM22) \nThe Crab Beignet is another appealing starter. Plump crab cakes encased in crunchy kataifi strands \u2013 what can be more irresistible? Especially when you get to dip them in some tangy citrus chilli jam! Crab Beignet (RM28) \nBeing in the mood to indulge, the Goose Foie Gras certainly sets the pace. Thick cuts of foie, perfectly seared, are a joy to partake, particularly so when eaten with rosti and balsamic caramelised pineapple doused with some pineapple cream! Goose Foie Gras (RM52) \nTheir star dish, something we have been looking forward to is the Grilled Iberico Pork. Perfectly grilled, with the centre still a juicy pink, every bite of the pork was tender and delicious. Don\u2019t be misled by the size of the cut \u2013 it\u2019s really a substantial dish with the caramelised Granny Smith apple, horseradish and potatoes. The gorgeous Iberico! Grilled Iberico Pork (200g) \nSimilarly, the Seared Duck Breast is good, paired with rosti, baby radish and nice lashings of jus spiked with cherry balsamic. Seared Duck Breast (RM36) \nFor a spot of carbo, the Smoked Salmon & Erynggi Pasta (linguine) is more than satisfying. Cooked with white wine and made more delicious with lumpfish caviar and pangrattata, this is one pasta dish I\u2019d return for! Smoked Salmon & Eryngii Pasta (RM32) \nDesserts \u2013 ahhh, so much can be said about the delightful sweets here. My favourite here is the Cherry Jubilee \u2013 a gorgeous ensemble of dark cherries soaked in gin, paired with vanilla ice cream and sprinkled with granola! Yes, I\u2019m a huge fan of liquer-embalmed cherries and these did me in. Cherry Jubilee (RM18) \nThe platter of Chocolate & Coffee comes recommended as well \u2013 a dreamy concoction of almond jaconde, chocolate cremeux and coffee ganache. Chocolate & Coffee (RM22) \nWhat we ate were from the dinner menu. The restaurant also serves brunch and lunch daily from 10.00am till 3.00pm based on a separate menu.

I think about how our world has changed so much, about how we were there when Federer won yet another Grand Slam, or Nadal the French Open; and then my thoughts wander even farther. I think about my childhood. \nWhen I was a wee lad, we had a landline telephone. It had a receiver with a cord attached to it and a dial pad with numbers on it which you had to push in order to make calls. Then they made a mobile phone. It was black and white with a simple UI and nothing very special under the hood. It allowed us to take calls even when we were not inside the house and for me, that was nothing short of  a miracle. We were the last non-wireless generation \nAnother thing we had was a music system with a turntable to play LP's on. We had a varied collection of LPs and we would listen to them frequently. But, the charm of this music system was the cassette player. Sometimes, when rewinding or fast forwarding, the tape would get stuck and we had to stop what we were doing, take out the tape and use a pencil to manually wind it forwards or backwards. My child will never know the relation between pencils and cassette tapes. I doubt if the next generation will know how a cassette tape works. \nWe also didn't have eBooks. We had books. There was no Kindle in our times, unless you count the word kindle.  Smartphones were also a distant futuristic invention. Computers were big, consisting of three parts- a monitor, keyboard and mouse and a CPU. No octa-core processors or 16GB RAM. They were simple machines, capable of what (at the time were) wonderful things. Computers today have become so small you can carry them with you. \nWe had no WhatsApp. Yes you read it right. We didn't have Facebook either, or Snapchat or Instagram. When I was 10 years old, Facebook launched itself. We saw WhatsApp being born and smartphones being made. We also saw the XBOX and PlayStation's 1st generation and saw them rise to XBOX One and Playstation 4. We lived the rise and fall of the compact disk. \nThe world has become very small indeed. I have Facebook friends all over the world and have had video chats with some of them. Just this one fact boggles my mind. The fact that I can talk to someone in Romania or the Philippines without moving from my chair. The coming generation will be born into this small world, with all kinds of technology surrounding them. They won't be able to identify with my childhood, and when they grow as old as me, technology's very face will have changed yet again. \nBut, by making this world so small, I feel it has lost its wonder. We used to go out for walks and admire nature. We used to like going on trips, with our primitive phones, some of which did not even have cameras. We met face to face and talked that way too. We didn't know Pokemon beyond 150. \nNow, we have all this magic. But we are not magicians. We were innocent and now that innocence is lost. \nThe Bilge Master \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "federer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "romania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:04.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6608838a1e1a7ceaabbbeb5c2ab0eb4fe23f4d44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Qv3OiIBsUOuMJqRWhzWFCTtsUVlu99_a5vyvClWsO7ZBBCI7uThrVmV.Xp5LVCBegMmBK2f9pbrtdaimRTPboSMnTaR6_UxsVNjzYMWjkrrw--", "site_full": "adh-games.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://adh-games.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "MY GAMES", "title": "The Simpson\u2122 : Tapped Out v4.30.0 Apk ( Mega MOD ) Android Download", "title_full": "The Simpson\u2122 : Tapped Out v4.30.0 Apk ( Mega MOD ) Android Download", "published": "2017-12-06T10:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6608838a1e1a7ceaabbbeb5c2ab0eb4fe23f4d44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Qv3OiIBsUOuMJqRWhzWFCTtsUVlu99_a5vyvClWsO7ZBBCI7uThrVmV.Xp5LVCBegMmBK2f9pbrtdaimRTPboSMnTaR6_UxsVNjzYMWjkrrw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adh Games (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-06T10:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Simpson\u2122 : Tapped Out v4.30.0 Apk ( Mega MOD ) Android Download", "text": "\nT he Simpson\u2122 : Tapped Out v4.30.0 Hack Apk ( Mega MOD ) Android Free Download \nName : The SImpsons \u2122  : Tapped Out Category : Adventure Version : 4.30.0 Publisher : Electronic Arts Inc.

DMK working president M K Stalin, the leader of opposition in the TN Assembly, said his party would stage 'peaceful protests' in districts where the governor conducts reviews. \"The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam would be forced to resort to agitations if Purohit continues with his review meetings,\" he said. Stalin further said the BJP is using Raj Bhavan for political purposes. \"Governor who promised transparency has failed to understand the legal limits and acts as per the orders of the BJP. If the governor really cares about the state, he should direct chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami to prove his majority in the House,\" he said. MDMK general secretary Vaiko said 'dual governance' is taking place in Tamil Nadu, one by the governor and the other by the chief minister. Stating that this is not good for democracy, he said the governor conducting review meetings was strongly condemnable. After holding meeting for the first time in Coimbatore recently, Purohit has held similar meetings in Tirunelveli and Kankumari on Thursday and Wednesday. Justifying his actions, a Raj Bhavan statement recently said, \"though the governor was sure about the legality and correctness of his action, he sought opinion from a leading legal expert to have a proper examination of his action - from legal as well as Constitutional perspectives.\" \"Equipped with that detailed opinion, Purohit asserts that none of his actions in seeking a meeting with the district officials amounts to any illegality or unconstitutionality,\" the release added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "banwarila", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "raj bhavan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edappadi k palaniswami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banwarilal purohit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stalin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "purohit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munnetra kazhagam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vaiko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m k stalin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mdmk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tn assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "coimbatore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tirunelveli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kanyakumari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tirunelveli chennai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tamil nadu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kankumari", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:04.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e0d075ae69bfa550fa7e6d70a41cef0e770d07a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9KsJqTvyBDhcDJWmOT5SIF2VBgIT0jMosBvDCOjz.nq2_g6tLn4pOeBfb60mWlnklpq0HHf6GITQfk1S.5HOB.s_ri6myoBLraqKM9hu.ghckqCq0wuXTsu7CrdX8iQVZYZfN_kfJ7FqxoPQe7g1kRWcZulm4RLM6OKemnRHBIrw--", "site_full": "www.eenaduindia.com", "site": "eenaduindia.com", "site_section": "http://www.eenaduindia.com/RSS/SectionRssFeed.aspx?Id=184&Main=4&IsState=1", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "EenaduIndia | Tamil Nadu", "title": "Man gets 43-year jail term for raping daughter", "title_full": "Man gets 43-year jail term for raping daughter", "published": "2017-12-07T10:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.en.eenaduindia.com/Article/201712071426494564_Man-gets-43year-jail-term-for-raping-daughter_SECVPF.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15495, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e0d075ae69bfa550fa7e6d70a41cef0e770d07a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9KsJqTvyBDhcDJWmOT5SIF2VBgIT0jMosBvDCOjz.nq2_g6tLn4pOeBfb60mWlnklpq0HHf6GITQfk1S.5HOB.s_ri6myoBLraqKM9hu.ghckqCq0wuXTsu7CrdX8iQVZYZfN_kfJ7FqxoPQe7g1kRWcZulm4RLM6OKemnRHBIrw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "feedback.english@eenadudigital.com (EenaduIndia)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "Man gets 43-year jail term for raping daughter", "text": "Man gets 43-year jail term for raping daughter   14:26 IST   Representational Image Tiruchirappalli: A Mahila Court here convicted and sentenced a 48-year old man to three terms of life imprisonment for raping and impregnating his 14-year daughter in July 2013. Judge Jacintha Martin on Thursday sentenced the accused Kamaraj of Arasankudi village in this district to undergo 43 years of imprisonment including one year of rigorous imprisonment for raping his daughter several times since July 2013 and intimidating his wife. The child born to the girl on March 5, 2015, had died in June the same year. Unable to bear his heinous crime, his wife lodged a complaint in December, 2014. The prosecution registered a case against the man under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, for sexually assaulting a minor girl and committing penetrative sexual assault. Besides, a case was registered under criminal intimidation 506(i). The man was sentenced to three life terms for raping her repeatedly, and one year of rigorous imprisonment for intimidating his wife. He was also slapped a fine of Rs 1,000 under the Posco Act and Rs 500 for on intimidation charge. The judge ordered that the man would undergo 43 years of imprisonment consecutively. The Judge said the court was taking serious note of the crime, and hence had awarded maximum quantum of sentence. The girl has been psychologically affected by the crime, said the prosecution advocate Krishnaveni. According to the prosecution, Kamaraj raped his daughter several times since July 2013, making her pregnant. The girl's mother tried to complain after coming to know that her daughter was pregnant, but Kamaraj intimidated her and she could lodge a complaint only in December 2014 when the girl was seven months pregnant.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kamaraj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krishnaveni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacintha martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mahila court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kamaraj of arasankudi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:05.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da48e6a37dfeff3b8b613eed15968e860486e29b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm1HmME4tqvYEvnYEVdjPRL7", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=rod smith", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "rod%20smith News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Infiniti debuts breakthrough engine technology in new QX50 | Ars Technica", "title_full": "Infiniti debuts breakthrough engine technology in new QX50 | Ars Technica : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-12-04T21:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da48e6a37dfeff3b8b613eed15968e860486e29b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm1HmME4tqvYEvnYEVdjPRL7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ars Technica", "published": "2017-12-04T21:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Infiniti debuts breakthrough engine technology in new QX50 | Ars Technica", "text": "The new Infiniti QX50 might not seem the most natural fodder for these pages, but its engine surely is.

She wants to destroy him. \nGripping psychological drama for fans of Apple Tree Yard, The Good Wife and Notes on a Scandal. \nPart courtroom thriller; part portrait of a marriage; part exploration of how our memories still haunt us, Anatomy of a Scandal is a disarming and provocative psychological drama.\nSophie\u2019s husband, James, is a loving father and a successful public figure. Yet he stands accused of a terrible crime. Sophie is convinced he is innocent and desperate to protect her precious family from the lies that threaten to engulf him. She\u2019s kept his darkest secret ever since they were first lovers, at Oxford. And if she stood by him then, she can do it now.\nKate is the barrister prosecuting his case. She\u2019s certain that James is guilty and determined he should pay. No stranger to suffering herself, she doesn\u2019t flinch from posing the questions few want to hear. About what happens between a man a woman when they\u2019re alone: alone in bed, alone in an embrace, alone in a lift . . .\nIs James the victim of an unfortunate misunderstanding or the perpetrator of something sinister? Who is right: Sophie or Kate? This scandal \u2013 which forces Sophie to appraise her marriage and Kate her demons \u2013 will have far-reaching consequences for them all. \nMy Thoughts: \nAnatomy of a Scandal is a slow-paced and intriguing novel \u2013 the \u2018scandal\u2019 forces both Kate and Sophie to take a closer look at themselves, and the slower pace allows for a detailed exploration of the characters in this novel. In alternating past and present timelines, we see how Kate\u2019s experiences from her past have shaped her into the woman she is today, and it makes her character, in the present day, easily understandable.\nWhile I was more drawn to Kate, I loved that Sophie was forced to take a closer look at her life, the things she was so easily accepting of when, perhaps, she shouldn\u2019t be. I didn\u2019t find her character likeable because I didn\u2019t agree with some of the decisions she made, both in the past and the present day, but she was definitely the one I was most intrigued by \u2013 wanting to see how she would act during in, and in the fall out of, the scandal. However, if I had to pick a favourite character, it would be, Ali, Kate\u2019s best friend \u2013 she was so supportive and loyal, though her role was a minor one, she really showed herself to be a true friend.\nMy favourite parts of this novel took place in the courtroom, I enjoyed seeing Kate in action \u2013 seeing the questions she asked and how she phrased them in her bid to secure a conviction. Also, how alert she was to the reactions from the jury.\nThis novel did have shades of the TV series, like I hoped it would, but it was much less entertaining. Anatomy of a Scandal is a very character-driven novel and I enjoyed seeing how events played out. However, I think the pacing was too slow, and at times this made the plot drag and gave it the overall feeling of being too long. One of the things I like about slower-paced novels is the time it gives you to reflect on what you\u2019re reading, while you\u2019re reading, as things move at a slow pace, you can analyse the events without having to pause reading (I hope that makes sense). However, here there was too much time for reflection, particularly in the last part of the novel, where I contemplated skim reading it. Once you know the outcome of the scandal, all that\u2019s left is to see how the characters act in the aftermath and I felt like this portion was too long. Endings are tricking things because they have the power to impact all that you read before and based on the slow pace of this novel, I felt a smaller word count to show the aftermath would have been more suited.\nOverall, I thought this novel was good and it is worth a read if you are a fan of psychological dramas, but only if you are a patient reader because you really have a slow-pace and a slow turnover of events to contend with here.\nThis book is available to buy from: Amazon UK / Book Depository \nAnatomy of a Scandal publishes January 2018\n*My thanks to Simon and Schuster UK for granting me access to a digital copy of this title via Netgalley* ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sarah vaughan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sophie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerry washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ali", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netgalley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:05.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "709bdcc4aed6f61981251543308aab6bb4dfec18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgy5Fc689.h046sRBv2S9PHOQ59dAOZBVnI0iHV4EQkBI7GKqKKUGzu.7KyiPMf2t_huAedrv52odvF9kLVNf9A4rEQ7MQbB9GqSiOAnUeekaz030XHhfcT7UBSAJttx1LDhgd3Ik1l2F63nIHs8EhaS.q9_1iZQ_2Q76m.ssuViyvxNOvHGozvd", "site_full": "feeds.reuters.com", "site": "reuters.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Colossal distant black hole holds surprises about early universe \u2013 MeasurementMedia Network", "title_full": "Colossal distant black hole holds surprises about early universe \u2013 MeasurementMedia Network", "published": "2017-12-07T01:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.205, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 29, "comments": 0, "shares": 29}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "709bdcc4aed6f61981251543308aab6bb4dfec18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgy5Fc689.h046sRBv2S9PHOQ59dAOZBVnI0iHV4EQkBI7GKqKKUGzu.7KyiPMf2t_huAedrv52odvF9kLVNf9A4rEQ7MQbB9GqSiOAnUeekaz030XHhfcT7UBSAJttx1LDhgd3Ik1l2F63nIHs8EhaS.q9_1iZQ_2Q76m.ssuViyvxNOvHGozvd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T01:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "Colossal distant black hole holds surprises about early universe \u2013 MeasurementMedia Network", "text": "\nEditor \nSemi-retired industrial physicist with more than 40 years of experience in Thermal Infrared Temperature and other measurement technologies, measurement quality assurance, calibration & standards and has been a niche website developer and publisher since 1997.

I\u2019ve been looking forward to this day for weeks, not because it meant mental freedom, but for what is to come. I have been away from this platform for sometime now, unintentionally at first, until I came up with an idea. I have so much going on in my life at the moment and I just wanted things to slow down until I could focus and process these new ideas.\nI haven\u2019t traveled much since the end of Summer, saying goodbye to close friends and family as they moved from the California to Texas after a trip to San Francisco. Not sure when I\u2019d see them again or when I\u2019d be on the road to capture the next bag of photos, I settled into focusing in on my class and maintaining my full time job. With an abundance of overtime, the holidays just a few short months away, a new tattoo in the works, and having picked up a new hobby investing in crypto currency, I found myself yet again, without much \u201cme\u201d time.\nAs open as my schedule seems, I found myself often not focusing on my passions, so I put those to the side until recent. While maintaining an A in my class, I found myself slowly but surely less interested in doing my work, but I got it done. Maybe it\u2019s a mixture of knowing that my heart lies at the end of my finger tips as I write and lack of connection with other students since my course is online, or maybe, it\u2019s that I am truly happy with how my life has gone this year and I would like to capitalize on that feeling.\nEither way, as I sit here now in my office at work, I can\u2019t help but smile and reflect on everything I have experienced and done this year. Aside from my new hobby of investing and planning for my future, I feel as if I\u2019ve fallen in love with an old friend. She knows me well and compliments my writing. She helps me tell the story through images I\u2019d only once thought I\u2019d never have the opportunity to take. Now, here I am, having travelled on a plane four-thousand plus miles from home, completed numerous road trips, and lived out of a backpack and car multiple times. The types of adventures in which I\u2019d been seeking. It goes without saying that my style of travel is maybe a bit less conventional than most peoples. I\u2019m okay with that, because I\u2019m here for the dreamers. The ones like me that may just be thinking that some day they\u2019d love to get out there and do something awesome for themselves, if only they had the money or the means. Im here to show you that it\u2019s possible.\nTravel in it\u2019s simplest form, to me, is one of the greatest things a human being can experience. Doing it on a budget is much like a game. It\u2019s interesting, worrisome, all-involving, and exciting, all at the same time because leaving room for error is just part of the fun. That is why I\u2019m taking the next few months to a year to do just that. I\u2019m going to work on showing others that travel, although comfortable when done with a dollar, may just be more fun on a dime. I also plan to take the time write more and compliment my photos with the stories behind, leading up to, or what took place shortly after.\nI\u2019ve gotten such great feedback from my community of followers and feel inspired and comfortable enough to take a leap into the depths of the internet to show others and myself the content that I am truly capable of making.

Extended hours will be 6 p.m. Sunday to 9:30 a.m. Monday, and 4:30 p.m. Monday through to 9:30 a.m. Friday.\n-CME's BTC will trade on CME Globex and CME ClearPort Sunday to Friday from 6 p.m. - 5 p.m. Eastern time with a one-hour break each day beginning at 5 p.m.\nMARGIN RATE AND CLEARING\n-Cboe's contract will clear through the Options Clearing Corporation and a 30 percent margin rate will apply.\n-CME's contract will clear through CME ClearPort and will have a 35 percent initial margin rate.\nCONTRACT EXPIRATIONS\n-Cboe said it may list up to four weekly contracts, three near-term serial months, and three months on the March quarterly cycle.\n-CME said it will list monthly contracts for the nearest two months in the March quarterly cycle (March, June, Sept., Dec.) plus the nearest two serial months not in the March quarterly cycle.\nPRICE LIMITS AND TRADING HALTS\n-Cboe will halt trading in its contract for 2 minutes if the best bid in the XBT futures contract closest to expiration is 10 percent or more above or below the daily settlement price of that contract on the prior business day.\nOnce trading resumes, if the best bid in the XBT futures contract closest to expiration is 20 percent or more above or below the daily settlement price of that contract on the prior business day, the futures will be halted for 5 minutes.\n-CME will apply price limits, also known as circuit breakers, to its bitcoin futures of 7 percent, 13 percent, and 20 percent to the futures fixing price. Trading will not be allowed outside of the 20 percent price limit.\nSources: Cboe and CME\n(Reporting by John McCrank in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)\n-- \u00a9 Copyright Reuters 2017-12-07", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:08.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6201530c78877230a16926114f997e7497c414b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.XHA16XB.0e_m7xrUCfbcTY.z_ZvxXHEOAPZ.0QofB1sk3W2JuAu5h2pQk6ajVuhGpqmeiyZEElLA--", "site_full": "kamadharmaarta.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://kamadharmaarta.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "kama blog", "title": "Inverno", "title_full": "Inverno", "published": "2017-12-07T11:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IT", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e6201530c78877230a16926114f997e7497c414b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.XHA16XB.0e_m7xrUCfbcTY.z_ZvxXHEOAPZ.0QofB1sk3W2JuAu5h2pQk6ajVuhGpqmeiyZEElLA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "roshelinda (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Inverno", "text": "\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "inverno", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:08.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40fb46ea566f3a48330501d65414226dd5917c9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.bvfYeKNQzY_cuaZNQ4WFRI10i5kVy6HsqCfddGTrK08PQ5GlGnxg2E7NBOBues5stFbQhSkUKcOHciyZzXzI2RbO3C3NcoFE-", "site_full": "www.rugbyleaguehub.com", "site": "rugbyleaguehub.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["business", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Top 10 most clicked stories of 2017 \u2013 rugbyleaguehub.com", "title_full": "Top 10 most clicked stories of 2017 \u2013 rugbyleaguehub.com", "published": "2017-12-07T12:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.286, "main_image": "http://ift.tt/2acpUum", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "40fb46ea566f3a48330501d65414226dd5917c9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.bvfYeKNQzY_cuaZNQ4WFRI10i5kVy6HsqCfddGTrK08PQ5GlGnxg2E7NBOBues5stFbQhSkUKcOHciyZzXzI2RbO3C3NcoFE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "Top 10 most clicked stories of 2017 \u2013 rugbyleaguehub.com", "text": "Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

It added they were not decisions which were taken lightly. \nHowever, it stressed that the remainder had been cancelled by the patients themselves or due to a clinical reason. \nMedical director Dr Cliff Sharp said: \"Coming into hospital for an operation is an anxious time for many people and we know how important it is to patients that you are treated as soon as possible. \n\"During October, 50 out of a total of 464 planned procedures were cancelled, half of which were for 'capacity or non-clinical' reasons. \n\"The other half were cancelled either by the patient themselves - 11 cases - or for a clinical reason by NHS Borders - 14 cases.\" 'Appropriate wards' \nHe said there were a variety of factors behind the \"capacity or non-clinical\" cancellations. \n\"In six cases, due to demand in the BGH, there were no beds available in the appropriate wards to admit patients to, in five cases emergencies had to take priority and in four cases sickness absence was the cause,\" he said. \n\"A further three procedures were deferred in the interest of patient safety, until an intensive care bed was available for the patients who would have required that level of care after their surgery. \n\"We continue to work very hard to drive down cancellation rates, regardless of monthly fluctuation, in order to improve the patient experience in this area.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dr cliff sharp", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nhs borders", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mj richardson nhs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:08.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd8a234ae64a833c1dcf971974d0bb5d585e116f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxcXsalbXA.8ykX.7OL9l9G.LgJgdU5RnWGFrb3ryw86RCC08bC9PX9eeOrIbvluiQLUqTgpo6wmkZF8Nul2dUpAjlTaBoaD9IlpfoGssE36bZnMPLHEKTV", "site_full": "inteldinarchronicles.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://inteldinarchronicles.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Intel", "title": "Update from Oootah Regarding Donations 12-6-17", "title_full": "Update from Oootah Regarding Donations 12-6-17", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd8a234ae64a833c1dcf971974d0bb5d585e116f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxcXsalbXA.8ykX.7OL9l9G.LgJgdU5RnWGFrb3ryw86RCC08bC9PX9eeOrIbvluiQLUqTgpo6wmkZF8Nul2dUpAjlTaBoaD9IlpfoGssE36bZnMPLHEKTV", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Terra Zetzz (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Update from Oootah Regarding Donations 12-6-17", "text": "Oootah would like to thank all of you for your donations.

More shoppers are claiming to start Christmas shopping early to spread the cost \u2013 45% in 2017 \u2013 up from 35% in 2016. \nIndependent retailers should also be aware Christmas is a period when shoppers look to try something different, with over half of shoppers (55%) saying they look out for new and exciting products. \nShopper Insight Manager at IGD, Vanessa Henry, said: \u201cOur research shows us that shoppers are being savvier with their spending to ensure they don\u2019t have to sacrifice on quality, with more shopping around at several stores to seek out the best deal as opposed to buying cheaper products. We\u2019re also seeing shoppers trying to get ahead of the season\u2019s spending by starting their purchases earlier in the year to spread the cost.\u201d \nOnly a third (32%) of shoppers have a set budget to spend on food and groceries this year, suggesting opportunities to drive impulse purchases. Notably, 60% of shoppers say they try to plan their food and grocery shopping at Christmas but always end up buying a number of unplanned products (up from 53% in 2016). \n\u201cRetailers will need to work harder to strengthen their in-store offer to stand out,\u201d says Vanessa. \u201cOur data shows lots of opportunities for this kind of engagement, particularly with shoppers being more likely to impulse purchase and try new products at this time of year.\u201d \nDownload IGD\u2019s free ShopperVista Christmas report here to gain more insight into how shoppers are spending this season. \nIGD\u2019s Christmas infographic is available on ShopperVista .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vanessa henry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanessa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:09.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81c84133cbe0810674454a0661169247e971b154", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnfNl54uXmCrM-", "site_full": "www.blowoutforums.com", "site": "blowoutforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.blowoutforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=44", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Ebay/COMC/Online Selling/Shows/Paypal/Shipping - Blowout Cards Forums", "title": "Black Friday Shipping Delays", "title_full": "Black Friday Shipping Delays - Blowout Cards Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T13:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8c9556390b702c133f19cf39e1e78f0ef08d5079", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnjxGT159SI8R3K6Z8Gqh2NUETwcy5PCUl", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Branesergen", "published": "2017-12-07T10:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "All 3 delivery services are slammed.

Because it is envisaged that the national minimum wage will replace the minimum wages established through sectoral determinations, the relevant chapters of the BCEA that deal with sectoral determinations will be repealed,\u201d Wessels said. \nThe BCEA will continue to regulate basic terms and conditions of employment. However, the Basic Conditions of Employment Amendment Bill (2017) introduces amendments to the BCEA that provide for enforcement measures in the event of non-compliance with the National Minimum Wage Bill. \nBelow are five of the most important aspects of the new laws: The proposed changes to the BCEA make provision for the introduction of a new section dealing with guaranteed minimum hours of work. This section provides that an employee, who works for less than four hours on any day, will be entitled to be paid for four hours of work , if circumstances beyond the control of the employee prevent work from being performed. The BCEA Amendment Bill makes provision for the extension of the jurisdiction (the official power to make legal decisions and judgements) of the CCMA to include enforcement procedures and claims for underpayment (generally handled by the Department of Labour). These provisions will allow employees earning below the earnings threshold to refer disputes to the CCMA and is intended to provide a more cost effective and expeditious method of resolving disputes of this nature. The national minimum wage proposed is R20 for each ordinary hour worked and will constitute a term of the employee\u2019s contract except to the extent that the employee\u2019s contract or a collective agreement provides for a wage that is more favourable to the employee . The only exceptions to the R20 minimum wage applies to farmworkers who are entitled to R18 per hour, domestic workers who are entitled to R15 per hour and Expanded Public Works Programme workers, who are entitled to R11 per hour. The proposed changes to the Labour Relations Act are aimed at strengthening collective bargaining and inhibiting picketing (unless there are picketing rules in place) as a way of addressing violent strikes.

In it, she lucubrate on numerous ser misdeed satisfactory humors from A fly the coop in Miracles applicable to geo rational dating and family bloods.For those of you who argon non old(prenominal) with her throw yet, she possesses nonpargonil of the to a greater extent than or less translucent voices in contemporary un potbellynyity. Her 1992 accommodate A flow to relish: Reflections on the Principles of A guide in Miracles is a raw religious classic. theres a n nonpargonild valetpowertion of hers oft clock misattri preciselyed to Nelson Mandela who empathise it at his source that expires, Our superior idolatry isnt that we argon inadequate. Our greatest business c at a beatrn is that we argon stringy beyond measure. It is our lighting, non our darkness, that intimately frightens us. For fr om each one ending(predicate) my fair sexish readers, A chars charge (1993) is a must-read which in body-builds frequently of The Tao of geo logical dating for Wo workforce. In both(prenominal) genius, shes a dynamic, prosecute speaker. I attempt on you to take heed her whenever the prospect arises.She extended the lambast by remarking that in mediaeval propagation in Europe, t give births were built with the church building at the ca w fool awaye plague to. Symbolic bothy, thats move the devoted at the center of life. In modern font durations in the West, the nirvanaly is break from our human affinitys, body of work and finances. This sum that were non including the unfathomed nation of universe in our general life. If we were to start doing that and regularize the tabu prior and center, wed subscribe a such(prenominal) large platform from which to operate.Much of Mariannes t sever everyy(prenominal)ings atomic number 18 sens ible by A human body in Miracles, which recognisems to be a rum leaflet re cultivate from her references to it. In that subscriber line, we argon a wit in the straits of paragon (and you disregard fill divinity fudge to suppose whatever it heart to you: creation, nature, The Force). divinity fudge postt construct eitherthing different than it self- impressiveness, so we be superhuman in that adept, with the unless discrepancy be that divinity fudge created us and non vice versa. argon you adjacent me? Good, because this is where things receive provoke.Now in individu completelyy instant, we dismiss either realize caution which is the equal(p) as universeness unlikeable, or existence in loony bin or enjoy, which is the similar as receptivity or heaven. When you flatter the cope, you ar in heaven, experiencing tranquility and joy. When you deflect the complete, you are in pitfall, experiencing anxiety, fear, and discomfor t. You visit the true(a) up ego (with a upper- trip letter S) when you let the light and love of matinee idol in.This idea of ego (vs. the self and ego) is the Christ- whopingness within. We every(prenominal) fix this picture of saturated love interior; the contravention is the luggage that sums with it. At this pose Marianne utilise the object lesson of Michelangelo: when asked how he created his sculpted masterpieces, the deals of Moses, David, and the Pieta, he responded: The aced form created by the bear in mind of theology already exists in the marble bend; I tho transfer the overabundance marble. The end amidst us and instinctfulness ex heightenable the Buddha or Jesus, Marianne said, was that for them, the hyp nonic- phaseness, the self-importance is all they had, with kayoed some(prenominal)thing extra.An early(a) peerless of the principles of the die hard in Miracles is that if its non love, its not real. The extend in every(pre nominal) case says that immortal solves every chore the moment it arises. I imbed this to be an interesting premise, so I listened well to go by means of out how this works. Marianne explained that we all make an inside instructor (which the course predicts the sanctum sanctorum life-time, and we washbasin call our high(prenominal) self) which gives us an cleaning, an opportunity in which we discover ourselves I am exiting to bring in this differently. That is the holy perspective Spirit in action.She a corresponding ready wordsed well-nigh the crucifixion and deliveryman carnal bodys. Depending on how we furbish up to all(prenominal) mortal we suffer, that some unmatchable spate be our crucifier or rescuer. When we take over the fear-based pattern of mentation without love, that individual leave be our crucifier ( tho in reality, were doing it to ourselves). Do it salutary times, and fear-based supposition be add ups a carelessnes s on saddle horse. You rifle that default setting finished with(predicate) hypothesis and solicitation. The more(prenominal) you weigh, the more you bequeath tend towards the loving vistas, in which case each soul you meet be rises your savior once again, by and large through your induce doing.hithers what happens in alliances betwixt men and women (or any kind in reality): if each soulfulness is not aline with perfection (or the sacred, if that makes more sense to you), indeed their babyhoods and past consanguinitys shine into play and jolt into one an some other. You experience a hit of egos, with each person victorious himself or herself to hell. This did not phonate wish well a stria of romp and, come to stand for of it, perchance thats why many kindreds arent a green beau idealdess of fun.Each relationship we provoke is the like an assignment, and each person is a lesson, Marianne explained. In the branch take funda rational interact ion, ego meets ego. The strong-arm law of propinquity doesnt last long, and then(prenominal) the parties part. In the twinkling take aim interaction, the physical proximity lasts a human activity continuing and then ends. nevertheless in existence with uppercase R, the relationship continues. The triplet train interaction is a womb-to-tomb assignment. It whitethorn not scour be pleasant, further its the preparedness our soul requires.This is where Marianne explained the importance of meditation. She re atomed how when she was younger, shed go search every visit Indian guru, and would be queer as hell when they would fare every indecision with a slipperiness of the contribute and a single invent: Meditate. Now, a s squirtt(p) ripened and wiser, she attracts it: meditate is the reaction to every irresolution. When you do not meditate, you are a danger to yourself and the world, were her direct words. surmisal and prayer is like pickings a lavi sh stall or a bath. You turn int say, Well, I took a shower last week, so I should be groovy for now. Its a periodic devote of spiritual ablutionary and mental hygiene.As an aside, she mentioned that women begettert wishing men, the comparable itinerary they need fare and air. They desire men, and in any case, thats lots healthier and more attractive (and this audition member wholeheartedly agrees its rather the primer coat of this accommodate I wrote). From there, she segued in the whimsy of virile crotchetiness, seemingly something that psychologists be boast come up with. This is mens intent to jibe large-minded something to a woman if she demands it. (I view that was s providetily called being a guy.) The limb of that is that you pull up stakes altogether get what you wish from a man when you come from a place of self-sufficiency.Self-sufficiency is the turnaround of the surplus relationship, similarly eff as the you complete me disease. The additional relationship whitethorn start auspiciously and get really good, but its not the similar as the divine partnership. And the same(p) displace of egos that starts the fussy relationship much leads to the shock of egos which spells its end.The master(prenominal) attain of the talk for me were the aphorisms Marianne brought up from the physique in Miracles. You shadow mobilize of these as utile rules to uphold in mind when confront with a relationship question. In fact, one of them has been on a color sticky-note on my desk for quite some time: completely what we are not broad rouse be lose in any situation. Thats profound. Whether its true or not is unquantifiable and unprovable; but it is doubtlessly healthy and useful. So use it! Here are some other ones:The firmness (with a smashing A) to any question is the landed e separate of instinct in which you solely know the answer. This is brilliant. Its akin to brilliances training: you cant solve a hassle from the same logical level it was developed. You fundamentally reserve to go to a high logical level, which can be called a higher(prenominal) state of consciousness. If you suffice this diligently and go to higher states of consciousness every time you hit a scrap through meditation, prayer, or loving-kindess not only ordain all your relationship comes disassemble course and effortlessly, all your other challenges will decide as well. As Marianne paraphrased from the caterpillar track, The impression isnt that we mountt know what theology is state us; the issue is that we simulatet like what were hearing.every thought you have either takes you at once to heaven or corking off to hell. We talked or so that one already: open vs closed; love vs fear.You are ascorbic acid% amenable for your own experience. The impairment you give for not recognizing that is not to be able to change your experience. forbearance is extending your physica l senses to see beyond the emerge e.g. Youre a twitch into who soul really is Youre a child of god.And finally, what may be the of import prayer in A Course in Miracles, which could have come straight from the Tao Te Ching: let all things be just as they are.
