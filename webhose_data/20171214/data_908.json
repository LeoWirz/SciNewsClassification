You wouldn\u2019t want to own a modern car with an engine which was designed and built in Ford Model A. The same thing applies to HDD and more powerful SSD. \nHDD or hard drives are based on a technology from the 50s, so they are more than just obsolete nowadays. SSD or solid-state drives are new devices which have been among us for a few years As such, they are much, much better. Contents 2 The final word The importance of storage drive \nMost users believe that a processor and RAM memory are the main factors to consider when buying a laptop. Although this is partially true, it can be treated as a mistake, when looking for a new device. The reasons are simple. A processor will use files and data stored on the storage drive, meaning that this component actually dictates the operating speed. As such, you can imagine that a slow HDD will limit the speed performance of a processor and RAM memory. In other words, your laptop will be slower, despite the fact it comes with Intel i7 processor. \nA slow performance is easy to understand as well, especially if you know HDDs work. They have a spindle which is paired with a magnetic platter. It basically uses a write/read needle to open or close each file separately or to store it on the magnetic platter. An SSD doesn\u2019t work like this and it will store all the files almost instantly on the memory, allowing you super-fast performances. Much better performances \nWe have tested the same laptop with two configurations. The unit had Intel i5 processor and 8GB of RAM. The first part of the test involved HDD and the second used SSD of 256GB. The results were more than just impressive. \nWhile using SSD, the laptop showed impressive improvements. Opening Word 2016 now takes 1.8 seconds compared to 32 seconds when it used HDD. Chrome is now ready for 1.1 seconds rather for 14 seconds and Excel opens in 1.1 seconds compared to HDD version when we needed 20 seconds. \nImprovements in data transfer are impressive as well. Laptop with the SSD was able to reach 237.8MBps, compared to HDD which was around 33.9MBps. \nObviously, users won\u2019t spend time calculating the overall speed of the operations a laptop offers, but there is another important advantage here. In real life, you would get a laptop which is capable of providing all tasks completed in less time than ever before. It simply means that you won\u2019t have to wait for your laptop to open a program, copy a file or boot the system. As soon as you start it, you will be ready to use it, within a matter of seconds, compared to HDD alternative which requires minutes. \nIn other words, a laptop with SSD is ready to meet all your requirements easier than ever before. Even if you have an old laptop, upgrading to SSD is a wise decision to make. You will get significant improvements in speed, reliability and battery life. Longer battery life \nHere we will reveal how much longer battery life you will get if you go for an SSD laptop version. On our tests, we were able to determine that the same laptop managed 5.5 hours of battery life when was equipped with HDD. The same laptop achieved 7 hours when was using SSD. \nThis is an obvious advantage which is more than just needed at the moment. For example, users who need extra battery \u2018\u2019juice\u2019\u2019 will appreciate this advantage. The explanation lies in the way how storage drives operate. The HDD has moving components, which require more energy, while SSD doesn\u2019t. While working, HDD will turn most of the energy into heat, while SSD will stay cool. \nThe battery life cannot be generalized due to the fact each laptop comes with a different battery life and different capabilities. On the other hand, we do know that each one will get a longer battery life without any issues related. \nObviously, by now, you should know that purchasing a laptop with SSD is a much better choice. You get better performances and a longer battery life, but this isn\u2019t all. \nSafety for all your data \nAll users should know that losing all of the data, stored on HDD is a severe issue which may have even more severe consequences. So, here we can see another advantage of laptops which come with SSD. All laptops are designed to be portable, used in different locations and carried anywhere a user needs them. All of this means that a laptop will be in a move constantly. HDD has a moving part inside, so it isn\u2019t great for this purpose. In a case you put a laptop in standby mode or in hibernation and move it, you can easily damage HDD. That\u2019s why it is mandatory to completely turn off a laptop while moving it, especially while in the car. \nA laptop with SSD doesn\u2019t have these issues. SSD doesn\u2019t have moving parts, so the data and the reliability are much better, we can even say on a completely different level. We will add that all manufacturers which make a laptop for outdoor or remote uses have completely switched from HDD to SSD. \nIn a nutshell, a laptop with SSD will be a much safer alternative for your data. Chances are much lower that your files will be corrupted or damaged, which isn\u2019t the case with HDD. Here, damages are common and in a case an HDD gets a lot of bad sectors, it will become useless. \nBetter gaming \nOne of the most appealing advantages laptops with SSD have to offer is in gaming. Because a processor and RAM memory will be capable of moving and using files much faster than ever before, you can expect significant improvements in the gaming performances. Think like this. The same laptop with HDD won\u2019t be able to run a specific game smoothly. The same laptop with SSD will. \nNowadays, all gamers have gone for SSD drives. The improvements are more than just significant and desirable. A combination of faster-operating speeds, better going and a longer battery life has transformed laptops into more sophisticated and more desirable types of laptops. Interesting: Not a single gaming laptops come with HDD nowadays, so you can get a better idea about the SSD importance for gaming. \n\nLower operating heat and quieter operations \nIf you recall, we mentioned that laptops with HDDs will generate more heat than equivalent units with SSD. This is perfectly reasonable if you know that all SSDs generate far less heat than HDDs, which can even overheat in some situations. \nA laptop equipped with SSD will run at a lower temperature, meaning that fan is less likely to turn on while performing average tasks. Of course, a fan is mandatory to run while playing games, running 3D rendering and video editing software. Besides the fact this makes using a laptop more pleasant, it also makes it more desirable. \nAll of this means that a laptop will be quieter. Even the most sophisticated HDDs are loud. You can hear the cracking noise almost all the time. Once an HDD has bad sectors, the sound it makes will become even worse and continue to get worse until an HDD stops working. You may believe that there are some ways which will restore the HDD \u2018\u2019health\u2019\u2019, but in reality, not a single one works. A damaged HDD is useless and you won\u2019t be able to restore its functionality ever again. \nAfter all, high-end laptops and ultra-books come with SSD drives precisely for these two reasons, alongside all the other ones we have mentioned. They allow the users to surf the web, play games or use any other feature more pleasantly than ever before. \nA laptop with an SSD is an investment \nHere we have the ultimate answer to the question, why would I buy a laptop with SSD. Because it is an investment. Here is an in-depth guide on Best Laptops Under 800$ equipped with SSD will be useful and fully operational for a longer period of time, while a model with HDD won\u2019t. IN the near future HDD will be useless and completely eliminated, meaning that it will be impossible to find a model for this type of storage. \nAs a smart investment, you will get a durability, better overall performances and a lot of additional advantages, which are all unavailable for HDDs. \nThe final word \nA laptop with an SSD is better in any way than a model with HDD. Yes, it is more expensive, but you should think of it as an investment. Laptops with HDD are barely sufficient to be used for web browsing, while units with SSD are ready to meet all your demands. In other words, if you buy a laptop with HDD, it is just a matter of time when you will have to replace its drive storage with SSD.
