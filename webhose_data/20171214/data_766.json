The CL defending champions finished second to Tottenham, who have remained undefeated in the tournament so far. After losing 3-2 in tonight\u2019s match, Dortmund will drop into the Europa League, remaining winless in the Champions League this season. With Real moving on regardless of their finish in this match, Ronaldo decided to make some history at its expense. Cristiano became the first player in the Champions League history to score in all six matches of the Group Stage. Ronaldo, with his new record, looks to take Real back to the promised land. The First Half Real got off to a red hot start in this match against Borussia Dortmund. It took only 8 minutes for Borja Mayoral to get his first ever Champions League goal and the first goal of the match for Real. \n\n\n\n\n\nFOX Soccer \n\u2714 @FOXSoccer 1st career Champions League start, 1st career Champions League goal for Borya Mayoral.  4:56 PM - Dec 6, 2017   2 2 Replies     106 106 Retweets     243 243 likes Twitter Ads info and privacy A great run from Ronaldo led to Isco just getting a tap-and-go pass to Mayoral for the goal. Real was off and running with the second goal of the night coming just four minutes later. It was Cristiano who scored an absolute stunner in the top corner behind BVB\u2019s Roman B\u00fcrki. It was perhaps Ronaldo\u2019s best goal of the Champions League and the goal that gave him the record. This goal in the 12th minute gives him 9 goals for the CL so far over the course of all 6 matches played in the Group Stage. \n\n\n\n\n\nGolazoJuice @GolazoJuice Oh boy. Ronaldo does Ronaldo things and its already 2-0 in the 12th minute.  # RMABVB   # RealMadrid   # BVB   # uefa 5:01 PM - Dec 6, 2017   7 7 Replies     85 85 Retweets     162 162 likes Twitter Ads info and privacy It seemed like the Real train was moving forward full-steam ahead and was ready to run away with the match. However, this would not be the case for very long. Dortmund had several chances after Real\u2019s two quick goals. A cross pass from the corner, intended for Aubameyang, was luckily kicked away by Varane saving an easy-tap in for BVB. Another chance was Pulisic absolutely walking the Real defense and making a great pass to Shinji Kagawa. Again, Varane was there to keep a great ball from getting into the back of the Real net. Aubameyang again had another chance in the 34th minute that he just shanked wide, one he easily should\u2019ve put past Navas. With Dortmund pressing, further worry struck Real. Varane went down to an apparent injury, luckily getting up quickly. Taking no chances, Zidane decided to sub on Asensio for Varane just in case it was more than a scare. The momentum shifted to Real for a moment when Mayoral just missed a bid for his second goal wide. Not even a minute later, Dortmund would cut Real\u2019s lead in half. A great pass from BVB captain Marcel Schmelzer was headed in by Aubameyang. One could see this goal as a bit of retribution for missing a fairly easy goal earlier in the half. With Dortmund cutting the lead to one goal, they went into halftime with all the momentum on their side. The Second Half Dortmund immediately turned their renewed confidence into the tying goal just 2 minutes into the second half of play. Aubameyang again drew blood against the Real Madrid defense, who just seemed to give up on the play. On further replays, it seems very much like the referee missed a clear offside on Aubameyang. Regardless, the match was a brand new one all tied up at 2 goals apiece. Ronaldo, who was having himself quite a game already, missed a chance wide that would have put Real back on top. Like Aubameyang\u2019s missed chance, it was one Cristiano usually buries. The next two important things to happen in the match, there was a bit of a lull in the action, were Ceballos being subbed on for Kovacic in the 57th and Llorente being subbed on for Isco in the 69th. These matches are really a great chance for Real to showcase their youth players and give them some extended playing time and experience. More controversy would strike the pitch when BVB defender Neven Subotic pulled Ronaldo down by the shoulder. A clear foul, which should have been a penalty kick awarded to Cristiano. Again, a costly miss by the referee; luckily, this match didn\u2019t mean much to Real in the grand scheme of things. Just minutes later, Ronaldo was cheated again when he put the ball in the net but was flagged for offsides. On further review, Ronaldo was onside and it should\u2019ve been a 3-2 Real Madrid lead at this point. No matter, as Lucas Vasquez did get Real back into the lead in the 81st minute of action. A great headed, lateral pass from Theo Hernandez found the side of Vasquez\u2019s boot and past B\u00fcrki. Real would hold on to this lead and keep Dortmund winless in the Champions League. This was, by no means, Real\u2019s best match, but they were able to find a way to win. Which, is exactly what you need if you want to move forward in the Champions League and hopefully win it all. You could argue this should have been a 4-2 win (or 4-1 if you call Aubameyang\u2019s 2nd goal offside), but it didn\u2019t really matter. What matters is that Real is moving on to the knockout stage of the CL which starts in February. All 5 of the English teams in the Champions League are also moving on, which means there is a higher chance that Real will have to play one of them to start the Knockout Stage. Regardless of who Real draws, they need to play much better defensively. When Varane went off, the defense looked pretty dreadful. Nacho, who was in for Carvajal, looked like he had never played with Sergio Ramos before. They looked lost at times and they really need to get it together for the Knockout Stage if they want to go farther than they are in La Liga.\n\nPlayer Ratings: Real Madrid 3-2 Borussia Dortmund, 2017/18 Champions League \nPhoto by Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images \nToday, we had the pleasure of watching the classic bipolar version of  Real Madrid . In the first 20 minutes of the match, everything looked so encouraging. Real players were hungry, motivated and for once converted their chances, so Real was quickly 2-0 up. However, upon scoring the second goal Real took the foot off the gas and let Dortmund grew into the game and score two goals. Real's lackluster defending and compactness was once again on full display. In the second half, the game opened up so much that you could mistake it for a preseason game, as you could see waves and waves of attacks and counter-attacks. \n\nView image on Twitter \n\n\nReal Madrid C.F. \n\u2714 @realmadriden  This is our starting XI for tonight's Champions League match against  @ BVB . # RMUCL  |  # HalaMadrid 3:33 PM - Dec 6, 2017   61 61 Replies     634 634 Retweets     1,357 1,357 likes Twitter Ads info and privacy Keylor Navas : 7 -  Keylor is slowly getting up to speed, which is great news, and he was by no means at fault for either one of the two conceded goals. He made an excellent point-blank save, but Real's defenders gave Aubameyang time and space to chip Keylor from the rebound. Nacho: 6.5 -  Nacho was moved around the back-line all the time. He started as a right-back, then he was moved to center-back when Varane was taken off, but due to Lucas' shortcomings as a right-back, Nacho once again assumed the right-back duties while Casemiro dropped to center-back position. At every position, Nacho was quite solid and managed to keep Aubameyang's runs in check. Varane: 8 -  Varane has been Real's best player of the season and his potential injury is a huge blow, as we could see from this game. Real's defense with Varane and without is like a day and night. Varane covers so many flaws and constantly bails out his teammates with last second tackles and interceptions. Sergio Ramos : 5   -  Oh Sergio. Today wasn't your day. You were sloppy, uninterested and slow. You were caught out of position so many times that I couldn't keep track of it. Usually, you know when to step up and intercept passes, but today you couldn't. Theo Hernandez: 6.5 -  This was one of Theo's better games, but it was far from perfect as Pulisic got better of him on almost every occasion. However, Theo was very good going forward and attacking space. Given his strengths, I do hope that we won't see Theo playing as a winger, because it negates most of his strong attributes - strong runs from deep and overlapping. Overall, it was encouraging decent performance. Casemiro: 6.5  - I wonder if Casemiro ever gets frustrated when he sees his teammates not tracking back. Our compactness has been shocking this season and Casemiro has been unable to revert it. I just wish that he improved upon passing to allow free-flowing passing. A lot of times, he rather keeps it extremely simple (passes back to center-backs) instead of looking for players in between lines. And for the record, it's also something that Marcos Llorente needs to work on. Mateo Kovacic - 6.5:  Mateo certainly produced some good moments, but he still needs more minutes. He did make a lot of good runs, but he failed to pass the ball at the right moment. In defense, he covered for Casemiro, when he stepped up, but quite often he didn't track back quick enough to help the defenders. Isco 6.5:  I was quite surprised to see Isco start this meaningless game. It was a good opportunity for Zidane to give Isco a bit of a rest while giving much needed minutes to Ceballos. Well, Isco was once again a creative hub of Real's attack and his unintentional (or genius?) touch set up Borja's opening goal of the match. \n\n\n\n\nJos\u00e9 Villacreses @jj_villac This is Borja Mayoral's goal against BVB. Cristiano did fantastic in making it possible! 5:13 PM - Dec 6, 2017   Replies     12 12 Retweets     30 30 likes Twitter Ads info and privacy Lucas Vazquez  7:  Lucas starting spot has been heavily criticised by the fans, but I think it's very clear why he start. Real's attack generally lack speed and width and with Asensio and Bale unavailable, only Lucas has these traits, so I make sense to start him. And today, Zidane's trust has been repaid with a winning goal in the second half. Ronaldo - 8:  In this game, Ronaldo was placed on his favorite left wing and he did look much better than he does as a striker, but bare in mind that Dortmund's defense is shocking. And Ronaldo casually set a new record in Champions League. In Europe, Ronaldo is unstoppable (19 goals in last 11 games). \n\nView image on Twitter \n\n\nOptaJose \n\u2714 @OptaJose 6 - Cristiano Ronaldo is the first player to ever score in each of the six games of a  # UCL  group round (nine goals).

He moved excellently around and in the box. He says that he tries to model his game after Benzema, but he certainly has slightly different traits. He is a great box predator and he knows exactly where to be. He scored his first of his (surely) many Champions League goals. Dani Ceballos - 8:  Dani Ceballos is wonderful and it pains me to watch him on sidelines game after game. I don't know why Zidane doesn't trust him more. Is he being cautious? Does he want him to adapt to a different role? I have no clue, but this treatment reminds me of Kovacic's situations in Zidane's first 6-8 months. Kovacic also barely played... Marco Asensio - 6.5:  I expect a bit from Marco when he came on. I thought he would be able to capitalise on Dortmund's leaky defense, but he was quiet tonight.

They are not a sword to be wielded in the service of bigotry,\" government MP Andrew Hastie said in parliament.\nAmendments to permit lay celebrants to decline to solemnise same-sex marriages and businesses opposed to the unions to refuse service at wedding receptions were all defeated, one after the other, during three days of debate.\n\"Love has won, and it's time to pop the bubbly,\" Greens MP and same-sex marriage supporter Adam Bandt said.\n Hot News 0 07/12/17 18:45 DISCLAIMER:\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:04.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8cea360c243c70e351b4fe1d5d1c0754904661bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXfcHd8J_NiMUp9OfffvILpdnvitFTE5aWBe7Qt01L8gTl0TXBpzBYZ6qg3KRleyXRMuP9d3pw.oApeylWSWeujDbrSV26yHcNwsWuzT49av2RuLBG9juGjcutagn8_R66xJ3mCLtA4V4thIFweLbCCcQOOJPbAopUapjWwwPZWLA5fNy51b67", "site_full": "www.holidaypirates.com", "site": "holidaypirates.com", "site_section": "http://www.holidaypirates.com/feed", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "HolidayPirates", "title": "Be tempted by Tunisia: 14nt all inclusive holiday under \u00a3400pp - incl. flights & 4* hotel", "title_full": "Be tempted by Tunisia: 14nt all inclusive holiday under \u00a3400pp - incl. flights & 4* hotel", "published": "2017-12-07T12:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thumb2.holidaypirates.com/LKp5vgNSNeq6N1Am3pGsR4EeYGg=/1200x627/https://media.mv.urlaubspiraten.de/images/2017/09/59c10064e45b9575260700e8kj7agy.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 32945, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8cea360c243c70e351b4fe1d5d1c0754904661bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXfcHd8J_NiMUp9OfffvILpdnvitFTE5aWBe7Qt01L8gTl0TXBpzBYZ6qg3KRleyXRMuP9d3pw.oApeylWSWeujDbrSV26yHcNwsWuzT49av2RuLBG9juGjcutagn8_R66xJ3mCLtA4V4thIFweLbCCcQOOJPbAopUapjWwwPZWLA5fNy51b67", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "GemUK", "published": "2017-12-07T12:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Be tempted by Tunisia: 14nt all inclusive holiday under \u00a3400pp - incl. flights & 4* hotel", "text": "Be tempted by Tunisia: 14nt all inclusive holiday under \u00a3400pp - incl. flights & 4* hotel 7.

To sketch the South African context, the paper\nprovides a summary of the ruling party\u2019s framing and\\or location of the RET discourse and its outline of the objectives of RET. This is followed with critical questions for debate in relation the framework and objectives mentioned above. The paper then locates the discourse on RET in\nSA in the context of the historical roots of racial, class , gender and related oppression in Sout Africa, the continuities thereof in the current dispensation and the implications thereof for the transformation. It traces such roots to a dynamic intersection between capitalist accumulation,\ncolonialism and racism and therefore posits the anti-thesis and synthesis as a radical project that simultaneously advance socialization, de-colonialization, democratization and put redistribution,\nredress, restitution , reparation and reconstruction at the centre of the political economy and social policy trajectory. Thus, the paper reframes the debate from talking about RET to talking about radical social, political and economic transformation in order to emphasize that the democratization of the polity and democratization of the economy are inseparable and\nintertwined and should be pursued simultaneously instead of being viewed as discrete processes to be pursued and achieved in a linear fashion or in stages\n1 Mphutlane wa Bofelo teaches Political and Social Development at Workers\u2019 College in Durban, KwaZulu\n\u2013South Africa \\Azania.

It was\nestablished in 1996 by the main trade union federations in South Africa, to help build a strong trade union\nmovement.\n\nIntroduction \n\u201cTo be radical is to go to the root of the matter. For man, however, the root is man himself.\u201d\n\u2015 Karl Marx\nThis education conference of Ditsela takes place on the occasion of the anniversary of two key\nmoments in history from which we can glean critical lessons related to the theme of the\nconference and the topic of Radical Economic Transformation. This year marks 150 since Karl\nMarx wrote the seminal piece, Das Kapital: Kritek der Polischen Oekonomie (The Capital:\nCritique of Political Economy) and hundred years since the Great Proletariat Revolution of 1919.\nMarx\u2019s Capital and the October Revolution are of particular relevance to today\u2019s topic in so far\nas their provision of historical and dialectic materialism as scientific tools of analysis that\nexposed how the problems of unemployment, poverty and inequality , the cycles of booms and\nbusts associated with capitalism and the series of financial crises the world has experience\noriginate and are rooted in the intrinsic contradictions within the capitalist system and therefore\nthat sustainable solutions to these has to be sought outside of the logic, values and structure of\nthe capitalist system. Marxists and post-Marxists theorists have identified some of the factors\nintrinsic to the logic and structure of capitalism that account for the crisis as (1) the myth of the\nself-regulating market,(2) neoliberalism unbridled greed of accumulation, (3) crisis of overaccumulation and the crisis of over production and (4) the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. The myth of the self-regulating market is dealt with extensively by Karl Polanyi 3in his book,\nThe Great Transformation. Polanyi adequately explains how the economy is connected and\nsubordinated to politics, religion and social relations and that the institutions and mechanisms of\nmarkerts self-regulation cannot exist without annihilating human and natural substance of society\nand turning labor, human beings into pure commodities. The notion of a self-regulating market\nis based on the idea of Capitalism as a system in which the market is allowed to own and control\nthe use of property in accord with their own interests, and where the invisible hand of the pricing\n3 Karl Paul Polanyi (October 25, 1886 \u2013 April 23, 1964)[1] was an Austro-Hungarian economic historian, economic anthropologist, economic sociologist, political economist, historical sociologist and social philosopher. He is known for his opposition to traditional economic thought and for his book, The Great\nTransformation, which argued that the emergence of market-based societies in modern Europe was not\ninevitable but historically contingent. Polanyi is remembered today as the originator of substantivism, a\ncultural approach to economics, which emphasized the way economies are embedded in society and\nculture. This view ran counter to mainstream economics but is popular in anthropology, economic history,\neconomic sociology and political science.\nmechanism coordinates supply and demand in markets in a way that is automatically in the best\ninterests of society. (Scott. 2006).\nThe doctrine of the invisible hand of the market is contradicted by the view of capitalism as\nsocio-political system as well as economic system constituting of three levels, namely\n(a) Markets which involves issues of patterns of ownership and control of the production,\ndistribution and consumption of wealth and resources; and constitutes of an interaction\nbetween market factors (labor, land, capital, and technology), product markets- goods and\nservices, firms and consumers.\n(b) Institutional foundations \u2013 policy regime, regulators, social infrastructure and physical\ninfrastructure, which is the domain of government.\n(c) The political authority - that administers the system in the form of direct and indirect\nparticipation in the economy through administrative and entrepreneurial role such as\noperating SOE, appropriation, or buying, selling and growing of SOEs, and enforcing\nlaws & regulations & regulations, maintaining infrastructure, passing new laws, issuing\nnew regulation and building new infrastructure. (Scott. 2006: 3-13). Expatiating on the\nidea of capitalism as a three level system, Bruce R. Scott asserts that Ideology, culture\nand the political structure including civil society have a mayor influences upon how a\ndemocratic society works (Scott 2006:16), and stresses that:\n\u2026market frameworks are created through political processes and regulated through\nadministrative agencies, neither of which is directly controlled by the economic actors\nthemselves. In short, the point is that economics is intimately connected to political and\nadministrative processes.\nWhen we take economics out of this broader context we gain something in the clarity\nwith which we can study how markets operate according to the laws of supply and\ndemand, but we inevitably lose the perspective that market frameworks are societal\nconstructs created and legitimated by legislatures and not by the economic actors\nthemselves. (Scott 2006: 17-18). This understanding of capitalism as a sociopolitical and\neconomic system is important in the light of the dominant tendency to frame the Radical\nEconomic Transformation on the assumption that South Africa has achieved political\ntransformation and now require to transit to economic transformation. This framing not\nonly holds the dangers of presenting the democratization of the polity and the\ndemocratization of the economy as discrete projects that can be achieved separately\nand\\or in a linear fashion, one leading to the other, it also holds the dangers of equating\nRadical Economic Transformation with merely de-racialising the ownership and control\nof the economy. The reality, however, is that the South African politics and polity has not\nbeen fully democratised into a participatory democratic state that provide people active\nparticipation in the design, implementation, monitoring and review of development\nprogrammes, social policy agenda and political economy trajectory of the country nor is\nit characterised by popular control of public institutions and worker-control of\nworkplaces and other social institutions.\nThe democratic deficit created by the inadequacy of bourgeois liberal representative democracy\nis in your face in South Africa, and so is the growing political, social, economic and ideological\ndistance between broader society and the social, economic and political elite. The undemocratic\nattributes, injustices and inequities of the economy and the undemocratic attributes, injustices\nand inequities of the political system are complementary and inseparable. The opulence, greed\nand insatiable accumulation proclivities of Monopoly Capital is prescribed, protected, abetted\nand entrenched by the constitutional, legal and policy framework laid down by the governing\nBlack comprador bourgeois class. The social lifestyles and political and economic conduct of the\nBlack social, political and corporate elite is prescribed by the standards of Big Capital. The\ndemocratic deficit in the politics is the function and creation of the democratic deficit in the\neconomy and the democratic deficit in the economy is reflective of the democratic deficit in the\npolitics. This perspective is useful in interrogating how working-class organizations position\nthemselves in relating to the complex and tricky relationship between the state and the various\nfractions of capital. This question is important in Southern Africa where there seem to be a direct\nlink between internal contradictions within the state and the territorial battles between the\nvarious segments of local, trans-national and global capital. \nIn Southern Africa there is an emerging pattern of the emergent Black capitalists and sections of\nthe ruling Black comprador bourgeosie enlisting nationalist and anti-imperialist language and the\ntransformation discourse to recruit the working-class on its side in its territorial war with other\nfractions of capital over who must turn nation\u2019s wealth and state institutions and public resources\ninto their private property the most. The paternalistic attitude of the regimes and regiments of\ncapitalist globalization towards Africa and the domination of capitalist monopolies by White\ncapitalists -courtesy of the legacies and continuities of apartheid-capitalism \u2013 create an enabling\nenvironment for the Black political and social elites to couch its ambitions to be the new\ncapitalist bosses behind the transformation agenda. This often takes the form of framing the\ntransformation agenda as the African agenda to veil class interests and class contradictions\nbehind the curtain of nationalism. To what extent does this create possibilities for the\ntransformation agenda to be residualizes into a de-racialisation agenda, thereby contributing to\ngiving capital a new breath of life in the form of a non-racial face that allows it to thrive\nwithout racial fetters? To what extent is the transformation agenda constructed within the logic of\nthe market? How vigilant and how much capacity, insight, power and influence does labour has\nto take the transformation discourse outside the logic and dictates of the regimes and regiments\nof capital? \nIn her book, The Accumulation of Capital, Rosa Luxemburg4 expounds on Marx\u2019s ideas on\nexpanded reproduction to explain how the capitalist system is locked the inescapable\ncontradictions and inherent crises. Luxemburg argues: \u201cCapital cannot accumulate without the\naid of non-capitalist organizations, nor on the other hand, can it tolerate their continued\nexistence side by side. Only the continuous and progressive disintegration of non-capitalist\norganizations makes accumulation of capital possible. \u201c(Luxembourg 2003, 397)\nOne can\u2019t agree more with Rosa Luxemburg on this observation. Capitalism needs labour to turn\nraw material into goods and services. Capitalism needs political and social institutional\nfoundations to survive. But capitalism does not only deplete and degrades the environment in its\nquest for super profits. It depends on the suppression of labour interests, social demands and\nstate power for unbridled accumulation of profits and private wealth. Therefore capitalist greed\nfor accumulation results in the destruction of the very non-capital actors that are critical for its\nsurvival. In this sense, Capitalism digs its own grave. But capitalism cannot avoid the grave. It\ncannot free itself from its entrapment to crisis and to the generation of poverty, unemployment\nand inequalities without eroding its very logic and structure. Updating Luxembourg thesis on the\nCrisis of Over accumulation in the context of the 1980, Walden Bello5 describes the financial\ncrisis of that period as \u2018the intensification of one of the central crisis or contradictions of global capitalism: the crises of over-production, also known as over-accumulation or over-capacity. This is the tendency for capitalism to build up in the context of heightened inter-capitalist competition, tremendous productive capacity that outruns the population\u2019s capacity to consume owing to income\ninequalities that limit popular purchasing power. The result is an erosion of profitability, leading\nto economic downspin\u201d (Bello 2009)\n4 Rosa Luxemburg ( 5 March 1871\u2013 15 January 1919) was a German-Polish-Jewish Marxist theorist,\nphilosopher, economist, anti-war activist, and revolutionary socialist who became a naturalized German\ncitizen. She was, successively, a member of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and\nLithuania (SDKPiL), the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the Independent Social Democratic\nParty (USPD), and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). She articulated a pointed criticism of both\nthe Leninist and the more moderate social democratic schools of socialism, Luxemburg.\n5 Walden Flores Bello (born November 11, 1945) is a Filipino academic who served as a member of the\nHouse of Representatives of the Philippines. He is a professor of sociology and public administration at\nthe University of the Philippines Diliman, as well as executive director of Focus on the Global South.\nSocialist Worker described Bello as \"one of the most articulate and prolific voices on the international left\"\nand that \"he has devoted most of his life to fighting imperialism and corporate globalization\". Bello was\nalso a supporter of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and was impressed by his opposition to the United States, stating after\nCh\u00e1vez's death that he was \"a class act, one impossible to follow. Wherever you are right now, give \u2019em\nhell\"\nBello observes that Capitalism mooted out neoliberal restructuring, structural adjustments \u2013\nextensive accumulation, rapid integration of semi-capitalist, non-capitalist and pre-capitalist\nareas in the global market economy, and financialization as gateways out of the crisis.\nThe problem with investing in financial sector operations is that it is tantamount to squeezing\nvalue out of already created value. It may create profit, yes, but it does not create new value \u2014\nonly industry, agricultural, trade, and services create new value. Because profit is not based on\nvalue that is created, investment operations become very volatile and prices of stocks, bonds,\nand other forms of investment can depart very radically from their real value \u2014 for instance, the\nstock of Internet startups may keep rising to heights unknown, driven mainly by upwardly\nspiraling financial valuations.\nProfits then depend on taking advantage of upward price departures from the value of\ncommodities, then selling before reality enforces a \u201ccorrection,\u201d that is a crash back to real\nvalues. The radical rise of prices of an asset far beyond real values is what is called the\nformation of a bubble. Profitability being dependent on speculative coups, it is not surprising\nthat the finance sector lurches from one bubble to another, or from one speculative mania to\nanother. Because it is driven by speculative mania, finance driven (Bello. 2009)\nIn their book, The Crisis in South Africa: Neoliberalism, Financialization and Uneven and\nCombined Development, Sam Ashman, Ben Fine, Susan Newman explain the devastating result\nof the financialization route in South Africa:\n\u2026in the context of South African production, financialization has produced a particular\ncombination of short-term capital inflows (accompanied by rising consumer debt largely spent\non luxury items) and a massive long-term outflow of capital as major \u2018domestic\u2019 corporations\nhave chosen offshore listing and to internationalize their operations while concentrating within\nSouth Africa on core profitable MEC sectors. The result, even before the impact of the current\ncrisis, was a jobless form of growth and the persistence of mass poverty for the majority\nalongside rising living standards for a small minority, including new black elites. (Ashman et al.\n2011).\nThe fact that the internal contradiction within the logic and structure of capitalism are at the\ncentre of the crisis of poverty, unemployment and inequality is further amplified in the account\nof Combined and Uneven Development in South Africa provided by Ashman et al (2011).\nSouth Africa is now, \u2018officially\u2019, the most unequal society in the world \u2013 though there seems to be\na macabre rivalry with Brazil for this status. The poorest 20 per cent of South Africans receive\n1.6 per cent of total income while the richest 20 per cent benefit from 70 per cent according to\nthe South African Government\u2019s Development Indicators 2009. In the most recent United\nNation\u2019s Human Development Index of \u2018wellbeing\u2019, South Africa fell one place to 129th out of\n182. Before the global economic crisis, South Africa had one of the highest unemployment rates\nin the world. It now officially stands at 35.4 per cent or one third of the workforce. The\ncontinuing relevance of Marx\u2019s notion that capital generates and draws upon a reserve army of\nlabour is surely demonstrated by South Africa, though Marx could not have foreseen its members\nwould struggle to survive in the context of the highest levels of HIV infection in the world. This\nhelps explain why, according to the UN, average life expectancy for South Africans is just 51.5\nyears, even though South Africa is classified as a middle income economy. (Ashman et al 2011)\nThis description of the impact of neoliberalism and capitalist globalization in South Africa\nunderscores Bello\u2019s assertion that the recent financial crisis is not a crisis of the neoliberal\ncapitalism but the crisis of capitalism itself. (Bello. 2009). One can go further to suggest that the\ntriple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality are not the products of neoliberal\ncapitalism but are an integral part of the logic and structure of capitalism; and in South Africa\nreflects how the Apartheid economy and its continuities in the current juncture could in many\nways be described by the notion of uneven development in the sense of fast growth in one\nsegment of the population or economy does not support development in the same society as a\nwhole. This then is the context in which we have to engage with the Radical Economic\nTransformation discourse in Southern Africa.\n.\nANC\u2019s outline of the context and objectives of radical economic transformation\nThe African National Congress\u2019s Discussion Document on Economic Transformation6 locates\nthe discourse on RET in South Africa in its resolve at its 53rd National Conference at Mangaung\nin 2012 to pursue what it refers to as the second phase of the transition from apartheid\ncolonialism to a national democratic society. According to the Mangaung resolution the focus\nthe second phase of transition is effecting economic transformation and democratic consolidation\nin order to improve the quality of life of all South Africans and to promote nation-building and\nsocial cohesion and the means to attain this are promoting growth and development, increasing\nstate-led infrastructure , focusing on using local content and local companies, and giving effect to\nthe National Development Plan , the New Growth Path and the Industrial Policy Action Plan to\nstimulate growth, reindustrialization , transforming the mining sector , promoting youth\nemployment, developmental state , maintain supportive macroeconomic policy framework \u2013\nreconstruction, growth and development. It also locates RET within the minimum demands of\n6 \u201cEconomic Transformation: Employment Creation, Economic\nGrowth and Structural Change: Strengthening the programme of Radical Economic transformation.\u201d ANC\nNational Policy Conference Discussion Documents. http://www.anc.org.za/sites/default/files/National\n%20Policy%20Conference%202017%20Economic%20Transformation_1.pdf\nthe Freedom Charter. The discussion document presents the objectives of RET policy\ninterventions as: \n\uf0fc Reducing unemployment and youth unemployment\n\uf0fc Returning land to our people and supporting land reform\n\uf0fc increasing Black ownership and control of the economy\n\uf0fc activating small business and cooperatives\n\uf0fc strengthening social justice and conditions for the poor and working class\n\uf0fc improving the employment impact on infrastructure projects\n\uf0fc reducing inequality and poverty\n\uf0fc Dismantling monopoly practices and structures\n\uf0fc Asserting South Africa\u2019s interests in the global economy\n\uf0fc Improving integration into African economy\n\uf0fc Stimulating inclusive growth \nQuestions for the Trade union Movement and the Working-class: \nSome of the critical questions that need serious engagement with insofar as the framework of\nRET as articulated by the ruling party are:\n1. To what extent will the achievement of the objectives of RET be impacted upon by the\ncurrent disarticulation between the social policy pronouncements that require significant\nsocial spending on housing, healthcare, education, social grants (etc) and an economic\npolicy path that is locked in the Washington Consensus logic of reduced tariff rates, tax\nincentives to big capital, bail out to big capital in different disguises, trade liberalization,\nflexible labor, de-regulation and down-sizing of the public sector?\n2. Many of the objectives of the RET outlined above were\\are the pronounced objectives of\nGrowth and Redistribution (GEAR), Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South\nAfrica (ASGISA) National Growth Path (NGP), Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP),\nand National Development Plan (NDP). Thus far these policy programs that the\ndiscussion document use as a frame of reference for RET, have produced little in terms\nof significantly altering racial, class and gender based power and social relations accrued\nfrom the legacies and continuities of racial-capitalism. What is it in theoretic and\npractical terms will or need to be done differently for RET to lead in the direction of\npractical overhaul of the apartheid geography and the apartheid economy?\n3. Is it possible for RET located within the framework of pursuit of the objectives of the\nNDP to lead to overhaul of the apartheid geography and the apartheid economy without\npaying serious attention to the problems and issues that organized labor and civil society\nhave raised about the NDP? For instance, the Congress of South African Trade Unions\n(COSATU has accused the NDP of selectively drawing from certain government policies\nand programmes and ignoring others, ignoring or contradicting critical elements of the\nNGP/IPAP, which are supposed to be governments lead strategies over the medium term.\nThis, Cosatu asserts creates confusion as to which policy prevails, and undermined the\ngreater degree of co-ordination which was emerging through e.g. the infrastructure plan,\nand the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission (PICC). To what extent\ndoes locating RET within the rubric of NDP without addressing the concerns workers and\nthe poor have raised about NDP holds the possibility of raising the policy confusion\nalluded to by Cosatu? In its critic of the NDP, National Union of Metal Workers of South\nAfrica (NUMSA) has argued that the NDP:\na) leaves intact the power relations of Colonialism of a Special Type\nb) It is therefore a major rightwing deviation from the Freedom Charter and thus, it paves a path\nthat derails a socialist-oriented NDR\nc) Ideologically, it is firmly anchored in neo-liberalism and does not even represent a shadow of\nthe revolutionary tradition of the national liberation movement\nd) GEAR is indeed a living and growing document, it had 66 pages in 1996. It has now grown to\n430 pages in the form of the NDP!\ne) We have consistently argued that there are very strong parallels between the NDP and DA\npolicy\nf) Specifically we have argued that the NDP:\ni) Does not have a plan on how to restructure the economy\nii) Does not have a plan on how to fundamentally transform ownership and control patterns of\nthe economy\niii) Plans to roll-out infrastructure to further reinforce raw mineral export dependence and not\nbroad-based industrial development\niv) Minimizes the role of the state in the economy\nv) Seeks to de-regulate the labour market further and to further weaken working class power,\nand is thus thoroughly anti-working class in its outlook\nvi) Operates within the neo-liberal macroeconomic framework and broadly, and thus offers no\nhope for fundamental social and economic transformation\nThe question that remains in this regard is: to what extent is there a match or mismatch between\nthe goals of RET and the goals of NDP? What are workers and communities going to do to\nensure that the conceptualization and implementation of RET addresses the issues and problems\nthey have with elements of NDP and other macrocosmic policies of the current government?\nRelated to this is the big question of the extent to which Radical Economic Transformation can\nbe achieved without rolling back some of the critical aspects of the CODESA7 agreements.\nThe Namibian and Zimbabwean experience is instructive in this regard. Herbert Jauch8 provides\nthis insightful account of the Namibian experience:\nIn its 1976 political programme, the South West African People\u2019s (SWAPO) envisaged Radical\neconomic transformation but did not implement it upon assuming power. In the run-up to\nindependence in the late 1980s, negotiations with the Western Contact Group resulted in certain\nconstitutional principles which included the protection of private property. Thus neither the land\nthat was stolen through genocide nor the control of multinationals over mineral and fishing\nresources was even touched. As a result, colonial economic structures remained in place after\nindependence and there was not even talk of the need for radical economic transformation\namongst the political leadership. An arrangement (although sometimes uneasy) between the old\nand the new elite was reached and economic changes were limited to some modest reforms such\nas affirmative action measures and more bargaining rights for unions. Working class\norganisations failed to mount a systematic challenge to push for radical economic\ntransformation. Critical left voices were either co-opted into government structures or remained\nin NGOs that were mostly donor-dependent. Trade unions\u2019 militancy declined steadily over the\nyears and despite some occasional radical positions on land and privatization, unions overall\n7 The Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) agreed on the principles of power-sharing,\nprotection of minority rights and guarantee of property rights as the corner-stones of the Government of\nNational Unity. The National Party had entered the negotiation process saying these are the nonnegotiable\nconditions upon which any future constitution of South Africa should be based. The property\nclause remains in the current constitution of South Africa.\n8 Herbert Jauch has been with the labour movement in Southern Africa for over 20 years. He served as\nexecutive member of the Namibian National Teachers Union (NANTU) as well as on various committees\nof the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW). Since 1995 Herbert worked as labour researcher,\ncarrying out research projects for the Southern African Trade Union Co-ordination Council (SATUCC) as\nwell as Namibian and South African trade unions. Herbert was instrumental in developing a labour\ndiploma course for Namibian trade unions and served as director of the Labour Resource and Research\nInstitute (LARRI) in Katutura, Windhoek from 1998 until 2007. He was LaRRI's senior researcher until\nJanuary 2010 and now works as freelance labour researcher and educator with various organisations in\nSouthern Africa.\ndid not manage to push for radical economic transformation. This left working class interests\nstranded. A few years ago, Namibia\u2019s second trade union federation, the Trade Union Congress\nof Namibia (TUCNA) developed its own policy proposals. This at least signaled an intention to\ntackle broader socio-economic issues and not be confined to a narrow collective bargaining\nagenda. (Jauch.2017)\nIn Zimbabwe a similar situation prevailed. Despite the socialist orientation of Zanu (PF) at the\ntime it ascended to power, it became constrained by the Lancaster House Arrangement9 Like\nSouth Africa and Namibia, Zimbabwe had the advantage and opportunity to learn from African\ncountries that received independence and received advises from statesmen from these countries.\nBased on Mozambique\u2019s experience after it had chased the Portuguese out of the country and\nembarked on an intensive nationalization program, Samora Machel cautioned Zimbabwe against\npost-independence revolutionary zeal, and Julius Nyerere implored with President Robert\nGabriel Mugabe to preserve the Jewel of Africa \u2013 referring to Zimbabwe\u2019s relatively developed\nand diversified economy. (Chitambara et al 2011). The Mozambican experience that Machel\nimplored Zimbabwe to learn from indicates the barriers that the economy dominated by\nbeneficiaries of settler-colonialism and racial-capitalism hold for post-independent Southern\nAfrican countries. It underscores the fact that Nyerere Should has qualified his plea to Zimbabwe\nto keep the jewel of Africa with a caution about the hollowness of hoping to leverage whatever\npositive elements of the inherited economy without addressing the realities of a disarticulated\neconomy, characterised by a disharmony between its various parts and the existence of tiny\nenclaves of opulence and filthy riches alongside oceans of poverty and wretchedness. In this\nregard, it is instructive to examine the observation of Chitambara et al (2011) that:\n\u2026.if Zimbabwe was a \u201cjewel\u201d at independence; it was certainly a flawed one. The inherited\neconomy was based on the philosophy of white supremacy that resulted in the evolution of a\nrelatively well-developed and modern formal sector, employing about one million people (a fifth\nof the labor force) , that existed alongside an undeveloped and backward rural economy , the\nhome of 70 percent of the Black population. The \u2018jewel\u2019 was the \u2018enclave\u2019 part of the economy,\nwhich had been developed on the ruthless dispossession of the source of livelihood of the\nmajority of the people, in particular their access to land, which forced them into wage\nemployment. Movement across these structures was strictly controlled such that the prevailing\nrelationship between them was an exploitative one. (Chitambara et al (2011).\n9The Lancaster House Agreement, signed on 21 December 1979, allowed for the creation and\nrecognition of the Republic of Zimbabwe, replacing the unrecognized state of Rhodesia created by Ian\nSmith's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965. The terms of the Agreement provided for\nZimbabwe Rhodesia to temporarily revert to its former status as the Colony of Southern Rhodesia,\nthereby ending the rebellion caused by Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence. In addition to\nthe terms, Robert Mugabe and his supporters were pressured into agreeing to wait ten years before\ninstituting land reform. Both the British and American governments offered to compensate white citizens\nfor any land sold so as to aid reconciliation (the \"Willing buyer, Willing seller\" principle), and a fund was\nestablished to operate from 1980 to 1990. The late Zambian economist, Guy Mhone has written extensively about enclavity, primitive\naccumulation, migration and rural marginalization and labor absorptive capacity in Southern\nAfrica and how the economy characterised by enclavity thwarted and arrested possibilities of\npro-poor development, and inclusive and shared growth Zambia.\nIn South Africa, many theorists have employed Trotsky\u2019s thesis of Combined and Uneven\nDevelopment to highlight the systemic and structural barriers created by the continuities of an\nenclave economy accruing from settler-colonial racial-capitalism. This highlights the importance\nof strategic policies simultaneously aimed, building the capacity of State Owned Enterprises,\nenhancing the efficacy Private Public Partnerships, facilitating active participation of indigenous\npeople in the economy through skill development, business support and affirmative action\nprogrammes and transforming patterns of ownership and control of the economy through\nredistribution and redress programs and reconstruction and social policy programs aimed\ntowards the overhaul of the socioeconomic and physical or geographic structures of racial\nsegregation apartheid geography. Zimbabwe\u2019s Transitional National Development Plan indicated\nsome sense of learning from other African countries. It declared that in some countries in Africa\ngrowth and development was impeded by external and internal constraints that include\ninappropriate policies and strategies, misallocation of human and material resources building\ncostly, unproductive and often unnecessary capacity. The Transitional National Development\nPlan went further to mention the results of suck skewed policies as uneven development,\nstagnation, and decline, leading to no significant and sustained improvement in the living\nstandards of a people as a whole. (Chitambara et al (2011). However the constraints of Lancaster\nHouse agreement, the impositions of the IMF and the World Bank and lack of political will and\ncourage to carve an alternative developmental path saw the Zimbabwe National Union -Patriotic\nFront (ZANU PF) government religiously implementing the Structural Adjustment Programmes,\nmuch to the disadvantage of the working-class and the poor. The rigorous adoption and\nimplementation of Effective Structural Adjustment Programs (ESAP) in Zimbabwe once again\nproved that liberalization and financialization is not a panacea to underdevelopment.\nThe Zimbabwean government inherited the most developed financial sector in Southern Africa,\nwith four commercial banks, two discount houses, three merchant banks, three building societies,\nthree finance companies, the Post Office Savings Bank, the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, a large\nnumber pension and provident funds, three development finance institutions, including\nAgricultural Finance Corporations established in 1924 to fund agricultural projects and two\nstockbroking firms. (Chitambara et al (2011). These highly segmented financial institutions\nwere not changed in any fundamental way by the new government in the first decade of\nindependence, making the financial services to remain exclusive of the majority of the\npopulation, available only to urbanites that constitute less than thirty percent of the population.\n(Chitambara et al (2011). Under the rubric of ESAP, Zimbabwe embarked on a rapid\nfinancialization project, based on the logic that a well-developed financial sector plays a casual\nand central role in promoting socioeconomic development and that financial development\nreduces income inequality and absolute poverty.\nBased on the argument that excessive regulations and controls interfere with competition and\nmake banks less efficient, more fragile and reduce industry\u2019s access to finance, the Zimbabwean\ngovernment adopted the liberalization of the interest regime and its transformation into a marketbased\nframework as its strategy to mobilize savings. This strategy is in line with the theoretical\nunderpinning of the financial sector reforms that emphasizes the link between interest rates and\nsavings and postulates that liberalization will, amongst others, increase financial savings and\nimprove the quality and quantity of investments and that increase in domestic interest rates\nrelative to foreign rates will encourage capital flow thereby augmenting domestic savings,\nresulting in a large pool of loanable funds. (Chitambara et al (2011). The reforms introduced by\nZimbabwe in this regard were\n\uf0fc relaxation of regulations pertaining entry of new financial institutions\n\uf0fc the government committed itself an exchange-rate policy that allowed\nZimbabwean dollar to depreciate over time by the inflation differential\nbetween Zimbabwe and its major trading countries\n\uf0fc Zimbabwean residents and companies were allowed to open foreigncurrency\ndenominated accounts with authorized dealers in Zimbabwe\n\uf0fc foreigners were allowed to purchase shares in the Zimbabwean stock\nexchange subject to 25 per cent limit on a counter , with a single investor\nlimited to 5 percent\n\uf0fc restrictions on access to domestic borrowings by foreigners was abolished\n\uf0fc in February 1995 Zimbabwe agreed to commit to article 8 of the IMF\n(Chitambara et al (2011).\n\uf0fc Chitambara et al (2011) observes that financial liberalization not only deregulated interest rates\nbut also facilitated the onset of the first stage of financial deepening \u2013 the emergence of new\nfinancial intermediaries and banks, with a number of banking institutions increasing by more\nthan three folds by 1990, constituting fourteen commercial banks, four merchant banks, three\nfinance houses, six discount houses and five building society. The fact that most of the new\nentrants in the financial sector were owned by indigenous Zimbabweans makes the banking\nsector one of the sectors in which economic empowerment of the indigenous was achieved\nsmoothly. (Chitambara et al (2011). However, the most important question, which is critical,\nespecially for South Africans \u2013 is did the well-developed and diversified, and relatively\nindigenized financial sector result in socioeconomic development? Did financial development\ncontribute to the reduction of income inequality and absolute poverty? Did the economic\nempowerment of indigenous Zimbabweans translate into the broader empowerment of the\nindigenous people of Zimbabwe as a collective or to their social development and economic\ndevelopment?\nAn answer to this question is a big NO or as South Africans would say, for the underclasses and\nthe majority of the population, it offered \u2018dololo\u201910. This comes out very clear in this account by\nChitambara et al (2011)\n\u201cThe influx of new entrants into the financial sector resulted in intense competition for\ncustomers between the new indigenous Zimbabwean banks and the old, orthodox banks, mainly\nforeign owned. However, the community did not benefit much from this competition, as the\npricing of banking products did not improve. Average lending rates increased from 12percent in\n1990 to 34.7 percent in 1997, while interest on three-month deposits rose from 10.3 percent to\n32.5 percent over the same period. In addition, when measured in terms of depth of products\nand services offered, the new banking institutions did not offer any innovative services, choosing\nto fight for space in the market for generic banking products, mainly deposit mobilization and\nlending to well established companies and individuals with high net worth. A lack of risk\nmanagement skills and weak corporate governance structures limited the capacity of new\ninstitutions to develop new structures. As a result the banking sector continued to serve its prime\nclients, leaving the SMEs and other marginalised sections of the community without access to\nfinancial services. (Chitambara et al (2011).\nThis example of how the poor benefitted fokkol11 from financial reforms that took place within\nthe framework of ESAP in the name of inclusive growth indicates how the roots of the financial\ndoldrums in which Zimbabwe found itself can be found in the imposition of the neoliberal\ntrajectory on Zimbabwe and the failure of its government to boldly the colonial, neo-colonial,\nracial and uneven nature of the economic structure head on right from the beginning. Instead of\nbold action the government resorted to using paying lip service to the land issue each election\ntime. When it became clear that the workers and the poor are tired of slogans and flag\nindependence, the government was forced to go the route of land redistribution, and\nindigenization, appropriated popular sentiments to project itself as an anti-colonial force in\norder to prop up its power. This happened at the time trade union movement was divided\nbetween a section that uncritically endorsed government agenda and a section that aligns itself\n10 South African slang for \u2018nothing\u2019\n11 Afrikaans word essentially meaning having nothing, being nothing, nothing left, literally \u201cfuck all\u201d\nwith a liberal bourgeosie opposition that tremendously failed to align itself on the side of the\nmasses, refused to support land repossession project. The MDC actually expelled \u2013International\nSocialist Organization (ISO)12 member - Gwisai Munyaradzi - who was then MP on the MDC\nticket \u2013 for pushing for MDC to support land redistribution agenda.\nThe absence of a strong, united and radical trade union movement and of a strong socialist\nmovement left the radical transformation agenda in the hands of the ruling Zanu PF who mostly\nused it as a vote-catching mechanism and as a means of patronage and self-enrichment of the\npolitical and social elite associated with Zanu PF rather than as a break with capitalism or\npractical search for a socialist alternative. The questions in this regard are: will the trade union\nmovement and broad working-class organizations in South Africa, choose the path of entrusting\nthe government with the radical economic agenda uncritically, or the path of making its distrust\nof government to take an dismissive and absenteeist posture or that of a critical support of the\ngovernment\u2019s RET trajectory, exploiting positive aspects thereof to articulate a socialist\nalternative, exposing and combatting attempts by the social, political elites to eat in the name of\ntransformation, and developing its own policy proposals and creating its own platforms and\nstrategies to pursue this goal rather than relying solely on government efforts and platforms?\nWhat can we learn from Zimbabwe in terms of transforming the white-dominated financial\nsector in South Africa in a manner that benefits all South Africans rather than create a few elite\nwho operates with the same profiteering logic of the white and\\or foreign owned financial\ncartels? Related to this question is the question of the meaning of national liberation and class\nstruggle in the South African context, specifically the extent to which formulating these as\ndiscrete questions that can be addressed in stages creates an ideological and political,\nphilosophical and practical dilemmas, and to what extent locating the RET within this paradigm\nraise questions.\nIn this regard there is a need to for the working class to critically on the extent to which there is a\nneed for critical review the notions such as national liberation, Colonialism of Special Types, the\nNational Democratic Revolution and the Native Republic Thesis which have always featured\nheavily in the dominant traditions within the liberation movement insofar as characterization of\nthe South African struggle is concerned. In his article, National Liberation: What significance,\nif any, for South Africa today? Leonard Gentle13 makes the point that though the land that is\ntoday still officially known as South Africa was a British colony up to the establishment of the\nSouth African state through the Act of the Union of 1910, the parties that negotiated settlement\nof 1994 were all South Africans unlike in Zimbabwe the Lancaster Agreement was between\nBritain and the liberation movements.\n12 The International Socialist Organization (ISO) is a revolutionary socialist organization in that identifies\nwith Trotskyism, Leninism, and the Marxist political tradition of \"socialism from below.\nHe therefore concludes that in South Africa \u2018national liberation\u2019 could not have meant the\nachievement of national independence from or secession from a colonial oppressor state in the\nstrict sense of the word. In response to this problematique of how to characterise apartheid state\nthe SACP coined the term Colonialism of a Special Type in the 1950s to describe the oppression\nof White minority rule as akin to colonialism, albeit with the colonizer not being a foreigner but\nan occupant. Such characterization amounted to regarding White South as settlers; a term\nlater associated more with the Pan Africanist Congress that split from the ANC in 1955. From\nthe 1960, partially because of the discomfort with the settler-colonial connotations and partly\nbecause of the influence of the two stage theory and the Black Republic thesis as propounded by\nthe USRR, the SACP and ANC used the concept of National Democratic Revolution (NDR) to\nexplain the character of the South African struggle. The gist of NDR was that the struggle is\nnational in form but democratic in context. This meant that the struggle should be conducted in\ntwo stages, respectively aimed at the goals of the attainment of liberation from colonial racial\noppression and the attainment of socialism. Flowing from this logic was the idea that the first\nstage that should lead to a Black Capitalist Republic shall be led by the Patriotic Front in the\nform of the African National Congress and the second that should lead to socialism shall be led\nby the South African Communist Party as the vanguard party. ( Gentle.2012). As late at 2010,\nthe General Secretary of the SACP, comrade Blade Nzimande asserted that the objective of the\nNDR has always been understood as the defeat of repressive and colonial regimes to build\npeople\u2019s democracies under the leadership of the motive forces, mainly the oppressed and\nexploited. He also stressed that such revolution may not be able to proceed to socialism\nimmediately in circumstances were the motive forces are not strong or conscious enough to\ndrive socialist revolution or where other objective factors pose a limitation to transition to\nsocialism.\nThis view is in harmony with the assertion of the ANC National Working Committee in 2009\nthat the NDR is called as such because its national and democratic tasks are aimed at dealing\nwith the political and socio-economic manifestations of apartheid colonialism and that\n13 Leonard Gentle is the former director of the International Labour and Research Information Group\n(ILRIG), an NGO that produces educational materials for activists in social movements and trade unions.\nHe has been an anti-apartheid activist for many years and has worked as an organizer for the South\nAfrican Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers' Union (SACCAWU), the National Union of\nMetalworkers of SA (NUMSA) and as an educator for the International Federation of Workers' Educational\nAssociations (IFWEA).\nWhile the motive forces strive to change the elements of the capitalist system in the interests of\nthe NDR, they have to manage the capitalist system in line with the main elements of its own\nlogic. In its Second Transition document of 1912, the ANC further amplified its strategic mechanism of\nmanaging the capitalist system in the interest of the NDR by arguing that the NDR requires a\nblack bourgeosie and should even appeal to sections of the white capital that are \u2018patriotic\u201d.\nGiven the points raised in this paper about the need to locate a revolutionary transformative\nagenda outside the logic, structures and regimes and regiments of capitalism, what are the\npossibilities of the NDR located within the framework of creatively harnessing capitalism in the\ninterest of democratization of the polity and economy transitioning into radical socio-economic\ntransformation, let alone socialism?\nWhat are the implications of pinning the hopes of the attainment of the objectives of the NDR\nand the possibilities of a second transition on liberal constitutionalism and creative management\nof capitalism? As Ari Sitas14 has observed, the dominant discourse within South Africa,\nparticularly within the tripartite alliance is not only that the post-apartheid dispensation is an\nunfinished National Democratic Revolution or a national democracy in the making, but also that\nan electoral or insurrectionary alternative is premature. (Sitas. 2012). The second transition\nconcept mooted by the ANC at its 2012 policy conference and subsequent policy positions as\nminor version of transition from the NDR Social Revolution is thin in details such as how it\noffers any substantial break with the political economy trajectory based on neoliberal\nmacroeconomic and the residualisation of social policy to safety-net aimed? What implication\ndoes the idea that since the ANC can directly access, reach and influence the working-class,\nurban and rural poor through local councilors and local branches, it does not need the mediation\nof the civics, has on the strategy of communists and progressive trade unions building socialism\nnow through the politics of encroachment and constructive criticism within the ruling party?\n(Sitas 2012). Gentle (2012) pose the following questions in relation to the NDR: \u201cWhat does\n\u2018national in form\u2019 means? \u201cWho is the South African nation? \u201cWhat did the liberation movement\nmean \u201cnational liberation? Gentle (2012) correctly probes the notion of national liberation by a\nreminding us that in terms of the notion of \u2018nation\u2019 , only White people were considered as the\nSouth African nation in the 1910 and that only white people made the decision in 1961 that\nSouth Africa should become a republic outside the British Commonwealth. One can add that\nBlack people were not included in the Ja\\Nee vote that was intend to gauge whether the SA\ngovernment of that time had the citizen\u2019s nod to pursue the negotiated settlements. This is\nprecisely because in terms of the apartheid lexicon and its systemic and institutional framework\nonly White people as a collective were perceived to constitute the South African nation, with\nBlack people as a collective perceived and portrayed as a collection of tribes. This the logic that\n14 Ari Sitas is a South African sociologist, writer, dramatist and civic activist. His publications include\nVoices that reason, Black Mamba Rising: South African Worker Poets in Struggle, William Zungu: A Xmas\nStory, Slave Trades, and Towards a Postcolonial Sociology?\ninformed the establishment of the Bantustan, urban townships sometimes segmented into Sotho\nsection; Nguni section etc and what was then called Radio Bantu; with tribal segmented radio\nstations, e.g Radio Sesotho, Radio Zulu, etc. It is in response to this apartheid notion of South\nAfrica as constituting of the White nation and a collection of tribal groups and the balkanization\nof the country along racial and tribal lines that the idea of a unitary democratic South Africa in\nwhich there is no whites or blacks, minorities or majorities but a single South African nation\npermeated the broader liberation movement. But to what extent can we say we have attained the\nnation-building part of the liberation project? Are there significant and noticeable steps toward\ndismantling and reconstructing the apartheid geography and antecedent structural and\ninstitutional arrangements beyond surface modification of the old society and renaming apartheid\nconstructed institutions without doing away with their racial and tribal constructions?\nTelling cases in this regard is how the housing and social infrastructure development\nprogramme of the post-1994 government has failed to challenge and reconstruct apartheid spatial\narrangements and the how the ghost of the 1951 Bantu Authorities Act is being resurrected in the\nform of a Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act where the Chiefs enjoy more\npowers than they did in the Bantustan regimes of the Nationalist Party, ( Giyosi 2012) often at\nthe expense of the rural poor, especially in places located in the former Transkei and former\nCiskei area. Another case in point is how we have simply renamed Radio Sesotho, Radio Zulu,\nand Radio Xhosa etc to Lesedi f.m, Ukhosi FM, Umhlobo Wenene without transforming them\ninto instruments of integration instead of tribally based institutions they essentially remain. The\nissues flagged raise the following questions: how far we are as country with the nation-building\nproject? What are there contrarieties within this nation-building project? To what extent has\nSouth Africa learnt from other countries in Africa about the pitfalls of national consciousness\nthat Fanon referred to? The questions about the meaning and relevance of national liberation and\nNDR in the current context are related to overall question about the class structure of South\nAfrica: What does the revolutionary agenda entail? Who are the motive forces? What kind of\nalliances and solidarities need to be built and what are the challenges and threats contained in\nsuch alliances? In this regard, it may be useful for the broader left to grapple with the following\nquestions posed by Gentle (2012):\n\u2026.when did South Africa shift from being a British colony and become something else\u2026.what is\nthat something else\u2026.and what was that \u201csomething else\u201d before 1994? And more importantly,\nwhat is that something else today? What is the character of the bourgeosie? And what is the\ncharacter of the working-class in South Africa? Is it simply a unified working class for which\nrace does not matter? What about the middle class? Does South Africa today still replicate the\nold divisions for access to the social surplus generated by the working-class? What strategies\nand tactics should the underclasses employ to win their goals \u2026and who is on the side of the\nunder-classes and who is against them?\nHow should the trade union movement and the working-class frame RET?\nPerhaps the best way for labour and working-class to answer the pertinent questions raised above\nis to locate RET within the historical-material roots and systemic and structural base of racial,\nclass and gender oppression in Southern Africa and South Africa in particular. A critical\nexamination of the roots of racial and class oppression in the global South and Southern Africa in\nparticular reveals an intersection between capitalism (classism), colonialism (imperialism) and\nracism and racial segregation. In order to deal with the crisis of the exhaustion of natural\nresources and the conflict between capital interests and labor and social demands, Capitalism in\nthe Nothern Hemisphere had to launch beyond geographic borders in search of raw resources and\ncheap labour.\nCapitalist colonial expansionism then had to enlist racism as moral justification expansionism of\nthe plunder of the lands and wealth of other people and the super exploitation of their labor\nthrough subjugation to subhuman working and living condition. The fact that colonialism and or\nimperialism conscripted racism as its moralizing doctrine logically resulted in colonial societies\nbeing based on structures of racial segregation. Emergent capitalism in Southern Africa enlisted\nthe pre-existing structures of racial segregation established by racism to fend cheap labor for\nitself through the proleteriazation of the African people, using the mechanisms of the forced\nlabor, In South Africa, the apartheid policies established by the National Party regime served to\ninstitutionalize the structures of racial segregation established by colonialism and expanded by\nracially-based capitalism. In his article on the South African political economy, Martin\nLegassick15 eloquently explains inextricable link between colonialism, capitalism and racism in\nthe context of South Africa.\nSouth Africa was formed through colonial conquest, by first the mercantile Dutch East India\nCompany from the mid-seventeenth century followed by the British from the early nineteenth\ncentury. From that time on colonialism resulted in racism, slavery, attempted genocide, the\nexpropriation of the land of indigenous people and the exploitation of their labour as forced\nlabour. Here lie the roots of national oppression. Full-blooded capitalism developed late in\nSouth Africa in comparison with Europe and the United States. The real impact of capitalism\n15 Martin Legassick (1940\u20132016) was a South African historian and Marxist activist. He died on 1 March\n2016 after a battle with cancer. He was one of the central figures in the \"revisionist\" school of South\nAfrican historiography that, drawing on Marxism, revolutionized the study of the social formation by\nhighlighting the importance of political economy, class contradictions and imperialism. He was also a key\nfigure in the independent left in South Africa from the 1970s, and a critic, from the left, of many of the\nanalytical and strategic positions taken by the African National Congress and the South African\nCommunist Party, as well as their understanding of South African history. The author of numerous books,\nmainly on the history of colonialism and capitalism, he collected many of his key political writings in the\n2007 Towards Socialist Democracy.\ncame only with the discovery of gold and diamonds, in the mineral revolution at the end of the\nnineteenth century, as the world economy was undergoing the transition to imperialism.\nDiamond and gold mines required large amounts of cheap labour. They used the pre-existing\nstructures of colonialism and racism and transformed them into structures of segregation to\ngenerate this supply as cheap black migrant labour, supervised by racially privileged white\nworkers. The ideology and structures of segregation prepared the way for the ideology and\nstructures of apartheid. Segregation and apartheid, therefore, served the interests of capitalism\nrather than merely the ideology of Afrikaner nationalism. (Legassick. Undated)\nThis account of the roots of national and class oppression indicates that the program of\ntransformation in South Africa must effectively be that of de-colonialization, socialisation and\nthe de-racialization and democratization of both the polity and the economy. While this implies\nthat redistribution, redress\\ restitution, reconstruction should be at the centre of social policy and\neconomic policy, it also means that South Africa must honestly address the difficult question\nposed by the Fallism movement: how possible is it to achieve redistribution, redress\\\nrestitution, reconstruction without brutally confronting the legacies, continuities and symbols of\nthe structures of colonialism, white supremacism and patriarchy? The argument that the decoloniality\nand intersectionality discourse presents before us is that de-racialising capital within\nthe precincts of colonial and neo-colonial structures is as cosmetic as de-colonization without a\nbreak with capitalism, patriarchy and related forms of social division, social exclusion and social\ndisenfranchisement ultimately amount to the ruling, corporate and social elites seating at the\ncapitalist table eating on behalf of everybody, while the underclasses as a whole, Black people in\nparticular, women and other marginalised sectors of society remain on the periphery, condemned\nto feasting on crumbs. It points to the fact that the task of the trade union movement and the\nworking-class has to be pushing the RET discourse beyond pursuing shared growth to\ndislocating the edifices of colonialism, capitalism, racism ad patriarchy. Patrick Bond (cited in\nLegassick. Undated) pointed to the need for the transformation agenda to highlight this historic\ntask of the working-class and their organization in his response Blade Nzimande\u2019s passionate call\nfor South Africa to go back to the RDP, to wealth redistribution, greater social spending, and\nheavy investment in infrastructure, together with policies that created long-term jobs and\nsustainable livelihoods for the majority. In a passionate plea made in to the Black Management\nForum, , Nzimande correctly asserted that growth alone, even if it reached 6%, wouldn\u2019t\nnecessarily translate into jobs. Where there was such a \u201chuge wealth gap\u201d, even growth of 10% a\nyear wouldn\u2019t help people without structural change.\nBond responded that Nzimande is right, but he needs to spell out clearly that this involves a\nstruggle to nationalize the commanding heights of the economy under workers\u2019 control and\nmanagement and that the strategy for inward-industrialisation to provide for the basic needs\noutlined in the RDP should lea inexorably to a strategy for workers\u2019 power, workers\u2019 control of\nthe economy, and workers\u2019 democracy. The argument raised by Patrick Bond16 point to the fact\nthat for the working-class Radical Economic Transformation, or revolutionary social, political\nand economic transformation will be superficial if it does not amount to development of a\nstrategy a strategy for workers\u2019 power, workers\u2019 control of the economy. In this regard, it may be\nuseful to quote at length, Simon Clarke,17 whose book, Keynesianism, monetarism, and the crisis\nof the state, influenced Bond\u2019s views expressed above:\n\u201cThe necessity of socialism has never been more urgent. The objective conditions for a\ndemocratic socialist society have never been more fully developed. The concentration and\ncentralization of capital has socialized production to an unprecedented degree. The computer,\nthrough which monetarism has been able to perfect the subordination of society to the alienated\nrule of money, provides the instrument that makes it possible to bring the complex apparatus of\nsocial production under democratic control. \u201cThere is no reason why socialism should not put\nitself back on the historical agenda, if only it can learn the lessons of its defeats. The\nfundamental lessons are three. First, the basis of socialism can only be the socialization of\nproduction. Only by bringing social production under social control can the contradictory\ntendencies of capitalist accumulation, that lead to the pauperization of growing masses of the\nworld population, to the intensification of class struggle, to wars and to recurrent crises, be\novercome. Second, socialism has to be internationalist. This is not dictated simply by the\ninternationalization of capital, for the crisis is unleashing nationalist political and ideological\nforces that counter such internationalization. It is more fundamentally a political imperative.\nNationalism is the supreme expression of the alienated form of the capitalist state, fetishing the\n\u2018illusory community\u2019 of the nation against the emerging unity of the \u2018real community\u2019 embodied\nin the collective organization of the working class. Third, socialism has to be democratic. This\ndoes not mean that socialism should confine itself within the limits of the formal democracy of\nthe capitalist state. The experience of state socialism and social democracy alike shows that the\nattempt to build socialism from above, on the basis of the illusory community of the capitalist\nstate and the formalism of its democratic processes, soon leads the state to confront the real\ncommunity of the democratic organizations of the working class as a barrier to socialism. The\nsocialization of production cannot be divorced from the question of the political forms of such\nsocialization\u201d (Clarke 1988)\nConclussions\n16 Patrick Bond (born 1961, Belfast, Northern Ireland) is professor of political economy at the University\nof the Witwatersrand Wits School of Governance. He was formerly associated with the University of\nKwaZulu-Natal, where he directed the Centre for Civil Society from 2004-2016. His research interests\ninclude political economy, environment, social policy, and geopolitics\n17 Simon Clarke (born 26 March 1946) is a British sociologist specialising in social theory, political\neconomy, labour relations, and the history of sociology. He has a particular interest in employment\nrelations in China, Vietnam, and the former-Soviet nations. He is Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the\nUniversity of Warwick.\nThe conclusions that can be drawn from the question raised in this paper with regard to (1) the\nconceptual and practical framework of RET, (2) the an analysis of the roots of national and class\noppression in South Africa and (3) the historic the task of the working-class is that genuine\nradical economic transformation has to result in an overarching change in patterns of ownership\nof the land, the major means of production and the commanding heights of the economy. It has\nto entail a move from private ownership to public ownership and state control of the land, the\nmajor means of production and the commanding heights of the economy and the socialisation of\nessential services such as water, energy, health, education, and transport. It also has to entail\ndoing away with a dis-embedded economy that is centred on the activities of private corporations\nand the state only without taking consideration of and capacitating other economic actors such as\nthe family, homebased economic and business activities, economic and business activities that\ntake place at the community level, in organizations, within the informal economy and in broader\nsociety. It has to take the form of re-embedding the economy in society and reinforcing the\nintersection between political democracy and economic democracy. It should be intertwined with\nthe creation of democratic worker control of production and workplace democracy and\ncommunity control of public institutions like schools, hospitals and clinics. True radical\ntransformation of the economy has to facilitate cooperative, collaborative and communal\nprocesses and structures of production, distribution and consumption.\nRadical economic transformation should go beyond economic reforms aimed at creating a Black\ncapitalist industrialist class. It should go beyond simply de-racialising the upper layer of the\ncapitalist structure but leaving the bottom structures the same, characterised by Black workingclass\nsuffering and White privilege. The way forward for labor and working-class organization\nwith in relation to the RET discourse can be summarized with one slogan: Resist, Mobilize,\nTransform! Resist both the ploys of capital to arrest the moves towards economic\ntransformation and the machinations of the Black capitalist and comprador bourgeoisie to turn\nRET into elitist project in which the rich and connected eat the nation\u2019s wealth in the name of\nand on behalf of the masses. Mobilize to build the strength, power and capacity of the forces of\nsocialist forces to fight and win battles at the shopfloor, at the boardrooms, on the street, in the\nparliament, etc. Unleash the force and power of the forces in all these platforms to push for\nsystemic, structural and institutional transformation. \n\nREFERENCES \nAshman, S, Fine B and Newman, S. 2011.

Ever-tightening margins in the UK dairy market were cited by the firm as its profits dipped, and it remains a long-term dilemma that shows no signs of going away. \n \nIn that regard the company\u2019s hopes to build a new dairy and research centre in Bridge of Allan would appear to be crucial to its growth aspirations. The plans, first lodged in 2015, are currently stuck in planning limbo, having initially been refused by Stirling Council before being referred to the Scottish Government reporter. \nGraham\u2019s will be hoping for a positive outcome soon. As well as allowing it to increase production volumes, managing director Robert Graham said the facility will give it the capacity to move into products which potentially offer higher margins. \nBeyond these shores, Graham\u2019s is encouraged by the fruits of its endeavours in the international arena.

spent two days visiting migrants in Calais and quickly came to the conclusion that British government policy is not working. A great deal of money has been spent on walls and fencing to keep migrants away from lorries. \nAn extra 1,200 police keep the estimated 400 to 500 migrants under close scrutiny and make boarding a lorry much more difficult. Yet this has just forced migrants into the hands of people smugglers paying to board lorries in Paris or Brussels or desperately trying to stowaway aboard a UK bound lorry. \nThe migrants receive no support from the local authority and are harassed by the police. Some move to Paris or elsewhere in France but nothing will force them back to their native land or crush their desire to come to the UK. \n \nA survey carried out earlier this year asked migrants why they did not want to seek asylum in France. \nSome 33 per cent felt unsafe in France; 21 per cent wanted to join family and friends elsewhere; and a further 23 per cent were put off by the treatment they had received in France. \nThey have no option but to live outdoors. They have no shelter from the weather. It is left to voluntary agencies such as Secours Catholique to supply food, clothing and sleeping bags. \nThe police remove tents, confiscate sleeping bags and have even tried to stop the aid agencies distributing food. \nAmong these migrants are unaccompanied minors. It had been hoped that the Dubs Amendment would enable 3,000 unaccompanied minors to come to the UK. Only a few hundred have been allowed in. \nLord Dubs had said \u201cThe way that unaccompanied refugee children are being treated in Europe is a disgrace. Governments must take action to ensure their safety\u201d. \nSadly, the treatment of minors in Calais remains a disgrace. \nThe Dublin III regulation allows those with close family in the UK to enter and have their asylum claim heard, although the process is very slow and cumbersome. \nWithout official assistance, it is left to voluntary agencies such as Safe Passage to help. \nIn Calais, I met a group of Ethiopians and Eritreans, orthodox Christians and deeply religious, welcoming and friendly. \nBrother Johannes from the Catholic Workers House was asked for a cross and he gave out rosary beads. \nAs we sat in front of a makeshift camp fire, on a bitterly cold morning, I was reminded that the people we label as \u201cmigrants\u201d, \u201crefugees\u201d or \u201casylum seekers\u201d are, first and foremost, our fellow human beings who should be treated with dignity, welcomed and given shelter as they wait for asylum. \nThe numbers in Calais are small compared to the worldwide refugee crisis and those who wish to come to the UK should be able to apply from Europe. \nThe British policy of doing all we can to reject these migrants demeans our country and undermines our humanity and the humanity of those in need. \nThe memory that I take with me from Calais is of the cold seeping into my bones as I stood on the street talking to migrants, followed by the relief that comes from going indoors and the warmth and heat. \nI left with feelings of sadness, guilt and shame. There was sadness that the migrants I left behind are without warm homes. \nIn addition, there was guilt, from knowing that an accident of birth left me privileged to live in the country they wish to enter. \nAnd there was shame, that my country was so unwilling to share that privilege with others.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "briti", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "johannes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubs", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "secours catholique", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic workers house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "calais", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:06.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e0408200d80128d63f5829ef5bc84d6758d0714", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog631sQyVFj_TRAub1WBI36GMajkO.Wai4hlZjOpLM4sK1ge6lv0A6uNrLf6bhNnPDxA--", "site_full": "community.comicbookresources.com", "site": "comicbookresources.com", "site_section": "http://community.comicbookresources.com/forumdisplay.php?15", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "painting", "sports", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "scuba_diving", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "X-Books", "title": "Would You Be Okay With Xenomorphs Replacing the Brood?", "title_full": "Would You Be Okay With Xenomorphs Replacing the Brood?", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4126, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f66692976072194814702fd129b5d55866a09de8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog631sQyVFj_TRAub1WBI36GMajkO.Wai4hlZjOpLM4sK1ge6lv0A6uNq6Wh9Iab10Qf9YhjqOdrRJ", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "JeanGreyForever", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I can't wait for a Disney/Marvel movie where Logan can refer to the sleazoids.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:06.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68db011710ba2c6b73e3a31986ba4285604bed9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibUEKmojPZsf1fwTnSMtkmkHnxXpIFzqI9fKaR0NG_ScJNPBQVaddFcLai4jKN.0-", "site_full": "www.f150forum.com", "site": "f150forum.com", "site_section": "https://www.f150forum.com/f12/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Maintenance Shop - Ford F150 Forum - Community of Ford Truck Fans", "title": "Winter detailing", "title_full": "Winter detailing - Ford F150 Forum - Community of Ford Truck Fans", "published": "2017-12-06T07:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33477, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13253b73a3bc60e94ddfe1896bbe8b64110f7760", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibUEKmojPZsf1fwTnSMtkmkHnxXpIFzqI9fKaR0NG_ScJNPBQVadd42TtYi_lxzB89cGHaOeUxejEAJlxZArR", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "idrive", "published": "2017-12-07T08:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : I was looking to see if anyone have ever detailed in temperatures below what products recommend...

Late on Tuesday evening, there was no indication that the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was hurrying to meet the Prime Minister. \nDavid Davis assured the DUP that Northern Ireland would not be \u201cleft behind\u201d in the single market and that \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d would apply across the UK post Brexit . This would also alleviate a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. \nBut will it? What will be aligned? It does not automatically mean remaining in the single market and customs union, does it? And will the four freedoms apply? \n \nHow will those aspects outwith the regulatory alignment be dealt with at the border between the UK and the EU and across the Irish \u201cdivide\u201d? And if the regulatory alignment is minimal in extent and other trade deals outwith in the \u201cwider world\u201d come into being, there will surely be \u201chard\u201d border checks of some description. And where the UK \u201cdiverges\u201d from the EU, how is that to be regulated at the \u201cborders\u201d? Messy. \nRegulatory alignment does not encompass everything and the EU said no cherry picking is to be allowed especially for passporting financial services. Or was Mr Davis making it up as he was placating his MPs? So a degree of \u201chardness\u201d is inevitable. Labour and the Tories and the DUP are firm on leaving the single market and customs union. \nAlthough Labour is beginning to soften, yet nothing official or definitive has come from Jeremy Corbyn , who seems to have gone silent. That red line cannot be got round other than with full compliance in line with the Norwegian model. Regulatory alignment is a smokescreen. The devil is in the detail. One can see the EU walking away in frustration and leaving Westminster to World Trade Organisation mayhem. \nJohn Edgar, \n4 Merrygreen Place, \nStewarton. \nIT is time for those negotiating Brexit to sit down around the table and decide what requirements are essential for the UK in the post-Brexit world. If these conditions are acceptable to the EU then these prerequisites will determine what subsidiary conditions must apply. \nIt appears that the first requirement is that the UK should leave the EU (\u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d) while the second is that there should be no hard border in Ireland and that the same conditions should apply in Northern Ireland as in the rest of the UK. \nConsequently, we have no option but to agree that the UK should leave the EU and remain in the single market and customs union. \nAt present, we have only had a referendum which has determined that we leave the EU. If the consequences of the need to maintain an open Irish border are unacceptable then there has to be another referendum. \nSince Northern Ireland does not have a land border with the rest of the UK, the electorate in the province could, at the same time, be asked if they wish to remain within the single market and customs union if the rest of the UK decides not to do so. \nSandy Gemmill, \n40 Warriston Gardens, \nEdinburgh . \nIT is time to stop this Brexit shambles as Article 50 can still be revoked. \nAll it needs is a Labour leadership that has, instead, been whipping its MPs to support a hard Brexit, against a customs union and single market. \nUnlike Ruth Davidson , Nicola Sturgeon has been the only leader in the UK with a consistent and coherent Brexit plan as outlined in Scotland \u2019s Place in Europe, with minimal damage to the UK and Scottish economies along the lines of the Norway position. \nMs Davidson is putting DUP interests ahead of Scotland\u2019s vote to remain and specifically opposes a deal that protects Scotland\u2019s businesses and economy. \nOn Monday, all of the Scottish Tories voted in the House of Commons to allow Westminster\u2019s power-grab over 100 devolved policy. \nThese include powers over farming support, fisheries, fracking , genetically modified crops, railway franchising, cooperation between Scotland\u2019s justice system and EU counterparts and environmental regulations. \nNot one opposition amendment was accepted but it is not too late for the UK Government to make the necessary amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill to respect the devolution settlement. \nScotland\u2019s share of the UK\u2019s Brexit bill will remove \u00a34.25 billion from our budget over 10 years, which is much greater than the \u00a3600 million to \u00a31.5bn over a decade that the No campaign told us would be the \u201cunaffordable\u201d independence transition \ncosts. \nWith support for independence standing at 47 per cent, Theresa\\ May will want to avoid another Scottish referendum but she needs to come up with a bespoke customs union and single market deal for Scotland on similar lines to the one she has been striving to secure for Ireland. \nMary Thomas, \nWatson Crescent, \nEdinburgh. \nI BELIEVE that Ed Archer (Letters, December 4) is being extremely optimistic if he believes that useful reform of the EU could occur should the UK decided to ditch Brexit and work for change from within. \nMargaret Thatcher negotiated a rebate for the UK in the 1980s. Tony Blair sacrificed a significant proportion of this in anticipation of improvements in the Common Agricultural Policy. I think we\u2019re still waiting. \nIn the run up to the referendum campaign, then prime minister David Cameron and his government ministers made several trips to various European cities to meet European national political leaders and EU functionaries, all of whom, we were assured, shared that government\u2019s views of the need for structural and functional reform of the EU. \nOnly they didn\u2019t, and eventually all Mr Cameron had to show were a few trivial concessions that were related to peripheral issues. \nEven these were grudgingly offered and could be rescinded at the whim of the relevant EU governing bodies. \nThere are a number of Balkan nations in negotiations to join the EU in the not too distant future. \nThey will all be supplicants for cash, and I fear that our chances of seeking reform in the future will be even less than they are now. \nChristopher W Ide, \n25 Riverside Road, \nWaterfoot, \nEast Renfrewshire.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "davidson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john edgar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watson crescent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy gemmill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewarton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed archer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruth davidson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicola sturgeon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony blair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy corbyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret thatcher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher w ide", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "house of commons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic unionist party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east renfrewshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world trade organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merrygreen place", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dup", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brexit theresa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warriston gardens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waterfoot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riverside road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:08.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "71f9fdf1cfc79232006991b94f6d9b4d8501cf23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey8rOYbyPJtMOjVtAapd0klnuO7s_GINPM87Y9LfQJ4A9J99ubpApuBf", "site_full": "forums.wynncraft.com", "site": "wynncraft.com", "site_section": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/forums/trade-market.71/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Trade Market | Wynncraft Forums", "title": "Selling -

One such scene involves Prince Philip, on a visit to Stephen Ward, osteopath to the A-list, hearing about a weekend party he is organising. \nPhilip spies a picture on the mantelpiece. \u201cThat\u2019s Christine,\u201d says Ward. \u201cShe\u2019ll be there and Mandy will be there too.\u201d When years later the Profumo scandal breaks, writer Peter Morgan, still exercising his dramatist\u2019s licence to thrill, has Philip telling the Queen he never took up Ward\u2019s invitation. \nThat the show should try to tie Philip, however tangentially or fictitiously, to the Profumo affair shows the mesmerising allure of the scandal even after all these years. If there was ever any doubt about this, the reaction to the death this week of \u201cChristine\u201d, Christine Keeler, has wiped it away like dust from an old photograph. \n \nWith the demise of a 75-year-old woman in a hospital in Kent we are suddenly back in 1963 again. Cue minister of war Profumo arriving at the Commons where he will lie about the affair. Cue West End good time girls Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies flitting to and from court. Cue pictures of the Russian naval attache, cue Harold Macmillan humiliated, cue Keeler in a swimsuit \u2026 We know the story so well it has acquired the status of a repeat. The Great Escape might only show at Christmas but the Profumo affair is always with us. \nLest a film, a play, books, and documentaries have not been enough, there is a new six-part BBC drama, The Trial of Christine Keeler, out next year. Its writer, Amanda Coe, describes the story as \u201cthe Salem Witch Trial meets OJ Simpson \u2013 a perfect storm of gender, class, race and power that resonates into the world we\u2019re living in today\u201d. \nKeeler cashed in on her own story of course, many times. Yet in any settlement of accounts for the Profumo affair, she remained firmly in the column of those who lost out badly. She did not seek refuge in a life of charitable works like Profumo (who was awarded a CBE a decade later), or find escape in suicide, like Ward. Keeler took a spectacular dive into infamy only to find no-one had filled the swimming pool. \nThough she tried to start again \u2013 new name, marriages, children, a succession of low-paid jobs \u2013 she was never able to escape the shadow cast by Profumo. The shame initially heaped on her head stayed with her for life. She became that dreadful thing, a cautionary tale. As her son, Seymour, put it: \u201cShe earned her place in British history but at a huge personal price.\u201d \nIt was telling that the reaction to news of Keeler\u2019s death has been largely sympathetic. Finally, we seem to have grown up, seeing Ms Keeler for what she was: a young woman, just 19 when she met Profumo, who fell in with a crowd of men who were older and vastly more powerful than herself, and who used her for their own ends. \nViewed from that angle, the whole Swinging Sixties scene, the benefits of which only seem to have been available to a handful of those and such of those, were a sham in which the new bosses were the same as the old bosses \u2013 men. We would never put up with such an obscene imbalance of power today, would we? We would never allow rich, powerful, badly behaving men to break young women like so many butterflies on a wheel, would we? \nThose last inquiries, lest there be any doubt, should be played out against a background of hollow laughter. For we know with the Weinstein scandal, and the many more people who have come forward with allegations (mostly women, but men too), that the power gap was never closed. Despite time and legislation passing, it continued, just as before. \nIf anything, it was easier for the less powerful in the Profumo Affair, Ms Keeler and Ms Rice-Davies, to have their say. The age of deference was on its way out, helped by a bold, voracious press. The story broke relatively quickly, and thereafter there was no holding it back. \nContrast this with how long the lid appears to have been kept on the allegations surfacing today. Consider, too, the ways in which alleged victims were ostracised, silenced by threats of legal action, or by fear they would not be believed. The New York Times, which has led the way on Weinstein, produced fresh revelations yesterday about what it called the workings of his \u201ccomplicity machine\u201d staffed by \u201cenablers, silencers and spies\u201d. \nAll of which makes the fightback of 2017, a year defined by scandal as surely as 1963, seem even more incredible, bordering on miraculous. Several things have made the difference in helping the previously powerless take on Goliath. First and foremost has been the bravery of those who have come forward. Next is the crucial part played by social media. Being able to get the story out there, to ask for support, to feel that safety in numbers, heartened those who came forward first and encouraged others to follow. \nThe old dead-tree media played its part too, piling time, money, and energy into taking on those who had too often been able to shut down inquiry with the threat of legal action. \nLet us not get too carried away at how far we have come, however. As you may have noticed, the backlash is already here. It has started small, with a series of half-baked apologies peppered with words like \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d and \u201cmissteps\u201d, that make you wonder if the person saying sorry is genuinely contrite, or just sorry they were called out. Add to this the number of people, women often to the fore, who are questioning what all the fuss is about, and it is clear that there is a long way to go before those scales of power are anywhere close to being balanced. \nAs for Ms Keeler, she is the last of the main Profumo cast to depart. The story will never go away, but as reaction to her death has shown, it can be viewed differently, smaller voices can be picked out from the din. \n\u201cWe are all very proud of who she was,\u201d said her son. I hope, in the end, she came close to feeling the same.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christine keeler", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alison rowat", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "christine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandy rice-davies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oj simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice-davies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keeler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "profumo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harold macmillan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amanda coe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seymour", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "profumo affair", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kent", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:09.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05133812b2be5c0faeac8639c36eaf3524c45459", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rDNjs.ZgPA8LiczEw6rULSk2cyMUrSLQcfyv2.D6bdy947tD4phChlMqtrm2D8LWa7FsaaTsvn11VTW1QGO1ELIFpNuvV0I.LNd_AEhA2hGTuREgJOYF5IFYXmIuf_Lm", "site_full": "quench.me", "site": "quench.me", "site_section": "http://quench.me/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "cocktails_beer"], "section_title": "Quench Magazine", "title": "Mark Perrier of Osteria Savio Volpe in Vancouver, BC: Mav Chefs 2017", "title_full": "Mark Perrier of Osteria Savio Volpe in Vancouver, BC: Mav Chefs 2017", "published": "2017-12-06T17:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ME", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://quench.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mark-Perrier-Photo-Credit-Allison-Kuhl.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05133812b2be5c0faeac8639c36eaf3524c45459", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rDNjs.ZgPA8LiczEw6rULSk2cyMUrSLQcfyv2.D6bdy947tD4phChlMqtrm2D8LWa7FsaaTsvn11VTW1QGO1ELIFpNuvV0I.LNd_AEhA2hGTuREgJOYF5IFYXmIuf_Lm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lisa Hoekstra", "published": "2017-12-06T17:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mark Perrier of Osteria Savio Volpe in Vancouver, BC: Mav Chefs 2017", "text": "By Lisa Hoekstra / Mavericks / December 6th, 2017 / 1 \nEvery year, Quench profiles Canadian chefs who are contributing that elusive something to the food scene, helping to change it, helping it to evolve. This year\u2019s lineup is (often unintentionally) helping to define Canadian cuisine, which is no mean feat. Mark Perrier of Osteria Savio Volpe in Vancouver takes Italian cuisine back to its purely local origins, transforming traditional Italian dishes into meals you can only find in Canada. \nPerrier started out in forestry \u2014 he got his BSc from the University of British Columbia \u2014 but took a sharp turn into Vancouver\u2019s Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts, graduating at the top of his class. After years of working in upscale French kitchens, Perrier needed a break from the restaurant biz for a bit. He spent two-and-a-half years at Two Rivers Specialty Meats, mastering whole-animal butchery. All of this drive pushed him towards one goal \u2014 to run his own kitchen \u2014 which he does as Osteria Savio Volpe. If you\u2019re looking for uncomplicated fare, look no further. Simply prepared vegetables. Fruit picked at the height of the season. Handmade pastas, cured meats and whole grilled fish. None of these descriptors truly shout \u201cItalian,\u201d but they are, especially after Perrier gets his hands on them. But they\u2019re also truly Canadian \u2014 every ingredient used in his menu comes from the soil, trees, waters and farms of Vancouver and the surrounding area. How did you go from a BSc in forestry to being a chef? \nI was lucky enough to grow up in a family in which my mother cooked dinner every night. Nothing fancy, but always made from scratch with good ingredients. She made her own bread and canned in the summer. I always loved eating but never really cooked anything until second-year university when I moved out of residence and had to fend for myself. I started messing around in the kitchen and trying to figure out how I was going to feed myself while at school and realized that I had a knack for making food that tasted good. Soon enough, I was spending more time worrying about what to cook for dinner than my forestry studies. As soon as I graduated, I enrolled in cooking school. Has your BSc in forestry influenced how you operate Savio Volpe? \nI grew up hunting, fishing and camping in the Interior of the province so I\u2019ve always had a close relationship with the natural world. More than anything else, my connection to nature influences my decisions when it comes to operating Savio Volpe in the most environmentally sustainable manner possible. What is the style you\u2019re going for and how do you achieve it? \nMy cooking style \u2014 and the food I make at Savio Volpe \u2014 is largely influenced by traditional Italian peasant cooking, la cucina povera . I cook Italian food from \u201chere\u201d \u2014 meaning Vancouver. I take the very best products available locally and prepare them in an Italian way, using traditional Italian techniques and restraint. We buy the best ingredients and do as little as possible to them to get them on the plate. To me, rustic food is cooked unpretentiously and in a way that honours the true, unadulterated spirit of the ingredient. A perfect example of this philosophy is our whole suckling pig, which is cooked on a spit over an apple wood fire, served with its crackling, dripping roast potatoes and cipollini onions, and a fresh salsa verde. What is the \u201clocal perspective\u201d and how does it change the traditional Italian dish? \nI believe that, at its core, Italian cuisine is hyper-local. To simply copy a dish from Italy and try to recreate here in Vancouver is not only impossible \u2014 we have a unique climate and access to different ingredients \u2014 but it wouldn\u2019t be adhering to cooking in the true spirit of the cuisine. You need to cook the very best of what is available where you are, and prepare it with an Italian spirit. I\u2019m not Italian, did not grow up eating this type of food and have never been there so how could I cook \u201cauthentic\u201d Italian food? When I use terms like \u201crustic\u201d and \u201csimple\u201d to describe the cooking that we do at Savio Volpe, I see these as virtues. Have you developed a sense of the essence of Canadian cuisine? If so, in your opinion, what is it? \nOutside of Quebec and parts of the East Coast, I don\u2019t feel that there\u2019s really anything you could call a Canadian cuisine, except maybe Kraft Dinner! Our country is too new; we\u2019re from too many places across the globe and came of age in the modern world. Traditional cuisines in other parts of the world developed slowly over hundreds of years because of isolation and cultures trying to make the most out of limited scarce resources. For a large portion of our history, there has been an abundance in variety of ingredients, travel between different geographic areas has become common and ingredients are shipped out of season from everywhere to everywhere. Canada is a multicultural country with a varied landscape and our cuisine reflects that diversity. You worked as a butcher at Two River Meats. Has this changed how you approach preparing meats? \nI thought I was pretty good a breaking down whole animals when I first got to Two Rivers, but soon realized that I knew nothing compared to the guys there. They were experienced machines, and I had to work very hard just to keep up. Almost all the meat at Savio Volpe comes into the restaurant as a whole animal (lamb, chicken, rabbit, all fish, squab, game birds, pigs, wild boar), halves (in the case of veal) or large primals (our beef is dry aged as long loins). Sourcing animals in this way has had a huge influence on the menu. We have to think creatively: How are we going to sell the pig skin, head and feet? What about the lamb offal? The fat off the dry-aged beef? The restaurant pays for the whole animal so we need to learn how to make money out of it. This is a much more interesting, challenging and rewarding way to cook compared to buying pre-cut steaks and chicken breasts. Savio Volpe doesn\u2019t have too many cocktails or \u201cfussy\u201d drinks \u2014 why choose this direction and how does your drinks list play into/complement the food you serve? \nIn my opinion, you cannot eat Italian food without wine \u2014 they are inseparable. We focus on developing a curated wine list and offer a few simple cocktail options, such as the Negroni or Aperol Spritz. For me, cocktails are for getting drunk, not for pairing with a meal. \nRabbit Cacciatore with Pine Mushrooms \nServes 4 to 6 \n1 whole rabbit (substitute chicken if you prefer) Salt and pepper, to taste 2 bay leaves", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "osteria savio volpe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark perrier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa hoekstra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "savio volpe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mavericks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific institute of culinary arts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perrier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quebec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "negroni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:09.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a8705d5295bd207e6a5d7a7bae562f975d8d2391", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTc3Wt6gO_FFgz6vufddClL9hPd2iHGvKLf.Pl0pPm2mVqy3J8xq_i2tqeQ5XTf9xM1xoydbDM0nQI1ykG_hDYq4d9pPbQSVwInDszrxN6S18E-", "site_full": "www.heraldscotland.com", "site": "heraldscotland.com", "site_section": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/rss/", "site_categories": ["media", "climbing", "sports"], "section_title": "HeraldScotland | Opinion", "title": "Obituary - Johnny Hallyday, French rock icon", "title_full": "Obituary - Johnny Hallyday, French rock icon | HeraldScotland", "published": "2017-12-07T12:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7151113/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a8705d5295bd207e6a5d7a7bae562f975d8d2391", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTc3Wt6gO_FFgz6vufddClL9hPd2iHGvKLf.Pl0pPm2mVqy3J8xq_i2tqeQ5XTf9xM1xoydbDM0nQI1ykG_hDYq4d9pPbQSVwInDszrxN6S18E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "heraldscotland.com", "published": "2017-12-07T12:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "Obituary - Johnny Hallyday, French rock icon", "text": "French rock icon \nBorn: June 15, 1943; \nDied: December 6, 2017 \n \nJOHNNY Hallyday, who has died aged 74, was an icon of French music and a singer heavily influenced by American rock music and Elvis Presley in particular who sold more than 110 million records. He may not have cracked the English-speaking market - something which was a source of frustration to him - but in his homeland, his fame could not have been bigger. He was France's Elvis and for decades the country's biggest rock n roll star. \nFrom the start, Hallyday's act was about the stars he remembered seeing as a child: Elvis of course, but Chuck Berry too and Buddy Holly. Many of his songs were French versions of English-language hits but his style was pure Americana too, right down to the glitter, gravelly voice and his distinctly un-French-sounding stage name. \nHe was born in Paris on June 15, 1943, during the Second World War with a less glamorous name, Jean-Philippe Smet. His parents had separated by the end of the year and it was not a happy childhood. \nBy the age of nine, he was already performing and was instantly inspired when he saw Elvis Presley's 1957 film Loving You. He gave his first professional concert in 1960, under the name Johnny, and put out his first album a year later. \nBy 1962, he had met the woman who would be his wife for years, and remained his friend to the end, singing star Sylvie Vartan. That year, he also made an album in Nashville, Tennessee, and rubbed shoulders with American singing greats. \nHallyday sang some of his songs in English, including Hot Legs and House of the Rising Sun, the melody of which was also used for one of his most famous songs, the 1964 Le Penitencier. And there was a real American connection: American singer Lee Ketchman gave him his first electric guitar. \nWith his square-jawed good looks and piercing blue eyes, Mr Hallyday was often sought-out for the cinema, playing in French director Jean-Luc Godard's Detective and with other illustrious directors including Costa-Gavras. \nMore recently, Hallyday had appeared in Johnnie To's Vengeance and had talked about giving film a bigger role in his life. \nHowever, it was the rocker's sentimental life, and his marriage to the model Laeticia Boudou that gave him a mellow edge. He spoke lovingly of his daughters Jade and Joy, who were adopted from Vietnam. \nHe was made a Chevalier of the Legion D'Honneur by President Jacques Chirac in 1997. \nHe is survived by Laeticia, their daughters, Jade and Joy, and by his two other children David and Laura.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "johnny hallyday", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "laeticia boudou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elvis presley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elvis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sylvie vartan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee ketchman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacques chirac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laeticia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hallyday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-luc godard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck berry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-philippe smet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "buddy holly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "costa-gavras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vietnam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nashville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:09.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f49947a381fb319c8c4aa415f8bd3bfc1efa831", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTK9tbdQ_2Ov5x0JjBZKZG1CW6MPn31sk0OhzDKdK345zWzdiFsumy_z812gFl07Oc-", "site_full": "forum.odroid.com", "site": "odroid.com", "site_section": "https://forum.odroid.com/viewforum.php?f=61", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "ODROID \u2022 View forum -

On the eve of Human Rights Day, they called for a new approach that will put improvement of the human rights situation and specifically an end to executions and torture at the center of any EU\u2019s relation with Tehran Editoral 07/12/22017 \n. \nThe MEPs rejected as fanciful the notion of \u201cmoderation\u201d by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, and called for Tehran to be held accountable for its nefarious regional conduct and ballistic missile program. Gerard Deprez (ALDE, Belgium) and Chairman of Friends of a Free Iran Inter-Parliamentary Group (FOFI) at European Parliament, said that Iran\u2019s human rights violations have gone unanswered for nearly 38 years. He called particular attention to the massacre of over 30,000 political prisoners, mostly from the People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), in the summer of 1988. Deprez criticized EU foreign policy chief  Federica Mogherini for excessive focus on the 2015 nuclear deal and for encouraging Western companies to go to Iran. EU must not compromise and must not stay silent on human right, said Ryszard Czarnecki (ECR, Poland) and Vice-President of the European Parliament. In his view,  \u201cas long as executions continue in Iran, as long as freedom of speech is repressed in Iran, as long as religious minorities including Christians and Sunni Muslims are repressed in Iran, we cannot and we must not have a normal relation with this regime.\u201d Maryam Rajavi standing next to the members of Friends of a Free Iran Inter-Parliamentary Group (FOFI) at European Parliament. \u201cIn recent years, we were somewhat soft on our principles and values and made compromises that we should not have made\u201d, declared   Pavel Teli\u010dka  (ALDE, Czech Republic) and Vice-President of the European Parliament. He stressed that during the EU delegation\u2019s visit to Iran, 18 people were executed: \u201cthat was a punch to us and that means that we are collaborators\u201d. The MEPs expressed their support for the Iranian resistance and Maryam Rajavi, the President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, the coalition of Iranian democratic opposition movements. During the meeting, Maryam Rajavi said there are growing signs of the popular desire for regime change in Iran, and the regime\u2019s solution has been more suppression and more executions as well as stepping up its meddling abroad. She warned that this policy does not reflect the regime\u2019s strength but its deep internal crisis which it tries to cover up by expanding its influence in the region. Indeed, it seeks to put up a hollow show of force to discourage the international community from adopting a decisive and firm policy against it. According to Maryam Rjavi, as long as the international community fails to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its destructive behavior, the mullahs will carry on with their dangerous adventures. The Iranian opposition leader said the EU can play a positive role in peace and stability in the Middle East and as such should hold the Iranian regime accountable for its crimes against the people of Iran and particularly for the massacre in 1988. It should demand immediate expulsion of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its proxies from Syria and other countries in the region, as well as an immediate halt to the regime\u2019s ballistic missile program. Failure to comply with these demands should result in severe sanctions on the regime\u2019s oil exports and loss of access to the international banking system. Struan Stevenson, President of the European Iraqi Freedom Association (EIFA), pointed out that EIFA had recently published a 25-page report which details the extensive links between the Iranian regime and Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda and Daesh. Stevenson represented Scotland in the European Parliament from 1999 until his retirement in 2014. He also served as President of the Parliament\u2019s Delegation for Relations with Iraq from 2009 to 2014. \u201cDuring the Soviet era, communists around the world were divided into a multitude of factions like Marxists, Leninists, Trotskyists and Maoists. They disagreed and fought with each other constantly. But ultimately, they all regarded Moscow as the Godfather of international communism,\u201d the former Conservative MEP said in Wednesday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\\\u201cThe same applies to Islamic fundamentalism today. They are split into a thousand factions, like the Taliban, al-Qaeda, Daesh, Boko Haram, Hezbollah and other terrorist groups and they all fight like cats in a sack. But they all look to Tehran as the Godfather of fundamentalist Islam. Just as the collapse of the Soviet Union saw the virtual end of aggressive communist expansionism, so the collapse of the mullah\u2019s regime will bring an end to the spread of Islamist terror across the globe.\u201d Stevenson concluded: \u201cFor those of us who hold human rights dear, we have to support the Iranian resistance under the leadership of Mrs Maryam Rajavi and the only legitimate democratic opposition movement, the PMOI/NCRI, to liberate the beleaguered Iranian people, who ache and pray for the removal of this corrupt and evil regime and the restoration of human rights, women\u2019s rights, freedom, justice and democracy to their long-suffering nation.\u201d Next week, the European Parliament will debate a resolution on Iran nuclear deal in Strasbourg plenary. \nSOURCE: http://www.vocaleurope.eu/ahead-strasbourg-debate-on-nuclear-deal-meps-strongly-criticize-eus-policy-on-iran-and-call-for-focus-on-human-rights/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maryam rajavi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "struan stevenson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerard deprez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deprez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pavel teli\u010dka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hassan rouhani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryszard czarnecki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boko haram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stevenson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federica mogherini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryam rjavi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national council of resistance of iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hezbollah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "free iran inter-parliamentary group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "people\u2019s mojahedin organization of iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament\u2019s delegation for relations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taliban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "revolutionary guard corps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european iraqi freedom association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eifa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strasbourg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soviet union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:09.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eadd137ba41296ec2a90f5f77b0b1b203253afb7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTc3Wt6gO_FFgz6vufddClL9pCs1TPSDCBFc7nGHy47.teEyY2stfTKE4iVi7p9tlJYgpap.6CkMgUISFgQ9krjPaCkVv.Sn1tPQ4CP5sbfT212MBahsR0dimRDALzFKb_GCQ4bvS.kL2M-", "site_full": "www.heraldscotland.com", "site": "heraldscotland.com", "site_section": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/rss/", "site_categories": ["media", "climbing", "sports"], "section_title": "HeraldScotland | Opinion", "title": "Herald View: Life is only going to get harder for first-time buyers", "title_full": "Herald View: Life is only going to get harder for first-time buyers | HeraldScotland", "published": "2017-12-07T03:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7150711/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fc59acefe16a08d0e9e2f349029bf2c8da5e77f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTc3Wt6gO_FFgz6vufddClL9pCs1TPSDCBFc7nGHy47.teEyY2stfTKE4iVi7p9tlJYgpap.6CkMgUISFgQ9krjPaCkVv.Sn1tPQ4CP5sbfT212MBahsR0dimRDALzFKb_G9AthLLkEVoMTldr.FMO.TA--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Michael Lloyd", "published": "2017-12-07T15:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "What a confused editorial.

According to the company\u2019s figures, the average deposit needed for first-time buyers in Glasgow is \u00a321,876; in Edinburgh it is \u00a337,661; and in London it is a staggering \u00a3139,987. Even in a country used to rising house prices, those are pretty extraordinary figures. \nBut it gets worse. Despite everything we should have learned from the credit crunch \u2013 which was caused in a large part by an out-of-control housing market \u2013 deposits are going to carry on rising. The projection by L&C Mortgages is that within ten years, first-time buyers will need to raise almost \u00a360,000 if they are in Edinburgh and in London the figure will have risen to \u00a3244, 842. A quarter of a million pounds and that\u2019s just the deposit. \nOne of the main reasons we ended up here is our obsession with home ownership over other options. In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher fed the obsession by introducing right-to-buy which reduced the stock of social housing. Private rental, which is typically short-term, is also a poor alternative for many people, particularly families with children. And with low interest rates, the cost of a mortgage still compares favourably to long-term rent. \n \nBut, with house prices continuing to rise, how are first-time buyers expected to be part of this so-called home-owning revolution? Saving for a large deposit is extremely hard if not impossible for most people, particularly with interest rates low and wages stagnating. Some people will rely on their parents, but not everyone has a mum and dad that can afford to help. \nThe over-heated nature of the market also makes it hard for first-time buyers. Typically, a house will be advertised as \u201coffers over\u201d which means that, not only does a first-time buyer have to raise the deposit, they have to pay a large amount over the asking price. It is hard to see how first-time buyers get anywhere at all, particularly in a market like Edinburgh\u2019s. \nUndoubtedly, the Help to Buy scheme has made a bit of a difference. The Scottish Government should also look at copying the UK Government\u2019s move to exempt first-time buyers south of the border from stamp duty on the first \u00a3300,000 of the purchase price. The First Minister says a tax break on purchases up to \u00a3175,000 would be enough, given lower house prices in Scotland , but perhaps Ms Sturgeon should look again at some of the prices of houses in the country\u2019s hot spots. \nA big increase in the number of affordable houses would also help. The Scottish Government says it will deliver at least 50,000 affordable homes by 2021, but there must be questions over whether that is achievable. Where will the land come from, and where will the money come from? The hope must be that more homes would make life easier, but even 50,000 isn\u2019t going to change the economic fundamentals. Sadly, for first-time buyers, they are still stacked high against them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "margaret thatcher", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "l&c mortgages", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:10.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b974e62ae7d39fa49115c206a73d58f7f66b961a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnEGQuRJelwbY-", "site_full": "www.blowoutforums.com", "site": "blowoutforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.blowoutforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=34", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "NON-SPORTS BUY/SELL/TRADE -

The current level of the shares currently stands at 240.00 at the time of writing. \nSAR stands for stop and reverse and it is a trend following indicator, designed to identify the turning point in price action. The parabolic SAR is shown on the charts as a series of small \u2018dots\u2019 that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. \nWhen the share price closes above the upper Parabolic SAR, a trader could interpret a buy signal. The Parabolic SAR will move from being above price to below price and the trader would cover any existing short positions and reverse direction and buy long. \nWhen the price closes below the lower Parabolic SAR, a trader could interpret a sell signal. The Parabolic SAR will move from being below price to above price and the trader would sell any existing long positions and reverse direction and go short. \nInvestors may be trying to get an edge by following current technical levels for Mckay Securities Plc (MCKS.L). In terms of Moving Averages, the 50-day is 225.62, the 200-day is at 222.65, and the 7-day is 234.66. Using a longer term moving average such as the 200-day may help block out the noise and chaos that is sometimes created by daily price fluctuations. In some cases, MA\u2019s may be used as strong reference points for finding support and resistance levels. Employing the use of the moving average for technical equity analysis is still highly popular among traders and investors. The moving average can be used as a reference point to assist with the discovery of buying and selling opportunities. \nMckay Securities Plc (MCKS.L)\u2019s   14 day Williams %R currently sits at 0.00. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would point to an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would signal an oversold situation. The Williams %R was developed by Larry Williams. This is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. \nMckay Securities Plc (MCKS.L) currently has   138.23. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \nCurrently, the 14-day ADX for Mckay Securities Plc (MCKS.L) is sitting at 27.54. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would identify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would lead to an extremely strong trend. ADX is used to gauge trend strength but not trend direction. Traders often add   to identify the direction of a trend. \nThe RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a widely used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility.

A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. After a recent check, the 14-day RSI is currently at 58.86, the 7-day stands at 61.96, and the 3-day is sitting at 72.63. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sar privacy policy mckay securities plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mckay securities plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kay securities plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:10.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "183dfd58deee116cfc890bf3d13aa5a8bcdd4535", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApurniITeHCjMyVh9lUJY13II8Eade7PdFle4Una58F.qRCFPrq8cSb2vs7FUxVsbx4mSvb73zutBx06pbi5EqRxr1EWa0wIy5g-", "site_full": "maliquidhitz.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://maliquidhitz.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "MALIQUIDHITZ", "title": "NEW MUSIC: BELOBAZAILE FT BAKILY- Naupenda Mziki |Mp3 Download", "title_full": "NEW MUSIC: BELOBAZAILE FT BAKILY- Naupenda Mziki |Mp3 Download", "published": "2017-12-07T12:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "TZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "183dfd58deee116cfc890bf3d13aa5a8bcdd4535", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApurniITeHCjMyVh9lUJY13II8Eade7PdFle4Una58F.qRCFPrq8cSb2vs7FUxVsbx4mSvb73zutBx06pbi5EqRxr1EWa0wIy5g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MALIQUID HITZ (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "NEW MUSIC: BELOBAZAILE FT BAKILY- Naupenda Mziki |Mp3 Download", "text": "AUDIO: Belobazaile FT Bakily- Naupenda Mziki |Mp3 Download   Enjoy Good Music~Stay Connected With  Maliquid Classic  For Any New Hit Song Released. \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:10.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a3032d760517b0cd07c5023637e50c4a25912301", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSh4iotr3FCj8conQEg9iR.TpDzb0v2hKSE2jOp9IwFKo.nqlg.VuXmDmJx90uSVDBLKdP.vz_4xoh1Cy10xFp8UbunpdewtqmxEkAi1o5sO5RAkFW5mX59", "site_full": "frasersherman.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://frasersherman.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Jesus and Ayn Rand are not the same person \u2013 Fraser Sherman's Blog", "title": "Jesus and Ayn Rand are not the same person", "title_full": "Jesus and Ayn Rand are not the same person", "published": "2017-12-07T12:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a3032d760517b0cd07c5023637e50c4a25912301", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSh4iotr3FCj8conQEg9iR.TpDzb0v2hKSE2jOp9IwFKo.nqlg.VuXmDmJx90uSVDBLKdP.vz_4xoh1Cy10xFp8UbunpdewtqmxEkAi1o5sO5RAkFW5mX59", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "frasersherman", "published": "2017-12-07T12:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Jesus and Ayn Rand are not the same person", "text": "But some conservatives keep insisting that objectivism\u2019s belief in survival of the fittest is completely compatible with Christian tenets of mercy and sympathy for the poor and downtrodden. The Conservative Bible Project, for instance, wants to translate (or \u201cwanted to\u201d \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that particular crusade is still active) all Jesus parables in ways that show he was really talking about the importance of the free market. Short answer: no he wasn\u2019t; for a long answer, find a blogger better at theology than I am. One such blogger, Rachel Held Evans catches right-wing pundit Erick Erickson arguing that the Bible tells us charity is strictly an individual responsibility, not something for government. Evans points out that\u2019s bullshit .\nCertainly right-wing economist Stephen Moore has no trouble worrying about anyone but himself. He\u2019s celebrating that the tax bill hurts education, hurts unions, hurts state government\u2019s abilities to raise taxes or provide services \u2014 in short, hurts everyone but the rich. That it makes class divisions more firm (the rich stay rich, the lower classes will find it harder to rise) is, I\u2019m sure, part of it, though Moore doesn\u2019t mention that. And Paul Ryan, lying as usual, declares that cracking down on high-tax states punishes the states that \u201ctake\u201d from the low-tax states that prop up the country economically. Nope . Apparently both Ryan and Moore are excited about turning all 50 states into Kansas .\nYet another man exposed as a sexual harasser, specifically Rep. John Conyers, who\u2019s resigning from office. The Root asks if Conyers, a black man, isn\u2019t being judged more harshly than white politicians .\nThe thing about all those sexual harassers like Matt Lauer, Mark Halperin and Bill O\u2019Reilly? Their sexism helped shape the media narrative that helped elect Trump .\nAll the ways Republicans will make it harder for students who take out government loans.\nNixon claimed anything he did was legal. W\u2019s attorney John Yoo claimed the president had no legal limits on his power. Now Trump\u2019s lawyer claims that obstruction of justice charges against the president are by definition impossible . The problem isn\u2019t just Trump, it\u2019s Republicans. As noted here .\nRoy Moore is unsurprisingly self-righteous in denouncing his critics as pure evil. Dammit, why can\u2019t they respect a man\u2019s need for teenage tail? As Lance Mannion notes, many conservatives love feeling persecuted. The Slacktivist blog once suggested it\u2019s partly because the Bible was written for Israelites in exile and a persecuted Christian church. It\u2019s much easier to imagine themselves as Israelites in bondage than realize that in the US, they\u2019re Pharaoh. Heck, some of them think ABC reporting on Mueller\u2019s investigation of Trump\u2019s people makes ABC a terrorist group .\nSpeaking of Moore his massive sexism is another good reason not to vote for him.\nApparently Republicans rushed the tax bill through so fast, they screwed up on delivering the corporate tax breaks . Oh, and Sen.

It quotes an Iraqi doctor, Laeth al Sadi, who says: \"I faced some difficulties in trying to understand the Glaswegian accent. Words like 'I didnae ken' and 'swally', but with listening and speaking to people you get used to them and people are very helpful.\" \nWe like the fact that Al Jazeera then adds that the phrases mean \"didn't know\" and \"an alcoholic drink\" for those from further afield. \n \nStop the bus \nWHAT are the most exotic destinations you see on buses around Glasgow? Auchenshuggle and Bonkle are my favourites. Been to both, by the way. Anyway the story of the Bonkle baby bus will be celebrated at a stunning hi-tech son et lumiere show on Saturday at the Vintage Vehicle Trust's Bridgeton Garage when the tales will include the expectant mum in 1960s Lanarkshire who couldn't afford a taxi to Bellshill Maternity and instead caught the Bonkle bus where she was caught short and gave birth behind the driver's cab. \nThe clippie doubled as a midwife and she banished all the menfolk to the Woodbine-fugged upper saloon. The show runs from 4-8pm. \nRemembering Christine \nTHE death of former model Christine Keeler, who was caught up in the Profumo affair, reminds us of when The Herald's redoubtable Jack Webster interviewed Christine over dinner at the Russell Hotel in London. She drank three large whiskies then followed Jack to his hotel bedroom, still raging about people who had deceived her. As a worried Jack later revealed: \"Here I was, alone in a bedroom with the notorious Christine Keeler! I also got the feeling she rather liked me.\" \nFear not gentle reader. Jack diplomatically persuaded her to leave the room and escorted her back to the lounge bar. \nIrish puzzle \nAS we all try to make sense of the DUP's intervention in the Brexit debacle, John Henderson explains: \"The irony of the DUP is that they are nothing more than a bunch of dinosaurs who don't believe at all in the existence of dinosaurs.\" \nCopped it \nOUR story about Edinburgh being a possibility for Prince Harry's stag night reminds Russell Smith in Kilbirnie: \"A friend was tied to a lamppost in Paisley 's High Street many years ago after a stag night and he called out to a passing policeman for help. 'Don't worry son, the worst is still to come,' was the reassuring reply when he explained he was about to get married.\" \nSecret Santa \nA GLASGOW lawyer tells us: \"At the risk of revealing my Secret Santa mission to my colleagues, I thought the new Herald Diary book would be an ideal gift. I went into Waterstone's in Argyle Street, and as I entered, a very nice lady assistant engaged me in a welcoming smile, so I just asked, 'Herald Diary?' at which she grinned broadly, leaned forward and in her best pantomime voice said, 'It's behind you!' which it was.\" \nHave we mentioned that there is a new Diary compilation out just now? Under a tenner too. \nMonday night fever \nWE feel we should pass on the observation on social media by singer Tim Burgess, best known for being the frontman for The Charlatans -late on Tuesday morning he posted: \"Monday nights in Glasgow are like Saturday nights in most other places.\" He then added one of those winking smiley faces, but I'm keeping the Diary column unbesmirched by emojis.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ken smith", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "christine hard", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "christine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russell smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine  the", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laeth al sadi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine keeler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "profumo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim burgess", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waterstone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack webster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "al jazeera", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "secret santa  a glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald diary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bellshill maternity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russell hotel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dup", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bridgeton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lanarkshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paisley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "argyle street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kilbirnie", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:10.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "560f8d368334479a8d2e97254877d2ad7841f090", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT1khnAYILhk_v0_ZQrOeknL7EInt5f.ly_M8k_c_y0qdrdPyReMVag8RQygyGBHkAqMn8n0c_vZQCiA5RinU7z4jyJfG1xlGkkqxPedZDkIxagiUWNW8usP2w0Uu9igIPDUUHakqytjg--", "site_full": "boston-informer.com", "site": "boston-informer.com", "site_section": "https://boston-informer.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Boston Informer", "title": "Patriots notebook: Wideout Chris Hogan is possible to make a timely return", "title_full": "Patriots notebook: Wideout Chris Hogan is possible to make a timely return", "published": "2017-12-07T12:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "560f8d368334479a8d2e97254877d2ad7841f090", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT1khnAYILhk_v0_ZQrOeknL7EInt5f.ly_M8k_c_y0qdrdPyReMVag8RQygyGBHkAqMn8n0c_vZQCiA5RinU7z4jyJfG1xlGkkqxPedZDkIxagiUWNW8usP2w0Uu9igIPDUUHakqytjg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Boston Informer", "published": "2017-12-07T12:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "Patriots notebook: Wideout Chris Hogan is possible to make a timely return", "text": "FOXBORO \u2014 The Patriots may need Chris Hogan this week as much as ever.

Prices have been higher on expectation of big fall in output due to pink bollworm attacks in some states, even though there is little clarity yet on the extent of the damage. Concerns about crop quality have also impacted prices. \nOf late, instances of rejections of cotton bales by buyers have increased. According to trade sources, about 60 lakh bales have arrived in the Indian markets this season compared to 47.3 lakh bales last year till Dec 1. \nICE cotton edged up on Wednesday, on concerns over crop damage in top producer India. However, the International Cotton Advisory Committee increased their projection for 2017/18 world cotton production 0.18 mt to 25.74 mt.

It is not typically recommended, however to use it as a stand-alone to generate trading signals. Since it is time and price based it is not adept at measuring the actual strength of a trend, merely its direction and duration. It is a good idea to use it in conjunction with additional indicators that can help determine the trend\u2019s strength. \nActive traders have a wide range of technical indicators at their disposal for when completing technical stock analysis. Currently, the 14-day ATR for Pwrshr FTSE RAFI Glb Sml Mid Fdamntl ETF (PZW.TO) is spotted at 0.20. First developed by J. Welles Wilder, the ATR may assist traders in determining if there is heightened interest in a trend, or if extreme levels may be signaling a reversal. Simply put, the ATR determines the volatility of a security over a given period of time, or the tendency of the security to move one direction or another. \nChecking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is currently at 56.97, the 7-day stands at 50.92, and the 3-day is sitting at 35.77. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a commonly used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. \nAnother technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with   to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Pwrshr FTSE RAFI Glb Sml Mid Fdamntl ETF (PZW.TO) is noted at 22.22. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nThe   Williams %R is another technical indicator worth taking a look at. Pwrshr FTSE RAFI Glb Sml Mid Fdamntl ETF (PZW.TO) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -44.12. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends. \nPwrshr FTSE RAFI Glb Sml Mid Fdamntl ETF (PZW.TO) currently has   16.35. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafi glb sml mid fdamntl", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "psar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:10.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5dd6c33aa0a9a48709263fdb374974db3b2a764", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kVvxTIQP0LAr9OW0uER2E2BAGoROFo0YcMkyaZbSUO_BeWrJSa8tvtQCnMJD2jGrKQsdM9LbQD0lIALnaiLQxIl.Q.uuxOrtrfqket._c6g9oDn6dUuiT", "site_full": "www.diynot.com", "site": "diynot.com", "site_section": "https://www.diynot.com/diy/forums/general-discussion/", "site_categories": ["home_and_garden", "home_repair"], "section_title": "General Discussion | DIYnot Forums", "title": "Impact Assessments - Do they exist - or did they ever?", "title_full": "Impact Assessments - Do they exist - or did they ever? | DIYnot Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.diynot.com/diynot.og.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 37067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ed98e9cd14ca3d124112e4ad6bc7198b46d32547", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kVvxTIQP0LAr9OW0uER2E2BAGoROFo0YcMkyaZbSUO_BeWrJSa8tvtQCnMJD2jGrKQsdM9LbQD0lIALnaiLQxIl.Q.uuxOrtrfqket._c6gMrop3WphL7br4UAXCe6Iark_VXQUu4mg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Notch7", "published": "2017-12-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "wannabeDIY said: \u2191 Please login (registration is free!) to view this link. http://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-42260350/david-davis-questioned-over-brexit-impact-assessments\nDavid Davis has said, several times, that the government had carried out Impact Assessments on Brexit.\nHe agreed to disclose these to Parliament.\nNow he is saying that they do not exist.\nIs he suffering from Doggit's complaint of fallible (meaning \"convenient\") memory fades?\nOr is he suffering from **** end's complaint of lying each and every time he needs to in order to pursue his own ideological political ends?

The comments came hours after the US flew bombers near North Korea, which inflames Pyongyang every time. North Korea continously refers to the bombers the US uses as being nuclear, even though they were denuclearized in the 1990s and Russia certifies that they are on a yearly basis. SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korea says a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula has become a matter of when, not if, as it continued to lash out at a massive joint military exercise between the United States and South Korea involving hundreds of advanced warplanes.\nIn comments attributed to an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman, North Korea also claimed high-ranked U.S. officials, including CIA Director Mike Pompeo, have further confirmed American intent for war with a series of \"bellicose remarks.\"\nPompeo said Saturday that U.S. intelligence agencies believe North Korean leader Kim Jong Un doesn't have a good idea about how tenuous his situation is domestically and internationally. The North's spokesman said Pompeo provoked the country by \"impudently criticizing our supreme leadership which is the heart of our people.\"\n\"We do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it, and should the U.S. miscalculate our patience and light the fuse for a nuclear war, we will surely make the U.S. dearly pay the consequences with our mighty nuclear force which we have consistently strengthened,\" the spokesman said.\nThe comments were carried by the official Korean Central News Agency late Wednesday, hours after the United States flew a B-1B supersonic bomber over South Korea as part of a massive combined aerial exercise involving hundreds of warplanes. North Korean propaganda is often filled with extreme claims and threats, and the spokesman's comments were consistent with the tone of previous statements condemning Washington and Seoul.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the Guam-based bomber simulated land strikes at a military field near South Korea's eastern coast during a drill with U.S. and South Korean fighter jets.\n\"Through the drill, the South Korean and U.S. air forces displayed the allies' strong intent and ability to punish North Korea when threatened by nuclear weapons and missiles,\" the South Korean military said in a statement.\nB-1Bs flyovers have become an increasingly familiar show of force to North Korea, which after three intercontinental ballistic missile tests has clearly moved closer toward building a nuclear arsenal that could viably target the U.S. mainland.\nThe five-day drills that began Monday involve more than 200 aircraft, including six U.S. F-22 and 18 F-35 stealth fighters.\nNorth Korea hates such displays of American military might at close range and typically uses strong language to condemn them as invasion rehearsals. It has been particularly sensitive about B-1B bombers, describing them as \"nuclear strategic\" although the planes were switched to conventional weaponry in the mid-1990s.\nSEE ALSO:  The US just upped the ante on simulated bomb runs on North Korea \n\n  Share the latest business news with your network: \n\n   \n\nEmail sent to: nguyenvu1187.love5@blogger.com   |   Manage your email preferences   |   Unsubscribe \n\nTerms of Service   |   Privacy Policy \n\nBusiness Insider. 150 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10011 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim tong-hyung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "foreign ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean central news agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joint chiefs of staff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean peninsula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifth avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyongyang", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:11.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0abf9a685a1885446572ec242d7548305ddc65de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSzXGjJekgbLjttUnYupKS7sd570tS.YYuw5Q6owk1z6USBnvNACnwG_2idcvXRiME-", "site_full": "forum-en.msi.com", "site": "msi.com", "site_section": "https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?board=168.0", "site_categories": ["computer_reviews", "tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Technical Discussions (MSI Notebook Technical Assistance ONLY!)", "title": "How to get a GS 63 Stealth run at 2560X1440", "title_full": "How to get a GS 63 Stealth run at 2560X1440", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forum-en.msi.com?action=dlattach&topic=286352&attach=53480&image", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4043, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "20d18e3e75366d56414eff4618378f0aac51b2d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSzXGjJekgbLjttUnYupKS7sd570tS.YYuw5Q6owk1z6USBnvNACnwGD7glhq1BAu_q3F.x5mUyDQ--", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "wotworx", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Oh boy.
