Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., meets with reporters after House Republicans held a closed-door strategy session as the deadline looms to pass a spending bill to fund the government by week's end, on Capitol Hill... Updated: Thursday, December 7 2017 10:12  12:05  48  09   \nBy ALAN FRAMAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Congress seems set to prevent a weekend government shutdown, but lawmakers and President Donald Trump still have longer-range disputes to settle over spending, immigration and other issues before they can declare budget peace. \nWith many on both sides deciding a headline-grabbing federal closure would be a political blunder - at least for now - the House planned to approve legislation Thursday financing federal agencies through Dec. 22. The Senate seemed ready to follow. Without legislation, many agencies would run out of money after midnight Friday and grind to a close. \nThe two-week spending measure is aimed at giving both parties' bargainers more time to reach longer-term budget decisions. To jumpstart that negotiating, Trump and congressional leaders were meeting Thursday to try reaching agreements. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., prompted the two Democrats to skip a bargaining session that was planned then. \nThis time, the White House smoothed the waters by following up with a more peaceable, written statement. It praised Pelosi and Schumer for choosing to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\" \nLater, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension. It also laid out administration budget goals, saying money for the military including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\" \nFor Republicans, a shutdown would put a humiliating bookend on a year in which they've controlled the White House and Congress with little to show for it. They want the public to focus instead on the GOP's prized $1.5 trillion tax bill, which party leaders hope to send Trump by Christmas. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nEven the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have been threatening to oppose the temporary spending measure, predicted passage. \n\"No one wants a shutdown, including Freedom Caucus members,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters. \nThe roughly 30-member caucus has been trying to win promises from leaders of spending curbs and quick passage of a full-year defense budget in exchange for backing the short-term bill. Without support from many of them, Republicans would need votes from Democrats to push the temporary spending measure through the House. \nWhile many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the short-term bill, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there. They know they'd still have leverage on subsequent bills needed to keep the government running. \nRepublicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes for passage. \nDemocrats have been using their leverage to insist on spending boosts for health care, infrastructure and other domestic programs that would match increases Republicans want for defense. \nDemocrats are also seeking an agreement to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. Trump ended safeguards against deportation three months ago but has expressed an openness to restoring them. \n___ \nAP reporters Andrew Taylor and Ken Thomas contributed.

The Prime Minister said in his address, \u201cThank you for coming to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office today. I would like to express my respect and gratitude to each of you for your daily hard work as part of the national movement for the return of the Northern Territories. It can be said that it is an unusual situation that even over 70 years after the end of World War II, the Northern Territories issue has not yet been resolved, and Japan and Russia have not yet concluded a peace treaty. President Putin and I have shared this recognition. Last year I held a Japan-Russia Summit Meeting in Nagato, and as one of the outcomes of that meeting, the grave visits by former residents of the Northern Territories by airplane were conducted recently for the first time in accordance with the agreement in Nagato between President Putin and myself. I want to continue to exert efforts toward giving former residents more freedom in making grave visits. As the former residents are aging, we must make it possible for them to make grave visits in a way that is less burdensome. I believe that President Putin also very much understands that point. In addition, there have been two consecutive local surveys toward joint economic activities on the four islands of the Northern Territories. Since there has unfortunately been hardly any progress on negotiations related to the Northern Territories or negotiations on the peace treaty in over 70 years, we decided to take an approach from a different perspective at the meeting in Nagato last year. I hope to resolve this issue by deepening Russian\u2019s understanding of Japan and the benefits it will gain by working with Japan through the joint economic activities and other cooperation. I ask for your continued cooperation, hard work, and understanding. Over 70 years have now passed. Having more Japanese people understand this issue will create momentum to resolve it, so I would like to close my address by requesting your continued cooperation on this matter. Thank you very much for your time today.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shinzo abe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "liaison council of municipalities", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "development of regions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prime minister\u2019s office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nemuro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern territories", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nagato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:13.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "411d850ec344b5e86cde0b2912d4a0c9152fccb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvmjFlqegXtjH_zrSCVz4x5ewJL05q0v25kD.sQoxmxdWlcWa.gT3uvd4ELH3XWvCyJz2TJl7uF.bg5Q.bDEl1fHVdH3bJyh3la6WfsFCKoD_teeHKxlvPICqIUx1EiZ8La8ZIYvoIYiqxSQv_Yjwxe8UlWSxMZ.ddfVdez547Two24RHIkwT.B7oYP7wTJRMXtiqc9siV6CZDZ8EPkTe6q85qPTfflnHe", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "COSCO Shipping Development : Wins 2017 Golden Bee Excellent CSR Report Growing Ent... | 4-Traders", "title_full": "COSCO Shipping Development : Wins 2017 Golden Bee Excellent CSR Report Growing Ent... | 4-Traders", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dbd530c6835b04b3c91607795e5587b621dd2a88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvmjFlqegXtjH_zrSCVz4x5ewJL05q0v25kD.sQoxmxdWlcWa.gT3uvd4ELH3XWvCyJz2TJl7uF.bg5Q.bDEl1fHVdH3bJyh3la6WfsFCKoD_teeHKxlvPICqIUx1EiZ8La8ZIYvoIYiqxSQv_Yjwxe8UlWSxMZ.ddfVdez547TwrXqQDWYqRgRQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "COSCO Shipping Development : Wins 2017 Golden Bee Excellent CSR Report Growing Ent... | 4-Traders", "text": "On December 1, the 10th Global CSR Report Forum was jointly held by China WTO Tribune, China Business Council For Sustainable Development, the CSR Center of Swedish Embassy in China in Beijing.

Photo by Aaron Schmidt \nI've been floating through the canyons of southeast Utah for 28 years. My first river trip was on the San Juan River, an 80-mile paddle through redrock gorges between the tiny town of Bluff and the upper reaches of Lake Powell. I was 1 year old. \nWhen I was 21, I asked a girl I met at college out on our first date: a few days spent canyoneering in slot canyons north of the San Juan. Five years later we were still dating and had moved to Bluff. We were married here in 2016. \nAll of these events took place in  , 1.3 million acres of federal public lands that President Obama protected under the Antiquities Act last year. On Monday, President Trump traveled to Salt Lake City and (without having ever set foot in southern Utah canyon country) signed two executive orders that slashed Bears Ears by 85 percent and the 1.8 million-acre   National Monument by almost half. The move amounts to the largest rollback of protections on public lands in U.S. history. Leasing for oil and gas drilling as well as uranium and coal mining on 2 million acres of wild public lands could begin in as little as 60 days, according to proclamation language . \nIt was river-running that first brought me to the area and kept me coming back as I explored beyond the San Juan and Colorado rivers (which mark the northern and southern boundaries of the original monument) and into the hundreds of sandstone canyons replete with ancient cliff dwellings and stunning rock art. My ties to Bears Ears go back for a few decades and for me Trump\u2019s attack is personal. But as a landscape with one of the highest concentrations of archaeological sites in the country, Native American ties with the area go back for millennia. \nIt was the leadership of five tribes (Hopi, Navajo, Zuni, Ute, and Ute Mountain Ute) that paved the way for the creation   last year. For many local Native Americans, Bears Ears is a living cultural landscape that tells the story of their people. Ancient cliff dwellings in  , Utah. Photo by Aaron Schmidt \nLyle Balenquah, a river guide, archaeologist, and member of the Hopi tribe, says , \"Within Hopi culture is the belief that the meaning of the past is what it contributes to life in the present.\" Balenquah often takes Hopi youth groups down the San Juan River. He describes watching their understanding of the depth of their culture grow as they experience \"ancestral sites within natural surroundings\" and gain \"insight into the lives of our earliest ancestors.\" \nThe most experienced raft guides I know here in Bluff are all members of the Navajo tribe, and they help educate thousands of non-Native customers that ride along on their trips each year about the area\u2019s cultural significance. \nTFW: when you about to be served by a thousand years of cultural heritage. \nPosted by Len Necefer on Tuesday, December 5, 2017 \nWithin hours of Trump's order, all five tribes filed a joint lawsuit against his administration. This was followed by lawsuits from environmental groups including the Bluff-based nonprofit Friends of Cedar Mesa where my wife works. \nUnder the 1906 Antiquities Act, presidents have the authority to create national monuments. Almost every president since Teddy Roosevelt has protected public lands in this way, Republicans and Democrats alike. Many national parks such as Grand Canyon and Arches were first protected as national monuments. But whether presidents have the authority to reduce the size of existing monuments has yet to be tested in court. Rock art in land that was cut from   on Monday. Photo by Zak Podmore. ( See more of the archeological \u2018crown jewels of Bears Ears\u2019 losing protection ) \nFar more is at stake here than industrial development in southern Utah's pristine canyonlands. If courts rule that monuments can be rescinded and shrunk, it could have implications for many other protected areas with world-class paddling: Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument in Montana, Browns Canyon National Monument in Colorado, Dinosaur National Monument on the Colorado-Utah border, and others. \nIndeed, the next round of environmental assaults have already started. The day after Trump traveled to Utah, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommended cuts to   national monuments. He also wants to introduce \"active timber management\" in Maine's   National Monument, an area renowned for its canoeing. \nIf Trump is allowed to get away with the largest rollback of public lands protections in history, it will only embolden anti-environmental crusaders like Utah Rep. Rob Bishop who is working to gut the Antiquities Act and is pushing to transfer federal public lands to states so they can be sold off to private entities. Should the land transfer movement succeed, Trump's actions this week will look quaint in comparison. \nTrump's attack on public lands is personal for the tribes who have been fighting to protect Bears Ears. It's personal for paddlers like me who have floated down the San Juan River, the Colorado River through Cataract Canyon, or the winding slot canyons of the Escalante River. And unless we stand up now, they could one day come to affect every public lands user in the country. San Juan River, Utah.

The planted area is also marginally downgraded, by 2% to 3.3 million ha.ABARES expects output in Victoria to decrease by 32% to 3.55 million mt and production in South Australia to fall by 45% to 3.65 million mt.Western Australia was least affected, with output expected to fall 25% to 7.52 million mt.In addition, recent reported above-average rainfall in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia are very likely to affect the quality of the harvest.Typically, excessive rainfall during the harvest season results in lower protein and falling number levels, together with chances of sprouted grains , if the rains last.Barley production is also projected to be affected by unfavorable weather, falling 40% from the last marketing year to 8 million mt nationwide.--Andrei Agapi, --Edited by Irene Tang, Request a free trial of: Daily Grains \nDo you want to have access to transparent and relevant real-time news, market commentary, analysis and data on the grains market before competitors do?

Thursday 7 December 2017 . Harmony advises that further to the announcement of the proposed acquisition of the Moab Khotsong operations, which incorporates the Great Noligwa underground mine and related infrastructure (the 'Target Assets') on 19 October 2017, Harmony has made available to download on its website, www.harmony.co.za/investors, today, a circular to Harmony shareholders. The circular will be posted on or about Friday, 8 December 2017. Defined terms used but not defined in this announcement have the meaning set out in the circular. \nThe circular provides further information in relation to: \nThe acquisition of the underground mine Moab Khotsong, which incorporates the Great Noligwa underground mine and related infrastructure from AngloGold Ashanti Limited for a consideration of US$300 million in cash; Proposed amendments to Harmony's memorandum of incorporation; The specific authority for the issue of Ordinary Shares to the ESOP Trust to facilitate a Black Economic Empowerment transaction; The specific authority for the issue of Preference Shares and Conversion Shares to the Harmony Community Trust to facilitate a Black Economic Empowerment transaction; Salient details pertaining to the establishment of an empowerment partner equal to an equity interest of 3% in the Harmony SPV and funding related to this specific BEE transaction. No shareholder authorisation required; and A potential capital raising to refinance the acquisition bridge facility. Further information on Target Assets \nBy acquiring the Moab Khotsong underground mine, which incorporates the Great Noligwa underground mine and related infrastructure, Harmony believes it will significantly improve its overall operating cash flows, increase its average overall underground recovered grade and significantly grow its South African underground Mineral Resource base. \nHarmony believes that there is the potential to increase the Moab Khotsong and Great Noligwa Mines' Life of Mine (as understood in the context of the SAMREC Code) by mining additional high grade Isolated Blocks of Ground (IBGs), extraction of the high grade Great Noligwa shaft pillar, as well as optimising the current plant facilities to treat the Mispah Tailings Facilities. Harmony believes that there is also further optionality in the Zaaiplaats project. \nRelating to the foregoing, the underground Mineral Reserves above infrastructure totalled approximately 1.7 million ounces at 8.8 g/t as at 31 December 2016, while the underground Mineral Resources above infrastructure at the Moab Khotsong and Great Noligwa mines as at 31 December 2016 were approximately 4.98 million ounces at 18.5 g/t. \na) Moab Khotsong \nHarmony believes that Moab Khotsong is a high quality, cash generating gold mine with well-invested and maintained infrastructure which can underpin near term cash flows and support the creation of value. Harmony's assessment of the value is broadly in-line with the preferred value of US$260 million recommended by the independent competent valuator as part of the Competent Persons Report. \nb) Great Noligwa \nThe Great Noligwa Mine, which has been placed on care and maintenance in recent years by AngloGold Ashanti has existing infrastructure utilised to service the Moab Khotsong mining operations. The Mineral Reserve of the Great Noligwa Mine is currently being extracted through the Moab Khotsong Mine. \nHarmony has performed due diligence on Great Noligwa and believes that additional value can be extracted by mining additional high grade IBGs as well as the high grade shaft pillar. \nExtraction of the shaft pillar is technically similar to what Harmony has successfully achieved at its Bambanani operation in or around the city of Welkom in the Free State, where since February 2010, Harmony has been able to extract 479 252 oz of gold at an average recovered grade of 9.89 g/t, and extend the Life of Mine (as understood in the context of the SAMREC Code) to 2022. Total project capital to mine the Bambanani shaft pillar was ZAR610 million. \nHarmony believes that the extraction of the Great Noligwa shaft pillar will yield a similarly positive outcome. The technical nature of the mining is similar and Harmony has proven expertise in this area. \nFurther to the above and based on its experience in mining IBGs, Harmony believes that it will be able to extend the life of the Moab Khotsong and Great Noligwa Mines from 5 to at least 10 years subject to the outcome of the necessary studies after completion of the Acquisition. \n\nHarmony estimates that the net present value from extracting the shaft pillar and mining the IBGs has the potential to be substantial, based on a set of macroeconomic, technical and operational assumptions consistent with Harmony's customary planning assumptions. Harmony's internal assessment of the value of mining additional high grade IBGs as well as the high grade shaft pillar at Great Noligwa Mine is broadly in line with the valuation of the Moab Khotsong Mine. \nc) Mispah Tailings Retreatment \nThe Mispah 1 tailings facility specifically, contains a Mineral Resource of over 70 million tonnes of surface tailings with an average gold grade of 0.30 g/t. With the current installed plant excess capacity and the treatment and processing of waste rock nearing the end of its life, Harmony believes that there is considerable scope to convert these facilities to a surface tailings re-treatment operation, similar to those currently operated by Harmony at the Phoenix plant and the Central plant operations situated in or around the city of Welkom in the Free State. \nHarmony believes that optimisation of current plant facilities would have minimal capital requirements and low technical risk, and would create a relatively low cost, long life operation. \nThe necessary studies, including obtaining the necessary permissions, still have to be completed to ensure value can be unlocked after completion of the Acquisition. Harmony estimates a potential net present value of approximately US$20-40 million based on its prior experience of developing similar plants and on a set of macroeconomic, technical and operational assumptions that are consistent with its customary planning assumptions. \nd) Zaaiplaats project \nThe Zaaiplaats project is potentially an extension of the Moab Khotsong Mine which contained a Mineral Resource base of 6.8 Moz with an average gold grade of 17.2 g/t as at 31 December 2016. It is currently in pre-feasibility stage and Harmony will assess its attractiveness after completion of the Acquisition. Zaaiplaats is expected to provide Harmony with optionality, particularly in a rising Rand gold price environment. Harmony has attributed no value to Zaaiplaats. It is currently viewed as a potential future expansion opportunity. \nFurther studies will be conducted, after completion of the Acquisition and the appropriate decision will be made subject to the outcome of those studies. e) Synergies \nThrough its analysis and due diligence investigation, and in applying the 'Harmony Operational Excellence and Operating Model' to Moab Khotsong Mine's operations, Harmony believes that it will be able to realise substantial cost savings. These are reflected in its operating model and valuation. \nHarmony believes that the main source of these cost savings will be through a reduction in central support services costs allocated to the Mine i.e. incorporating the Moab Khotsong Mine into its existing centralised management structures and support services. Alongside these savings, Harmony has also identified certain procurement and metallurgy-related savings which it believes can be achieved. In estimating these cost opportunities, Harmony has been cognisant of the environment in which it operates and its social responsibilities and these factors have been factored into Harmony's estimates. \nf) Conclusion \nHarmony believes the Acquisition is value accretive and will enhance its position as a higher-grade producer and cash-generative gold mining company. Harmony anticipates that the Acquisition will boost Harmony's operational cash flows by more than 60%, and increase its average overall underground recovered grade by 11% and grow its South African underground Mineral Resource base by 38%, in each case as compared to performance in FY17. \nFurthermore, Harmony's assessment of value of the Target Operations is based on what Harmony believes is a conservative set of macroeconomic, technical and operational assumptions that are consistent with its customary planning assumptions indicates significant upside to the Purchase Price. \n1) Notice of General Meeting \nNotice is hereby given to the Shareholders that a General Meeting of the Shareholders will be held at the Hilton Hotel, 138 Rivonia Road, Sandton, Johannesburg, South Africa at 11:00 (South African Standard Time) on Thursday, 01 February 2018. \n2) Salient dates and times \nPosting Record Date to be eligible to receive the Circular and Notice of General Meeting\nPosting Circular to Shareholders Friday, 01 December 2017\nFriday, 08 December 2017 Last Day to Trade in order to be eligible to participate and vote at the General Meeting Tuesday, 23 January 2018 Voting Record Date to participate in and vote at the General Meeting Friday, 26 January 2018 Last Day and time to give notice to Transfer Secretaries to participate in the General Meeting electronically by 11:00 on Monday, 29 January 2018 Last day and time to lodge Forms of Proxy with the Transfer Secretaries, by 11:00 on Tuesday, 30 January 2018 General Meeting of Shareholders at 11:00 on Thursday, 01 February 2018 Results of General Meeting released on SENS Thursday, 01 February 2018 All dates and times above are South African local times unless otherwise stated. \nThe above dates and times are subject to amendments.

These objections are heavily influenced by those who adhere the \"strict separation\" and \"strict neutrality\" towards religion as reflected in the US Constitution. However, the Philippine Constitution did not totally adopt the US Constitution as in fact the Preamble acknowledges the existence of Divine Providence. In Re: Tony Q. Valenciano A.M. No. 10-4-19-SC, March 7, 2017, the Philippine Supreme Court ruled in this wise: \n\n\nAccommodation, Not Establishment of Religion \n\nIn order to give life to the constitutional right of freedom of religion, the State adopts a policy of accommodation . Accommodation is a recognition of the reality that some governmental measures may not be imposed on a certain portion of the population for the reason that these measures are contrary to their religious beliefs. As long as it can be shown that the exercise of the right does not impair the public welfare, the attempt of the State to regulate or prohibit such right would be an unconstitutional encroachment. (Emphasis ours) \nIn Estrada v. Escritor, the Court adopted a policy of benevolent neutrality:\n\nWith religion looked upon with benevolence and not hostility, benevolent neutrality allows accommodation of religion under certain circumstances. Accommodations are government policies that take religion specifically into account not to promote the government's favored form of religion, but to allow individuals and groups to exercise their religion without hindrance . Their purpose or effect therefore is to remove a burden on, or facilitate the exercise of, a person's or institution's religion. As Justice Brennan explained, the \"government [may] take religion into account . . . to exempt, when possible, from generally applicable governmental regulation individuals whose religious beliefs and practices would otherwise thereby be infringed, or to create without state involvement an atmosphere in which voluntary religious exercise may flourish. (Emphasis ours) \nIn Victoriano v. Elizalde Rope Workers Union,  the Court upheld the exemption of members of Iglesia ni Cristo from the coverage of a closed shop agreement between their employer and a union, because it would violate the teaching of their church not to affiliate with a labor organization. \nIn Ebralinag v. Division Superintendent of Schools of Cebu, the petitioners, who were members of the Jehovah's Witnesses, refused to salute the flag, sing the national anthem, and recite the patriotic pledge for it is their belief that those were acts of worship or religious devotion, which they could not conscientiously give to anyone or anything except God. The Court accommodated them and granted them an exemption from observing the flag ceremony out of respect for their religious beliefs. \nFurther, several laws have been enacted to accommodate religion. The Revised Administrative Code of 1987 has declared Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Christmas Day as regular holidays . Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9177 proclaimed the first day of Shawwal, the tenth month of the Islamic Calendar, a national holiday for the observance of Eidul Fitr (the end of Ramadan). R.A. No. 9849 declared the tenth day of Zhul Hijja, the twelfth month of the Islamic Calendar, a national holiday for the observance of Eidul Adha. Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1083, otherwise known as the Code of Muslim Personal Laws of the Philippines, expressly allows a Filipino Muslim to have more than one (1) wife and exempts him from the crime of bigamy punishable under Revised Penal Code (RPC). The same Code allows Muslims to have divorce.  \nxxx \nNon-Establishment Clause \n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum is the constitutional mandate that \" no law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion ,\"  otherwise known as the non-establishment clause. Indeed, there is a thin line between accommodation and establishment, which makes it even more imperative to understand each of these concepts by placing them in the Filipino society's perspective. \nThe non-establishment clause reinforces the wall of separation between Church and State. It simply means that the State cannot set up a Church; nor pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religion, or prefer one religion over another nor force nor influence a person to go to or remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion; that the state cannot punish a person for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance; that no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activity or institution whatever they may be called or whatever form they may adopt or teach or practice religion; that the state cannot openly or secretly participate in the affairs of any religious organization or group and vice versa. Its minimal sense is that the state cannot establish or sponsor an official religion.  \nIn the same breath that the establishment clause restricts what the government can do with religion, it also limits what religious sects can or cannot do. They can neither cause the government to adopt their particular doctrines as policy for everyone, nor can they cause the government to restrict other groups. To do so, in simple terms, would cause the State to adhere to a particular religion and, thus, establish a state religion.  \nFather Bernas further elaborated on this matter, as follows:\n\n\"In effect, what non-establishment calls for is government neutrality in religious matters. Such government neutrality may be summarized in four general propositions: (1) Government must not prefer one religion over another or religion over irreligion because such preference would violate voluntarism and breed dissension; (2) Government funds must not be applied to religious purposes because this too would violate voluntarism and breed interfaith dissension; (3) Government action must not aid religion because this too can violate voluntarism and breed interfaith dissension; [and] (4) Government action must not result in excessive entanglement with religion because this too can violate voluntarism and breed interfaith dissension.\"  Establishment entails a positive action on the part of the State. Accommodation, on the other hand, is passive. In the former, the State becomes involved through the use of government resources with the primary intention of setting up a state religion. In the latter, the State, without being entangled, merely gives consideration to its citizens who want to freely exercise their religion. \nxxx \nWhile this masonic constitution is designed to minimize the privileges of the true Christ through His Church in the society, but somehow, it can still be proved that any law passed by Congress declaring December 8 as non-working holiday in deference to the Feast of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary is within the bounds of the Philippine Constitution. The Court adopts benevolence and not hostility towards religion. The State has no choice but to include the Catholic Church in their application of benevolence towards religion in the name of equality. \nBut wait a minute, what about the BBL which will allow the BBL cities to impose Sharia Law?  \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "estrada", "sentiment": "none"},

Reynolds Cast To Play Pikachu In 'Detective Pikachu' Movie Thu Dec 07 2017 08:41:35   08:43:26 GMT+0000 (GMT) Chris Ogden Chris Ogden in entertainment Powered by \nRyan Reynolds has been catching a lot of great roles over the past few years but now he's going to catch 'em all. Sorry, we'll get our coats. \nThe Deadpool star is shifting away from his X-rated superhero and starring as Pikachu in the live-action Pok\u00e9mon movie Detective Pikachu . \nStarring alongside Reynolds in the first non-animated Pok\u00e9mon adventure will be Justice Smith, who will star in the upcoming Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Big Little Lies' Kathryn Newton. This cosplayer was w y ahead of the curve on this casting choice for Detective Pikachu... pic.twitter.com/USEsg4ajlW - :rose:Yes, please:rose: (@SpectacularTime) December 7, 2017 \nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter , Reynolds' role as Pikachu will be motion capture while the rest of the cast alongside him will be normal human beings. This sounds amazing. \nDetective Pikachu is based on the Pok\u00e9mon spin-off game of the same name, which was released in Japan last year, in which players work with a talking Pikachu to solve mysteries. \nReports say that the film will start with the kidnap of Smith's character's father, forcing the teenager to team up with Pikachu to find him. Newton will play a \"sassy\" journalist who aids them in their quest. Sounds like a laugh. \nThe film is due to start shooting in mid-January 2018 in London and will be directed by Rob Letterman, who recently directed the live action version of R.L. Stine's Goosebumps. \nJust in case you've been living under a rock for the last 20 years, lightning mouse Pikachu is the most famous icon of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise which has taken the world by storm since it emerged in the 1990s. \nNintendo's Pok\u00e9mon franchise has sold over 300 million video games worldwide, shipped out billions of trading cards and has been the subject of a long-running animated series, so it's easy to see why producers believe the film will be a smash hit. Although I wouldn't hold your breath for Oscar season. \nFans of the franchise are simultaneously delighted and disappointed by the casting choice - notoriously short and grouchy Danny DeVito had long been the fans' favourite to voice Pikachu in English. Ryan Reynold ( @VancityReynolds ) is set to voice Pikachu in the live action Detective Pikachu movie.I really hope Deadpool makes a joke about this at some point. pic.twitter.com/eNfWytiwZr", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r.l. stine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pikachu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deadpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob letterman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris ogden chris ogden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny devito", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan reynold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathryn newton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nintendo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pok\u00e9mon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pikachu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood reporter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:17.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e250ec30c1c1b11de3ad14af50e6b79d88fae447", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hb4xVCLNk6UlLF0xuOD.pYAjMPD9iGty0yB9IWggwP1yWWuEtuyA1rxC4OOofkZVjI6Op.8.YvLusGa_mJNLwqbDzOzF5E9chF5Rh.YxWLw--", "site_full": "www.tzjobconnection.com", "site": "tzjobconnection.com", "site_section": "http://www.tzjobconnection.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Tanzania Job Connection | Jobs in Tanzania", "title": "Nafasi za kazi : Laboratory Technician at Maternity Africa", "title_full": "Nafasi za kazi : Laboratory Technician at Maternity Africa", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e250ec30c1c1b11de3ad14af50e6b79d88fae447", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hb4xVCLNk6UlLF0xuOD.pYAjMPD9iGty0yB9IWggwP1yWWuEtuyA1rxC4OOofkZVjI6Op.8.YvLusGa_mJNLwqbDzOzF5E9chF5Rh.YxWLw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wajanjatz Media (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Nafasi za kazi : Laboratory Technician at Maternity Africa", "text": "\n\nLocation Other Dar es Salaam District Dar Es Salaam Description Maternity Africa is a local nonprofit organization in Tanzania, devoted to helping make child birth safe and treating obstetrical fistulas.

A post shared by August Ames (@msmaplefever) on Nov 30, 2017 at 10:47pm PST \nAmes' husband, adult film director Kevin Moore, said in a statement: \"She was the kindest person I ever knew and she meant the world to me.\" Moore has asked for privacy in the wake of Ames' death. \nAccording to Hollywood Life, friends close to Ames have claimed that she had been battling depression, and that online bullying may have played a part in her death. \nAmes received severe criticism on Twitter over the weekend after refusing to complete a scene with a man because he'd previously starred in gay porn, saying: \"I do homework for my body\". \nFans and others slammed her for being homophobic, which she strenuously denied. Instead, Ames said that her comments were not meant to be malicious and she was just looking after her own health. I don't have anything to apologize for! Apologizing for taking extra steps to ensue that my body stays safe? Fuck you guys attacking me when none of my intentions were malicious. I fucking love the gay community! What the fuck ever! I CHOOSE who I have inside my body. No hate. https://t.co/7dSbq27K2F - August Ames (@AugustAmesxxx) December 4, 2017 \nAmes' final tweet, posted on Tuesday, simply said: \"fuck y'all\". \nNumerous figures in the porn industry were deeply shocked by the news of Ames' death, with fellow porn star Abella Danger tweeting: \"She was the most kind-hearted person ever.\" \nProducer/director Jules Jordan added: \"Rest In Peace to August Ames, one of the best, nicest people I ever knew in the business.\" \nYesterday, fellow porn star Annika Albrite, a friend of Ames, even implied that the recent backlash may have contributed to her death. \n\"Omg,I can't believe she's dead,\" Albrite tweeted. \"You people should have known better than to berate her over her personal thoughts! Shame on all you for beating it into the ground. \n\"Online harassment is a real thing & it claimed another life. Someone who I liked & would have even called a friend!\" \nAmes, whose real name is Mercedes Grabowski, had starred in over 270 adult films since making her acting debut in 2013.

Speaking with a car finance company tonight who give better rates advice me that Jaguars are indeed one of the highest risk cars depreciation wise, as such they did advice if buying a regular version (none SVR) to try to get one 2yr-3yr old as they get hit hardest in first year. He believe a regular R purchased at 60-65k now around 1.5-2yr old would be worth around 45-50k in a further 2yr at which point he expects to be bottom, he said the coupe and AWD are more desirable as such hold value better. An SVR model is different and that in 2yr really a worse case example would be 60k and could still be at 65k plus I was advised.\nOf course he did say a Porsche GT would eliminate risk of depreciation, but did also say any good GT3 is around 140k which is a big difference than 80k and he could not comment if he believes the prices will increase further or not.\nGonna look at other cars in this price region too and test drive, then as crazy as it sounds like today, a brochure turned up for the new Mustang from dealership I've ordered with.\nThen I watched these videos:\nThey do shift very well indeed and the SVR seems much quicker off the line or it just got a good launch.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/AybwYQoJ-LU?wmode=opaque", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Q_go-5sqLQ?wmode=opaque"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:18.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2eb7e96646f904fa6e40d2cd58b88373db4b056b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..GwbCvKuuYhLJ8KiWEZqEPPqzLGCuo2iC5iuYG7CLGfvux4ssRjgcpGM-", "site_full": "forums.overclockers.co.uk", "site": "overclockers.co.uk", "site_section": "http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Overclockers UK Forums", "title": "THE 50K CHALLENGE: NEW MUSTANG ON THE WAY, BUT WOULD 50K BE BETTER SPENT ON ANOTHER MARQUE? | Page 26", "title_full": "THE 50K CHALLENGE: NEW MUSTANG ON THE WAY, BUT WOULD 50K BE BETTER SPENT ON ANOTHER MARQUE? | Page 26 | Overclockers UK Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T13:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.026, "main_image": "https://forums.overclockers.co.uk/data/avatars/m/0/6.jpg?1487067885", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13599, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7411cc6f3480c890eb99e828bcc62d34bcd11e69", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..GwbCvKuuYhLJ8KiWEZqEPPqzLGCuo2iC5iuYG7CLGfvu4pVZ1iguzX7yKPmv8PWRpw--", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Acme", "published": "2017-12-07T14:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Synced up the launches of those two Jags above, and there was nothing between them.
