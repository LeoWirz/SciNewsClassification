The US accuses Russia of meddling in its democracy, without being able to prove it, and spends huge sums doing the exact same thing. The Yiddish word for this kind of thing is \"Chutzpah.\" Nicholas Sokolov   MORE:   POLITICS It's no secret that social media manipulation and information war is the greatest weapon in this Cold War 2.0. This report from the Russian evening news goes into detail about how the US does not simply label Russia State Media as foreign agents, but they send their own army of internet trolls to wage a subversive campaign against Russia online.  (Full Transcript provided at the bottom of the article) According to the report: The idea is to actively work in social networks to discredit news from Russian state media, and to highlight the posts of opposition Russian-speaking journalists, those who under the new amendments will amount to foreign agents. They target Facebook, Twitter, and even Odnoklassniki. We have already covered the presence of  these disgusting ,  perverted trolls , on both Facebook and  Linkedin , and now it seems they have been given a blank check to expand their trolling network into Russian social media like Odnoklassniki. This is a dangerous slippery slope. First, they will target Russian State Media, then every single independent journalist who so much as dares to question the narrative. Their campaign of censorship has already hit close to home when they openly targeted Russian Faith, a website founded by an American military veteran and co-founder of Russia Insider to cover the Christian Renaissance in Russia. Their YouTube channel was  completely terminated  without a word of warning. Did you by any chance  sign their petition  to reinstate it? Russian Faith has NOTHING to do with politics, but because it has the word \"Russian\" in it, that makes it an agent of the Kremlin under this new McCarthyism. This Orwellian campaign against free speech WILL affect you some day. First, it starts with RT and Sputnik, they will say it's because they are state funded. Then it will be Russia Insider, they will say RI is fake news created by Putin's useful idiots if they don't outright claim it's secretly Kremlin-funded too. How long will it be until simply posting pro-Russian comments on a Facebook page, or...gasp, simply having an account on VK or Odnoklassniki, gets you labeled a Kremlin agent? Please consider supporting your favorite independent media outlets. Russia insider really needs your  support , but  even if that is not Russia Insider,  consider supporting other  i ndependent journalists who work tirelessly to bring you the truth in an age when that becomes not only more costly, but more dangerous. Otherwise, videos like the one above may begin to disappear. And that loss of information is most tragic. Video Transcript Anchor: Nothing unexpected. Put pressure on RT in the US? Get a tit-for-tat response. There have been multiple warnings. Especially since the US authorities feel free to control other countries' information agendas. The Polygraph project is more evidence of it. The State Department, of course, wasn't eager to unveil it. But they could not hide it either. The idea is to actively work in social networks to discredit news from Russian state media, and to highlight the posts of opposition Russian-speaking journalists, those who under the new amendments will amount to foreign agents. They target Facebook, Twitter, and even Odnoklassniki. The scale is impressive. It's about a whole troll factory. Stanislav Bernwald has found out how much they are paid. -Hello, Stanislav. Good evening. And they weren't stingy with them. Stanislav Bernwald: Indeed, they weren't, it's about hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars. Let's have the details right now. A dramatic increase in budgetary spending for anti-Russian propaganda was detected back in June 2017. All the media projects of Broadcasting Board of Governors will continue to be funded by the US federal budget. For example, the Voice of America will get more than $7 million for programs in Russia, Radio Liberty again has a considerable budget for the coming year, which exceeds $10 million. Crimea also notices that millions of dollars are lashed out on anti-Russian propaganda. A Kiev troll factory, focusing on Crimea, has considerably increased its personnel. Dmitry Polonsky, Information Minister of Crimea: \"We can't but notice a dramatic increase in so-called fake news or preplanned bogus stories. Crimea has always been and will remain a target of such information attacks. Of course, it requires significant funds. And the acceleration of this activity that we're monitoring indicates that a lot of money is invested in it.\" Stanislav Bernwald: Not surprising, it's for the work in social media that the budget has been increased. More than $6 million will be invested there, which is almost 350 million rubles. Facebook, Twitter are promising directions, with Russian social media Odnoklassniki and VKontakte being very promising. Ilya Ukhov, journalist: \"VKontakte and Odnoklassniki have targeted primarily the Russian audience. It's no secret that Odnoklassniki is one of the key social networks in the Russian Federation. Most of its audience isn't engaged in political discussions on Facebook. Obviously, such an interest of US propaganda agencies in these social networks is due to their desire to expand their audience, to break the barrier.\" Stanislav Bernwald: A new approach of the Western propaganda machinery is also interesting. To hit the target, they engage Russian top video bloggers to work for the Western audience like, look how bad everything is here in Russia. Ilya Ukhov: \"If a John Smith, American, or a European is telling this, few will believe in it both in the country and in Europe and the US because what can a person who's not integrated into the local environment say? But when a Russian citizen speaks, allegedly sharing their own experience, it sells better, and, I'm sure, there are some contracts in this field.\" Stanislav Bernwald: Here's an illustrative example of fake news. It's not just a post, but paid ads on Facebook. It's a link to the krymr.com website. What's important is, it's a subdivision of Radio Liberty. It says that the Sakharov Prize for Courage has been awarded to a Russian writer condemning the annexation of Crimea. Meanwhile, the laureate Boris Stomakhin was charged with calls for terrorism and sentenced to 7 years in prison. If we take a closer look at the Sakharov prize, it doesn't look like a prize at all. Maxim Kononenko, journalist: \"Today we tried to find out what is this Sakharov prize. It's actually not the big Sakharov prize, it's another Sakharov prize created specifically for Boris Stomakhin to receive. So, we can create a Nobel prize, I mean, call it that, award it to you, and everybody will call you a Nobel prize laureate, you'll be in the spotlight.\" Stanislav Bernwald: Experts think we'll see many fakes like this. While control over foreign media will be enhanced in response to the requirement for RT to register as a foreign agent, it's still unclear how to control anti-Russian propaganda on the Internet. Anchor: Stanislav Bernwald has reported on the trolls in the State Department's care. \nhttp://russia-insider.com/en/us-prepares-lavishly-funded-anti-russia-propaganda-and-troll-army/ri21805  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilya ukhov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicholas sokolov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boris stomakhin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry polonsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odnoklassniki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sakharov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maxim kononenko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanislav", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanislav bernwald", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "troll army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christian renaissance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook and  linkedin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russian state media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radio liberty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broadcasting board of governors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "voice of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russian federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crimea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kiev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sputnik", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:26.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "140478d54b48b477708746b770943597827dbb93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7uI68rqpB3Ly2x2JbwLqa42nJvKF3MTE59VkchO3OXgaP1F1Lny.dRr3zbx_WVDVPX2tt_GLM6BHkuHne_oeGFNMCHQ1UKEiE-", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "2018 \u2013 Pre-orders, rumours, hopes dream and aspirations | Page 3", "title_full": "2018 \u2013 Pre-orders, rumours, hopes dream and aspirations | Page 3 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/80/80811.jpg?1511637799", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0cfa0c29b23a22e01acc25171fc4461eff449a78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7uI68rqpB3Ly2x2JbwLqa42nJvKF3MTE59VkchO3OXgaP1F1Lny.dRr3zbx_WVDVPX2tt_GLM6BHkuHne_oeGFge71jsAZy6cVYd_E6NRoIA--", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "hamicle", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "factory44 said: \u2191 It\u2019s about time for volume 2 in the Go-Betweens box set series.

There are different companies that offer different services hence you should find a suitable one. You should ensure you find one that will provide excellent services when it comes to boat transport . Below are some of the considerations that ought to be outlined.\n\nThe vessel can be your investment, but you need them to be transported at an affordable price. Different firms will have different quotes which you should be aware of. Start by contacting different firms to know the price for the boat to be moved. You should then compare the pricing with the quality of services they offer. Hire one that has quality services being offered at a good price.\n\nGet to know if the selected firm has extra services that you can rely on when it comes to such an undertaking. Those that do not offer extra services should be left out since they are expensive. Professional wrapping is provided by some firms since it protects the boat from damages. They should also be monitoring the movement of the boat for you to secure it and be pleased with it.\n\nRead different websites to know about different firms that offer yacht transportation services. Do not pick the first that appear on the list but go through all of them. Read the profile of the firm to know about the services they offer. Choose one that suits you because they have been rated highly by the better business bureau.\n\nDo proper preparation for the vessel before the transportation starts. All the items must be secured so as to avoid some mistakes. If you do not prepare it in advance, some of them might get lost, or you will waste their time when they arrive. Ask them to come with their crane if you have not found one.\n\nIf you want to get quality services, you need to start by talking to previous clients. They are the ones who will tell you about the quality of services they received for you to consider. Ask them if the vessel was handled carefully during transportation. You should also get to know if they delivered it at the recommended time. This information will help you distinguish the syndicate and choose a suitable one.\n\nMake sure you locate a firm that has been licensed. This is because the license is a proof that the firm has been allowed to provide boat hauling services in the country. It is also important in case you want to sue the organization since it proves they have been registered. Insurance is also important as it proves they will be liable in case of any damages to your vessel.\n\nLook at their trailers to know if they suit the type of vessels you have. If you do not have a trailer or it does not meet their requirements, you should find one that has adjustable trailers.

I have had a very gentle word this morning about it, and they are going to sweep up at the end of the day. They are taking the largest wall in the hall back to brick so it is extremely messy. But it's in such an unbelievably awful state at the moment, drastic steps are necessary.\nI have been saving up for 10 years to do our work, which has basically involved living in a horribly down-at-heel ex-rental house with plastic carpets for more or less a decade. I suspect my house is worlds cheaper than most of yours, though: the cost of the extension is more than 50% the value of the house! This is the kind of financial decision everyone advises you not to take - we will not add the same amount in value as this is costing, probably by \u00a320-30k. However, we just couldn't find a house that suited us in our budget (which is small, even with the extension costs)- we live in a city that isn't very architecturally distinguished, and where people don't really care for their houses, very unlike the south east. So we decided to create the space that we actually needed and to design everything in so that we could have a very minimal and clean interior.\nSince we haven't spent much on the house in the last decade, I think some of the costs we won't recoup are just things we would have had to do anyway for maintenance (new kitchen, staircase).\nI think I might be able to start decorating this weekend! The little study at the back of the house is being patch plastered today and the skim coat is quite thin so I think it might be dry by Sunday. If not, I can definitely do the walls that aren't being touched, anyway, and finish up next week if need be.

First comes the Fitzgerald debacle, and now the Brexit deal that very clearly wasn\u2019t. In fairness that last wasn\u2019t his fault (though I see Stephen Collins may be arguing otherwise in the IT this morning). But\u2026 small wonder the long faces when the Taoiseach et al came out and faced the cameras on Monday evening. This wasn\u2019t how it was meant to go. And on a slight tangent to me that suggests that all the complaining from Tory ultra-Brexit proponents and the DUP about Dublin \u2018leaking\u2019 etc are very wide of the mark as well as deceitful and self-serving. This was a deal that was meant to work, at least in terms of the political optics, whatever about the substance. Whatever else it\u2019s a hard lesson in one basic truth \u2013 be sure and sure again that what you think is about to happen is actually going to happen. \nAgain on paper this isn\u2019t a good look for Varadkar as he heads into Christmas. Would Fianna F\u00e1il have handled this better? Would anyone?\nBut yet again, we get a poll where FG is soaring ahead of Fianna F\u00e1il, where in some curious political alchemy failure of sorts is success of anther sort! \nWhat is this about? The electorate get a good look at Varadkar and the new FG team and like the cut of their jib? A sense that the state standing up to the British is no bad thing? Satisfaction at the way matters are proceeding? Or as noted earlier relief that there is no election and that combined with the strong but meditative tone of the Taoiseach and T\u00e1naiste this week that has gained plaudits and support?

Bellephill.com", "text": "BUA Group writes Open Letter to President Buhari over alleged Abuse of Power by Kayode Fayemi and Dangote Group By tweet \nBUA Group on Monday published an open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari over some alleged activities of the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Kayode Fayemi . \nThe letter, titled \u201c A Cry for Help: Wanton Abuse of Power by a Serving Minister Geared at Sabotaging Operations of BUA Cement ,\u201d alleged that the minister, in collaboration with Dangote Group , is carrying out activities capable of undermining the peace and security around the BUA cement plant in Okpella, Edo State. \nThe letter stated that the minister had alleged that BUA Group is engaging in unlawful and illegal mining in Kogi State in site No. 2541ML. \nThe minister, through the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, had however issued a \u201cstop work\u201d order asking BUA to vacate and stop mining activities in its plant Obu-Okpella, Edo State. \nThe letter alleged that a private militia employed by Dangote Group, Dangote Cement\u2019s Chief Security Officer, Ahmed Yabagi , youths in the Okpella area employed by Dangote Group, senior officials of the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, and high ranking police officers had at different instances entered the premises of the cement plant to disrupt activities. \nThe Ministry of Mines and Steel Development on the other hand has issued a press release addressing the allegations. \nThe press release stated that the ministry will stand by its stop work order, which BUA Group had used a combination of armed militia, soldiers and policemen to resist. \nRead both the open letter and the press release below: Our Position on Bua Group\u2019s Misleading Publication \nThe attention of the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development has been drawn to a misleading publication signed by the Executive Chairman of the BUA Group Abdulsamad Rabiu, published in several newspapers as an open letter to the President and titled: \u201cA cry for Help: Wanton Abuse of Power By a Serving Minister Geared at Sabotaging Operations of BUA Cement.\u201d \nThe publication which is an unwarranted campaign of calumny against the Ministry and the office of the Honourable Minister, is nothing but an attempt by the cement company to blackmail the Ministry into granting a free pass for illegal operations. \nWhile the Ministry does not intend to join issues with the BUA Group which has an enviable history of industrial performance, we deem it appropriate, however, to state the facts for the purpose of enlightening members of the public as follows: In the records of the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development and the Nigerian Mining Cadastre Office (MCO), the BUA Group, does not have a mining lease over the contentious site No. 2541ML. Therefore, its mining activities there are illegal. The Ministry stands by the Stop Work Order issued to the BUA Group and signed by the Permanent Secretary, dated 17 th October 2017. The letter was issued after thorough investigation confirmed that the BUA Group was indeed engaging in illegal mining of marble/limestone at a mine pit located on Geographical Coordinates N07 0 21\u2019 47.4\u201d E006 0 26\u2019 51.8\u2019, while the Run-of-Mine (ROM) is stockpiled at an area with geographical coordinates N07 0 21\u2019 48.4\u201d; E006 0 26\u201937.2\u201d Clarification provided by the Mining Cadastre Office shows that the coordinates of the Mine pit and ROM stockpile area fall wholly within the area of mining Lease No 2541ML belonging to Messrs Dangote Industries Limited. The Ministry had earlier in 2015 issued a Stop Work Order on this same disputed site but the BUA Group disregarded the order and went ahead with its illegal mining activities, under heavy cover of armed soldiers, policemen and men of the Civil Defence Corps. The Management of BUA also resisted the enforcement of the latest Stop Work Order issued on October 17 th , 2017 using a combination of armed militia, soldiers and policemen to obstruct the team from the ministry in effecting the Stop Work Order. While BUA Group in its publication admitted the fact that a suit over the ownership of the site was pending in a court of competent jurisdiction, the Group, however continued with its illegal mining activities on the site, which in itself is subjudice to both the court and the Mining Act 2007, which guides mining activities in the country.

Apart from that, it is named as more reasonable options that become functional for flats which desired to restrict carbon footprints and protect atmospheres. During common days, liquefied petroleum gas pertains to alternatives centralized on outdated materials as the result of better and more advanced octane levels.\n\nNext, it referred to odorless and transparent components that are condensate into gaseous chemicals where smells are made from ethyl mercaptan that is incorporated for distinguishing concerns. While its other types provide warmer rooms, Wax and Asphaltene Solvent provides steady air quality near 115 degrees. Amid other times, electricity requires greater deals of time, assets, and work forces.\n\nBut, it has the capability essential in reaching those dreams within the period of 20 minutes which is needed to create power.

If you like it, feel free to contribute your own.\nThe game is this: Any time you play a game and feel like one team won because of a vastly superior comp, post the matchup and put in spoilers who won and your impression of why. Before looking at the spoiler, people can reply and predict who they think won and why. QM games are welcome as long as the comps are reasonable and not just stupid QM comps. After all, QM might randomly put together a great counter to a reasonable team you might expect to see drafted that you never would have thought of before.\nCursed Hollow: 1) Alarak, Morales, Tracer, Stitches, Butcher vs 2) Sylvanas, Muradin, Li Li, Li-Ming, Lucio Team 2 wins pretty handily. This is the match where I said Li Li's cleanse seemed fine. On the surface these both seem like conceptually reasonable teams. Stitches, Alarak, and Butcher sound like a pretty great gank squad and dive comp, with Tracer there to finish anyone who might slip away a little. But they were a primarily AA team and the blinds were sufficient to both reduce their damage and allow time to heal with double support. This wasn't a crazy blowout - they often got several of us down to very little life - but they scored 5 deaths total the whole game. Butcher was a non-issue with cleanse + blind and Muradin did a great job of peeling for our substantial back line. Team 1 definitely needed some AOE - any of the big 3 mages in place of Butcher would have been good. And Morales wasn't a great pick.\nSpider Queen: 1) Diablo, Li-Ming, D.Va, Uther, Greymane vs 2) Varian, Rehgar, Sylvanas, Anub, Sonya Team 1 took this one pretty handily. The combination of Diablo, D.Va, and Uther turned out to be a lot of stun lock and displacement so that our melee heavy team couldn't engage.

Even if you are living alone, you will never feel left out at all. At least, you could always have someone to talk to and play with. Humans are emotional being. Hence, it is important for their physical and mental health to have a company. They got to have some friends. They should have a family.\n\nJust imagine this. Every time you arrived at your apartment, even for the fact that you are living all by yourself, someone on your front door would greet you. As a human being, it is normal to feel lonely. This unique nature of yours is what makes you special and unique. Of course, some animals, like your pet, could feel the same way too. That is why try to help out each other. Strengthen your relationship. To keep them productive and jolly, you better let your pet visit the animal communication Colorado clinic. If possible, reconsider availing this service. This is important. Animals are living things. That only means that they are quite prone to illness too.\n\nIndeed, knowing that they are suffering, leaving the matter aside could be quite disastrous. If you really love something, it will be pretty shameful on your part to just ignore it. That is always provided. Therefore, make sure to always act kindly to your pet. Now, find someone who could support and evaluate their health.\n\nDepending on someone who lacks potential could be quite shameful. That actions of yours would only waste your time and even your efforts. You are not worthy of that treatment, though. Not even your pet. You know it. Hence, starting today, look for someone credible.\n\nRegardless how interesting their services and promotions could be, never miss checking their reputation. Determine how skillful their people are. Find the reason why you need to trust them compared to other medical providers. Be meticulous. You would be making various types of investments.\n\nCertainly, their marketing strategies are quite different. Their services, their promotions, and even their customer programs. Their policies, extended services, and even their target market, it is quite obvious that they give you several options. Try to look forward to it. They are not a hindrance. Rather, try to view them as an opportunity that you need to grab.\n\nThere are more than what is mean the eyes. Do not just things by its cover. As a client, you have an obligation to pay for the service. This is not for free from the very beginning. In exchange for your investment, giving yourself competitive returns is the best reward you could have. Stay logical. When getting some prospects, hear out the opinion of the public.\n\nWhen listening for an advice, it is essential that you have evaluated the standards of your speaker. You see, if their standards and bars in choosing a prospect are quite lower than yours, there is a chance that all of their advice would never satisfy you. For them, everything might be fine. At the end, they might take the service without knowing their rights and privilege.\n\nGetting their advice and recommendations might help.

Instead it is about schedules just not lining up.\nI think it's both. The reality of a league is that it's going to take time from people to make it work, and as the season drags on (especially with teams that aren't doing as well) the motivation to make the time tends to dissipate. Also, if you have a team with some \"try-hards\" and some more casual, the THs will want to spend additional time practicing, and the more casual folks will probably not be willing to put in the time.\nScheduling 10 people together is a whole other thing that will tend to extend the season, as we saw for example Ducks had to drop and Knight thought he had to drop at the last minute. That affected 2 out of the 4 teams.

In ideal case (bin file never exceed 64kB) you can use minimalistic settings - copy data from UART directly into RAM then flash data from RAM into PFLASH and verify with Server if the data are correct. In this case it is possible use binary file send from terminal.\nUsing srec is more universal - but more complicated. You will need server side application which is sending data on client (S32K144) request (for example one srec line).

Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

This allows him/her to choose a new Talent from 1/4/7 upon completing a questing talent.\nThe 1, 4, 7 talents would have 3-4 quests each. Realistically you wouldn't finish all the quests (depending on the difficulty), but stacking talent rewards makes you very strong in the long run. This would also allow you to react to your opponent's talent choices and adjust yours to compensate.\nThematically, you'd play as the Chosen One (Male and Female skins by default) that starts weak and becomes the super-strong late game hero. Probably best to throw this character into a multi-class role with the level 1s dictating your direction (assassin, warrior, or support). Each quest completion makes your Q/W/E abilities upgraded over time.\nOne Ult option is called \"Journey's End\": Choose a friendly hero (yourself included) and auto-complete a Talent Quest. One-time use.\nYup, that Convection or Master's Touch talent being useless is now complete! Your main Tank just completed a 20-30 Orb quest! Unlock Raynor's Marksmen quest or Alarak's Lightning stuff. Your Nazeboo not gonna reach 175 stacks? You got him covered (granted he'll be lower on health and mana though). How about maxing out Azmo's Dunk at 500 damage? So yeah, you don't get a 4th ability, but can enable yourself or teammates to become stronger.\nThe level 20 upgrade to this ult is called \"A New Calling\": Journey's End has a 90 second cooldown. Limited use in low to no quest groups, but gives you a boost every minute and a half longer the game continues.\nThoughts? OP? Lame? Too situational?

when the new location is better than the previous one. However, setting things up can be quite a struggle especially when individuals have no help. Hiring Roanoke movers makes relocating much more enjoyable. This is because these professionals are involved in doing most of the work.\n\nA reputable company is the best to work with as they have made these moves a thousand times over. They are therefore aware of difficulties of the business and know how to deal with the common challenges faced. These moving experts are also aware of the special way certain things need to be packed so that they remain in perfect condition during the process.\n\nDuring packing, items of a particular room can be put in the same box. If they cannot all fit, they can be put in different boxes that are marked to indicate where they belong. Also, once they have been moved, arranging and removing the items from the boxes will be easy. This is because boxes will be moved to the specific rooms so that unpacking can begin. Similar items will most likely be in the same place.\n\nKnowing the right routes to use is important. In case the company is not aware, clients can help with the information. Planning on how to move is important depending on what is being transported. The path used determines how fast or slow the move will be done especially if there is traffic. There should be alternative paths to use in case there is some difficulty when using a particular one.\n\nProperty can easily be damaged during moving. Having moving insurance can save an individual from incurring extra costs. The moving company should be in charge of the items as long as they are in their hands. These relocation service providers may have insurance packages for those who are interested. Individuals need to understand the kind of coverage offered before signing up for everything.\n\nClients can contact their current insurance company to find out if they are covered while they are moving. If this aspect was not part of their initial insurance, they might be asked to add a small amount of money so that they can get this benefit. If their insurance agency does not offer this service, they may need to seek other reputable agencies to work with.\n\nUsing trucks to transport items to a faraway place can be time consuming and expensive in terms of fuel. There may be certain places that work as stopovers with special spaces to keep the property belonging to clients. A special fee will need to be paid for those who are in need of these services. The money needed will depend on how long the things will be held in storage.\n\nIt is important to ask all the relevant questions regarding the moving experience when with professionals. The amount of money to be paid for the service is a discussion that must be held. This is an opportunity for clients to negotiate and hopefully be given a fair price. The further the destination, the more a person will be required to pay.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nFind a list of the benefits you get when you hire Roanoke movers and more info about a reliable moving company at http://www.acemovinginc.com right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "timothy edwards", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "roanoke", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:29.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54d04babb18f8cf07a91c5a9f8aa7983721b6501", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpRsk.Tzcz84iaZ01MOA9Ddxw9HDhrT3UjmrXpPqN95Wfd8hokPy5PtpSsUxyMfoCmjy_8N_H3Mea7h05L6z1Qhag5_qqJ5UhxnyTQ_6K8MHNg--", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/service", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Service Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals", "title": "Neil Young - Online Archive Service - Free Access Until 30th June 2018", "title_full": "Neil Young - Online Archive Service - Free Access Until 30th June 2018 - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-06T02:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 41, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2848476_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b7dd8d20673187c3327d02b84e2761da1ac216f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpRsk.Tzcz84iaZ01MOA9Ddxw9HDhrT3UjmrXpPqN95Wfd8hokPy5PtpSsUxyMfoCmjy_8N_H3Mea7h05L6z1Qhag5_qqJ5Uhxl0gE2Bo0VA7rCuPE.jtoTe", "ord_in_thread": 21, "author": "webhose.io", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Superb find Boz.
