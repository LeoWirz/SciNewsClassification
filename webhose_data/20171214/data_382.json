Despite the development of new treatment options in the past decades, IFI remains a concern due to substantial morbidity and mortality in these patient populations. In addition, the increasing use of new immune modulating drugs in cancer therapy has opened an entirely new spectrum of at risk periods. Since the last edition of antifungal prophylaxis recommendations of the German Society for Haematology and Medical Oncology in 2014, seven clinical trials regarding antifungal prophylaxis in patients with haematological malignancies have been published, comprising 1227 patients. This update assesses the impact of this additional evidence and effective revisions. Our key recommendations are the following: prophylaxis should be performed with posaconazole delayed release tablets during remission induction chemotherapy for AML and MDS (AI). Posaconazole iv can be used when the oral route is contraindicated or not feasible. Intravenous liposomal amphotericin B did not significantly decrease IFI rates in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients during induction chemotherapy, and there is poor evidence to recommend it for prophylaxis in these patients (CI). Despite substantial risk of IFI, we cannot provide a stronger recommendation for these patients. There is poor evidence regarding voriconazole prophylaxis in patients with neutropenia (CII). Therapeutic drug monitoring TDM should be performed within 2 to 5 days of initiating voriconazole prophylaxis and should be repeated in case of suspicious adverse events or of dose changes of interacting drugs (BIItu).

(EPA/Yonhap News) Already reeling from the withdrawal of NHL athletes, organizers fret that viewership and quality of events will suffer further The Pyeongchang Winter Olympics taking place on Feb. 9\u201325, 2018, have suffered a major blow with Russia\u2019s ban for doping. Already reeling from the National Hockey League\u2019s (NHL) announcement that it would not be competing, the games stand to suffer even more in terms of viewership and substance if winter sports superpower Russia boycotts and refuses to allow qualifying athletes to compete as individuals. \u201cThe best thing would be to have the Russian team participating and carrying the flag, but we don\u2019t have the power to oppose the IOC\u2019s decision,\u201d said Pyeongchang organizing Committee president Lee Hee-beom on Dec. 6. For now, the committee can only sit and watch what Russia does next. Russia is traditionally a major force in the Winter Games. The New York Times reported the same day that Russia had athletes capable of medaling in 32 events, or roughly one-third of the 102 events in next year\u2019s games. It was considered a leading candidate for gold in four events: women\u2019s single figure skating, the men\u2019s biathlon relay, and the men\u2019s team sprint freestyle and skiathlon in cross-country skiing. It was also expected to medal in most cross-country events and men\u2019s ice hockey. At the 2014 Sochi Olympics, Russia took 33 medals, including 13 gold. If Russia does boycott, fans will miss out on its athlete\u2019s outstanding capabilities. Interest in the games is also likely to decline not only in Russia, but also in former Eastern Bloc countries. \u201cThe Russian ice hockey team reserved 30 to 40 hotel rooms in Gangneung and purchased a large number of tickets,\u201d a Korea Ice Hockey Association source said. \u201cIf Russia does boycott, that will impact our ability to draw audiences,\u201d the source fretted.

A lightning strike in the Malibu Hills starts a brush fire, that burns out of control. By early on the 25th, half of the Los Angeles Basin is either burnt or engulfed in random fires. Latest revision as of 08:52, December 7, 2017 \nNovember 13th, 1989 - A set of crab-eating macaques are imported from the Philippines and arrive at the Hazleton Research Products facility in Reston, Virginia. Unbeknownst to the staff, they have developed a mutated form of the Ebola Zaire virus, that is airborne (but not lethal to the monkeys). 11:00am-- Kyle Jurgenson and Mark McClendon at HRP are infected that first day, and spread it to all of the facility. Jurgenson leaves work, with a headache and upset stomach at 3:00pm; McClendon does as well at 4:15pm. The staff closes up at 5:00pm and most return to their homes. 5:39pm-- Bonnie Wilson, the firm's bookkeeper stops at a local 7-11 and buys gas and a ginger ale, as her stomach is bothering her. She infects seven people, including the clerk. One of those she infects is flight attendant Jessica Mankowitz, who proceeds to her scheduled flight to Paris, departing at 10:pm \nNovember 14, 1989 - Kyle Jurgenson returns to work at 8:30am, but leaves again when he starts vomiting. Mark McClendon stays home as his vomiting has gotten worse and he remembers he still has some sick days left. His wife, Renee, was infected the night before, as was their four year old, Emily. 9:00am-- Jessica Mankowitz on USAir Flight 52 to Paris has infected the entire aircraft. By the time it touches down at Charles De Gaulle Airport the following morning, 130 people (including the crew) have the virus and spread out into Paris. Forty of them have connecting flights to Geneva, Moscow, Oslo, and Rome. \nNovember 17, 1989 - Rushed to the hospital by his friend Frank Logan (who he infected two days earlier), Kyle Jurgenson is now suffering from severe dehydration and bloody diarrhea. Mark McClendon is as well, as is his wife and child. All three are taken to the Reston Hospital Center. Doctors are stumped by the men's conditions, but spot it as obviously an infectious disease. They are of course immediately infected by the admitting staff who brought the men in. 1:45pm-- Jessica Mankowitz, back from France since the 15th, calls in sick from her apartment in Alexandria, Virginia. \nNovember 18, 1989 - Several dozen cases of \"fever and nausea\" are reported at Washington area hospital emergency rooms. Most are dismissed, and sent home with anti-emetic and anti-fever prescriptions. Paris reports to the French Health Ministry a \"surprising increase in fevers\" in the Paris metropolitan area. 3:15pm-- Dr. Lawrence Luddens, of the Reston Hospital Center, cuts short his phone call with the Atlanta CDC, complaining of nausea. The CDC Director puts together a team, to fly to Reston the next morning. 5:00pm -- By five o'clock on the afternoon of the 18th, every member of the Hazleton Research Products staff are now admitted to the Reston Hospital Center. \nNovember 19, 1989 - Kyle Jurgenson, Mark McClendon, and 4 year old Emily McClendon are now in serious condition. Vomiting has subsided with lack of material in the stomach, but diarrhea continues and some blood is now found in the liquid stool. Jessica Mankowitz is rushed to the Alexandria Virginia hospital by her roommate, when her fever hits 101. 11:00pm-- Paris' main hospital now has 38 cases of \"extreme fever and nausea\". A local physician and expert on hemorraghic fevers, Dr. Marc LeVoisier, recognizes the symptoms as possibly Marburg or Ebola. He calls the French Health Ministry. \nNovember 20, 1989 - Kyle Jurgenson goes into a coma. Upon palpation by an attending physician, it's discovered that his liver is failing and possibly his kidneys as well. In fact, both are. Mark McClendon goes into a coma just before midnight. Bonnie Wilson and three Hazleton staff have fevers in the 101-103 range and bloody diarrhea. Los Angeles, Bonn, Moscow, Stockholm, London, Dublin, Tokyo, Beijing, Jerusalem, Istanbul, and Lahore, Pakistan...all report \"strange fevers\". \nNovember 21, 1989 - Emily McClendon dies at 1:32am. She is the first fatality, but Kyle Jurgenson joins her less than seven hours later. By now, the entire staff at the Reston Hospital Center (as well as some 70% of the city of Reston itself) is infected. Most are still in the early stages, but admitting staffs are now in the isolation ward. Every bed in the Reston Hospital Center is full and attempts at isolation and barrier nursing fail. 1:00pm-- The Director of the CDC and the director of the Army Infectious Disease center meet in special meeting with President George Bush. In attendance are Vice-President Quayle, Secretary of State James Baker, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan, the acting Surgeon General James Mason, as well as the CIA and FBI heads and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. The meeting lasts for two hours; President Bush cancelling appointments with Congressional leaders and the Ambassador of Australia. Unknown to all, including himself, Acting Surgeon General Mason is infected (contacted third-hand by a staffer, who had eaten at a Dulles Airport food vendor, who had talked to Jessica Mankowitz almost a week earlier. He infects the entire meeting, including President Bush. After the meeting, a protocol is initiated to try to contain the virus at Reston, by sealing off the city with Virginia National Guard units. Just before it is put into place, reports from the CIA and State Department indicate that Paris has had its first fatality, a child on the flight with Mankowitz; at nearly the same time, reports are flooding in from half the major cities in the United States. Containment has been lost. Another emergency meeting is held at 7:00pm. President Bush is advised by SoD Cheney to go on national television, declare martial law, and impose a strict \"stay in your home\" curfew for two days. The Surgeon General, CDC Director, and USAMRID Director concur. The only way to stop further spread is to keep those not infected isolated. Secretary of State Baker objects claiming it will cause a national panic. He loses the debate as the Surgeon General tells him he has a massive headache and just took his temperature, and it was 99.4 degrees. Congressional leaders are contacted and warned of the impending move. Speaker Jim Wright and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell concur after hearing the evidence. (Though the conversations were made by phone from the Oval Office, both Wright and Mitchell were already unknowingly infected.) Hastily drafted, President Bush goes on television at 11:00pm. The speech is serious, but attempts reassurance. He states that a \"potentially dangerous flu epidemic\" has broken out but that it should run its course in a few days. Until such time as notified by authorities, people were to remain in their homes and avoid all contact with others. Martial law was being declared with a time-limit of the next two weeks. (Horrifically, Surgeon General Mason told the President those infected would likely be dead in 10-14 days and pose no further threat to those uninfected). (NOTE: Though well-organized and informed, the actions taken by the US Government between the hours of 1pm (the first Presidential meeting) and 11pm (the Presidential address) were totally wasted efforts. In that 10 hour space of time, nearly every international airport in the United States (and dozens of regional ones) had been infected. Between the afternoon meeting and George Bush's address time-frame alone, some 19 million Americans were infected.) \nNovember 22, 1989 - Panic ensued. National Guard and Army units (armed with respirator masks) were deployed, but by this time, almost 40% of them had been infected. When they meet with their local commanders to discuss how to deploy, they infect each other and the rate rises to 85%. \nMeanwhile, with no supplies, people rush to the supermarkets and hardware stores, furthering the spread. Police were quickly overwhelmed with minor assaults, traffic collisions, robberies, etc. Each time putting more and more of them at risk for infection. 500 people died in the first 24 hours of President Bush's announcement, and all from panic-related events. \nAs martial law goes into effect in the United States, it appears in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Soviet Union. Gorbachev (infected on November 21st after a meeting with the Swiss Ambassador) is already showing signs and the Politburo puts local generals in charge of the Soviet republics and provinces. Communicating with Bush, Gorbachev agrees with him, to put a lock-down on the Soviet ICBM force, cutting off underground bunkers from the outside world until the pandemic has passed. \nNovember 23, 1989 - Every member of the Hazleton Research Products staff has died by noon of the 23rd. The last, Jamie Kilborn, \"bled out\" with no one in attendance. Nurses and staff are almost non-existent at the Reston Hospital Center, as most have gone home or are too sick to help those even worse than themselves. \n90% of the White House staff and Administration officials are coming down with symptoms. 3/4ths of the Pentagon has, the Chairman of the Joint Chief refusing to leave his office, even as he is wracked with a 104 degree fever and painful diarrhea. (He dies two days later on the 25th in the Pentagon infirmary.) \nRioting has continued for nearly 24 hours. Most stores and groceries have been stripped and resupply trucks stopped or even hijacked on-route. Those who remained uninfected are now behind locked doors at their homes. Generosity and kindness are NOT rewarded, as many take in relatives and friends, unaware that they are already infected, thus dooming the entire household. \nMeanwhile at Ft. Detrick, Maryland and the CDC in Atlanta, attempts at creating a vaccine are in high speed. Unfortunately, anti-viral agents are relatively new and those tried merely slow the disease, not cure it. Also staff at those facilities are increasing getting sick and unable to continue to work. (By the 28th, 50% of the CDC staff is dead; 70% of the USAMRID staff at Ft. Detrick dies by the morning of the 29th.) \nNovember 24, 1989 - Every person on Jessica Mankowitz' flight to Paris from November 14th, is dead. Mankowitz herself dying on the 22nd; the last, Jerome Klein, dying in a crowded Mt. Sinai hospital ward at 4:35pm today. \nWashington, DC and Paris have been hit first and hardest. 1,889,000 people are infected in those cities. Of that, 74,000 have died and 383,000 are in comas and will die within 36 hours. Hospitals are now emptying out, as no new patients arrive, the previous ones die, and there are few staff on hand at the ones still operating. \nNational Guard units function at about 50%. Most have some infected personnel, but after respirators were distributed and bio-warfare protocols enacted, the rate of soldier-to-soldier transmission dropped to a degree. Road traffic is almost non-existent. Air travel has ended, except for a few private aircraft flown to TRY to escape plague-infected areas. (Thus spreading it further) \nNew York City and Los Angeles begin to burn. Arson is the culprit, as swaths of the Lower East Side catch fire and few FDNY units respond. It burns for hours, taking out six city blocks before a rainstorm damps it out. \nWatts and Compton in L.A. starts to see fires as well. Fed by Santa Ana winds, the fires spread quickly and eventually even metropolitan LA and the Hollywood area is threatened. A lightning strike in the Malibu Hills starts a brush fire, that burns out of control. By early on the 25th, half of the Los Angeles Basin is either burnt or engulfed in random fires. \nNovember 25, 1989 - President Bush is now feverish and approaching dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea. Mrs Bush and several family members staying at the White House are all bed-ridden. His personal physician is sick now as well, thus unable to offer much help. Vice-President Quayle attempting to co-ordinate efforts receives a report from Atlanta from the CDC. A person exposed to the virus...is showing no symptoms. They estimate that it's possible that 1 out of every million people may be immune. At first taken as good news by Quayle, he quickly realizes that that would mean 280 people in the ENTIRE United States may be the only ones to survive the pandemic. \nThe CDC attempts to check the patient's family, but information is getting sketchy as hospitals fail to return calls. \nNovember 26, 1989 - 70% of the city of Reston, Virginia is dead. The rest, aside from Melissa Chalmers , are severely debilitated or in comas. More than half of Washington DC will be dead by the end of the day; as well as 3/5ths of Paris, France. \nAs supplies run out, those who remained in their homes are forced to seek out food and water. The infection rate has declined, but spike again as those folks encounter the few ambulatory cases in Wal-marts, Costcos, etc. If they had waited another 3-4 days, they likely would have survived. As it is, the final infection rate in the United States reaches nearly 95%. \nCrime drops as those committing the robberies become too sick. Meanwhile, nuclear power plants (ordered by President Bush to enact shut-down protocols) begin to heat up as there are few if any staff to maintain them. The Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant in Haddam Neck, CT experiences a catastrophic meltdown at 11:53pm on the 26th. Most of the radioactivity is initially kept to the containment vessel, but as the slag melts through the flooring and hits the water table, radioactive steam and particle blast from underneath the dome. 5300 acres in Connecticut are contaminated, killing a few lingering survivors of the pandemic by radiation poisoning. Three other reactors go super-critical in the next three days. \nNovember 27, 1989 - The situation in the United States reaches its apex as the population is now 55% dying by the end of this day, 25% bed-ridden, and the remaining 20% showing first symptoms. At 4:35pm, President Bush dies. As no judge or Justice is allowed into the sealed-off White House, Dan Quayle has the Acting Attorney General swear him in, almost immediately Quayle's legs give out from under him and he is forced to stay on the sofa in the Oval Office. (His tenure as President would last 16 hours.) \nIn the nation, total anarchy reigns. No police forces remain intact, and only two battalions of National Guard and Army units are more than 50% active. Fires burn out of control in forty different cities. Some, who had escaped infection, die in the fires or the firestorms that are created. The population of the greater Los Angeles area is approximately 50,000 (from Malibu down to Marina del Rey). Chicago burns as it did in 1876, with the Sears Tower a giant torch lighting up the night-sky visible from the other side of Lake Michigan. \nAcross the world, chaos is the rule rather than exception. In the Mid-East, the Israeli Army collapses, as do the Egyptian, Syrian, Iraqi, and Iranian forces. \nNovember 28, 1989 - World deaths reach the billion mark. Paris is now 90% dead or deserted; Washington, DC is 95%. London, Moscow, Beijing, Mumbai, Singapore, Tokyo are all at 95% infected, 70% dead. Fires burn out of control in most of the major cities of the world; power and water systems have failed in most as well. \nIsolated villages in South America, Africa, Asia, Siberia, northern Canada, and Australia are untouched by the virus. Given the die-off of the infected, within a few days most will remain uninfected. Other problems will emerge. \nWith no industrial and agricultural base to draw on, many of these areas will suffer critical losses of medical supplies. Those capable of it will produce their own food, but at subsistence level production. \nNovember 29, 1989 - World deaths reach the 2.5 billion mark and continues. No one remains in Washington, DC, Paris, London, or Moscow. The immune now total about fourteen million world-wide; uninfected total about sixteen million, for a total of 30 million. The remainder of the 5.67 Billion people on the Earth will be dead in less than 48 hours. \nDecember 1, 1989 - World deaths reach five billion. There are some sixty people in the whole of Europe unaffected by the virus. (40 immune, 20 uninfected). Asia has only 3500 people, mostly Mongolian tribesman and isolated villages in western China. There are approximately 40 people unaffected in the United States (20 of these are USAF aircrew in Minuteman missile silos, isolated since the outbreak. They will finally abandon their posts on December 3rd, five days after their last communication from the Pentagon.) \nMeanwhile an explosion of insect life has occurred, primarily the necrophagous insects such as blow-flies, carrion beetles, and mites, which feed on human corpses. There will be (at the end of the pandemic) some 350 Million TONS of human flesh (5.67 Billion people X an average weight of 125 lbs) for them to feed on. (In addition to dogs, cats, and cattle...all victims of the pandemic as well...adding another 100 million tons of flesh.) \nDecember 2, 1989 - Alberic Kasavubu of the town of Elipa, Zaire is the last victim to die of the ironically named \"Ebola Zaire\" virus that has encircled the globe. Kasavubu watched his entire town die over the past three days, including his wife and two children, and then succumbs himself at 5:32pm GMT to 'bleed out'. Exactly 19 days have passed since Kyle Jurgenson and Mark McClendon were infected at the Hazleton Research Products facility in Reston, VA. \nSixteen million people survived to this point. Though 30 million escaped infection, 14 million of them proceed to die from other causes. These include things like appendicitis (untreated with no medical facilities or doctors), other diseases (some springing off of the mass of corpses, including cholera), and various and sundry accidents, illnesses, etc. There are some 70,000 suicides; people either despondent at the loss of family or friends or convinced that they are alone in the world, they end their lives. There are even 300 murders; people attacking other survivors for food and water (typically among the uninfected villages and towns). \nThe population of the Earth hasn't been at this level since the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt and start of the construction of the Pyramids....approximately 2500 BC. \nDecember 9, 1989 - Every nuclear reactor on the planet has now gone super-critical and either detonated (creating local \"Chernobyls\") or melted through their containment floor hitting the water table below, with much of the steam being released into the atmosphere. In Europe and the Soviet Union, sixty of the 500 survivors in those areas die within two weeks, from exposure to radioactivity. Another 600 world-wide will die from radiation poisoning as well. \nAt sea, nuclear vessels (often scuttled by dying crew to the bottom of the ocean) break their containment and spill several hundred tons of enriched uranium and plutonium into the oceans. Though thousands of fish are killed, due to the large size of the oceans, the effects are minimal and quickly dissipated. \nDecember 1989-March 1990 - Winter hits the Northern Hemisphere, particularly strong in Europe in the month of January. Sixteen survivors succumb there, killing all but 24 remaining (another 20 died from illnesses and accidents before the end of December). From Portugal to northern China, some 4000 die that winter. At this point there are places from Europe to Asia, where there may be ONE person for every one million acres. Individuals isolated from larger groups face a low likelihood of survival, even with tons of food and medical supplies available for scavenging. \nMarch-June 1990 - Spring arrives. Most of the corpses have been picked clean by insects and other carrion feeders. Out of control fires consume many of the towns and cities that survived, and temperatures are coolish as a sort of \"post-pandemic winter\" hits from all the smoke and ash from those fires. \nMeanwhile, plant life and wildlife are now encroaching on the previously inhabited areas. In the US, deer herds move into Boston, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Memphis, etc. Antelope herds move into cities in the West. Deer populations will spike enormously this spring as hunting and herd culling no longer exist. By 1993, the deer population of North America will be FOUR times what it was in 1989. \nRats now over-run every large city and even some smaller towns. Feral cats, who survived infection, feed and multiply off them, but the rodent populations are on an order of magnitude by 1990. Four survivors succumb to rat-based diseases or bites during the Spring of 1990. The rats will eventually begin to die out in the early 90s, with no food trash being created. Rodent populations drop to pre-Pandemic levels by 1995 and lower levels in the following years. Cockroaches too, deprived of human wastes and garbage, begin to drop in population after only two years. \nCracked pipes and faulty seals (damaged from the harsh winter and no repairs) open up tons of chemicals and toxic wastes in the industrial centers of the world, from the US Northeast and Midwest to the Soviet Union to India and China. Dioxins and other poisonous compounds are released, many into water tables, rivers, and lakes. This kills another twenty-seven people world-wide and induces cancer in forty-eight others that will prove fatal in less than 10 years. \nPetrochemical plants leak as well, and several are caught on fire due to lightning strikes. That effect is minimized though as most of the material has seeped into the ground. The areas are still polluted though for decades. \n1990-1995 - Of the 30 million who survived the Pandemic of 1989, almost 2/3rds are dead by the end of 1995. The world's population is approximately 11.5 million. This is approximately the population in the year 4000 BC. \nOf that, some 5 million (nearly half) exist in groups of less than ten. Mostly survivors who have found each other, and small villages that have weathered the non-Ebola diseases, winter starvation, and various medical emergencies. Sixty thousand babies are born in 1990, 40% survive the first year (only 63% survive labor and almost 20% of the mothers die in childbirth). Fifty thousand are born in 1991 and fifty-eight thousand are born in 1992. \nTechnologically, many things from the 20th Century are still useful. Firearms, if properly maintained, continue to be useful and ammunition supplies (from both gun shops and Army depots) is plentiful. This aids in hunting. Generators work, but gasoline and diesel supplies are running short by the mid-90s, with no further refinement. Medicines are rapidly degenerating and proving useless, but still in good supply. There are fifteen automobiles being operated on the entire planet Earth. \n1995-2005 - The Earth's human population is now stabilizing at about 10 million people. The largest contingent is a village in the upper Amazon region of Brazil, Manicore' on the Rio Madeira, with some 1300 people. Next is the village of Hatgal, Mongolia with 1140. Both have subsistance level farming and herding (one goat, one sheep and Bactrian camels). \nAll but four of the last sixty North Americans arrive at a campsite near Riverside, IA. Organized by three survivors who met in Riverside, they set up automated radio broadcast stations across Iowa and Missouri, alerting any fellow American survivors to meet in the town. By 1995, 56 of them have settled in the town (only partially destroyed by wildfires) and are gradually making a go of it. \nMelissa Chalmers , a UVA graduate student from Reston, Virginia, who was working on her genetics master's degree is one of the leaders of the community. Aiding with basic sanitation and medical needs, she soon realizes that \"genetically\" the group has little chance of survival long-term. \nThere are only sixteen females of child-bearing age in the group. (34 total females, but 18 of them are over 45 years old). To keep a group from inter-breeding and developing long-term genetic abnormalities, they are going to need at least another dozen fertile females at least. Though some in the group show little concern for the matter, several others realize that they've got to try to contact other survivors in North America, if not the world. \nThe four not at Riverside, Iowa are: A woman in the hills of Kentucky near Barbourville. She dies of exposure in February 1999, when she breaks her leg while gathering firewood and freezes to death before she can drag herself home. A teenage boy in Yakima, Washington eats a can of soup on May 9th, 2000 and dies three days later. The can had been microscopically pierced while he was scavenging it from a local store and he died from botulism. In August 2001, actor David McCallum of \"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" fame, who had survived the Pandemic and the destruction of Los Angeles, dies of radiation poisoning from fallout from the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Plant. McCallum, 68 years old, had not seen another human since 1989, but had heard a broadcast from the Riverside Survivors and had started to make his way across southern California, when he travelled through a mass of radioactive debris in Kern County. Maria Lourdes Lopez, living on a farm outside of Nuevo Laredo, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, died on April 5th, 2003 from tetanus received while adding old wooden boards to the side of her house. \nJanuary 2008 - As the 20th anniversary of the Pandemic approaches, the Riverside Survivors are continuing to try to contact other survivors but with little luck. Short wave radio is set up and a survivor in the Vancouver area, Larry Jessup (who was not immune, but had been isolated while doing research on tern migration in Alaska) was contacted and reached Riverside in May of 2006. \nMelissa Chalmers continuing to point out the \"genetic\" danger the group was in, had organized a \"breeding schedule\". Though embarrassing and cause for not a few internal arguments among the group, fertile females were impregnated on a rotating schedule by different males in the group. By late 2007, sixteen children had been born and survived to late childhood. The fathers were categorized and to prevent cross-breeding, some men were no longer allowed to have unprotected sex with some females. \nChalmers herself had five children in the space of ten years with four different men. Larry Jessup was the last and he was her lover until her death on January 17th 2008. She died in childbirth, with the infant (a daughter named Melissa surviving). An uncontrollable (by the midwife available) hemorrhage was the cause. Of the original population in 1989, she was the last surviving citizen of Reston, Virginia. \nIn the rest of the world, life proceeds, much as it did 6000 years earlier. Small villages grow with small spikes in their numbers. Diseases often destroy a village, as children die of many things treatable before the Pandemic and none are born to replace them before the adult women go into pre-menopause. Sixteen thousand people's communities will simply disappear in the next 40 years. \nOthers prosper. Materials begin to be scavenged from abandoned towns and cities. Tons of fertilizer and herbicides/pesticides still exist and remain useful 20 years after their manufacture. Unlike the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age (which had the equivalent population), many villages are familiar with ideas like crop rotation, irrigation, and even things like saddles for horses. This greatly aids in the development of their agriculture. \nHygiene and sanitation too are better understood to these remaining humans, as well as germ theory for disease, thus eliminating many ineffective \"home remedies\" and theories about contraction of illness. \nInter-community communications are almost none existent. The closest surviving villages are in northern Asia/Siberia, with two towns within 500 miles of each other. Trade and exchanges of marital partners will help them over the next decades in both growing as well as keeping a diverse genetic stock. \nPollution from the pre-Pandemic days remain. Primarily radioactivity and petro-chemical/plastic pollution. Areas around and downwind of destroyed nuclear plants will be uninhabitable for centuries. Petroleum and toxic waste will eventually break-down, but will pollute nearby water tables for decades to come and give rise to cancers in those who drink from them for as long or longer. Aside from radioactive \"hot spots\" though, in less than 200 years, much of the Earth's ecology will be as it was before the time of the Pharaohs. \nUsing previous history as a basis, it is unlikely that the world will again achieve a 20th Century level of technology AND population until at least 6500 A.D.

She is now taking independent steps which is amazing. \n\u201cWe are going to keep on encouraging her to walk on her own and hope over time she will be able to do even more independently. \n\u201cWe have signed up to do the Reindeer Run to say thank you to Smile For Life \u2013 they have helped us so much and we want to give something back to them. \n\u201cI think it will be a really fun day and something that Hope will really enjoy. If you\u2019d asked me a year ago if this would be appropriate for her I\u2019d have said no, but she has come on so much that with some help hopefully she will be able to do it. \n\u201cShe is so determined and loves moving around so it should be right up her street.\u201d \nSmile For Life, based in Gosforth, aims to change the lives of disabled and disadvantaged young people across the North East. \nAs well as providing an Upsee for Hope, Smile For Life joined with volunteers from Tesco Bank to re-vamp her garden, and took her and her family to the Peter Pan panto at the Theatre Royal. \nHadrian School pupil Hope, who was diagnosed with Ohdo syndrome when she was a baby, will be one of dozens of children taking on the Christmas-themed course at Coxlodge Community Association, Gosforth, from 2pm-5pm. \nChildren who take on the 1km course and obstacles will be given a goody bag and a free pair of reindeer antlers at the finish line. \nCharity Chief Executive Paula Gascoigne said: \u201cIt is fantastic Hope is starting it this year as two years ago we presented her with the Upsee which allowed her to experience walking for the first time and now she is able to take part! \n\u201cIt is a perfect example of how our work can change the course of a life. \n\u201cThis is our third annual Reindeer Run which is a fun and festive event aimed at all children in the community, those with disabilities and without. \n\u201cIt is a wonderful way for the whole family to have some fun and burn off some excess Christmas energy.\u201d \nChildren\u2019s tickets for the event cost \u00a310, while accompanying adults run free.

AkzoNobel, famous for well-known brands such as Dulux, Polycell and Hammerite has recently opened its most sustainable manufacturing facility in Ashington which is capable of producing 200 million litres of paints annually. Initially, Total serviced multiple sites by providing waste management and cleaning services for AkzoNobel before all production moved to Ashington in September. Nick Turnbull, Health, Safety, Environmental, sustainability & Security Manager at AkzoNobel, said: \u201cOur working relationship with Total Recycling Services has always been excellent and constructive. Dialogue between our site team and the Total Recycling team has been great and nothing ever appears to be a problem. \u201cWorking with Total aligns with our philosophy of zero to land fill, which is a major site goal. We have a wish to partner with companies who can demonstrate this. \u201cI know that all documentation is of the highest standards which gives the Ashington site confidence that waste materials are being handled and disposed of as sensitively as possible.\u201d Total Recycling has also undertaken training to AkzoNobel\u2019s personnel on waste management procedures, which have helped to support the company\u2019s targets and objectives. Sue Woodward, Commercial Director of Total Recycling Services said: \u201cEnsuring that businesses are making the correct commercial and environmental decision is top priority for us, and if that involves us having members of staff on-site or training our customers\u2019 members of staff we are happy to do that. \u201cAkzoNobel is a global powerhouse and we\u2019re delighted that they have shown such a commitment to building a sustainable future through their environmental principles. \u201cIn the future, I hope Total and AkzoNobel\u2019s relationship will grow and develop as we share the same vision for waste management and development of recycling initiatives. Nick concluded: \u201cSince moving to our new facility, we have been increasing production volumes.

(by Han Ju-yeon, special contributor) A survivor of the Sewol ferry disaster accepts the prize from the Friedrich Ebert Foundation \u201cMy hope is this will become a true country that considers people first, not money.\u201d Jang Ae-jin, a survivor of the Sewol ferry sinking that claimed the lives of hundreds of her Danwon High School classmates, shared her feelings at the auditorium of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Berlin on the evening of Dec. 5. Jang was attending the ceremony on behalf of the 17 million South Korean candlelight demonstration participants, who were honored with the foundation\u2019s 2017 Human Rights Award. \u201cThere were no injuries and no arrests at the candlelight demonstrations, and that is because everyone was united under one mind,\u201d she said. Jang was initially calm in relating her experience with the Sewol tragedy, but her tears eventually started to flow. She concluded her remarks with a message to two departed Danwon classmates named Min-ji and Min-jeong. \u201cIt\u2019s because of you that I was able to accept this award,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen spring comes again, I will do my best so that you don\u2019t suffer. I miss you a lot. I hope you\u2019re doing well.\u201d Around 100 overseas Koreans, exchange students, and other residents of Berlin attended the event honoring South Korea\u2019s \u201ccandlelight citizens\u201d with the globally prestigious Human Rights Award. Attendees watched a documentary by the foundation on the candlelight demonstrations and spent time reflecting on their significance. On the reason for its selection, the foundation explained that \u201cfreedom of peaceful assembly is essential to thriving democracy,\u201d adding that the candlelight demonstrations in South Korea had \u201cshared this important fact with the citizens of the world.\u201d Foundation chairman Kurt Beck said he was \u201cdeeply moved\u201d in talking to the awardees. \u201cI vividly sensed that South Koreans claiming their own destiny is a real phenomenon,\u201d he said. Beck also explained that Germans sympathized especially deeply with the South Korean demonstration because of \u201cour own experience with candlelight demonstrations in East Germany leading to peaceful reunification in 1989.\u201d \u201cEven if it runs into obstacles with the interests of different powers amid the Korean Peninsula\u2019s division, we hope the South Korean government gains strength from the fact that it has an awakened public behind it,\u201d he added. Niels Annen, a Social Democratic Party member of the Bundestag, said the candlelight demonstrations \u201cpaved the way to democracy.\u201d \u201cAll of you have contributed greatly to achieving democracy. You showed that democracy is not limited to voting,\u201d he said by way of congratulation. In addition to the award ceremony, a discussion was also held on the South Korean \u201ccandlelight revolution\u201d last year. Korea Alliance for Progressive Movement co-chair Park Seok-woon said South Koreans had \u201cchanged administrations through a citizens\u2019 movement\u201d and noted that \u201cmeaningful reforms are being attempted,\u201d but added that \u201cpeople still don\u2019t sense the change in their own lives.\u201d \u201cThe efforts to eradicate deep-rooted vices and achieve major reforms have been slow to progress. The candlelight struggle needs to be fulfilled as a candlelight revolution,\u201d Park said. Also attending the ceremony that evening was Japanese military comfort woman survivor Gil Won-ok, who was in Berlin to donate funds for female refugees from Africa.

In the speech, Moon emphasized using the idea of regional economic development in northeast Asia as a way to resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. (Yonhap News) The administration is looking to create a \u201cnew economic road map for the Korean Peninsula\u201d The Presidential Committee on Northern Economic Cooperation (PCNEC) released findings on Dec. 6 from a survey on South Korean attitudes on Northern economic cooperation. The results showed a large number of South Koreans holding positive attitudes on President Moon Jae-in\u2019s \u201cnew Northern\u201d and \u201cnew Southern\u201d policies. Headed by chairperson Song Young-gil, the PCNEC is a presidential organization created at Moon\u2019s instruction in August to handle economic cooperation with Russia and other northern countries. The two-day survey by the polling organization Hankook Research was carried out at the PCNEC\u2019s request on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, with 1,000 adult men and women nationwide questioned (\u00b13.1% margin of error with a 95% confidence level). A total of 78.3% of respondents agreed that the \u201cnew Southern\u201d policies strengthening cooperation with Southeast Asian countries would help revitalize the South Korean economy. The new Northern policies, which involve stronger cooperation with Russia and other Eurasian countries, were viewed positively by 67.6% of respondents. In the case of economic cooperation with Indonesia, Vietnam, and other Southeast Asian countries, 36.5%of respondents said the policies would be \u201cvery helpful\u201d to the South Korean economy, while 41.8% said they would be \u201csomewhat helpful.\u201d Only 6.1% predicted they would be \u201cnot very helpful.\u201d Respondents also showed support for economic cooperation with Russia, Mongolia, and Central Asian countries, with 26.6% saying the policies would be \u201cvery helpful\u201d and 41.1% saying they would be \u201csomewhat helpful.\u201d Anticipated economic effects of northern economic cooperation included \u201ceconomic structure diversification\u201d (64.9%) and \u201cincreased private-sector exchange\u201d (63.4%). When asked to name what should be the chief focus of northern economic cooperation, 37.3% said energy, while 24.7% answered transportation and distribution. In contrast, relatively few respondents said the focus should be on manufacturing and other industry (14.9%) or farming and fishing products (5.3%). The new Northern Policy focuses on promoting economic cooperation with Eurasia \u2013 including Russia\u2019s far east, the three northeastern Chinese provinces, Mongolia, and the countries of Central Asia. The plan echoes Moon\u2019s ideas for a \u201cnew economic road map for the Korean Peninsula,\u201d as stated in his speech in Berlin last July. The new Southern Policy was developed with eye toward broadening the scope of economic diplomacy from its focus on the US and China to include the 10 member countries of ASEAN, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Survey respondents were less favorable on the results of the northern economic cooperation policies pursued since the 1990s. A total of 34.8% of respondents said the policies had \u201cnot yielded economic results,\u201d while fully 40.7% said they did not know. Another 22.9% said there had been \u201cminor economic results,\u201d and 1.6% said the results were \u201cconsiderable.\u201d As reasons for the lack of success with previous policies, respondents cited \u201clack of mutual understanding and minimal human and cultural exchange\u201d (44.6%) and \u201clack of systematic policy efforts\u201d (42.7%).

December 2017 by Gateleyblogs \nOn an afternoon in January 2013, five men walked into a bar in London; a business owner with his consultant and three corporate brokers looking to secure some business. \nThe drinks flowed and the banter was good. Discussions moved on to increasing the price of business owner\u2019s shares and who should be incentivised and rewarded if the share priced doubled. Several pints later, and whilst laughing, the business owner, in front of those present, says to his consultant something along the lines of \u201c If you can get the stock to \u00a38 per share, why would I care how much I pay you, I\u2019ll have so much money it won\u2019t matter \u201c. The consultant shakes his hand and said something like, \u201c I\u2019ll hold you to that \u201c. The drinks continue to flow, the banter and laughs continue and a reward of \u00a315m for doubling the share value is agreed. They continue drinking and eventually go their separate ways. \nThe consultant believes he has an agreement for \u00a315m if the share price doubles. He says (in due course) that having been promised \u00a315m he, in effect, worked harder than expected. In February 2014 the share price has doubled and bingo, the consultant believes he will be \u00a315m richer. \nHowever, the consultant doesn\u2019t receive his \u00a315m \u2013 so he sues the business owner for breach of the verbal contract. \nThe claim went to the High Court where the Judge agreed with the consultant that the business owner had said he would reward the consultant with \u00a315m if he doubled the share price and that the share price had doubled. \nHad the consultant won? No. The Judge did not order the business owner to pay a penny to the consultant. \nThe Judge considered whether the requirements for a binding agreement existed \u2013 was there an agreement, was it intended to be legally binding; had consideration provided and was there enough certainty for the agreement to be enforceable. \nThe Judge decided that the requirements had not been satisfied, particularly the intention for the agreement to be legally binding. He gave 8 reasons for his decision: The setting in which the agreement was formed, \u201can evening of drinking in a pub with three investment bankers is an unlikely setting in which to negotiate a contractual bonus arrangement with a consultant who was meeting them on behalf of the company \u201c. Although an agreement could be made in an informal setting and the business owner had a history of conducting business in informal settings where alcohol was consumed, there was no evidence that he negotiated or concluded contracts at these types of meetings. The purpose of the meeting was to introduce the corporate brokers, not to discuss the consultant\u2019s remuneration. The conversation was jocular in nature and tone and the discussions about remuneration were mere \u201cbanter\u201d. It would make no commercial sense for the business owner to make the alleged offer and was not in keeping with his character. It was fanciful to suggest that the consultant could influence the share price to double. The offer was too vague for it to be taken as seriously, for example there was no reference to the work the consultant was to carry out to earn the payment and how that work would be measured. Besides the consultant, none of those present believed the business owner was being serious. The evidence also showed that the consultant did not initially construe the offer as a serious, e.g. it was not followed up in writing at the time or shortly after, and the consultant only took it seriously once the share price started to increase. \nThis case serves as a reminder that verbal contracts still need to satisfy the key elements of a written contract, including that the parties intend to create a legally binding and enforceable agreement. When considering a disputed verbal contract, the Court can take into account where the agreement was said to have been made and what was taking place at the time. This isn\u2019t to say that agreements can\u2019t be concluded in bars or restaurants, but that factors other than the words that are said will be taken into account. If in any doubt about the terms or enforceability of a verbal agreement, it is best to follow it up in writing. As in this case, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is! \nThis post was written by Peter Barr .

Cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), a family of proteins that are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, are frequently overexpressed or mutated in cancer. Hence, CDK-inhibiting drugs have been developed and evaluated as cancer therapeutics. Clinical trials have shown CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) to be relatively safe and effective, and these are now standard of care treatment for advanced hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Some CDK4/6i drugs are also able to cross the blood brain barrier and may, therefore, offer effective therapy for primary and metastatic central nervous system malignancies. Ongoing research is also evaluating CDK4/6i for additional breast cancer subtypes and non-breast malignancies with promising early phase clinical trial results. Finally, pre-clinical research has identified potential biomarkers for CDK4/6i efficacy and is exploring potential resistance mechanisms to this treatment. Further clinical-translational research is needed to advance patient selection and combinatorial treatment strategies with CDK4/6i in breast cancer and other malignancies.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2k4GJgN", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:29.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8086ea0b25ae44bbee95bdf1593e23f27ec98068", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RL20bMacrDdQZit4J.kywG8Q2sY2WINJJrHR6nI0mfu9.dL6TJCOVnUwOyL_Yv59sWbJ9eRv.dn1iH8jDpjrq4T4uVSxifosv6a6R5GANcXHOGVqFWYXXd767CrqhoBn49hFjKhRXKfVUd93asZAtGVnt4hbdlMvxw-", "site_full": "www.independent.co.uk", "site": "independent.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "The Independent - World", "title": "Jerusalem latest: Hamas calls for new Palestinian uprising against Israel after Donald Trump announcement", "title_full": "Jerusalem latest: Hamas calls for new Palestinian uprising against Israel after Donald Trump announcement | The Independent", "published": "2017-12-07T15:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/16/10/breaking-5.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 568, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "965e731f271a7b75cfbf6543d2eff36b91909962", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RL20bMacrDdQZit4J.kywG8Q2sY2WINJJrHR6nI0mfu9.dL6TJCOVnUwOyL_Yv59sWbJ9eRv.dn1iH8jDpjrq4T4uVSxifosv6a6R5GANcXHOGVqFWYXXd767CrqhoBn49hFjKhRXKfVUd93asZAtGVkfKSswB._RetP9laiE_djw--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "dubhero", "published": "2017-12-07T13:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "certainly.

But this declaration angered many other European powers. Shortly after the empire was formed, Britain, Austria, Prussia, Spain, Portugal, and various German and Italian states created the First Coalition. Napoleon conscripted hundreds thousands of French soldiers startlingly quick, a main factor to knocking the enemy off-balance. The massive French armies surprised Spanish and German forces during the early days of the war. A strip of land in northern Spain was taken during late 1793, and the army did not stop. Belgium fell during that time as well due to Napoleon's genius tactics. Large chunks of the dying Holy Roman Empire also found their way into French hands. The war ended in 1797 with the Southern Netherlands (Belgium) and the Rhineland in the French Empire. War of the Second Coalition Edit \n(Author's Note: In ATL, the British interests in India are more or less extinct. Therefore, the Invasion of Egypt doesn't happen. The French Army doesn't get stranded in Egypt, and when the Second Coalition is formed, there are more soldiers to fight with.) \nIn 1799, two years and a half years after the War of the First Coalition, the Holy Roman Empire, Austria, Britain, Russia, and many Italian states joined together to once again attempt to defeat Napoleon's empire. Some preemptive attacks on the French part in 1799 and 1800 captured more land in Germany and Italy. The two years between the wars had been spent in France modernizing the army and improving tactics. The Second Coalition was caught off guard by many of the newly thought up brilliant tactics the French used. Swiss soldiers also assisted in diverting Austrian manpower to the Alps, keeping them from using the armies against the French. Genoa was completely overrun by the French Army in a massive attack in 1800. Parma and Modena met similar ends when the French and Swiss met in the Po Valley to form an even bigger army. The war ended in 1802 after the Austrian army was smashed to pieces on two fronts. The war ended with the Treaties of Luneville and Amiens. France also successfully sold Louisiana to the American Empire in 1802 for financing the incorporation of gained territory into France. War of the Third Coalition Edit \nThe War of the Third Coalition started in 1805 when a combined French/Spanish fleet left from ports in France and Italy for Egypt. Nelson's British fleet had been misinformed and made a fatal mistake by \"chasing\" the French fleet into the Atlantic. Napoleon's army landed in Egypt soon after. The Ottomans there were not prepared for the massive French army. The Battle of the Pyramids was famous for the French victory, as well as numerous archaeological discoveries the French made. When news of the invasion of Egypt was heard by Nelson, he was ridiculed and humiliated. Infuriated, Nelson sailed at top speed towards Egypt. The French fleet had docked in Egypt and engaged the British in the Battle of the Nile. The British allies in Austria and Sweden were quick to join. The conflict in Germany was now the worst it had been for decades. Over two hundred thousand French conscripts kept up repeated waves of attack in Germany. This tactic proved to be costful and destroyed almost a fifth of the French army, but the enemies had ceased to exist. Austrian defeats in Italy, the Rhineland, and the Alps crippled their army. On Christmas Day, 1805, Austria surrendered. The Holy Roman Empire was no more, and France formed the Confederation of the Rhine as a buffer state. Egypt was now a French colony, and France and America had formed a powerful alliance. War of the Fourth Coalition Edit \nIn early 1806, the King of Prussia ordered his generals to plan for an invasion of French controlled Germany. Shortly after this, Prussia joined the Fourth Coalition. However, French spies discovered this several months before the invasion started. By the time Prussia sent in its army, they found a French army there. The War of the Fourth Coalition started shortly after. A French/Swiss/Italian army fought the Austrians on the Adriatic shore. The French fleet quickly landed a second large army into eastern Italy. Napoleon assumed command of the armies in Italy and took the Illyrian provinces from Austria. In Prussia, large swaths of land were added to the Confederation of the Rhine. The flow of soldiers throughout the French empire became smoother as horse-drawn railways are built at the Emperors heeding. The war was over by 1807, a French victory. The war ended with the continental system: a system of laws in effect in continental Europe forbidding trade with Britain. Portugal was the one country that refused to honor the decree. Invasion of Rio de la Plata Edit \nIn 1806, as Britain once again fought France and their Spanish allies, a new war started elsewhere. The Rio de la Plata in South America had long been prized by the Spanish and envied by the British. While the Spanish armada was serving under French admirals in Europe, the British easily landed several divisions of redcoats on the shores of Uruguay. Montevideo fell after three months of siege, and became the British headquarters for the invasion. What is OTL Uruguay is conquered by mid-1807, and more troops and settlers arrive to help with the conquest of Argentina. OTL/Modern provinces of Buenos Aires and Entre Rios are captured as well. The lack of Spanish assistance caused the birth of many pro-independence factions, which added to the confusion and turmoil on the continent. More British soldiers arrived in Buenos Aires shortly after chasing a band of pro-independence guerrillas into the wildlands of Patagonia. Those guerrillas allied with Mapuche Indians there and struck several more times into Rio de la Plata. Rebellious factions struck at the British in large cities, and still others smuggled in weapons from the Portuguese colonies in the north and from Mapuche outposts in the south. The last major event in the British invasion (excluding guerrilla attacks) was the Battle of Rio Plata (December 3, 1807), between fifteen British ships-of-the-lines/frigates and a similar amount of French and Spanish ships. Although more British were killed, the ground artillery kept the French at bay long enough for reinforcements to come and sweep away the enemy. Once colonihood had been bestowed on January 2, 1808, the war was over and Rio Plata was at last a British colony. The Peninsular War Edit \nIn late 1807, Spain declared war on Portugal with French backing. Napoleon sent one of his trusted generals to Spain with a medium-sized army. Nearly every major Spanish military installation was packed full with French soldiers. The Spanish army took action in November and invaded. While the bulk of the Spanish army was fighting, the French army kept the countries installations working. French systems such as railways and republic polls are made as well. Spain begins to resemble a \"mini-France\". After the war between Spain and Portugal (dubbed the First Peninsular War) ended, the Spanish fleet had grown considerably by capturing the Portuguese navy. The war damaged most of these ships, and many were taken back to the booming shipyards in France to be repaired. To bolster Spanish forces in Portugal, the French army sets up in the Pyrenees and in the foothills separating occupied Portugal and Spain. The Peninsular war started when the Invasion by stealth began. The French armies in Iberia turn against Spain and overwhelmed the country within months. All available resources are hoarded and brought back to France and a new pro-Imperial regime is set up. The Republic of Spain and Duchy of Portugal are both created as French satellite states. Guerrilla armies rage against French occupiers. With British assistance, several French outposts in Iberia are destroyed. However, many Spanish and Portuguese soldiers are no fans of the British and help the French. Large military bases are built in the Pyrenees to help keep the conflict from spreading into France. The one are that had remained under Spanish control was the Balearic islands. The puppet Spanish navy and French navy blockaded and besieged them, but many were fortified heavily. An invasion of Sardinia in the summer of 1809 weakened the Spanish strongholds in the Mediterranean and incidentally started the War of the Fifth Coalition. War of the Fifth Coalition Edit \nThis war stands alone so far out of the Napoleonic wars. It is the only war where France provoked combat, rather than another attempt at stopping Napoleon's regime. On June 22. 1809, thirteen French warships began bombarding towns in northern Sardinia. Just a week later, these ships landed and released thousands of French soldiers upon the island nation. Weapon smugglers fled for the Balearics, but not before a blockade of Sardinia was established. Most of these weapons were sold to pro-independence groups in Latin America. The rest went to puppet Spanish soldiers. While the French continued their conquest of Sardinia, more soldiers massed in Germany, preparing for an invasion of Prussia. The Prussians were equally wary. More soldiers stood across the border from Austria, leaving no room for them to maneuver. This tactic proved excellently planned when Napoleon led the army through the Illyrian provinces into Austria proper. As the French army smashed through Prussia and Austria, the French fleet once again invaded an Italian island. Sicily became a headquarters for French ships carrying troops to the Illyrian provinces. As the war dragged on, Austria and Prussia retreated and eventually surrendered. Prussia had been absorbed into the Confederation of the Rhine, while Austria was now just another satellite state of France. The war had been won after just a year of fighting. The battle for continental Europe was almost over. Napoleon only had one more opponent to fight. The War of 1814 \nAfter twenty years of continuous war between Great Britain and France, one war was the endgame. Although composed of many different real wars, the one event that set the War of 1814 of was the Invasion of Russia by France. Invasion of Russia \nAfter the end of the War of the Fifth Coalition, Napoleon looked east, towards Russia. Russia was the only country left in Europe that resisted the Continental Sytem. Now weakened after a decade of war, Russia was a promising target. Preparations Edit \nLike most of Europe, France was tired and near its limits regarding war. So before the invasion commenced, Napoleon began some preparations for what would likely be the largest war in history. French connections in the Ottoman Empire grew to an all time high, as imports and trade interests in India and Egypt benefited the Turks and the French. Turkey joined the planned invasion in late 1810. Napoleon also became allies with Sweden, who had just recovered from a war with Russia. All of the Scandinavian countries joined France's Continental Alliance in hopes of taking Finland back from Russia. Resources, food, and supplies are moved to depots and forts all along the Polish/Turkish/Swedish border. Over five hundred thousand French troops, one hundred thousand Austrians and Germans, one hundred and fifty thousand Turks, forty thousand Swiss troops, twenty thousand each of Portuguese soldiers and Spaniards, twenty five thousand Dutch and Belgian soldiers, and fifty thousand soldiers from various Italian states. Almost one millions soldiers, the biggest army modern Europe had ever seen at one time, had been assembled across the border from Russia. On February tenth, 1814, Napoleon sent one more peace proposal to St Petersburg. A reply never arrived. On March of the same year, the Invasion of Russia began. The Invasion Edit \nOn March twentieth, 1814, Napoleon invaded Russia after four years of preparing and building up an invasion force. The main branch of attack was aimed at Moscow, and was compromised of six hundred thousand soldiers of the Continental Alliance. Napoleon and his generals were in charge of this army. Two other smaller branches were based in Sweden and Turkey, and attacked in a tree branch formation with the main army. As the Grand Armee progressed through the plains of Russia and Belorussia, there was less and less to use for the army. The Russians had adopted a scorched earth strategy. This resulted in the loss of almost a hundred thousand troops by the time Napoleon was in the immediate vicinity of Moscow. Before advancing, Napoleon divided his army in three, commanding one branch and giving the other two to his best generals, Jacques MacDonald and a group of lower ranking commanders. Napoleon's army group was to invade directly into Moscow. The other two were to flank around the city for a relatively long range and meet on the other side. All resources and wagons were to brought with them back to Moscow. The other generals thought this tactic to be a needless waste of men, but they obeyed anyway. It took a week to circle Moscow. By the time the two army groups met inside the city, they had captured enough wagons full of supplies to keep the army alive. All the supplies were brought to Moscow, which Napoleon had made his headquarters. Massive armies of Russian conscripts attacked the captured city from all directions, but the enemy had destroyed much of their own supplies and were suffering for it. After crushing attack after attack, Napoleon led half of the men left to St Petersburg in June. The city had been heavily fortified against attack. Scandinavian soldiers had been besieging the city since the beginning of the war, but St Petersburg would not fall. Napoleon led over two hundred fifty thousand soldiers to St Petersburg. The French army set up ahuge naval blockade along with another blockade on the Russian Mainland.

Now, the video series is celebrating its 200th episode, a milestone deserving of its own time to shine. \nChico E-R Sessions was started in January 2014 by then-Enterprise-Record Entertainment Editor Leila Rodriguez and Ernesto Rivera to showcase local artists and musicians passing through town. \nRodriguez said Sessions was inspired but the Trolley series in San Diego, which features famous artists who play music in red trolley cars. She said Rivera and herself were drawn to the aspect of on-the-spot, one-take performances. Together, they brought the idea to Enterprise-Record Editor David Little. Be a featured artist \nAre you interested in participating in E-R Sessions or would like to suggest new artists? Email the arts and entertainment editor at . \n\u201cThe scene is just so saturated with amazing people and we wanted to showcase that and all of the incredible acts that come through Chico as well,\u201d Rodriguez said. \nLittle gave them the green light. They were then tasked with finding at least five artists to film, which ranged from local artists to visiting bands. To this day, Rodriguez said the first five videos they produced are her favorite. Chico\u2019s music community was also receptive to the idea when it came out. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve had really good feedback on it,\u201d she said. \u201cJason Tate, a bass player who filmed with us, said he would play the videos just in the background at work and said it was the perfect Chico playlist\u2014a slice of the music scene.\u201d \nSessions started as Rodriguez and Rivera\u2019s passion project. And, although the inspiration came from the Trolley series, most of the time, the videos are shot in Bidwell Park. The location they shoot at usually depends on the genre and feel of the artists\u2019 music. They\u2019ve shot videos all over town in obscure places like Cedar Grove, a barn, the Chico Paper Company, Rodriguez\u2019s backyard and even on a bus. \n\u201cWe went on the bus before, and that was really special,\u201d she said. \u201cThey gave us a private bus to film in and I wanted to do something a little different than just sit and sing. But, we film everywhere and anywhere.\u201d \nSometimes the musicians\u2019 sounds would get tricky to balance because of competing natural sounds from their scene of choice. Often times, the team has to find a way to avoid helicopters buzzing, planes flying, dogs barking and even passersby \u2014 specifically a man with a flute who wanted to play in the background of the shoot. The first videos also were only acoustic because they had one microphone, no equipment and the team didn\u2019t know how to edit sound. \nRodriguez said when James Chato joined the team a year ago, the professionalism of the videos soared because of his sound engineering skills. She also jokes that the professionalism started on Chato\u2019s first day when he showed up in slacks, compared to the more casually dressed team members. Chato swears he doesn\u2019t remember wearing slacks, but from there, \u201cthe rest is all a blur.\u201d Advertisement \nThe third team member is Jeffrey Fox, who Rodriguez said \u201cis very on the scene all the time and snags artists for videos.\u201d \nAlthough the team has evolved over the years with Rivera\u2019s departure and new additions, Rodriguez, Chato and Fox\u2019s team dynamic is what makes the video series successful. Each team member has a skill set that complements the others\u2019. \n\u201cJeff has a totally different aesthetic and is just so good with artists and talking with them. I tend to be quiet and technical, and James is good with talking to them too,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThe three of us together, it works well.\u201d \nThe 200th episode features Max Minardi, who has been an artist on the Session\u2019s bucket list since the series started. Scheduling conflicts were the biggest issue because of Minardi\u2019s busy music schedule. A few years back, the team and Minardi were able to connect. But, when they finally were able to settle on a date for the video, the microphone went missing at the shoot. \nMinardi said he was a big fan of Sessions because for the small community, the videos are \u201cmaking something that lasts and incorporating the local talent and making a big thing of it. \n\u201cI like sessions like this because it gives people a chance to really sit down with the song,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my favorite parts of Sessions is you can visit it as many times as you want and you can really dig really deep in to aspects of the song that you might not hear in a live show.\u201d \nMissing microphone and busy schedules aside, the video that has been two years in the making was finally filmed in the woodsy Cedar Grove in Bidwell Park. \nBy the next hundred episode milestone, Rodriguez and Chato said they still have a bucket list of artists they hope to feature. On the top of their list are local artists like Solar Estates and the Yule Logs. Chato also said he\u2019s looking to get nationally-recognized bands that tour through Chico. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great learning experience,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also been a privilege to have these artists entrust us to showcase their music weekly.\u201d \nReach reporter Bianca Quilantan at 896-7758.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jason tate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minardi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leila rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james chato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david little", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ernesto rivera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bianca quilantan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey fox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max minardi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rivera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "solar estates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chico paper company", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minardi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cedar grove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bidwell park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:30.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "715953de1950754852dadcec5f5c44d03d26ed20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRCUCyTWdXk.SaI8azfARXqDMa3QdAPB3G7pLFR.EkcqnbxBmLYg30U4fEjL15ey0wvgLdluKx_Pxk0w9BbuGRK_PgBsSB2rpX5ZgVid2Rb.CDzAL2B5Rtvz4.HH2Qe_O93Illvwoj25aAeatBg595mZAZKqiIFcfY-", "site_full": "ellecroneblog.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://ellecroneblog.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "18X10 Black 94-R 94RBP 8\u00d7170 0 Nitto Terra Grappler G2 285/60R18 Rims Tires \u2013 Elle", "title": "18X10 Black 94-R 94RBP 8\u00d7170 0 Nitto Terra Grappler G2 285/60R18 Rims Tires", "title_full": "18X10 Black 94-R 94RBP 8\u00d7170 0 Nitto Terra Grappler G2 285/60R18 Rims Tires", "published": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "715953de1950754852dadcec5f5c44d03d26ed20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRCUCyTWdXk.SaI8azfARXqDMa3QdAPB3G7pLFR.EkcqnbxBmLYg30U4fEjL15ey0wvgLdluKx_Pxk0w9BbuGRK_PgBsSB2rpX5ZgVid2Rb.CDzAL2B5Rtvz4.HH2Qe_O93Illvwoj25aAeatBg595mZAZKqiIFcfY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ellecroneblog", "published": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "18X10 Black 94-R 94RBP 8\u00d7170 0 Nitto Terra Grappler G2 285/60R18 Rims Tires", "text": "18X10 Black 94-R 94RBP 8\u00d7170 0 Nitto Terra Grappler G2 285/60R18 Rims Tires \u2013 Buy \u2013 18X10 Black 94-R 94RBP 8\u00d7170 0 Nitto Terra Grappler G2 285/60R18 Rims Tires ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "nitto terra grappler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nitto terra grappler g2", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nitto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:30.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d151a37e7179797e63968b790a0402c54ab1d620", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3I904nIplxyhwnYdI3d4IZlTT1Q7OdcOEsWmzfUsI1dNsHWZWV4hkhNEGio.dH8uPlXF8rieU_C0yA60bgW9NC0XcZ2Obs.zd0-", "site_full": "english.hani.co.kr", "site": "hani.co.kr", "site_section": "http://www.hani.co.kr/rss/multihani/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "\uba40\ud2f0\ud558\ub2c8 : \ub274\uc2a4 -

For the EU to insist that a non-member state abide by EU standards constitutes a violation of taxation sovereignty,\u201d the Ministry went on to say in the press release. The day before, the EU\u2019s Finance and Economy Committee, which was attended by the finance ministers of the 28 countries in the bloc, placed South Korea, along with Panama, Tunisia, Barbados and other countries, on a blacklist of \u201cuncooperative regions\u201d regarded as tax havens. South Korea was included on the list because of its Special Tax Treatment Control Act, which gives five to seven years of concessions on corporate and income tax for companies that set up shop in a free economic zone. The EU regards the act as a \u201charmful preferential tax regime,\u201d or in other words legislation that explicitly gives tax benefits to transactions with foreigners. Seoul contends that the EU\u2019s measures run contrary to international standards. The OECD and the G20 have been running a program to counter base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) strategies as part of efforts to prevent tax evasion, and in September they concluded that South Korea\u2019s subsidies for foreign investors did not constitute a harmful preferential tax regime. Those organizations had limited the scope of tax avoidance activities to sectors with high mobility, such as finance and services. The South Korean government is under fire, however, for having done little to address the EU\u2019s announcement early this year that South Korea would be included on the tax haven blacklist. During negotiations with the EU, countries including Switzerland, Turkey and Hong Kong avoided inclusion on the list by promising to revise their tax systems. In the end, all the regions on the blacklist except for South Korea are either small economies or self-governing islands. \u201cWhile this does seem unfair, the truth is that South Korea is nearly the only country in the OECD that explicitly provides preferential tax treatment to foreign investors. We will take this opportunity to discuss tax concessions for foreigners in light of the interests of domestic industry and international standards,\u201d said an official from the Ministry.

As we go to press, campaigners from Fairlie are gathering at Holyrood in bid to persuade MSPs to rethink the planning bill. Late submissions to the Scottish Government Planning and Environmental Appeals Division has resulted in decision date being pushed back to Friday December 8. Operators SSE have turned off the turbines since October, awaiting the final outcome. Representatives from Fairlie Community Council are joining other communities to gather outside the Scottish Parliament, urging MSPs to rethink new planning legislation that is being introduced. Fairlie Community Council chairman Rita Holmes and secretary Karla Tully are joining the demonstration which has been called in response to the Scottish Planning Bill \u2013 expected to be laid imminently before parliament. The villagers have been working with the grassroots Planning Democracy campaign who have been at the forefront of calling for an equal right of appeal to be included in the legislation, to allow communities the option to challenge controversial planning decisions. A statement from Fairlie Community Council read; \u201cThere is something very wrong, when a rejection by the Reporter can be appealed by SSE the wind energy company, but a consent cannot be appealed by the community. This despite the fact NAC have already asked that SSE`s Appeal be dismissed. \u201c Clare Symonds (Chair of Planning Democracy) said: \u201cWhat we are looking for is a level playing field when it comes to big planning decisions that can create major disruption to people\u2019s lives or seriously impact upon the environment.\u201d \u201cThe lack of an equal right to appeal is seen by communities as one of the most unpopular and unjust aspects of the current planning system. Research commissioned earlier this year by the Scottish Government found e that communities have a \u201cserious lack of trust, respect and confidence in the planning system\u201d. As things stand, the only option available to communities who wish to challenge a decision by a local or national government body is a costly judicial review.\u201d An SSE spokesperson said: \u201cThe Hunterston site has brought multiple benefits to the offshore wind industry as well as the local community over the past five years, SSE hopes to continue these benefits through the two year time extension and awaits the decision of the Scottish Government.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clare symonds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairlie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karla tully", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rita holmes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairlie community council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental appeals division", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scottish parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "holyrood", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:31.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "761700e635e9909ae94509c26c2848889415d247", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJX_.U98qckB9fBJcsYRU_7MwHCFIe4o67UbSMuaHaVwMDAH0AxklGu7INmQCin3l3XBtCVA1y6Akw--", "site_full": "nynj.backpage.com", "site": "backpage.com", "site_section": "http://newyork.backpage.com/online/exports/Rss.xml?section=4373&category=4401", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "backpage.com | trades & labor jobs | new york, ny", "title": "Robinhood App", "title_full": "Robinhood App", "published": "2017-12-07T06:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 949, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "761700e635e9909ae94509c26c2848889415d247", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJX_.U98qckB9fBJcsYRU_7MwHCFIe4o67UbSMuaHaVwMDAH0AxklGu7INmQCin3l3XBtCVA1y6Akw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T06:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "Robinhood App", "text": "Enlarge Picture Hey you, For as little as the price of a cup of coffee to get started.

Nevertheless, the field of oxygen-chemoreception still presents the general observer with a bewildering array of potential signalling pathways by which a fall in oxygen levels might initiate Type I cell activation. The purpose of this brief review is to address five of the current oxygen-sensing hypotheses.\nThe lactate/Olfr78 hypothesis of oxygen chemotransduction. The role mitochondrial ATP and metabolism may have in chemotransduction. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) hypothesis and its current role in oxygen-sensing by the carotid body. Reactive oxygen species as key transducers in the oxygen-sensing cascade. The mechanisms by which H 2 S, reactive oxygen species and Heme Oxygenase may integrate to provide a rapid oxygen-sensing transduction system. Over the previous fifteen years several lines of research into acute hypoxic chemotransduction mechanisms have focused on the integration of mitochondrial and membrane signalling. This review places an emphasis on the subplasmalemmal-mitochondrial microenvironment in Type I cells and how theories of acute oxygen-sensing are increasingly dependent on functional interaction within this microenvironment (see Abstract Figure).\nThis article is protected by copyright.

These Tips Can Help!", "text": "With regards to wine, we could all stand to know a bit more than we actually do. Being an expert in wine is a tell tale way to show off your sophistication, but this is much easier said that done. Luckily, the following article has a wealth of information that will help you learn all there is to learn about wine.\nAttend as many wine tastings that you can during the course of the year. This can be very beneficial for you as it allows you to get an idea of some of the newer wines that are on the market. This will help you to gain a better appreciation for all wine has to offer.\nPinot Grigio is a natural partner to a seafood meal. The flavors complement each other well. Other white wines go equally well with seafood. It makes for a tasty combination when you pair white wine with seafood.\nYou can make amazing pairings with your favorite wine. For example, you can pair a Chardonnay with either Gouda or Provolone. For http://www.news18.com/news/lifestyle/food-these-are-the-best-italian-restaurants-outside-of-italy-1559837.html , such as Cheddar, opt for a Cabernet such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Cabernet Franc. Zinfandel wines go beautifully with the more delicate cheeses such as Feta and Gouda.\nNot every white wine must be chilled before serving. They are not the same and have different serving requirements. While sauvignon blanc is best served chilled, wines like chardonnay and pinot gris taste better at warmer temperatures.\nIf you buy boxed wine, you can filter this into a nice glass decanter to improve the way that it looks. This is a great trick that you can use if you have to serve friends at a party or dinner. This will allow you to save money while giving off an elegant image.\nWhite wines do not always need to be chilled before serving. They are not the same and have different serving requirements. As an example, Pinot Gris is best served closer to room temperature.\nIf you are in the market for champagne for a wedding or other festive event, consider a sparkling wine instead. Sparkling wines are typically from California, and they taste similar to a Champagne. They are almost always less expensive, making it easier to afford a large quantity for big events.\nA decanter can be a useful product to have. If you have not been able to get one, or if you do not like them because of the time involved in using them, think about getting an aerator instead. They fulfill similar functions, and they are often easier to use.\nSo many tastes are available in wine, so have fun with them. When analyzing wines, you\u2019ll be breaking them down by their construction, pairings, and flavors. Instead, just enjoy yourself and choose things that you like.\nKeep a journal just for wine. The easiest way to keep track of the wines that you enjoy and the ones that you do not like is to keep a list of them. You can also include the foods that you drank them with so that you can repeat the experience if you like.\nYou can read as much as you like about wine, but ultimately, you have to decide for yourself if you like it or not. Price often doesn\u2019t matter. You may like an inexpensive bottle of red wine much more than a costlier version. Don\u2019t apologize for your tastes. Drink what you enjoy.\nMaking sure a Spanish wine is kept fresh is easily done, but there are different methods depending on its type. Rioja lasts up to seven years after bottling, and it is popular here. Storing your wine in a place that is dark and cool, such as a basement or closet, can really help to ensure you get the maximum flavor from your wine.\nIf you are out on a date or with someone you want to impress, do not order a wine that you have not had before. Try to order wine that you are familiar with, or know that you like. Be http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/howard-magazine/bs-mg-ho-howard-county-best-restaurants-2017-story.html in your own time, when you are not out in public.\nNo matter, how much you enjoy a particular type of wine, do not purchase a whole case of it. As your palate becomes more educated, your taste will change enough that you prefer another variety of wine. This could leave you with a supply of wine in storage that you no longer care for.\n\nNow that you have more information about wine, you can show off.

According to court documents, Wendy Haskell alleges Moon made \"unwanted and unsolicited\" sexual advances as part of her role as his assistant working for Sports 1 Marketing. Moon is the co-founder and president of the company. \nThe Washington Post first reported on the lawsuit Wednesday. The 61-year-old Moon has been working as a radio commentator for the Seattle Seahawks. The team announced later Wednesday that \"We have accepted Warren Moon's request for a leave of absence as the club's radio analyst.\" \nMoon played parts of 17 seasons in the NFL with Houston, Minnesota, Seattle and Kansas City. He threw for 49,325 yards and 291 touchdowns in the regular season and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2006. The former University of Washington star led Edmonton to five Canadian Football League titles before playing in the NFL. Advertisement \nAccording to the lawsuit, Haskell was hired as an executive assistant to Moon in the summer of 2017. The lawsuit alleges that Haskell was forced to sleep in the same bed with Moon on business trips while wearing lingerie. Haskell says in the lawsuit that she complained about the arrangement but that Moon responded \"this was the way it was.\" Additionally, the lawsuit claims Haskell was required to keep the bathroom door unlocked while she showered and Moon repeatedly entered the room. \nHaskell also claimed she was drugged by Moon during a trip to Mexico in October. The lawsuit alleges that Moon acknowledged drugging Haskell because he thought she wasn't \"having fun.\" She also claims Moon pulled off her swimsuit during the Mexico trip. \nThe lawsuit claims that Haskell reported Moon's behavior to Sports 1 Marketing CEO David Meltzer but the company did not investigate her claims. Haskell claims she was demoted after making the complaints. \nHaskell's attorney, Diane L. Fitzgerald, told The Washington Post her client had decided to go public with the suit. \n\"She was expecting to further her career in the sports marketing industry,\" Fitzgerald told The Post. \"She had no idea that her job duties were going to involve that kind of perverse protocol.\" \n___", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren moon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fitzgerald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david meltzer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wendy haskell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haskell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diane l. fitzgerald", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hall of fame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orange county superior court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle seahawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edmonton to five canadian football league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haskell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the washington post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kansas city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:31.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4fdbdc3c2e4548796ce294da12a3ca46d6100003", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pHOV0P4srq732Sj_5cDAM7_nGsK0Opa9RO7JgIqnUK1MX.OwSWNTBDpdp7B5r0t2y3zXWWNGrChKorXu2ahYLb7QcAcHd48LYRhNoENmYetugIKE_BC.tZYqfZgArVlRa0J0UeYXgZrF", "site_full": "medium.com", "site": "medium.com", "site_section": "https://medium.com/tag/self-improvement/latest?source=rss------self_improvement-5", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Self Improvement on Medium", "title": "The myth of \u201chaving an impact\u201d", "title_full": "The myth of \u201chaving an impact\u201d", "published": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 380, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4fdbdc3c2e4548796ce294da12a3ca46d6100003", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pHOV0P4srq732Sj_5cDAM7_nGsK0Opa9RO7JgIqnUK1MX.OwSWNTBDpdp7B5r0t2y3zXWWNGrChKorXu2ahYLb7QcAcHd48LYRhNoENmYetugIKE_BC.tZYqfZgArVlRa0J0UeYXgZrF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mostafa Ismail", "published": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "The myth of \u201chaving an impact\u201d", "text": "I want to change the world. Is this desire driven by an insecure ego in need of attention, one searching for glory and eternity, or is it a sincere honest desire to just make the world a better place\u2026\nI don\u2019t know\u2026\nBut the moment I decided that I was somehow capable of changing the world, everything changed. I was suddenly more energetic, more disciplined and just more joyful about my life.\nBut..\nMy day to day activities didn\u2019t change, I was still a student. I was now attending my classes, and focusing on my studies, because of the ambitions I had set out for myself, but nothing really changed.\nI felt trapped.\nI felt torn between a voice telling me to just stop everything and just \u201cgrind out\u201d my own path, and a voice that was telling me to be patient, and that the big change was coming, the big impact was going to happen soon.\nI thought that the bigger and more ambitious my purpose was, the stronger I will be, and the more disciplined I would be, and so I constantly told myself that I have to aim higher, and ask for more.\nI couldn\u2019t have been further from the truth.\nThe bigger and more ambitious goals didn\u2019t serve me, but they served my ego, providing satisfaction by painting an image of upcoming glory and recognition, and so I\u2019ve learnt that\u2026\nEgo is the enemy \nThis is a great book by Ryan Holiday , and I haven\u2019t even read it, but it\u2019s inspired me in countless ways, it\u2019s shown me where my error was.\nI learnt about it from a Youtube book summary by Fight Mediocrity. In it, Holiday explains how he reached success very early in his twenties, thanks to good fortune and luck more than anything else, and how his ego used that success to construct a \u201cnarrative\u201d, where all the success was due to his skills and hard work, and where all the failures never occurred.\nThis was it! This is why I felt trapped, I was trapped by my own ego.\nI thought that the key to success was setting huge goals that sound completely crazy, but I didn\u2019t realise that these goals had to be centred on me bettering myself, and not on changing the world, or even affecting other people.\nChanging the world and being recognized are desires that stem from our ego which seeks superiority, while bettering oneself has its basis in humility, since I need to admit I\u2019m not good enough to start doing the work to improve myself.\nMy goals are now based on getting better at whatever I do, I don\u2019t care about having an impact. \nTo illustrate this, I will share with you the small but valuable experience that taught me this.\nI arrived at university a year and a half ago. Back in school I was \u201cthe smart kid who did nothing and still got the best grades\u201d. This made me feel good about myself, or more accurately, made my ego very satisfied.\nBut when I got to university, this was crushed completely, if I didn\u2019t put the work, I didn\u2019t get the grades. This was frustrating and destabilizing.\nMy self-esteem and my confidence were battered, because these were built almost entirely on external factors, such as my grades, my friends\u2019 opinion of me, etc..\nI had to admit to myself that I wasn\u2019t that smart after all, that the only reason I was that good at school was actually because I paid really close attention in class, although I tried very hard not to show it. And that the only way I was succeeding at this (University), was by working really hard, and asking for help from those around me.\nThe result is: I\u2019m a better student. \nI also had to learn to build my confidence and my self-image on internal rather than external factors. I build my confidence on my hard work, and on what I create, not what grades I get, or how talented I think I am at something.\nI learnt to put my head down, and to work hard to achieve something small but important and it makes day to day life so much more enjoyable!\nI\u2019m no longer pressuring myself with this abstract idea of having an impact, of changing the world, but I\u2019m simply bettering myself, and if the time is right, and it\u2019s what the world needs (rather than what my ego needs) maybe I will get to change the world, maybe I will be well known for something, but that\u2019s not the goal, because I can\u2019t control that, I can only control my day to day life.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan holiday", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:31.043+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50db51bac9798a13df8cf1d343deb8183845f06a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gT.AZYqr_Njcw_FlEYeAhRo-", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/1011697/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Battlegrounds - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "(A) Aya RBGs", "title_full": "(A) Aya RBGs - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T12:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cb3fe5143be19fab2c7803e8f3de0b90061700cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gT.AZYqr_Njc7ET.ORH0SYR5GkozNZc9JA--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Reaper", "published": "2017-12-07T13:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I'll get on board with this!

Health Secretary Shona Robison told GPs at a special BMA conference that the move will ensure long term sustainability of GP practice. There are currently around 4,900 GPs in Scotland. Ms Robison also announced \u00a37.5 million in 2018-19 to recruit and retain GPs, particularly in rural areas. Support will be available for all 160 rural and remote practices, including \u2018golden hello\u2019 payments of \u00a310,000 to GPs taking up their first post in a rural practice and relocation packages of up to \u00a35,000. Ms Robison said: \u201cThe new GP contract, a historic joint agreement between the SNP Government and the BMA, will ensure that GPs are able to spend more time with patients and less time on bureaucracy. If accepted, it will help cut doctors\u2019 overall workload and make general practice an even more attractive career prospect. As multi-disciplinary teams are developed further within GP practices, our ambition is to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over ten years to ensure a sustainable service for the future.\u201d Added Kenneth Gibson MSP said \"The SNP Government\u2019s commitment to invest \u00a37.5 million, including expanding the remote and rural incentive scheme and relocation funds, will have a real impact going forward. Ultimately, this will ensure people both here in Ayrshire and across Scotland continue to receive a high standard of care.\u201d Chair of BMA Scotland's GP Committee Dr Alan McDevitt said: \u201cWorking towards delivering 800 additional GPs for Scotland is a sensible and realistic target for the years ahead. Together with the wider measures in the proposed contract to make general practice a more attractive career, I believe that this can have a significant impact on improving GP recruitment and
