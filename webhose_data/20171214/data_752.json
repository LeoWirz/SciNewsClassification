They are examples of things he is using and that he has presented about virtual reality. \nVicki: Virtual Reality is a new education paradigm. \nEnrique Chachafeiro @ @8bitbiologist is an amazing presenter. I have to give a hat tip to Dr. Lisa Durff, who is my research assistant. She saw Enrique present in Second Life recently about how we can really change things using Virtual Reality. \nSo, Enrique, why do you think that Virtual Reality is going to change everything in education? \nWhy do you think Virtual Reality is going to change everything? \nEnrique: Well, I think it has a number of advantages over other education technologies right now. \nThe biggest reason, I think, it\u2019s the tool to go to, is the ability for it to be in the cloud and accessible to a large number of students and to bring an unparalleled educational experience to them that you can\u2019t re-create in the classroom. \nVicki: So what are some of your favorite examples when you\u2019re trying to convince people that this is a great model? \nEnrique: Well, some examples that I\u2019ve either done or suggested to them in the past have been\u2026 \nFor example, if you\u2019re studying lakes in earth science, you know how many times can you get a classroom out to a lake to study the science of the lake. In Virtual Reality, you can do that whenever you want to. \nIn Second Life, I\u2019ve visited the surface of Mars, for example. I visited the Smithsonian\u2019s Rocket Exhibit that they have in Second Life. \nA number of other things that can happen a lot easier and a lot faster \u2014 for any school that has access to the internet. \nGreat examples of VR, not just for schools with funding. \nIt doesn\u2019t have to be just the schools that are close enough to a museum, or just the schools that have the funds to be able to send the kids to a lake, or to get the supplies or to get the kit. \nAll of a sudden, all you need is that access to get into the world, and then the sky\u2019s the limit. You can really bring all kinds of experiences to kids anywhere in the country. \nVicki: There\u2019s some incredible things you can do. \nI know I was in Dubai recently at the EduTEch Conference with my students. We were trying out Google Expedition with a full classroom kit. They all had on their headsets, and I was able to control things and mark things in the sky. They were like in space. \nAnd it\u2019s almost hard to get your arms around, isn\u2019t it? \nEnrique: Yeah. Yeah. The possibilities are\u2026 We\u2019ve just begun to scrape the surface. \nThere\u2019s much more development to be done in the future. \nWith the headsets that they have now, the experiences are fairly limited. Those basically kind of field trips that they do? Those are real nice, but I think that there\u2019s a lot more that we can do with it. Make it more immersive. Make the experience more all-inclusive. \nWithin the virtual environment, you get you learning, you get your assessment, you get your experience. Instead of just making it a part of the instruction, you do almost and entire instruction/lesson within the virtual environment through the tools they have. \nSo I think we\u2019ve only been scratching at the surface of what they\u2019re doing with it now. I think it has a lot more possibility for the classroom. \nVicki: So, Enrique, one of the challenges I\u2019ve had when I\u2019ve sued VR headsets is actually\u2026 I\u2019ve kind of had to appoint a student to be a watcher for the student who is in VR, because they really do lose a sense of the physical world because they feel like they really are in reality. \nHow does that work in classrooms? I mean I\u2019ve seen people have the kids on stools that turn around. I mean, what\u2019s the way that we handle the fact that I\u2019m in a physical world, but I\u2019m also in a virtual world in a headset? \nEnrique: Yeah, you definitely want to keep them seated. \nKeep your students seated so they are safe! \nVicki: (laughs) \nEnrique: It can be disorienting. You want to be on a chair. Otherwise you\u2019re going to have yourself a whole lot of kids flopping around all over. And that wouldn\u2019t be good. So you want to keep them on a chair. You want to keep the experience kind of contained. \nRight now, the experience is a little bit limited with the headsets. You know, you have two tiers of headset, pretty much, at the moment. \nThat\u2019s the high end Oculus Rift or Vive , which require a high-end desktop. If you had one of those in the classroom to play with, it\u2019s not practical. I don\u2019t believe it is practical in the future to use in the classroom. It\u2019s too expensive of a device, you require the desktop, teachers can\u2019t afford that, they don\u2019t have to room for the desktop. \nSo I think what we\u2019re waiting on, to really have the area explode, VR in education, are the mobile headsets that are running web VR \u2014 which we haven\u2019t seen a lot of yet. \nWho are the leaders in affordable VR for the classroom? \nThe technology for the web VR is there, though companies like SineSpace , Edorble , and Amazon just came out with Sumerian \u2014 which is based on it\u2019s A-frame technology, which can run virtual worlds on mobile devices. \nIf you couple that with the cheap Google Cardboard headsets, and now you can have a Virtual Reality experience for \u2014 a hundred bucks \u2014 versus eight hundred bucks. \nVicki: Help me understand the differences between web VR experiences and like, Google Expedition . \nWhat\u2019s the difference between web VR and Google Expedition? \nEnrique: So Google Expedition\u2019s basically takes a 360 image and drops in the middle of it. Or several 360 images. So then you can basically like you were there. They took a camera, they go around and they have these images they took of a place, and then you feel like you\u2019re there. Which is great! And if you haven\u2019t ever been to somewhere, that\u2019s fine. \nBut what I\u2019m interested in is how do I teach cell biology to a kid? How do I teach Shakespeare to a kid? How do we do instruction? \nVisiting places can expand your horizons, and let you visualize some things. \nBut what I want to do is much more hands-on, much more of, \u201cOK, I want to visit a lake. I want to be able to have the kid dip something into the water, collect the water, look in the microscope for the fauna and the flora, etc.\u201d \nI want all that done within the virtual world, even though they\u2019re in a classroom. We don\u2019t have the microscope. We don\u2019t have the equipment here. \nBut in the virtual environment, we can digitize and simulate that equipment and have the kids do the experience as if we had these thousands of dollars worth of equipment. \nIn a virtual environment, the kids can experience things as if we had expensive equipment. \nTo do that, we build a virtual environment like Second Life, where we can have digital microscopes, digital water, digital microbes floating around in the water they can see, etc. Re-create that. Just like Second Life, which runs on a desktop, but with that new technology, have that run on a mobile device that can be in the Google Cardboard so the kids can experience it. \nThe Google Cardboard devices \u2014 you can have a whole classroom set of those, have all the kids involved in the experience. Not just one or two on your very expensive Oculus Rift. \nVicki: OK, so you said it\u2019s not really there yet. Is there anything in web VR that\u2019s heading in the right direction that could help our listeners really kind of get a taste for this exciting technology you\u2019re talking about? \nIs any site moving in the right direction? Who should we begin to investigate? \nEnrique: Yes. Edorble.com \u2014 which is a virtual environment, a virtual world made for instruction. They run on a desktop client, but they have the beta that runs on a browser, so you could run it, say on a Chromebook. Chromebooks only run stuff that\u2019s on browsers. \nAnother one, SineSpace \u2014 which is completely web VR based. So all their virtual worlds \u2014 and they\u2019re free to join up \u2014 run on browsers. \nAnd the only thing with those two \u2014 the thing that is holding them back, I think \u2014 is that you\u2019re required to know Unity . Unity is a software required to make games. You make the experience in Unity, and then you export it to the platform, which puts it on the web for you to be able to use. \nMost teachers \u2014 and I consider myself pretty tech savvy \u2014 Unity has a fairly steep learning curve. \nVicki: Yes, it does. \nEnrique: And most people don\u2019t have time to do that. \nVicki: I tried it. And it totally kicked my hiney. I couldn\u2019t do it. \nEnrique: Yeah. \nVicki: I won\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t have enough time to do it. (laughs) \nEnrique: Exactly. And you know most teachers won\u2019t. And most teachers don\u2019t have that kind of time. It\u2019s just \u2014 we\u2019re not programmers. \nBut, Amazon just came out with Sumerian , which is a much easier, noncoding based way to make virtual environments like a classroom or a lab or something IN web VR, using their new technology. Now Sumerian is in pre-D only, They sent out a few invites, so it\u2019s still really, really new. However, it runs on Amazon web servers, and it seems to be a really good option to use in the future. \nVicki: Enrique, where do you envision we\u2019ll be in five years with this? \nWhere will all of this be, in about five years? \nEnrique: I\u2019m hoping that within two years, we have the hardware \u2014 the hardware is still coming out for this \u2014 and the software out there to be able to do this. \nBut to be honest, it\u2019s a little nebulous because what we don\u2019t have is a group that is really invested in this. I mean, this is not a game. It\u2019s not meant to make money. \nThe companies that are doing this right now are not making money with it because schools don\u2019t have money. We\u2019ve got to have a different model to use than traditional models because of the environment that we\u2019re working with. \nAnd the other problem is the paradigm. Right now we have a very established, traditional, industrial age paradigm for instruction \u2014 that is not budging, for all that we do. \nAll of the efforts of all the folks like you, like Lisa, like me, and other folks you talk to with innovation. \nI was in the classroom for eight years, and I know that everything that I was doing in my classroom \u2014 I was hoping that other teachers would model and copy and ask me questions. And that was not the case. \nSo, it\u2019s going to take a big idea, a big project, to be able to dislodge this traditional paradigm that we have in place. I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s going to be up for it, but I\u2019m hoping they\u2019re out there on the horizon. \nVicki: Enrique, as we finish up, what are the groups and organizations that you are a part of that you feel like ar making progress in this area? So that our listeners who are really excited about the potential can join in. \nWhat groups can listeners follow to learn more? \nEnrique: I recently went to the Serious Play Conference . It\u2019s a great conference with a variety of teachers that talk about using games and recent technology to motivate kids and to get them interested. That\u2019s a great group! \nAnd through that particular conference, I met Peggy Sheehy\u2026 \nVicki: Oh, I love Peggy! She\u2019s awesome. \nEnrique: \u2026 who\u2026 Yeah, Peggy and Bron. And they introduced me to The Tribe. And The Tribe is a group of innovative educators who gather. We have a group on Facebook and Collaborate. We share ideas. We go to each other\u2019s web conferences, and most importantly, we try to get the best of what we each do and share it with each other so we can hopefully borrow ideas and further the cause. And bring other teachers into it. \nVicki: Well, this is exciting! VR is a new education paradigm. I hope you\u2019re enjoying Hour of Code Week. I hope that you\u2019ll also take a look at VR, and experiment with it. I\u2019ve got a lot to learn. I was excited about Expeditions, and now I love VR, and I\u2019ve got some more things to play with! \nSo get out there, and play, and enjoy, and be remarkable! \nTranscribed by Kymberli Mulford \n[email protected] Bio as submitted \nEnrique Cachafeiro has spent the last decade finding ways to evolve the state of the classroom as to take advantage of new instructional technologies and strategies.

LCD Soundsystem \u2018American Dream\u2019", "text": "When \u2018 Christmas Will Break Your Heart \u2019 slipped into the world on December 24 th , 2015, the rumours of an LCD Soundsystem return were rife and the internet fell over itself trying to get hot takes on Murphy\u2019s un-retirement out into the world before clickbait took a day off for turkey. Confirmation of live performances soon followed and the inevitable consternation about tarnishing a legacy was unleashed. As the less prone to hyperventilation predicted, the unchecked emotional response has mutated with, firstly, fresh chances to witness the band\u2019s joyous catalogue in the flesh and, secondly, talk of a new album. However, no amount of frenzied paragraphs would count for shit if the resultant record didn\u2019t deliver.\n\nNearly two years later, \u2018 American Dream \u2019 is upon us, atrocious cover and all. James Murphy sure knows how to sequence a record, even if he has allowed an unprecedented tenth song onto the tracklist this time. The progression from \u2018 Oh Baby \u2019 to \u2018 Black Screen \u2019 is nuanced and enveloping, a slowly unravelling thread that you don\u2019t notice until it\u2019s got too long to tuck aside. Initial listens highlight a lack of pace, and it\u2019s definitely more about textures than bangers, but there is an inviting coherence about this scratching of the itch.\nThe moments that come closest to where Murphy has been before are actually the least interesting. \u2018 Other Voices \u2019 is a barely concealed Talking Heads reboot, a squiffy synth line the first sign of deviation and a robotic spoken word section neatly shifting things up a gear towards its conclusion. It\u2019s one for the flailing limbs, and pretty joyously executed, but there\u2019s much more interesting material surrounding it. \u2018 I Used To \u2019, for example, is a shuddering, bleepy electro Joy Division, pushing LCD Soundsystem to darker, fuzzier terrain. It takes time to unfurl fully, its not especially inviting layers slowly arraying themselves across the soundstage.\nAfter \u2018 All I Want \u2019 from 2010\u2019s \u2018 This Is Happening \u2019 affectionately plundered Bowie\u2019s \u2018 Heroes \u2019, it\u2019s the Scary Monsters era that propels \u2018 Change Yr Mind \u2019. The howling Fripp guitar of tracks like \u2018 Fashion \u2019 and \u2018 It\u2019s No Game \u2019 is aped with \u00e9lan, while the lyrics feel like a more circumspect and less ironic take on \u2018 Losing My Edge \u2019: \u201cI\u2019m not dangerous now, the way I used to be once. I\u2019m just too old for it now. At least that seems to be true.\u201d The artist to whom this track so brazenly owes a debt is just one of a number of losses to have impacted upon Murphy\u2019s life since that last album, and the passing of time and mortality are all over the record\u2019s lyrics.\nThe teaser tracks have neatly ticked a selection of boxes: \u2018 Call The Police \u2019 is another slowly escalating, soaring riff-possessing, seven-minute stomper to add to the catalogue and \u2018 Tonite \u2019 is a hip-thrusting delight, driven by lively synths and a borderline erotic bassline. The least immediate of the trio, the album\u2019s title track, is perhaps the most effective primer for \u2018American Dream\u2019 as a whole. It is a hypnotically woozy soundscape, coming on like MGMT played at the wrong speed, shooting stars of melody cascading across the chorus. They\u2019ve not attempted anything quite this delicate in the past and its composed wistfulness is one of the record\u2019s emotional keystones.\n\u2018 Emotional Haircut \u2019 is tonally at odds with its neighbours but is curiously fitting as the penultimate song. A regimented rock track, it does occasionally waft a little close to the world of U2\u2019s latter-day attempts to convince themselves they\u2019ve still got it, \u2018 Vertigo \u2019 and \u2018 Get On Your Boots \u2019 especially, but is saved by the brutally sparse verses. Despite such unflattering associations, it\u2019s a perfect contrast with the starry-eyed release of \u2018 American Dream \u2019 prior to it, and a strange wire wool palette cleanser for concluding track \u2018 Black Screen \u2019. At twelve minutes in length, it is impossible to imagine that piece as anything but the closer. Think the second side of \u2018 Low \u2019, but in the summer: warmer in both senses. The gently colliding synth motifs engineer a lulling looseness, like an infant trying to grab at bubbles on the breeze.\nThere remains, however, one track more remarkable even than the record\u2019s enigmatic finale. As if to make amends for invoking gurning Noughties Bono elsewhere, his early Eighties incarnation seems to hover over parts of the album\u2019s nine-minute midpoint, \u2018 How Do You Sleep? \u2019 After a long, tense build with judicious use of reverb, scratchy, ever-intensifying strings add a tension that takes time to be resolved. The truly immersive peaking synth stabs that then clamber all over the song almost force the vocals into the distance. There\u2019s a redemptive hint when the beat emerges on the five-minute mark, but it\u2019s the moment that Murphy unleashes a little falsetto midway through the track\u2019s final third that truly releases the pressure.\nLCD Soundsystem may well have disappointed fans who felt they had loved and lost, cherishing the potency of their grief, when they stepped out on the stage again. They may well have risked a legacy built on a triumvirate of largely wonderful albums by venturing back to the studio also. But, in returning to the project that best suits his sense of adventure, James Murphy has done nothing to tarnish what has gone before. \u2018 American Dream \u2019 is a darker, more diverse record than its predecessors and a more human one too. In realising the difficulty of allowing himself to indulge in what he had chosen to end, Murphy has found himself driven to justify LCD Soundsystem\u2019s rebooted existence more than ever before. It\u2019s still imperfect, but even its flaws are worthy of note. The long goodbye is now followed by quite a lengthy return. Long may it last.\nThis originally appeared on the Clash website, hence the rather lengthier nature of it.

We have a 2017 4200 with 3 - ac units 15K each and the Suburban 35-SFQ furnace. What use to happen up until 12-4-2017 is this; The T-Stat in the hall would be set to \"Auto\" and the temp set to 83 the furnace would kick the blower on and heat would come out of the floor registers. When this would happen a single tick could be heard in the area of the AC filter. Now what happens is the T-stat is set to \"Auto\" and the temp set to 83 and no blower / no heat. Just before this stopped the ticking sound in the AC filter area repeated itself many times. If I go to the bedroom and turn the T-stat to auto and 83 degrees the furnace blower comes on and heat comes out. So this tells me the furnace is working. I have called Heartland I have called Dometic I have swapped and reset the T-stats in the rooms and have changed the relay boxes in the AC units that control the furnace power from the Bedroom AC unit.

(AP) \u2014 The mother of former NBA player Lorenzen Wright stood up Thursday during a court hearing for a man charged with killing him and shouted, \"How could you have murdered my son?\"\nWearing a red sweater with a drawing of her son's face on it, Deborah Marion made the outburst during an arraignment for Billy R. Turner in a Memphis courtroom. Judge Lee Coffee told her he would not allow another such interruption, but he did not charge her with contempt of court.\nTurner was indicted Tuesday on a first-degree murder charge. His bail is set at $1 million. Turner told the judge that he was planning to hire an attorney and Coffee set a hearing for Tuesday.\nLATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing Google Earth tour of San Francisco sfgate Spiked Eggnog Custard With Rum-Caramel Popcorn sfgate Whole Foods' first 365 store opens in the Bay Area sfgate Sen.

He was shot multiple times. The seven-year investigation into his death has been one of the Memphis Police Department's most high-profile unsolved cases.\nProsecutors and police have declined to say much about the case. Police said last month that they had found a gun used in the killing in a lake near the small town of Walnut, Mississippi, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Memphis.\nAfter Marion's statement, Turner was led out of the courtroom in the custody of court officers. The judge called Marion to a microphone in the courtroom and told her he understands her pain because his father was killed. But Coffee also said that he would not allow anyone to \"engage in an outburst like that.\"\n\"You have to be respectful of the judicial system,\" Coffee said.\nMarion replied, \"I told him what I wanted to tell him.\"\nOutside the courtroom, prosecutor Paul Hagerman said he spoke with Marion about the incident.\n\"Ms. Deborah is going to behave herself next time,\" Hagerman said.\nWright, who was born and raised in Memphis, played for the Memphis Grizzlies and four other NBA teams as a forward and center over 13 seasons before retiring in 2009.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/qyZLykzv-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/ymIabdMc-720.jpg)", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/oT0P81gO-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/fPX3XJZJ-720.jpg)", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/r6YuJPz1-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/Y1yGNtl0-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/Kc2ifh3L-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/GTtCvdHL-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/5T4LjYVX-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/Gf0WUwLB-720.jpg)"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:34.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "411b961c837016771434794dce3b6614ed8c4815", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg81a7r8y.ARgvl75_UQY2tjJXPVrwUe9ZJMm0giWaz5SF5Li_u6_EwYp37DV2eVT2.ZBMaFg0a9qwlNKb3evOWXAZUILjI3u2NTIHW6cs7QN5r6s_YbqM4JkDhuQYPQ0IsOCJ0Vc6023Y8FASQA8m_xJuK77glKxn089LrkJhE82RoNVsivNfK_", "site_full": "www.dorsetecho.co.uk", "site": "dorsetecho.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/localnews/dorchester/rss/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Dorset Echo | Dorchester", "title": "Driving that extra mile to ensure disadvantaged children have a merry Christmas", "title_full": "Driving that extra mile to ensure disadvantaged children have a merry Christmas", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/resources/images/7149613/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "411b961c837016771434794dce3b6614ed8c4815", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg81a7r8y.ARgvl75_UQY2tjJXPVrwUe9ZJMm0giWaz5SF5Li_u6_EwYp37DV2eVT2.ZBMaFg0a9qwlNKb3evOWXAZUILjI3u2NTIHW6cs7QN5r6s_YbqM4JkDhuQYPQ0IsOCJ0Vc6023Y8FASQA8m_xJuK77glKxn089LrkJhE82RoNVsivNfK_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Driving that extra mile to ensure disadvantaged children have a merry Christmas", "text": "3 comments \nA car enthusiast has driven the extra mile to make sure disadvantaged children in Dorset have a merry Christmas. \nAntony Pope who runs the MGF and TF car enthusiasts group, organised a car run around Dorset in support of the Dorset Echo Toy Appeal. \n\"I normally organise car runs in the summer but I thought, it's coming up to Christmas, let's do something for a good cause,\" he said. \nThe group of car enthusiasts took part in a 60 mile route around the county including breakfast, a tea stop at Dorchester Museum and buffet lunch. \nMr Pope said, instead of asking car enthusiasts for payment to participate in the car run he asked them to donate toys for the appeal instead -

The lack of these two critical factors have largely undermined the industrialization trajectory in most African countries. \nGiven this scenario, the industrial settlement framework as well as tax policies, are particular dynamics to be looked into. \nThis was the key message that emerged during a Tuesday panel discussion at the 12 th African Economic Conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on the theories and practices for building resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation in Africa. \nThe session brought together more than 150 researchers, media, private sector and civil society representatives, among other participants. \nProf. Keun Lee from Seoul National University launched the debate in a keynote address, where he underscored the need for Africa to be industrialized to add value to its huge raw materials and services. \u201cAccess to finance and markets is key to promoting industrialization\u201d, he said, but \u201cfailure in designing governance policies can be a serious downside for promoting the sector.\u201d \nDr. Tilman Altenburg, Head of Department of the German Institute for Development, explained the dichotomy between his country\u2019s industrial policy and his experience in Africa. His analysis touched on the viability of national projects, productive transformation and mobilizing societal support for it. He argued that establishing clear rules for market-based competition; delivering services effectively; and removing protection are requisites for effective industrialization. \nIndustrial policies are more likely to achieve results if targets are agreed upon in a collaborative manner, involving the private sector as well as the competent public entities and civil service organizations, he said. \u201cThere is a need to look into the settlement framework, the distribution and marketing strategy, as well as productive integration and focus on tax policies.\u201d \nFor her part, Dr. Miriam Altman, South Africa\u2019s National Planning Commissioner, expressed the view that industrialization is a long-term process of more than 20 to 50 years, which requires incredible commitments and leadership, as well as appropriate policy in public sector procurement. \u201cWhile there is need to focus on attracting foreign investments, leveraging domestic and regional markets is necessary,\u201d she said. \nFocusing on \u201cgovernance of power in African societies,\u201d Prof. Adebayo Olukoshi, Regional Director for Africa and West Asia at the Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, underscored the need to have functional states with effective leaders. \u201cWe need to get the policies right, and build nations with leaders capable of building and leading industrial policies,\u201d he said. \nOverall, the panelists agreed that Africa\u2019s industrialization would have a more positive impact on the continent\u2019s Gross Domestic Product. However, they noted that, for this to happen, a comprehensive and resolute continental industrial policy that is country-adjustable to local contexts and that can be aligned with countries\u2019 development goals, should be designed. \nAfrican Eye Report/afdb.org", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":

Director General of the Ghana Health Service, Dr. Anthony Nsiah-Asare Ghana\u2019s aim at achieving Universal Health Coverage by 2030 has been given a big boost with a $9 Million project to strengthen its Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS). \nThe five-year project, which will be implemented in Northern, Upper East and Upper West regions of Ghana, is a collaboration between the Government of Japan through the Japan International Cooperation Agency-JICA, the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service. \nThe goal of the project is to contribute to Ghana\u2019s efforts for the attainment of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). \nLaunching the CHPS for Life project in Accra, the Director General of the Ghana Health Service, Dr. Anthony Nsiah-Asare said the project is a big boost to Ghana\u2019s UHC agenda because it provides support for improving access to Primary Health Care (PHC) through CHPS using the \u201cLife Course Approach\u201d. \nDr Nsiah-Asare explained that the life course approach aims to increase the effectiveness of interventions throughout all the stages of a person\u2019s life. \n\u201cThe Project will therefore focus not only on mothers and children but also on the aged and other family members through prevention, early detection and care of non-communicable diseases and health promotion for all age groups\u201d. \nThe Director-General revealed that the Service has identified the over-concentration of the country\u2019s primary health care strategy, CHPS on maternal and child health services to the neglect of other interventions as a result, there is a new paradigm of expanding the package of services provided under CHPS to meet everybody\u2019s need to ensure the total health of the family. \nDr Nsiah-Asare pointed out that the new policy direction fits strongly into the new government\u2019s health agenda of prioritizing preventive health backed by the idea to initiate the setting up of wellness clinics across the country whereby the National Health Insurance Scheme will be used to access a wide range of preventive health services for people of all ages. \nHe charged the various Regional Directors of health to rally their staff for the success of the project so that the lessons and best practices to be replicated in other regions. \nIn a speech read for him, the Minister of Health, Kweku Agyemang-Manu, noted that the CHPS for Life project is very important, as it is in sync with the government\u2019s commitment to the prioritization of preventive health to promote early detection and appropriate management of diseases particularly at the community level. \nHe lauded the government of Japan for rehabilitation of the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research and the construction and furnishing of 84 CHPS compounds in the Upper West Region among other things. \nMr Agyemang-Manu was optimistic the CHPS project would contribute to the country\u2019s goal of achieving UHC and ultimately improve the life expectancy of Ghanaians. \nThe Deputy Chief of Mission at the Embassy of Japan, Koji Tomita said Ghana is one among three countries in Africa that the Government of Japan has prioritize for support to help them achieve UHC. \nHe mentioned the two other countries as Kenya and Senegal and said Japan has enjoyed a fruitful collaboration with Ghana for many years especially in health and medical research one of the current initiatives being the support to improve health resilience in Ghana. He was confident the collaboration would continue to inure to the benefit of the two countries. \nThe Regional Directors of Health Service for the three regions expressed joy for the assistance and pledged their leadership commitment to make sure the project is implemented well to benefit the communities. \nThe UN as part of the SDGs has tasked all Member States to achieve UHC by 2030.

Elumelu, UBA Group Chairman Lagos, Nigeria, December 7, 2017\u2013 President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi would today (Thursday) host six African Heads of State including Prof. Yem Osinbajo, Nigeria\u2019s Vice president at the Africa 2017 Forum that would take place at the picturesque beach resort of Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The President of Guinea, current chair of the African Union (AU), would be joining the forum as well as the Presidents of Chad, Rwanda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Comoros, and Somalia. This business and investment forum, whose theme is: \u2018Driving investment for inclusive growth,\u2019 has been convened to increase intra-African investments and cross-border collaboration. Egypt in 2015 hosted the signing of the tripartite agreement between the three regional economic communities; SADC, COMESA and the EAC, and the Forum has been designed for African business leaders to play a greater role by investing in opportunities throughout the continent. The first edition of the Forum took place in February 2016. This year the programme has been enhanced to include two exclusive Presidential Roundtables, where these business leaders would openly discuss policy with the African presidents present to help create a more conducive business environment, in addition to immense investment and business opportunities available in the continent. Youth and entrepreneurs would also play a prominent role. Over 50 of the continent\u2019s brightest and most promising entrepreneurs had been invited to showcase their businesses and would be presenting them to investors. The forum is being organised by the Ministry of Investment and International Cooperation of Egypt and the COMESA Regional Investment Agency (RIA). Speaking ahead of the Forum, Dr. Sahar Nasr, Minister of Investment and International Cooperation of Egypt stressed the importance of greater intra-Africa collaboration: \u201cIntra-Africa trade is a valuable component of Africa\u2019s and Egypt\u2019s economic growth strategy,\u201d she said. \u201cFor Egypt\u2019s growth strategy, Intra-Africa trade remains a valuable component. Despite European and North American markets dominating Egypt\u2019s trade activities, we have proximity to African markets as well as trade agreements with African nations. \u201cThe markets where Egypt has seen an increase in its trade include North Africa, specifically Morocco, East Africa, specifically Kenya, South Africa and Sudan,\u201d she said. Heba Salama, Head of RIA, highlighted the responsibility of the private sector to devise innovative solutions. \u201cThe private sector can play an important role in filling in the US $93bn infrastructure gap. Manufacturing is another important sector where private sector support is needed. \u201cMcKinsey Global Institute estimates that Africa could double its manufacturing output in 10 years, which could ultimately create between 6 million and 14 million stable jobs and boost African GDP growth,\u201d he added. The forum would commence on December 7 and runs through December 9, 2017. \nIndependent.ng", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elumelu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony o. elumelu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osinbajo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sahar nasr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heba salama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdel fattah al sisi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yem osinbajo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "uba group c", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comesa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mckinsey global institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sadc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of investment and international cooperation of egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international cooperation of egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comesa regional investment agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "elumelu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guinea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharm el sheikh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rwanda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sudan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "somalia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morocco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intra-africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:35.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03988a78615f42f2df43f1d23bec3c3e691cc250", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QtijbbHpc1IPFpZYSl1YwaynchmS9.3fvVUEK6pV0z97HyZM2cNeOqIjQ_UWH7xRFNJiP4UPcel1nAbuVW116n6gqtwf2PBV.kQEMjF6ff4PDKzzn.aNvr", "site_full": "africaneyereport.com", "site": "africaneyereport.com", "site_section": "http://africaneyereport.com/feed/atom", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "African Eye Report", "title": "Africa\u2019s Richest Man to Invest Up to $50 Billion in U.S., Europe", "title_full": "Africa\u2019s Richest Man to Invest Up to $50 Billion in U.S., Europe", "published": "2017-12-07T08:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03988a78615f42f2df43f1d23bec3c3e691cc250", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QtijbbHpc1IPFpZYSl1YwaynchmS9.3fvVUEK6pV0z97HyZM2cNeOqIjQ_UWH7xRFNJiP4UPcel1nAbuVW116n6gqtwf2PBV.kQEMjF6ff4PDKzzn.aNvr", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MASAHUDU ANKIILU", "published": "2017-12-07T08:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "Africa\u2019s Richest Man to Invest Up to $50 Billion in U.S., Europe", "text": "Africa\u2019s Richest Man to Invest Up to $50 Billion in U.S., Europe Aliko Dangote Photographer: Jason Alden/Bloomberg December 7, 2017//-Africa\u2019s richest man, Aliko Dangote, plans to invest $20 billion to $50 billion in the U.S. and Europe by 2025, in industries including renewable energy and petrochemicals. \nThe 60-year-old Nigerian cement tycoon aims to move into these territories for the first time in 2020 after completing almost $5 billion of agricultural projects and an $11 billion oil refinery in his home country, he said in an interview with Bloomberg Markets Magazine this month. \n\u201cBeginning in 2020, 60 percent of our future investments will be outside Africa, so we can have a balance,\u201d said Dangote, who\u2019s worth $11.1 billion, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index. Dangote Group will consider investments in Asia and Mexico, but will focus mainly on the U.S. and Europe, he said. \u201cI think renewables is the way to go forward, and the future. We are looking at petrochemicals but can also invest in other companies.\u201d \nDangote has diversified rapidly in the last five years, both geographically and into new industries. He\u2019s expanded Dangote Cement Plc , which accounts for almost 80 percent of his wealth, into nine African countries aside from Nigeria. In 2015, he began building a 650,000 barrel-a-day refinery near Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s main commercial hub, and he\u2019s constructing gas pipelines to the city from Nigeria\u2019s oil region with U.S. private equity firms Carlyle Group LP and Blackstone Group LP. He said in July he\u2019d invest $4.6 billion in the next three years in sugar, rice and dairy production . \nShares in Dangote Cement rose 2.7 percent to 219.80 naira in Lagos Thursday, extending their advance this year to 26 percent. Telecoms Unappealing \n\u201cWhen you look at it \u2014 not just in Nigeria but in the rest of Africa \u2014 the majority of countries here depend on imported food,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way you can have a population of 320 million in West Africa and no self-sufficiency. So the first thing to do is food security. I believe Dangote Group is in the right position to drive this trajectory.\u201d \nDangote, who mostly lives in Lagos and counts Bill Gates among his friends, said he was a passionate industrialist and ruled out moving into newer sectors such as telecommunications or technology. \n\u201cWhen I look at telecoms, for instance, I think that would be very tough for us,\u201d he said. \u201cSome players have been in this market for 17 years already. There\u2019s no way you can go and jump over somebody after 17 years of their hard work. So I think we would pass when it comes to telecoms today.

children and six infants. \nIbrahim Farinloye, Spokesperson for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), South West zone, said the returnees arrived aboard a Libyan Airlines aircraft at the Cargo Wing of the airport at about 1.30a.m. \nHe said they were assisted back to Nigeria by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the European Union (EU). \nHe also confirmed that four of the returnees had medical cases and were promptly taken away on an ambulance for treatment. \nHe said the returnees were received by officials of NEMA, Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), and the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN). \nOn Tuesday night, a batch of 144 stranded Nigerians in Libya was deported in continuation of the massive repatriation of Nigerians in the North African country. \nThe Tuesday returnees arrived aboard a BURQA Airline Boeing 737-800 aircraft with registration number, 5N-DMG from Libya. \nINDEPENDENT learnt that there had been a renewed drive to repatriate all stranded Nigerians from Libya amidst raging reports concerning a resurgence of slave trade in the Maghreb, especially Libya. \nNo fewer than 1,295 Nigerians in Libya were rescued in November alone, with more of them expected to be repatriated before the end of the year following reports that Nigerian irregular migrants were languishing in either Libyan cells or deportation camps. \nThe latest batch of returnees comprised 102 males and 42 females, including infants, who were received by agencies of the Federal Government including the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI), National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), among others. \nThe repatriation of the stranded Nigerians which started in 2016 is being done in collaboration with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) which has provided the chartered aircraft to convey the returnees. \nAs at the time of filing in this report, another flight conveying other returnees was being expected from Tripoli, the Libyan capital. \nIdentifying Stranded Nigerians Major Challenge \u2014FG \nMeanwhile, Geoffrey Onyeama, Minister of Foreign Affairs, has said the ministry officials were facing minor hitches in identifying those that are Nigerians with a view to evacuating them from Libya. \nBeyond identification, Onyeama said most of the Nigerian victims were trapped in areas not officially recognised by the United Nations. \nHe noted that accessibility into such troubled areas was also a major challenge. \nIn view of these challenges, Onyeama said the Charge d\u2019Affairs in Tripoli has been invited to come to Abuja to give full details of what was actually going on there. \nHe gave these updates at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. \nRecall that the media have been awash with information that Nigerians who had gone to seek greener pastures in Europe through Libya had fallen victims of slave trade in the North African country. \n\u201cOn the issue of Libya practising slave trade, of course, it has been in the news in the last two weeks; also, the imprisonment in various detention centres of Nigerians. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is that first of all, we\u2019ve got our Charge d\u2019Affairs in Tripoli to come to Abuja to give us the full details of what is actually going on there. \n\u201cEspecially how many Nigerians are in detention and are trying to come home? So, once we establish that and we are given all those facts, we are now meeting with various agencies like NEMA and NAPTIP to now arrange the evacuation process and this will be done in co-ordination with International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and see if we can very quickly repatriate all our Nigerian nationals who are there who want to return home. \n\u201cThe charge d\u2019 affairs said a number of Nigerians (and not all of them) do not want to come home. Certainly, it has to be those who want to come back home,\u201d he told State House correspondents. \nIndependent.ng", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "onyeama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemi osinbajo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibrahim farinloye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geoffrey onyeama", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national agency for prohibition of trafficking", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "immigration service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burqa airline boeing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naptip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national commission for refugees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foreign affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libyan airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international organisation for migration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal airports authority of nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal executive council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national emergency management agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "abuja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south west zone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murtala muhammed international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tripoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cargo wing of the airport", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:35.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a3b70fde52e87a3040ad6ccfb02e282818abe8af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKprIkY0g9nZK1f8KHQAwmCexedvZYf0_69h.J0PJ99TnsmbS9FqGbzfKlRHqGrafaxp156gBCSwxJ7elnfN8GMA--", "site_full": "www.freelancer.com.pe", "site": "freelancer.com.pe", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.com.pe/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "freelance_writing"], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Excellent and Dependable Writer Wanted by sirwebmaster", "title_full": "Excellent and Dependable Writer Wanted by sirwebmaster", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "PE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a3b70fde52e87a3040ad6ccfb02e282818abe8af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKprIkY0g9nZK1f8KHQAwmCexedvZYf0_69h.J0PJ99TnsmbS9FqGbzfKlRHqGrafaxp156gBCSwxJ7elnfN8GMA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Excellent and Dependable Writer Wanted by sirwebmaster", "text": "Reescritura de art\u00edculos Excellent and Dependable Writer Wanted \nI need a Good and Dependable writer who can write 4 men's lifestyle articles.

Weka is a package that offers users a collection of learning schemes and tools that they can use for data mining. The algorithms that Weka provides can be applied directly to a dataset or your Java code. When running the program, you can view four available applications that you can access: 'Explorer', 'Experimenter', 'KnowledgeFlow' and 'Simple CLI'. The first section allows you to open a dataset or a database and edit it as you wish. You can filter the data contents, change the attributes and visualize the result in a bar chart. Also, you can classify the available data according to a predefined set of rules, as well as perform a complete cost / benefit analysis that automatically displays the cost matrix and the threshold curve. In addition to this, the program also includes tools for data clustering, association rules and attributes evaluator. Furthermore, you can use it for data plotting, as it allows you to view and analyze point graphs for each possible attribute combination. The program is also suitable for developing new machine learning schemes. You just have to configure your experiment by choosing its type: classification or regression. Also, you have to choose the desired dataset and algorithm and then you can run it. The results can be saved either in ARFF or CSVformats or as a JDBC database. Also, you can analyze and test a data file. The program allows you to choose the significance and the comparison field, as well as the sorting criteria and the test base. Weka is an easy to use application, yet it is designed for those who are familiar with data mining procedures and database analysis. Using this software, you can view and analyze ARFF data files, as well as perform data clustering and regression.

African Development Bank projects that Uganda\u2019s GDP will grow from 5.1% in 2017 to 5.8% in 2018. Among other factors, the government has highlighted the role of information communications technology (ICT) as a key enabler for this trend toward growth. \nAs key stakeholders in the country continue to promote the use of ICT for economic and social growth, Uganda\u2019s internet penetration has increased in the last two years from 31% in 2015 to 53.9% in the first quarter of 2017, according to the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC). \nIn East Africa, Uganda is second only to Kenya in terms of internet penetration. While this figure is significant, a section of Uganda\u2019s population still lacks internet access. A critical issue is that many live in rural areas that are hard to reach through traditional methods. \nSatellite broadband can break through both the cost and planning barriers to these remote areas. Since it is not subject to the same physical and infrastructure limitations of cable-based systems, satellite broadband offers an alternative that is less costly to connect and requiring less complicated infrastructural planning. This could significantly improve connectivity in rural areas for individuals and businesses. \nIn neighboring Kenya, many unserved and under-served rural areas are already enjoying the benefits of satellite connectivity. One of the main segments to benefit is the country\u2019s public healthcare sector. In Kiambu County, for example, satellite connectivity is delivering quicker and more effective patient care through the sharing of knowledge and resources via the internet. \nThrough the provision of satellite broadband connectivity and the implementation of new software, local healthcare facilities are now able to share critical information and better manage patient inquiries since medical records are now available to all connected healthcare facilities within the county. Anyone can go to the nearest facility and receive the consultation and medicine they need within a matter of minutes. \nOther sectors such as education facilities continue to reap similar benefits. Today, a student is able to access vast amounts of e-learning tools with a simple click of a button. Information that is essential to learn, grow and pursue his or her ambitions is now more readily available. \nIn addition to enabling students and medical professionals, satellite broadband has also enabled government organisations to streamline their processes and ensure that their services reach individuals, no matter where they reside. \nIn South Africa, approximately one in every ten pensioners was either unaware of the value of their pensions, or was unable to access them. Hence, the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) launched an outreach project aimed at engaging with pensioners. \nAn always-on broadband connectivity facilitated real-time access to pension data, no matter how remote the location of the pensioner. Through collaboration between public and private organisations, 1.2 million members of GEPF and their bene\ufb01ciaries were able to gain access to valuable \ufb01nancial services. \nThese are just some of the examples of how satellite connectivity is driving social and economic change. Through satellite communication, communities can now access many services, and the way they educate their children, access local and global markets for their goods and maintain good health is also changing. \nUntil very recently, these kinds of scenarios would have seemed far-fetched. \nAccording to the World Bank, the GDP of developing nations rises by 1.38% for every 10% increase in broadband connectivity. With such a direct correlation between investment in broadband connectivity and the growth in economic activity, connecting rural Uganda is central to the achievement of the 5.8% growth expected in 2018. \nThe collaboration between governments, technology partners and businesses is key to extending the benefits of connectivity.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "uganda communications commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "african development bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ict", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uganda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kiambu county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:36.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "319fde8684a5285befc0fca28378eaa829bf0160", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSrY3zTBFQr2qgROFi_9LlEtSh.a4kqwu8RzSBo4Kk6ZxY2DKlg6rPTG2UdWZUBMet9xEGbCIllA4v7NFclPO_", "site_full": "itunes.apple.com", "site": "apple.com", "site_section": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios-food-drink/id6023?mt=8", "site_categories": ["tech", "television", "shopping", "mac_support", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Food &amp; Drink - App Store Downloads on iTunes", "title": "Favor - Food Delivery", "title_full": "Favor - Food Delivery on the App Store", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/cd/d7/a7/cdd7a7c3-dba2-451b-1312-8c8dd5ddf0dc/source/1200x630bb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 49, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c4349f4fedd3ec3d5b7a420b25de5a6fe339adb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSrY3zTBFQr2qgROFi_9LlEtSh.a4kqwu8RzSBo4Kk6ZxY2DKlg6rPTG2UdWZUBMet9xEGbCIllMlhbP3L7iRvQUEz3R5tbJoPriAz8ie9m0d9GWGf4n81HnWFNYEOSWY-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "YoDawgIHearYouLikeApps", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Love this service.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:36.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "49f9bb355ac779fd3df52ef31d5b6d3e4fde6760", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQPrHlu7Gub_vsH5mx_kcN8fVX7pdO1eT1LziturAvsM8KyTBqGXsJte6yqsUQnVUI0jMasKBKZrZda_glcBjpzpGYS3.sYnalD2GY6TuucF68diVAvJr1B", "site_full": "www.heartlandowners.org", "site": "heartlandowners.org", "site_section": "https://www.heartlandowners.org/external.php?type=RSS2", "site_categories": ["tennis", "sports"], "section_title": "Heartland Owners Forum", "title": "Welcome-new Texas North Chapter members", "title_full": "Welcome-new Texas North Chapter members", "published": "2017-12-07T04:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "49f9bb355ac779fd3df52ef31d5b6d3e4fde6760", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQPrHlu7Gub_vsH5mx_kcN8fVX7pdO1eT1LziturAvsM8KyTBqGXsJte6yqsUQnVUI0jMasKBKZrZda_glcBjpzpGYS3.sYnalD2GY6TuucF68diVAvJr1B", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jayc", "published": "2017-12-07T04:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "Welcome-new Texas North Chapter members", "text": "4,188 Welcome-new Texas North Chapter members Please help me welcome new members James Hickey and Cat Miller forum username JamesnCat from Lewisville Texas.

His \u201creturn to old Labour\u201d is seen as a step back rather than forwards; he claims that good old socialist policy can still be applied to contemporary issues such as the NHS crisis, but his critics say that his staunch left-wing ideas are what are losing him elections, councillors, and seats. Indeed, upon attending Labour party meetings, you will find that many members are leftover Blairites- it feels very much like the meetings are discussions of methods to sabotage Corbyn from the inside. At face value, this anti-Corbyn propaganda seems to be based on his politics, but it\u2019s much more complex than just that.   \nInitially, he was slammed for not wearing a tie and having his top shirt button undone, on the grounds that it was unprofessional. Ex-PM Cameron was too busy to notice that to be fair- he was playing Candy Crush on his phone, proving that politicians are people after all. Corbyn then, after drawing up a manifesto, was called a communist who was a danger to the party. Communism isn\u2019t a bad thing, per s\u00e9, although it has never worked, but it was the scathing tone that he was called one with that made it seem scarier. And whilst MPs such as Dianne Abbott are quick with their criticism of their leader, they\u2019re forgetting that Labour\u2019s place in the political spectrum is inherently left wing- and if they don\u2019t agree with that, the Liberal Democrats would be more than happy to accept them into their pitiful ranks. \nFurthermore, they\u2019re ignoring the real problem- the party they\u2019re supposed to be against, in particular the bumbling idiot that you may know as Boris Jonhson, are putting lives at risk with the seven years of extreme austerity the UK has faced. Jonhson\u2019s claims that Nazanin Zaghrari-Ratcliffe, the detained Iranian-British project manager, was \u201csimply teaching journalism\u201d whilst visiting Iran could have killed her at worst, added five years to her already five-year imprisonment at best. And for what? When you put it like this, it almost seems like lives are less important to the Conservatives than the future of Mr Corbyn. \nThe hatred that Corbyn has seen is, quite simply, based on the ground that wanting equality is an outlandish and unreasonable idea. The coalition may have passed same-sex marriage in 2013, but many of the Tory MPs who voted in favour had to be persuaded (as they\u2019d conveniently decided not to use whips in the vote), with almost every Labour MP voting in favour. And let\u2019s not forget that our benevolent leader, Theresa May, voted entirely against any form of LGBTQ+ rights until 2004. \u201cBut those votes were almost 20 years ago!\u201d, you may cry. Which is true. But she\u2019s still proved that until about 10 years ago she didn\u2019t believe that gay and straight people should be equal. \nThat\u2019s not to say that Labour fare 100% better. Although Corbyn voted \u201cconsistently in favour\u201d of LGBT+ rights (according to theyworkforyou.com), the section concerning LGBTQ+ policy is nestled comfortably near the back of his manifesto. He\u2019s definitely included more than May has- for example, a promise of training for health practitioners (GPs, nurses, etc,.) on how to help LGBTQ+ patients- but the fact that these policies aren\u2019t being shouted about is disheartening to say the least. For example, Labour state in their manifesto that they will \u201censure that all teachers receive initial and ongoing training on the issues [LGBTQ] students face and how to address them\u201d, which I definitely think is brilliant and has the ability to save lives. But how? Even though there\u2019s scarcely any mention of LGBT+ people in the Conservative manifesto- the acronym \u201cLGBTQ+\u201d is not even used at all- I still don\u2019t think that training for teachers is inherently enough: there should be compulsory LGBT+ sex education in line with heterosexual sex education in years three and five, and there should be harsher punishments for students, teachers, and parents who use verbal or physical threats or violence towards LGBTQ people on the grounds of their sexuality. But it\u2019s more international than that- where is Labour\u2019s condemning of Chechnya, the region of Russia where kidnappings of gay men were so commonplace and violent that it was described by a survivor as a \u201cconcentration camp\u201d? Where is the rebuffal to Donald Trump \u201cjoking\u201d that his Vice President \u201cwants to hang and electrocute all the gays\u201d? Corbyn\u2019s policies are impressive and are easily adaptable to Britain, but it is all talk and no action unless he, and his party, actively works against the oppressor in order to keep LGBTQ people in other countries alive in the first place. \nIn spite of the flaws that his party displays, I still believe that the media\u2019s coverage of him is a character assassination of sorts. But let\u2019s not be pedantic and talk anecdotally. Many news organisations- the Daily Mail, the Telegraph, the BBC to a point- have a right wing perspective, which is not a problem in itself. There is no point that I would ever discredit a news agency because many of its journalists and reporters are of the Conservative persuasion- no, what I have a problem with is that so many of these journalists either rely on clickbait titles (\u201cJeremy Corbyn, the great tax hypocrite\u201d- the Daily Mail, November 2017) or simply use their opinions to whip up a media storm about one small thing they don\u2019t agree with or are not knowledgeable about (\u201cMI5 \u2018kept file on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019 over his IRA sympathies\u201d- the Telegraph, May 2017). Let\u2019s also clear up this record- Corbyn has never said that he agrees or sympathises with the IRA, and from what I know, not wanting to murder a group of people is in no way showing sympathy for their cause. Corbyn does not want to bomb people, or condone capital punishment, instead opting to take a pacifist stance and favouring jailing them. The fact that in 2017 we even need to clarify that politicians aren\u2019t terrorist sympathisers and overall Bad People is worrying- if you think that one person\u2019s life is inherently superior to another\u2019s then you should not be able to have the power to make decisions for your electorate (I\u2019m looking at you, Jacob Rees-Mogg). \nCorbyn\u2019s manifesto has reached a whole new audience of people; the young people of the UK have become enamoured with his politics and beliefs, choosing to research into different causes and begin campaigns to lower the voting age to sixteen. It is evident that a large proportion of young people are \u201cCorbynistas\u201d, with sixth-form and secondary school mock elections generally producing results with huge Labour swings. However, all of this research and knowledge is cast aside, generally by the older generation, as being unreasonable, stupid, and too optimistic. Time will tell if, when the youth electorate- myself included- are able to vote, Britain will vote for the many, not the few.

I mentioned this in mid-November when The New York Times first reported on the negotiations and that the Koch brothers were helping to finance the deal with a $650 million infusion. The deal went through the weekend before last. And then Harry and Meghan happened. And then Matt Lauer happened. But even though I\u2019m a week late on this, it goes well with another magazine-related situation that just broke yesterday. \nFirst though, to round out the Time Inc story, Meredith Corporation insists that Koch Equity Development will not have a seat on their board and \u201cwill have no influence on Meredith\u2019s editorial or managerial operations\u201d. Like it\u2019s just a business decision. Pause. Another pause. \nSure. \nTime Inc, of course, includes PEOPLE Magazine. As I said last time, maybe in the short term you won\u2019t see much change. But going forward, how will that impact celebrity coverage, especially celebrities with causes and values that are diametrically opposed to Koch interests? Again, the best example here is someone like Leonardo DiCaprio who has specifically called out the Kochs in his climate change documentary, Before The Flood . And what about Sports Illustrated, also a Time Inc property? Sports Illustrated just honoured Colin Kaepernick last night. The Koch brothers have a complicated relationship with civil rights and race. And, just today, TIME Magazine released its Person of the Year : The Silence Breakers, the men and women who\u2019ve come forward to call out predators and sexual harassers. After Harvey Weinstein, guess whose name appears the most times? That would be Donald Trump. Last week, a new report was released that linked the Kochs to almost four dozen Trump administration officials. \nSpeaking of Harvey and Donald though, and the change in the gossip landscape, as you know, US Weekly was acquired earlier this year by American Media Inc, the company that also publishes The National Enquirer, Star Magazine, and Radar Online. Dylan Howard, who oversees those publications and outlets, was accused yesterday of sexual misconduct. Last month, in his piece of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s \u201c army of spies \u201d, Ronan Farrow wrote in The New Yorker about Dylan\u2019s relationship with Harvey, and how he may have allegedly helped Harvey\u2019s efforts to discredit and silence his accusers. Just yesterday, The New York Times reported on Harvey Weinstein\u2019s \u201ccomplicity machine\u201d, noting that: \n\u201c(Weinstein) was so close to David J. Pecker, the chief executive of American Media Inc., which owns The Enquirer, that he was known in the tabloid industry as an untouchable \u201cF.O.P.,\u201d or \u201cfriend of Pecker.\u201d That status was shared by a chosen few, including President Trump.\u201d \nIn response to the allegations, AMI said that Dylan Howard \u201chas the full support of AMI and its executives.\u201d It said since Howard was rehired, \u201che has continued to have the respect of his peers and colleagues.\u201d \nWell that\u2019s reassuring. \nTwo years ago, PEOPLE and US Weekly were at the top of the tabloid hierarchy. How will new ownership, in both cases, change the gossip landscape? And since gossip is the lens through which we process our social values and behaviours, what will we be looking at in another two years? \nYours in gossip,", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lainey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "meghan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david j. pecker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pecker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin kaepernick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronan farrow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leonardo dicaprio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dylan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dylan howard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt lauer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ami", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national enquirer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koch equity development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sports illustrated", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "star magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meredith corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meredith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american media inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american media inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kochs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:37.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9432a75f7f7eb475a3b28dc8fc77cfaf9c5bb061", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKprIkY0g9nZJO8b1eoUw3a0ftKHvZeBy5FrOj9kTK4xfynwDf3TW9q13neM0YbFN4EikvYjqhJbg-", "site_full": "www.freelancer.com.pe", "site": "freelancer.com.pe", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.com.pe/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "freelance_writing"], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "design artwork urgent by alexIBZ", "title_full": "design artwork urgent by alexIBZ", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "PE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9432a75f7f7eb475a3b28dc8fc77cfaf9c5bb061", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKprIkY0g9nZJO8b1eoUw3a0ftKHvZeBy5FrOj9kTK4xfynwDf3TW9q13neM0YbFN4EikvYjqhJbg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "design artwork urgent by alexIBZ", "text": "Dise\u00f1o de carteles design artwork urgent \nHi, I need artwork recreated from a similar image.

Alexa for business can be used at an employee\u2019s desk to place calls or create a to-do list. But it can also be used in a conference room to start a meeting, dialing phone numbers and controlling AV equipment. And companies can create apps \u2014 which Amazon is calling \u201cskills\u201d\u2014 to enable Alexa to handle a variety of tasks around the office, Amazon says: \u201cUsing your custom Alexa skills, Alexa can provide directions, find an open meeting room, order new supplies, report building problems, or notify IT of an equipment issue. Alexa can also provide important information, like inventory levels, and help with on-the-job training.\u201d Alexa for business may raise security concerns for some businesses, notes an article in The Wall Street Journal . The question is whether corporations will be willing to load up their workplaces with Alexa microphones that connect to the cloud when someone says \u201cAlexa.\u201d WeWork, a provider of shared workplaces and other services, says in a blog that it has been testing Alexa in its corporate headquarters . WeWork has developed \u201ctechnology that responds to the needs of people using meeting rooms,\u201d the blog says. A person in a meeting could ask Alexa to extend a meeting. Or to request WeWork to adjust the temperature or the lighting. WeWork see voice-enabled technologies as a step beyond touch screens as interfaces for getting things done. The introduction of Alexa for business is part of a larger battle among tech giants over voice-enabled devices, says another report in The Wall Street Journal . Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft all have virtual assistants. Will they jump into the workplace as well with products aimed specifically at business?

Manhattan, in particular, has come unbelievably far from its boomtown roots as an oyster-shelling paradise. 21st Century Manhattan is marked by a huge amount of industrial diversity, and a greater amount of capital. The rate at which monumental structures are being commissioned on the island is only increasing, which is really saying something when you consider how many landmarks have already been fixtures for decades. and here we can identify something of a sea change. \n\n\nNow more than ever, the grandeur of New York\u2019s architecture is in housing. Lower Manhattan has cemented itself as one of the U.S\u2019s most desired living places, and the world\u2019s best and most coveted designers been given notice. And so, here in 2017 New York, we are continuing to see a prominent showing from starchitects who want to try their hands at authoring Manhattan\u2019s next great residential building. \nSo what exactly is a starchitect? The term itself has been floating around for some time now, and its popularity makes perfect sense. Design culture and its progenitors are slowly but surely making their way into the pop-culture sphere. Tom Ford hires Tadao Ando, Tobey Mcguire hires Peter Zumthor, etc. As the cultural crossover continues the public\u2019s interest in the world of high design will become stronger and stronger. After all, what could lead the layman to a greater appreciation of design if not the idolization of the designer? \nIn the past 5 years, Bjarke Ingels Group, Zaha Hadid Architects, Robert A.M. Stern, Frank Gehry, Annabelle Selldorf, and OMA (Rem Koolhaas) to name a modest handful have either completed or begun construction on large scale residential projects across the island. \nThese buildings service a particularly high-income demographic, and there will never not be criticism inherent in this decision on the part of the architect. High-end residential projects in Manhattan have become symbols of the death grip that the international elite have on the lower half of the Island.Since its completion, Rafael Vinoly\u2019s needle-thin 432 Park Avenue has become a totem to the garish wealth that has been agglomerating along the edge of Central Park. Also on the park, Robert A.M Stern\u2019s 15 Central Park West, just one of many projects the architect has designed in the Manhattan\u2019s residential sector in the recent past, adding to his impressive resume on the East Coast. 175 West 10th St \nNeil Denari\u2019s Highline 23 is a headlining act in a series of high-profile projects which have popped up adjacent to the repurposed subway line and made the area that much less affordable in the process. Starchitects involvement in cases such as these gives a face to the condition of gentrification in urban spaces, and so they\u2019re rebuked; as sellouts, elitists, or any other moniker you could hand to a person who deals closely with great amounts of wealth. \nThese gripes aren\u2019t unfounded. Still, it\u2019s important to remember that for as long as the conception of a better, more thoughtful shelter has been a conscious effort (i.e. the beginning of human history), exceptional work has pooled alongside exceptional amounts of resource. It seems unjust to chastise New York\u2019s next wave of designs from our most cherished designers based solely on financial underpinnings, especially when Manhattan offers so many ways to appreciate architecture beyond the statistics. For instance, there\u2019s the skyline appeal. It should go without saying that New York\u2019s skyline is essentially not comparable with that of any other North American City, although we\u2019ll give honorable mentions to Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco for the sake of good sportsmanship. Observing the skyline is more than just enjoyable, it\u2019s mesmerizing and cathartic. From this angle, it seems wholly exciting that a group like Herzog & de Meuron would take on a high-rise commission in lower Manhattan, and not just for those who have the opportunity to live in it. \nAnd then there\u2019s the bottom line. In my time in New York, I\u2019ve arrived at some simple conclusions on the matter. It can only be a good thing that starchitects exist, if only for the public to use the name as a means of remembering that there is something worth thinking about in the buildings that surround us. It\u2019s also important to remember that those names have power for a reason, whether you\u2019re a prospective tenant or an aimless twenty-something, New Yorkers are living in a time when they can expect consistently interesting housing to continue to appear on the horizon, or just around the corner.

The global international commitment of the Paris Agreement to keep the global temperature increase below 2\u00b0C is a tall order. Under the Paris plan, each country put forward a proposal to curtail its greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2030. Today, the magnitude of industry change required to adapt to a 2\u00b0C scenario is just starting to emerge. And not only the magnitude. The required pace of change needed within the next few decades is often overlooked and is critical in a sector that is both resource and carbon intensive. This is the case despite recent remarkable efforts by forward-looking players to deploy transformational innovations. \nLafargeHolcim, as a leading global building materials company, is focusing efforts to reach its 2030 ambition to reduce CO 2 emissions per tonne of cement by 40% vs 1990 levels. The efforts needed to achieve this goal are considerable and require a holistic and far-reaching approach. 2\u00b0C business models \nGlobal warming is already damaging the environment and the health of millions \u2013 and yet reluctance to change remains high. \u201cAfter the last No, there will be a Yes,\u201d as strongly expressed by Al Gore at COP21, \u201cand it is on this Yes that we will build the future\u201d. In other words: the sector will have no other choice than to align efforts to deliver on the objective of carbon neutrality by the mid-century. The early movers \u2013 those who are able to develop meaningful \u201c2\u00b0C business models\u201d\u2013 will be the winners of the race. It also makes business sense. \nThis year\u2019s COP23 in Bonn, Germany, highlighted the remaining gap between individual countries\u2019 commitments and the 2\u00b0C objective. Businesses could help bridge the gap, if robust business models are enabled by targeted regulations. For those willing to drive the change, these are exciting times. Construction is a field of action that can deliver a massive greenhouse gas emission reduction and create real low-carbon business opportunities, while fulfilling \u2013 with pride! \u2013 the infrastructure and housing needs of the increasingly urbanised world population. A science-based approach: the new paradigm? \nA rational strategy to address climate change in a business sector is today increasingly reliant on a so-called science-based approach, meaning a strategy that aims at reaching mitigation targets in line with the level of decarbonisation required to stay below the 2\u00b0C global temperature increase. \nThe application of this concept to the very fragmented construction sector appears to be rather complex and raises fundamental questions on how to measure and deliver actual greenhouse gas emission mitigation over the entire lifecycle of buildings and infrastructure \u2013 at the best economical cost. Complex or not, political and civil society stakeholders will be increasingly assessing companies on their ability to align to this science-based approach. \nForward-looking companies \u2013 including LafargeHolcim \u2013 are exploring these questions. This thinking process, however, remains mostly within the boundaries of each of the segments of the value chain. \nFor a building materials company, the achievement of CO 2 targets is meant to be delivered through action plans on energy-efficiency improvement or through the substitution of high-carbon raw materials, fuels, or electricity supply by low-carbon alternatives. The substitution of clinker \u2013 the carbon intensive component of cements \u2013 remains the main lever for upcoming years. Let\u2019s be clear: these actions must collectively be taken by these industries. But this will not be sufficient. \nTransformational innovations in the product portfolio, which often require adaptation of downstream techniques and/or a more holistic monitoring (and accounting) of carbon mitigation impacts, are today insufficiently (and much too slowly) deployed and rewarded. Innovation at all levels! \nPractice shows that building materials or components with a higher initial footprint per reference unit (in our sector: per tonne of cement) can deliver large emissions savings over their entire lifecycle. Thinner structures from stronger materials \u2013 high-performance concrete is the best example \u2013 can also make a real difference in total embodied emissions. Smarter designs of structures, enabled by the most innovative and high-performance materials, can unlock a CO 2 mitigation potential that can only be addressed by collaboration between every player of the construction chain. In some cases, carbon sink effects can be created and/or enhanced through appropriate practices during the life or end-of-life of materials, which is, for example, the case through the huge potential of concrete to re-carbonate and to chemically bind CO 2 from the air. \nAnd let\u2019s not forget the urgent need to advance the sector in emerging countries, where the majority of construction activities will continue to take place over the next few decades. The entire sector has a clear and direct responsibility to rapidly increase the quality of construction and to help train and educate the workforce so that materials are used in the most efficient way, so that wastage of materials and resources are drastically reduced, and so that buildings and infrastructure are designed and constructed in a way that ensures long lifetimes, resilience to climate events, and cost-effective future refurbishments, as well as affordable deconstruction and recycling solutions. The next steps on the path towards carbon neutrality \nBeyond continuous improvement of our own emissions, building material companies are essential drivers for innovation. LafargeHolcim is making ground: from low CO 2 clinkers, cements, and concrete types (such as Solidia, gaining strength through chemical reaction with CO 2 ) to energy-efficiency solutions for buildings (such as the newly launched insulating cement-based foam, Airium). The portfolio of sustainable solutions \u2013 our so-called 2030 Solutions \u2013 for the construction sector is expanding year on year. \nThe construction sector should be at the centre of regulatory efforts to mitigate CO 2 emissions. Collaborative thinking across the construction industry on common metrics and consistent targets, plus a shared vision and action plan to achieve carbon neutrality and resilience to climate disasters in the built environment, is no longer just a nice-to-have.
