The report, entitled, From Arrest to Conviction: Court Outcomes of Police-reported Sexual Assaults in Canada , 2009 to 2014 , looked at the paths of victims and accusers as they moved through the system in jurisdictions across the country during a six-year period.\nBased on police and court records, it determined just one-in-10, or 12 per cent of sexual assault cases, ended with a conviction.\nThe review, presented to Waterloo Regional Police Services Board on Wednesday (Dec. 6), illustrates that while advocacy campaigns like #MeToo may be gaining momentum to encourage victims to come forward, the judicial system has much work to do to better support them.\nChief Bryan Larkin applauded local advocacy groups for \u201cphenomenal\u201d work to make changes to support victims and cited a grassroots task force studying sexual assault unfounded rates as one example of the community and police working together toward that goal.\nThe report, however, proves there\u2019s much work to be do within the judicial system itself, Larkin said. Better training for everyone from judges to prosecutors and investigators is needed, he said.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be complacent, we have to acknowledge that we have challenges, we have to acknowledge that we have to change the way we do business,\u201d he said following the meeting.\nThat includes a commitment to change within the police organization.\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of our internal culture because we\u2019ve accepted that, and we\u2019re moving forward with some of those pieces,\u201d said the chief, \u201cand we look forward to some of the recommendations from the community task force because it\u2019s driven from the ground up and I think that\u2019s very special.\u201d\nIn Waterloo Region, the average annual rate of sexual assault reports was about 62.1 incidents per 100,000 residents during the six-year period studied, ranking slightly above the average when compared to other metropolitan areas throughout Canada.\nIn 2016, that rate of reported sexual offences dropped to 51 per 100,000, dipping just below the average. However, only 33 per cent of those reports were considered cleared in 2016, compared to the average rate of 56 per cent.\nThe discussion was of particular significance Wednesday, National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, marking the murder of 14 women at l'\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al in 1989.\n\u201cToday is a very special day in Canada around violence against women,\u201d said Larkin. \u201cIt reminds us that change is occurring, albeit, not as fast, not as quick, but there are a number of positive things and we have great people in our community doing some great advocacy and support work for our survivors.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hoped improved advocacy and supports will mean more victims of sexual violence will come forward, and while that might elevate statistics on paper, it also means victims are willing to report them, said the chief.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a message that these offences, these criminal offences, and tragic intrusive offences are occurring in our community and people feel comfortable coming forward to report them.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also hoped the task force on unfounded sexual assaults will bring recommendations forward to the police services board early next year. Meanwhile, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police is recommending Statistics Canada resume collection and analysis and dissemination of all unfounded incidents starting in July 2018, a practice that ended in 2006.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bryan larkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larkin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "waterloo regional police services board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canadian association of chiefs of police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice statistics", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waterloo region", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:06.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da87952f2fda3f9785d69ebf0dc5bfcb1eff1b73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_qs.PqEroUOP2gm85PxSF5aw.mpMvri1T3NqT5vA9HnBsYI1oC9reFkwilomenKEpLj.kbjuOj8QA5L.AjjzjbToLgcCwNyewSOZha3lvYO5dN8Gni0iu1", "site_full": "wamc.org", "site": "wamc.org", "site_section": "http://wamc.org/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Trump, Russia And Beyond: 3 Tough Questions As FBI Director Heads To Congress", "title_full": "Trump, Russia And Beyond: 3 Tough Questions As FBI Director Heads To Congress", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201712/568941870.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da87952f2fda3f9785d69ebf0dc5bfcb1eff1b73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_qs.PqEroUOP2gm85PxSF5aw.mpMvri1T3NqT5vA9HnBsYI1oC9reFkwilomenKEpLj.kbjuOj8QA5L.AjjzjbToLgcCwNyewSOZha3lvYO5dN8Gni0iu1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Carrie Johnson", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Trump, Russia And Beyond: 3 Tough Questions As FBI Director Heads To Congress", "text": "By Carrie Johnson \u2022 15 minutes ago Christopher Wray testifies during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 12, 2017, in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order. Copyright 2017 NPR.

Regulators froze the Philippines' world-first public dengue immunisation programme last week and suspended all sales of the vaccine on Monday after Sanofi said Dengvaxia could worsen symptoms for vaccinated people who contracted the disease for the first time. \"Eventually it's the court of law that is going to decide in so far as the liability of Sanofi is concerned,\" Health Secretary Francisco Duque said on ABS-CBN television The previous administration of president Benigno Aquino launched the vaccination programme last year, making the Philippines the first nation to use Dengvaxia on a mass scale. About 830,000 schoolchildren had received at least one dose of the vaccine, Duque said on Thursday. Previously the government said more than 733,000 people had been vaccinated. Sanofi's announcement last week caused great concern in the Philippines -- where the mosquito-born disease is extremely prevalent. The French company on Monday sought to allay concerns, saying Dengvaxia would not cause anyone who was immunised to die and would not cause a dengue infection. However, Duque said Thursday Sanofi's recent statements on Dengvaxia were \"confusing\". Duque said he may ask Sanofi to refund 1.4 billion pesos ($27.6 million) worth of unused Dengvaxia supplies. He added the government might also demand Sanofi set up an \"indemnity fund\" to cover the hospitalisation cost for children vaccinated under the public programme who would fall ill. Sanofi was not immediately available to comment on Duque's remarks. Asked if the government would sue Sanofi if allegations of a lack of transparency were proved, Duque said: \"I'm sure it's going to get there\". He added: \"If it's found out that (Sanofi) withheld material information that would have changed the outcome of all of these problems and the decision makers of the Department of Health in the previous administration, then they are liable.\" Duque said congressional hearings into the issue would start next week.

I don\u2019t think there is a person in this room who hasn\u2019t been affected.\u201d\nWhile there are measures in place to deal with the crisis now, there is a distinct sense of urgency in the region.\n\u201cThe consequences of this crisis is that if you\u2019re a 22-year-old, you can overdose before those solutions come in to effect,\u201d said Rebecca Webb, manager of performance for the LHIN.\nWaterloo Region has already hit a record high with 613 overdose calls to paramedics and that number is expected to reach at least 700 by the end of the year. In 2016 at this time, there were 461 calls and in 2015 at this time, there were 248.\nPolicing\nBryan Larkin, chief of Waterloo Regional Police Service, said the opioid crisis puts them in a precarious position.\n\u201cWe are heavily engaged in front line response and front line services and secondly, we\u2019re tasked with enforcing federal law,\u201d said Larkin.\nLarkin said previous to 2015, police never tracked overdose demand on police services. When the epidemic of opioids came, they noticed more stress on resources.\nIn 2015, there were 15 fatal overdoses requiring response from Waterloo police. In 2016, there were 613 demands for service for overdose-related calls. And as of Friday, there were 416 calls for service in 2017.\nBut, police aren\u2019t always called to overdoses because of the fear from those calling. There is the Good Samaritan Act, but many aren\u2019t aware that they are essentially exempt if calling in an overdose.\nLarkin added that mental health responses and drug addiction go hand in hand oftentimes. Regional police receive an average of 2,400 mental health service calls per year and so far this year, 45 police calls per month for overdoses\nLarkin said if the deaths were from other sources, it would be received much differently.\n\u201cIf we had seven deaths per month on our roadways, there would be significant outcries,\u201d said Larkin.\nIt is estimated that 65 deaths have been caused by overdoses in Waterloo Region so far this year. It breaks down into 29 in Kitchener, 27 in Cambridge and nine in Waterloo.\nLarkin added that so far this year, 3,666 calls have been received for unwanted persons in Waterloo Region and most are connected with drug use.\n\u201cThe consistent theme from our front line is the correlation to substance use and homelessness,\u201d said Larkin. \u201cWe will never arrest our way out of this public health crisis.\"\nLarkin said they\u2019ve redesigned the way they approach prisoners with health care in mind. They\u2019ve also removed the word addict from the organization and replaced it with the word use or user.\nCoun. Tom Galloway said the demand on police may change the way police operate and the level of service they provide.\n\u201cIf your garden gnome is stolen off your front lawn, maybe a police officer doesn\u2019t come and investigate,\u201d said Galloway. \u201cThat\u2019s something the community may have to get used to.\u201d\n Public health\nKaren Quigley-Hobbs, director of infectious disease, dental and sexual health for Waterloo Region Public Health, said in her 33 years, with public health, she has yet to see anything like the current opioid crisis, despite working through community-wide issues like crack cocaine in the late 1990s and early 2000s and crystal methamphetamine shortly after.\n\u201cI have yet to see something as complex as I have with this issue in Waterloo Region,\u201d said Quigley-Hobbs.\nQuigley-Hobbs said sometimes users seek fentanyl, but other times, it is taken unwillingly, which is more dangerous.\nFentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is 1,000 times more toxic than heroin and 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. It is the leading cause of a major increase in overdoses in Waterloo Region and across North America.\nCambridge\nIn Cambridge, Sanguen Health Centre, the City of Cambridge and Public Health will soon launch a program where needle patrols will be completed by \u201cpeer workers\u201d or former users.\n\u201cTrails or areas where we may have residents living in tents, etc., we may need to be a little more creative about how we approach needle disposal,\u201d said Quigley-Hobbs.\nAgain in Cambridge, there has been an Overdose Awareness Day, information events and the installation of 24/7 outdoor needle disposal kiosks. Cambridge has also been a part of the feasibility study for supervised injection services.\nCambridge is also expected to host a rapid access clinic, as part of the LHIN funding, which is expected to make a significant difference. Unlike the emergency room, rapid access clinics can start with treatment immediately, ranging from referrals to addictions counselling to prescription medication for withdrawal symptoms.\nFrom a policing perspective, Larkin said Cambridge there is a \u201cdifferent clientele.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see it\u2019s fairly spread out throughout the region, but there are challenges in one specific portion of Cambridge, as it is with Kitchener,\u201d said Larkin.\nMayor Doug Craig, who originally requested the special meeting, said the negative focus on Cambridge is unfair.\n\u201cWe have community groups working with local government and regional council and making things better.\u201d\n Supervised injection services\nRegional staff is currently working on a study on whether or not supervised injection sites are feasible in Waterloo Region.\nRegional council has given staff the go-ahead to start the study, which is expected to come back to the community services committee in early 2018.\nPhase 1 of the study, determining the need and broad community input, has been completed.\nPhase 2 of the plan, with approval from regional council, would be consideration of potential locations and council/community consultation.\nIf council is in agreement, staff would send an application to the province to join the supervised injection program.\nCoun. Helen Jowett questioned Larkin about how the enforcement around safe injection sites will be approached.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a complex balancing act,\u201d said Larkin, adding that the police service will have to look at how to balance perception of enforcement with local safety.\n\u201cThe person is going to get there and say they\u2019re not going because I\u2019m going to get stopped and questioned and arrested,\u201d said Larkin.\nPublic health is mandated by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to provide clean needles. All regions in Ontario have needle Syringe Programs. None are \u201cone-for-one\u201d programs. Quigley-Hobbs said any programs set up on the exchange basis are doomed to fail.\nIndividuals given clean needles are also provided with disposal containers in various sizes. The sharps containers can be returned to any needle syringe program location.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

The name of the victims has been kept under wraps due to a court order. \nDetails of the judgment \nThe Australian citizen is reportedly going to file an appeal soon. He is now out on a $40,000 bail. \nDuring the time of judgment, Hamidah Ibrahim, the District Judge said that his actions were deliberate and not accidental. \nN K Anitha, during the hearing, told the judge that the court should impose a jail sentence of 11.5 months and three cane strokes to the culprit as he has committed such a heinous crime. Anitha also added that Burridge, being un-flinched after the first attempt committed a similar crime within an hour which indicates his criminal mindset. \nShashi Nathan, Burridge's lawyer, pleaded the court to give a jail sentence to his client in between five to six months, as Burridge was completely intoxicated with alcohol during the time of the crime. \nDetails of the crime \nThe first incident associated with the case happened on October 8, 2015, at around 11.00 PM. When Burridge was at a bar in Canton Street, he touched the private parts of a 46-year-old events consultant from under her skirt. As Burridge violated the personal space of the lady, she turned around and hit the Australian man. The lady soon informed the bar's manager, and he informed the police immediately. \nThe second incident happened an hour later when Burridge molested the second woman in another bar at the North Canal Road.

The sun is reflected in the sea. Winter is mild and spring comes early. This all contributes to a long growing season, resulting in great the taste and complexity of the cherries. \nOnly the small, black Danish Stevnsb\u00e6r cherry, referred to by fruit experts as the Nordic grape, is used in the wine production. The berries themselves are not suitable for eating, but they are, in turn, excellent for wine production. \nStevnsb\u00e6r cherries are found in several parts of Northern Europe, but the Danish berries are the very best. \nFrederiksdal Estate dates back to 1305, the present white main building being built in 1756. \n\nPRODUCTION \n44 ha. \nAfter fermentation the wine is decanted into small, 25-litre carboys, and left outside in the sun for a year. \nThe wine is then stored for another year in used, 450-litre, Cognac barrels. \n\nCHERRY ORCHADS (STEVNSB\u00c6R cherry) \nNielstrupmark: 13.4 ha .

Nearly 1,800 firefighters and a fleet of aircraft are fighting the flames but the blaze is only 5% contained and an estimated 12,000 buildings are in danger. \nEarlier a wildfire in a wealthy western area of Los Angeles reached an estate and winery owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. \nRoxanne Langer at Moraga Vineyards in Bel Air said a temperature-controlled wine storage shed burned after the fire erupted before dawn, but it was unclear how much wine was lost. \nShe said firefighters stepped in to douse the flames with the aid of helicopters and that other storage sheds, the winery itself and the estate's unoccupied house are not damaged. \nThe winery, bought by Mr Murdoch for about 30 million dollars in 2013, has been evacuated. \nMs Langer said it appeared the seven acres of vines suffered only slight damage and the grapes already had been harvested. \nIn a Facebook statement, Mr Murdoch said some neighbours suffered heavy losses and his thoughts and prayers were with them. \nOn Wednesday firefighters managed to stop the spread of a wildfire that has destroyed homes near the world-famous Getty museum in Los Angeles. \nDeputy Fire Chief Charles Butler said firefighters and aircraft stopped the growth of the 475-acre blaze in the Bel Air neighbourhood. \nMr Butler said four homes had been destroyed and 11 damaged since the blaze erupted before dawn on Wednesday in an area that includes many hilltop mansions. \nAbout 700 homes, an apartment building and a school were ordered evacuated.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "langer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murdoch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roxanne langer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupert murdoch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "butler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bel air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bel air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moraga vineyards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:07.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2c682225686674aaa6bfc2e8adb7ba2ca6777f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DH4fzRhcB2ytvlXvTYS3gjp9pJbxl8TetZzExkicolG6k0qcwldjm7Mp3IMktaN5zbEvpu9hltfdqTnBpHwzrD32d6wzSlSXgo", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site": "huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/feeds/verticals/uk-tech/index.xml", "site_categories": ["politics", "financial_news", "law_government_and_politics", "finance"], "section_title": "HuffPost UK -

megawatts in the first quarter of 2017. \nThese plants will be constructed on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis in the Upper Egypt governorates of Aswan and Minya, official sources told Alborsa News.

authority will launch bid instead so firms can compete for it, sources added. \nOn 23 October, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) announced that it will fund implementation

Samantha Bee Defends Hillary Clinton\u2019s Close Friendship with Harvey Weinstein The blame, the \u2018Full Frontal\u2019 host argued, should lie with the \u201cshitty media men\u201d who covered candidate Clinton unfairly. Marlow Stern 12.07.17 4:30 AM ET \nEarly Wednesday, The New York Times published an eye-opening report titled \u201cHarvey Weinstein\u2019s Complicity Machine.\u201d In it, five reporters spoke to over 200 sources to examine how far the movie mogul and accused serial rapist\u2019s tentacles spread across various industries in order to provide him cover for his alleged crimes, with the former Miramax honcho allegedly employing spies, gossip columnists, media executives, power-agents, and more to do his bidding. \nOne of the more shocking revelations in the expos\u00e9 concerned Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, a longtime friend of Weinstein\u2019s who benefitted from his not-so-benevolent largesse. \nDuring her historic presidential run, one of her most outspoken celebrity surrogates, Lena Dunham, claims to have informed Kristina Schake, Clinton\u2019s deputy communications director, of Weinstein\u2019s predation. \u201cI just want to let you know that Harvey\u2019s a rapist and that is going to come out at some point. I think it\u2019s a really bad idea for him to host fundraisers and be involved [with the campaign],\u201d Dunham alleges to have told her. \nTeam Hillary appears to have brushed aside Dunham\u2019s warning\u2014as well as one from Tina Brown, a former business associate of Weinstein\u2019s\u2014and allowed the then movie exec to continue to host lavish fundraisers for the Clinton campaign, including a star-studded Broadway fete one week before Election Day. To make optics worse, Hillary also had dinner with Weinstein and his team days after her election loss, where the group discussed plans to develop a TV documentary about her campaign. \nAll of this proved very, very confusing for longtime Hillary superfan Samantha Bee . \n\u201cJust today, we learned more about the network of powerful people who turned a blind eye to Harvey Weinstein\u2019s demonic behavior\u2014including powerful people who should really, really, really, really know better. Really ,\u201d said Bee on her late-night show Full Frontal . \nShe added: \u201cOh, my admiration for you is so complicated! Maybe she actually did have a stroke in the specific part of her brain that identifies shitty men.\u201d \nBut the comic then shifted the blame during her Wednesday night monologue from Hillary to the cabal of \u201cshitty media men\u201d who Bee believes treated candidate Clinton unfairly, offering that \u201cvirtually every man who ever expressed an opinion about her in front of a camera turned out to be a huge creep.\u201d \nBee then addressed many of the \u201cshitty\u201d men in media who\u2019ve been accused of sexual misconduct, from Mark Halperin to Glenn Thrush to Matt Lauer to Charlie Rose.

\u201cMaharaja\u201d (emperor) title on him, Lim Kit Siang has passed the crown to Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak. \nCommenting on Najib's proclamation that \u201cUmno, God willing, would rule the nation for 1,000 years\u201d, Lim said that this is not the mindset of a democrat. \n\u201cBut (the mindset of) a Maharaja or Maharaja-wannabe,\u201d he added in a statement this afternoon. \nThe DAP veteran said a democrat accepts the principle that the people are the final arbiters of which political party or coalition rules and accepts their verdict. \n\u201cThe voters would not be threatened with chaos, unrest or whatever horrifying consequences if they vote for a change of government, nor would any government or party leader boast of ruling a country for a thousand years,\u201d he added. \nLim also reminded the Umno president that Adolf Hitler's Nazi Third Reich also aspired to rule for 1,000 years but collapsed after 12. \n\u201cI wonder whether Najib would call Hitler a democrat?\u201d he asked. \nNajib had mentioned his hope to see Umno thriving for centuries to come in his policy speech at the party's 71st annual general assembly at the Putra World Trade Centre (PWTC) in Kuala Lumpur this morning. \nLike Shahrizat ( photo ), the Umno president's speech was also peppered with warnings for the Malay electorate about the opposition, especially the predominantly Chinese-DAP, coming to power. \nThe Wanita Umno chief had said that the coming general election would present the people with a choice between a leader with a \u201cgood record\u201d such as Najib and \u201cMaharaja Lim\u201d, whereas Najib claimed that voters must pick a bright future with BN or a \u201cdark road\u201d under DAP. \nHowever, Lim said the next election is a crucial test on whether Malaysia is capable of a becoming a normal democratic nation. \n\u201cCountries which are normal democratic countries, like in Europe, Australia, Canada, the United States, and in Asia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Philippines and increasingly, Indonesia, everyone accepts the democratic principle that the government-of-the-day is decided through the ballot boxes. \n\u201cAnd there are no political leaders who aspire to become 'Maharajas' or 'Maharaja-wannabes' with thousand-year rule visions. \n\u201cIs Najib prepared to prove that he is a democrat by declaring that he would accept the democratic verdict of the people in the 14th general election and would peacefully hand over power if this is the decision of the Malaysian voters?\u201d he asked. \nLim also raised the 1MDB issue, particularly US attorney-general Jeff Sessions' description of the scandal as \u201ckleptocracy at its worst\u201d during a conference in Washington DC on Monday, the eve of the Umno meet. \nHe said that despite this, no Umno leader or delegate was \u201csufficiently patriotic\u201d to call on Umno to be in the forefront to take belated measures to clear and cleanse Malaysia's name. \nApart from this, the veteran politician recounted the words of Malaysia's founding father Tunku Abdul Rahman, who called on all \u201cto work and strive with hand and brain to create a new nation, inspired by the ideals of justice and liberty \u2013 a beacon of light in a disturbed and distracted world\u201d. \nLim asked if Malaysia has achieved this dream in the past six decades. \n\u201cFrom 'a beacon of light in a disturbed and distracted world', we have ourselves become a 'disturbed and distracted' nation,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Within the index, 24 stocks rose, 14 fell and 12 were unchanged. Turnover was $145 million. \n\"Offshore markets didn't give us too much of a lead last night, and the market is probably just recovering from the first three days of the week, which have been pretty poor,\" said Grant Williamson, director at Hamilton Hindin Greene. \"The closer we get to Christmas the more the volumes will continue to fall back.\" \nFletcher Building led the index, up 3.2 percent to $7.01. \n\"There has been a lot of interest focussed on Fletcher Building for no particular reason but its oversold position - it has bounced back up on bargain hunting,\" Williamson said. \nSpark New Zealand rose 2.5 percent to $3.64 and Air New Zealand gained 2.1 percent to $3.225. \nKathmandu Holdings was the worst performer, down 2.1 percent to $2.34, with Mainfreight down 1.5 percent to $24.15 and Tourism Holdings falling 1.3 percent to $5.30. \nA2 Milk Co dropped 1.9 percent to $7.93. It has settled a court case in Australia with its rival Lion Group. Lion had brought a case against A2 over the science behind health-related claims about the milk, with A2 countersuing over its milk brand's use of A2 protein claims, seeking an injunction and damages. Both companies have agreed not to pursue their claims and have come to a confidential settlement. \n\"That share price has got a mind of its own, the news didn't have too much of a bearing on the stock at all,\" Williamson said. \nZ Energy dropped 0.8 percent to $7.62. Yesterday, the government said it has asked the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to further investigate fuel prices and is looking to increase the Commerce Commission's market studies powers by the end of next year after getting more information on the fuel market. \n\"There's been a lot in the media and it has got one or two investors a little bit nervous,\" Williamson said. \nTrustpower dipped 0.5 percent to $5.95. It is eyeing up King Country Energy's retail business as it teams up with King Country Electric Power Trust to buy out the remaining minority shareholders. \nThe Tauranga-based utility company will form an unincorporated joint venture with the trust, which owns 19.98 percent of King Country Energy, which will then make a takeover offer for the central North Island electricity generator and retailer, it said in a statement. The $5 a share offer is a premium to the $4.50 the shares last traded at on the Unlisted exchange before being halted on Dec. 3. \nOutside the benchmark index, Tegel Group fell 3.3 percent to $1.18. The shares dropped nearly 13 percent yesterday after it said first-half earnings fell 2.3 percent, missing estimates and stoking concern it hasn't managed to stabilise profitability in a domestic market where competition is restraining prices. \n\"Tegel has taken a bit of a battering, it's not at its lows yet from when it got hit extremely hard in the middle of the year but investors are certainly not liking that,\" Williamson said. The stock reached a record low $1.05 in June. \nOpus International Consultants was unchanged at $1.81. It will de-list from the NZX in January, with its shares to be suspended from Dec. 11, after being acquired by Canadian listed consultancy firm WSP Global Inc. \n(BusinessDesk) BusinessDesk \nIndependent, Trustworthy New Zealand Business News \nThe Wellington-based BusinessDesk team led by former Bloomberg Asian top editor Jonathan Underhill and Qantas Award-winning journalist and commentator Pattrick Smellie provides a daily news feed for a serious business audience.

December 7, 2017 09:24 GMT David Cassidy died on 22 November due to multiple organ failure David Livingston/Getty Images \nFormer teen icon David Cassidy was always open about his estranged relationship with daughter Katie Cassidy. It has now been revealed that David had completely cut Katie out of his will, further proving how irreparable the divide between them was. \nThe Partridge Family star, who died in November at the age of 67 , stated in his will: \"It is my specific intent not to provide any benefits hereunder to Katherine Evelyn Cassidy and/or any descendant of Katherine Evelyn Cassidy.\" \nAccording to the documents obtained by The Blast , Cassidy had $150,000 in various assets. \nThe majority of it has been inherited by son Beau, a 26-year-old singer-songwriter. \nThe will also stated that anything that was \"music memorabilia\" was to be left with his three half-siblings. \nCassidy who gained fame playing Keith Partridge in the 1970s musical-sitcom The Partridge Family, had struggled with alcoholism for most of his adult life. \nHe had spoken about his troubled relationship with Katie in an interview with People magazine. \n\"I've never had a relationship with her. I wasn't her father. I was her biological father but I didn't raise her. She has a completely different life,\" he said. \nKatie was raised by her mother Sherry Williams and stepfather Richard Benedon. \nHe said, however, that he was proud of her achievements as an actor. \n\"I'm proud of her. She's very talented. It's hard for me to even accept how old she is now, like 30.\" \nKatie has appeared in TV series such as Arrow, Gossip Girl and Supernatural. Katie Cassidy as Black Siren The CW / YouTube \nHis relationship with son Beau, however, was completely different. The two were very close and the yesteryear star called him a \"beautiful person\". \nIn the same interview he said: \"He's just one of the best people you'll ever meet in your life and it's that that I'm proud of.\" \nDespite their fractured bond, Katie had paid an emotional tribute on Twitter to her father after his death. It read: \"Words cant express the solace our family's received from all the love & support during this trying time. My father's last words were 'So much wasted time'.

Yesterday was one of those days that you will always remember. I remember when African Bank went to zero, it probably spent more time that day in volatility auctions than trading freely. Other days that come to mind would be the day after Brexit and then the day after QE was announced (that was a good day).\nIt was carnage for Dr Christo Wiese in particular, where over and above the Steinhoff train wreck, all his other companies also sold off heavily too. Shoprite was down 5.9%, Brait was down 5.2%, Invicta was down 3.1%, Tradehold was down 3.2% and Pallinghurst was down 2%.\n\nI suspect that over the coming days we will get SENS announcements from some or all those companies saying that Wiese has sold some of his shares. What the above graph doesn\u2019t capture is that Wiese bought some of his shares using debt, or the use of leverage to boost his returns with an appreciating share price. The problem with leverage is that it bites hard when a share drops, more so because as soon as the share drops the bank lending you money tells you to sell your shares to pay their loans.\nIn September 2016, Steinhoff issued a whole bunch of shares to help them pay for the US purchase of Mattress Firm. Wiese bought 314 million more shares at a price of EUR 5.055 per share, for a total value of EUR 1.587 billion. Wiese may be one of the richest men in the world, but to come up with EUR 1.6 billion in cash is not easy. To raise the money for the new shares he had to borrow it. To do that he had to use existing shares as collateral.\n\u201c[Entities linked to Wiese]. . . have pledged to Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Nomura International Plc (together the \u201cFinancing Banks\u201d), 628 million ordinary shares. . . Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited, provided additional facilities to companies controlled by Dr Christo Wiese.\u201d\n \nHe bought his shares at EUR 5.055, last night the stock closed at EUR 1.14; his collateral went from being worth EUR 3.14 billion to now only being worth EUR 715 million. I don\u2019t know how much he borrowed from the investment banks but if it is more than those shares are worth, he might be a forced seller. Selling now means that he is locking in his losses. Ouch!\nI have seen a number of people saying after the fact, that it was clear Steinhoff was going to implode. Wiese, a seasoned business man and Steinhoff insider wouldn\u2019t have bought R 123 000 000 worth of stock (using debt), if he thought the company was on the brink of implosion. Less than a month ago Wiese bought 2 000 000 more shares at R61.46. He bought them through a single stock future, meaning more leverage. Having a dispute with a business partner is not uncommon. Going to court over tax structuring is not ideal but again not uncommon for a multinational company. When operating in just one country, tax codes are pretty black and white. When you start operating across the globe, things get very grey and loop holes appear.\nIt currently looks like the reason for Jooste\u2019s resignation relates to Steinhoff overstating the strength of their balance sheet, allowing them to get better financing rates.\nMarket Scorecard. US markets fluctuated between green and red the whole day. The Dow was down 0.16%, the S&P 500 was down 0.01%, the Nasdaq was up 0.21% and the All-share was down 1.64% .\n \nLinkfest, lap it up \nByron\u2019s Beats \nWhat did Steinhoff do wrong ? Or more specifically (at this stage) Markus Jooste. It is still up in the air at the moment because nothing official has come out but there are many theories doing the rounds.\nFrom what I can gather, one of the main dodgy tactics was to create off balance sheet entities to house non preforming assets or to purchase intangible assets from Steinhoff. This is a simple explanation, it is far more complicated than just that.\nAnother allegation suggested that the reporting on Conforama was incorrect. Throughout the period they owned that asset, they actually had a JV partner who was sharing all the profits yet they indicated to the market that they owned that asset outright.\nWe will have to wait for the external investigation to find out exactly what happened.\nWhen you make investment decisions there is an element of trust you place in the management team . Christo Wiese, one of South Africa\u2019s smartest businessmen had put the majority of his wealth into this company. As Chairman you would expect (and trust) he knew exactly what was going on behind the scenes. Clearly this was not the case\n \nMichael\u2019s Musings \nIt is amazing how quickly things have changed in the retail space . As a consumer, being able to order online and have it delivered to my desk is a huge win \u2013 There are 170,000 fewer retail jobs in 2017 \u2013 and 75,000 more Amazon robots .\n\n \nBright\u2019s Banter \nVolkswagen executive Oliver Schmidt has been sentenced to seven years in prison after admitting guilt under a plea agreement in August. He\u2019s the eighth executive to be charged in the VW emissions scandal.\nIt get\u2019s worse, the German authorities are also launching their own fresh investigations on other VW vehicles potentially breaking environmental laws \u2013 VW Executives Gets Seven Years For US Emissions Fraud \nWal-mart or Wal-mart Stores has finally changed its name to Walmart. The company\u2019s name change is inspired by its move to push online shopping so it can compete with the likes of Amazon. Walmart\u2019s push online is so aggressive not even a hyphen can stand in its way \u2013 Wal-mart Changes Its Name To Walmart In Push Online \n \nHome again, home again, jiggety-jog.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

The resolution passed Wednesday condemns \"murderous ethnic cleansing and atrocities against civilians\" in Myanmar's response to attacks by Rohingya militants in late August.

Kim Jong Un posing next to the new Hwasong-15 missile KCNA/Reuters \nAs the US and South Korea conducted an annual power exercise in Korean peninsula this week, the tensions in the region have hit a new high. Now, North Korean Foreign Ministry has said that a war is inevitable as the United States and its allies are continuing their provocation by conducting military drills. \nAn inevitable war in the Korean peninsula \nThe unnamed Pyongyang Foreign Ministry spokesman said that top US officials including CIA Director Mike Pompeo have already exposed America's intention of starting a war with a series of 'bellicose remarks.' \n\"These confrontational war-mongering remarks cannot be interpreted in any other way but as a warning to us to be prepared for a war on the Korean peninsula,\" said the spokesman, Reuters reports . \nThe spokesman also added that the country is not wishing for a war, but will not hide from it if it breaks out. \n\"The remaining question now is: when will the war break out? We do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it,\" said the North Korean spokesman, reports Reuters. \nPolitical experts also believe that a war may break out at any moment in the Korean peninsula, as the Kim Jong-un led regime conducted a new test of their latest Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile which is capable of hitting the US mainland. \nSoon after the missile test, H R McMaster, the White House national security adviser said that the possibility of a war with North Korea is increasing day by day. \nFearing a possible conflict with North Korea in the near future, U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham requested Donald Trump to call back the dependents of US army officials who are now living in South Korea. \nChina may back Pyongyang in the event of war \nWhen the US and South Korea were busy conducting the annual air power exercise over the Korean Peninsula, China staged exercises above the Yellow and East Seas, areas in which it has never flown before. According to political experts, China has conducted the drills intentionally to send a message to the US. \nLi Jie, a Beijing-based military expert, told the South China Morning Post that this high profile air drill from the country is a strong warning to Washington not to provoke Pyongyang any further.

By David Sim December 7, 2017 09:24 GMT \nThe remote town of Nueva Fuerabamba in Peru's southern Andes was supposed to serve as a model for how companies can help communities uprooted by mining. Built to house around 1,600 people who gave up their rural village to make room for a massive, open-pit copper mine, the new town boasts paved streets and modern houses with electricity and indoor plumbing, once luxuries to the indigenous Quechua-speaking people who now call this place home. People walk down a street in the town of Nueva Fuerabamba Mariana Bazo/Reuters \nThe mine's operator, MMG Ltd, the Melbourne-based unit of state-owned China Minmetals Corp, threw in jobs and enough cash so that some residents no longer have to work. However, the high-profile deal has not brought the harmony sought by villagers or MMG. \nNueva Fuerabamba was at the centre of one of the most generous mining settlements ever negotiated in Peru. But three years after moving in, Reuters interviews with two dozen residents show that many are struggling with suburban life and its supposed conveniences. They miss their old lives growing potatoes and raising livestock. Some have squandered their cash settlements. Idleness and isolation have dulled the spirits of a people whose ancestors were feared cattle rustlers. Reynaldo Llanqui carries his daughter down a street in the town of Nueva Fuerabamba Mariana Bazo/Reuters \nMMG inherited the Nueva Fuerabamba project when it bought Las Bambas from Switzerland's Glencore Plc in 2014 for \u00a35.2bn. Under terms of a deal struck in 2009 and reviewed by Reuters, villagers voted to trade their existing homes and farmland for houses in a new community. Heads of each household, about 500 in all, were promised mining jobs. University scholarships would be given to their children. Residents were to receive new land for farming and grazing, albeit in a plot four hours away by car. Amenities include a hospital, football fields and a cement bull ring for festivals. Locals sit around the cement bullring in the new town Mariana Bazo/Reuters A football pitch is seen in the town of Nueva Fuerabamba Mariana Bazo/Reuters A deserted roundabout is pictured in the town of Nueva Fuerabamba Mariana Bazo/Reuters \nCash was an added sweetener. Villagers say each household got 400,000 soles (about \u00a392,000), which amounts to a lifetime's earnings for a minimum-wage worker in Peru. MMG declined to confirm the payments, saying its agreements are confidential. \nHowever, some residents say the deal has not been the windfall they hoped. Many no longer plant crops or tend livestock because their replacement plots are too far away. Jobs provided by MMG mostly involve maintaining the town because most residents lack the skills to work in a modern mine. \nTheir new two-and-three storey houses are draughty and seem flimsy compared to their old thatched-roof adobe cottages heated by wood-fired stoves, some said. Now basics like water, food and fuel \u2013 once provided by the land \u2013 must be paid for. \"Everything is money,\" Margot Portilla, 20, told Reuters. \"Before we could make a fire for cooking with cow dung. Now we have to buy gas.\" Margot Portilla strokes a lamb in the kitchen of her home in the town of Nueva Fuerabamba Mariana Bazo/Reuters Margot Portilla gives milk to a lamb in the backyard of her home in the town of Nueva Fuerabamba Mariana Bazo/Reuters A lamb lies down in Margot Portilla's huose in the town of Nueva Fuerabamba Mariana Bazo/Reuters \nCamilo Leon, a mining resettlement specialist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, says subsistence farmers have struggled to adapt to the loss of their traditions and the \"very urban, very organised\" layout of planned towns. \"It is generally a shock for rural communities,\" Leon said. \n\"It is like we are trapped in a jail, in a cage where little animals are kept,\" said Cipriano Lima, 43, a former farmer.

They went drinking,\" he said. \nThe streets of Nueva Fuerabamba were virtually deserted when Reuters visited on a weekday. Vargas said many residents have returned to the countryside or sought work elsewhere. Alcoholism, fuelled by idle time and settlement money, is on the rise, he said.

Over the 12 months through July, four residents killed themselves by taking farming chemicals, according to the provincial district attorney's office. It could not provide data on suicides in the old village of Fuerabamba. MMG, citing an \"independent\" study done prior to the relocation, said the community previously suffered from high rates of domestic violence, alcoholism, illiteracy and poverty. \nWhile the company considers the new town a success, it acknowledged the transition has not been easy for all. \"Connection to land, livelihood restoration and simple adaptation to new living conditions remain a challenge,\" MMG said. \nThe company said most have benefited from improved housing, healthcare and education. \"Nueva Fuerabamba has experienced significant positive change,\" Troy Hey, MMG's executive general manager of stakeholder relations, said in an email to Reuters. MMG said it spent \"hundreds of millions\" on the relocation effort.

The new town is cleaner than the old village, said Betsabe Mendoza, 25. She invested her settlement in a metalworking business in a bigger town. Portilla acknowledged her younger sisters are getting a better education than she did. \nNueva Fuerabamba residents continue pressuring the company for additional assistance. Demands include more jobs and deeds to their houses, which have yet to be delivered because of bureaucratic delays, said Godofredo Huamani, the community's lawyer. MMG said it stays apace of community needs through town hall meetings and has representatives on hand to field complaints. \nWhile villagers fret about the future, many cling to the past. Flora Huamani, 39, a mother of four girls, recalled how women used to get together to weave wool from their own sheep into the embroidered black dresses they wear. \"Those were our traditions,\" said Huamani from a bench in her walled front yard. \"Now our tradition is meeting after meeting after meeting\" to discuss the community's problems. \n(Reuters report by Mitra Taj, with photos by Mariana Bazo.)

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .
