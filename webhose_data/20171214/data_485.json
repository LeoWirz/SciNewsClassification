Share prices were mixed in Asia on Thursday, with Japan and Australia leading gains after U.S. inde... \nBy YOUKYUNG LEEAP Business Writer \nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) - European stocks were higher while some Asian markets recovered from the previous day's losses on Thursday as investors focused on the U.S. tax reform and an upcoming U.S. jobs report. \nKEEPING SCORE: Britain's FTSE 200 rose 0.3 percent to 7,366.77 while France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent to 5,383.07. Germany's DAX gained 0.2 percent to 13,028.86. Futures augured flat opening on Wall Street. Dow futures remained unchanged while S&P futures added 0.1 percent. \nASIA'S DAY: Asia closed mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5 percent to 22,498.03 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5 percent to 5,977.70. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed earlier losses, adding 0.3 percent to 28,303.19. Most other regional benchmarks fell. The Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.7 percent to 3,272.05 and South Korea's Kospi lost 0.5 percent to 2,461.98. Stocks in Southeast Asia were mixed. \nANALYST'S VIEW: \"Asia equity investors found themselves standing in a sea of pain at yesterday's market close and are likely breathing a sigh of relief that both EU and U.S. equity investors appear a bit more level-headed for the time being,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading at OANDA. \nTAX: The U.S. Senate voted to begin negotiation with the House to reconcile their two tax bills on Wednesday in a sign that they can iron out differences. Republican leaders are pushing to send a final blended package to President Donald Trump to sign before Christmas. \nGEOPOLITICAL ISSUES: Market reaction was muted to President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, ending decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on the issue. In other global developments, the British and Irish prime ministers spoke, seeking to overcome a logjam in Brexit talks, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. \nU.S. JOBS: A report from payroll processor ADP showed private employers added 190,000 jobs last month, slightly better than expected. The report comes two days before a government jobs report, among the last key economic indicators before the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. \nOIL: Benchmark U.S. crude recovered slightly. It added 7 cents to $56.13 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the contract sank $1.66 to settle at $55.96 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 29 cents to $61.51 per barrel. It lost $1.64 to $61.22 a barrel on Wednesday. \nCURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 112.66 Japanese yen from 112.27 yen while the euro weakened to $1.1790 from $1.1796.

Conn, who spent six months on the run after pleading guilty in a $500 million Social Security fraud scheme, was being flown back to Kentucky on Tuesday after he was caught outside a Pizza Hut in Honduras. Matt Goins AP Photo Kentucky lawyer who vanished pleads not guilty to escape By BRUCE SCHREINER Associated Press  43 AM UPDATED 1 MINUTE AGO LEXINGTON, Ky. \nA Kentucky lawyer who vanished for six months made his first court appearance Wednesday since he was caught as he faces the consequences for his role in a Social Security fraud case. \nEric Conn was in a federal courtroom in Lexington, Kentucky, the day after he was flown back to the United States following his capture outside a Pizza Hut in Honduras. \nConn's legal woes now go beyond his plea deal in the massive fraud case. He now faces escape and failure to appear charges outlined in an indictment unsealed in October while the attorney was still missing. Conn's attorney, Scott White, entered a not guilty plea to those charges during the hearing. \nWhite later told reporters that Conn was calm when they met for about 40 minutes before the hearing.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"He's obviously sad that he's back here in the sense of having to deal with this stuff that he thought he had put behind him,\" White said. \nConn, 57, was handcuffed and wore a yellow jail outfit at the hearing. After taking his seat, he looked around the courtroom and nodded toward the prosecution team. Conn only spoke when asked questions by the U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert E. Wier and offered brief replies. \nWier set a bond violation hearing in Conn's case for Dec. 28. \nWhite told reporters that he's anticipating that federal prosecutors will attempt to pursue more than a dozen charges against Conn that would have been dropped as part of his original plea deal. If Conn is ultimately convicted on those charges as well as the escape-related charges, he could face a potential life sentence, White said. \nProsecutors will present court filings to indicate whether they intend to pursue those original charges. \nA federal prosecutor declined to comment after the hearing. \nWhite said that he intends to fight any efforts to have Conn face those charges. \n\"That completely changes the tenor of what we've got to do,\" White said. \nConn was sentenced in absentia last summer to a 12-year prison term for stealing from the government and bribing a judge as part of the more than $500 million Social Security fraud case. \n\"Here's a guy that really rolled the dice,\" White said, \"because the deal we got for him is he was going to do no more than 85 percent of 12 years.\" \nHe said when he met with Conn on Wednesday morning, Conn asked about his mother and had questions about the case and where he'll be held. \nWhite said he does not know how long Conn was in Honduras or whether he'd taken refuge anywhere else. \nWhite said Conn started serving his 12-year sentence as soon as he was transferred to the custody of the U.S. government. \nConn was handcuffed and wore blue jeans and a blue jacket Tuesday evening as he arrived back in Kentucky at Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, according to media reports. \nAs reporters shouted questions at him, Conn said: \"It's good to be home,\" according to WSAZ-TV. \nConn fled on June 2 when he cut off his electronic ankle monitor. \nOne of Conn's former employees, Curtis Lee Wyatt, is facing charges of helping in Conn's escape. \nHis capture has been cheered by his former clients and their families, who have struggled to make ends meet while fighting to keep their Social Security disability checks. \nConn, who started his law practice in a trailer in 1993, had portrayed himself as \"Mr. Social Security.\" He fueled that flamboyant persona with outlandish TV commercials and small-scale replicas of the Statue of Liberty and the Lincoln Memorial at his office in eastern Kentucky. \nConn represented thousands in successful claims for Social Security benefits. \nBut his empire crumbled when authorities discovered he had been bribing a doctor and a judge to approve disability claims based on fake medical evidence. \nAmong his former clients in the impoverished coalfields of eastern Kentucky and West Virginia are many people with legitimate disabilities. \nNed Pillersdorf, an attorney representing many of Conn's former clients, has said Conn caused a \"true humanitarian crisis.\" As part of the fallout, the Social Security Administration identified about 1,500 beneficiaries who were made to undergo hearings, he said. Pillersdorf said those hearings are nearly complete, and about 700 have been found eligible to maintain the benefits.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric conn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "curtis lee wyatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert e. wier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pillersdorf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt goins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruce schreiner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ned pillersdorf", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security administration", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lexington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honduras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blue grass airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln memorial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lexington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:36.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "deaf135d6505946df3f03d2253b62dfe43408fad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80LlB01Bw9APnDghMCpd_INDIwb4hhWLuQ879jUm.9XhUY2VQhR9MZ3_xnT75kAul9.oYu2fAsE.SNmhl5lsSOtEZk4LDxAjE-", "site_full": "www.texastechpulse.com", "site": "texastechpulse.com", "site_section": "http://www.texastechpulse.com/news/news.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "TEXASTECHPULSE - Texas High Tech News", "title": "Neverfail Opens Datacenter In UK", "title_full": "Neverfail Opens Datacenter In UK", "published": "2017-12-06T21:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "deaf135d6505946df3f03d2253b62dfe43408fad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80LlB01Bw9APnDghMCpd_INDIwb4hhWLuQ879jUm.9XhUY2VQhR9MZ3_xnT75kAul9.oYu2fAsE.SNmhl5lsSOtEZk4LDxAjE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T21:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "Neverfail Opens Datacenter In UK", "text": "  Neverfail Opens Datacenter In UK Austin-based Neverfail , which develops business continuity software, said today that it has expanded with a new data center in the United Kingdom.

The utilized 3D skin model system proved to be a reliable, accurate, and reproducible tool to explore the effects of various laser settings both on skin morphology and gene expression during wound healing.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AzlrSw", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:38.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bcf12c7c436d584496b282043ceea5a771f9cc5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TTMAa_6sUXUCH0OItnOPoStQMTKyrBMx9rgv989P2ThbRIz6ExLW1Ua3mkPLGMMlLDrf_TKT7rQSRqp0_YpDAiaJhlftxERg5IRRuPd..K3ijcJsjl53pC2pxnCm9C.FfA0mYURDl4rJoJ8J3b.0_bRzBpiOm..l4lcelIIeCTCVJGioNhQyHtGY4uF_A.M6h.JHtGbAs.Vy4BWbrBDhWMswFFTo34BxS236Jfmdmt9s32LhrvZdlhwg8k1W.lMkTxdjnVGtPqh_g.Ma7QF9hKi3p_U19I0gnra8YyJR7w5pNZ1wBIIQJy", "site_full": "almz.holy.jp", "site": "holy.jp", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["web_design_html", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u4eba\u6c17\u683c\u95d8\u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u300e\u30b1\u30f3\u30ac\u30f3\u30a2\u30b7\u30e5\u30e9\u300f\u3001\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u5316\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01 | \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\uff06\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "title_full": "\u4eba\u6c17\u683c\u95d8\u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u300e\u30b1\u30f3\u30ac\u30f3\u30a2\u30b7\u30e5\u30e9\u300f\u3001\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u5316\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01 | \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\uff06\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "JP", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 63721, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bcf12c7c436d584496b282043ceea5a771f9cc5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TTMAa_6sUXUCH0OItnOPoStQMTKyrBMx9rgv989P2ThbRIz6ExLW1Ua3mkPLGMMlLDrf_TKT7rQSRqp0_YpDAiaJhlftxERg5IRRuPd..K3ijcJsjl53pC2pxnCm9C.FfA0mYURDl4rJoJ8J3b.0_bRzBpiOm..l4lcelIIeCTCVJGioNhQyHtGY4uF_A.M6h.JHtGbAs.Vy4BWbrBDhWMswFFTo34BxS236Jfmdmt9s32LhrvZdlhwg8k1W.lMkTxdjnVGtPqh_g.Ma7QF9hKi3p_U19I0gnra8YyJR7w5pNZ1wBIIQJy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u4eba\u6c17\u683c\u95d8\u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u300e\u30b1\u30f3\u30ac\u30f3\u30a2\u30b7\u30e5\u30e9\u300f\u3001\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u5316\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01 | \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\uff06\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "text": "Copyright\u00a9 \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\uff06\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 , 2017 All Rights Reserved. \u00d7 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:38.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1163fcef60885b01d8effd518f1e61a3b87af60e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_gPlYjvXugMnEGy0KIRJSqGQsr9j3byCGqmgZqYW3..0xvMgDacoLTvrYwl26G5EU-", "site_full": "www.neogaf.com", "site": "neogaf.com", "site_section": "http://www.neogaf.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=22", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Off-Topic Discussion - NeoGAF", "title": "Best Movies of 2017", "title_full": "Best Movies of 2017 - NeoGAF", "published": "2017-12-07T03:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.911, "main_image": "http://www.neogaf.com/forum/images/neogaf2/icon_social.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2568, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c5beae2eeafe97fe8eec4842832101a2fb93a45", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_gPlYjvXugMnEGy0KIRJSqGQsr9j3byCGqmgZqYW3..0xvMgDacoLTlOPuC9tBZ5PlUfOw_r2dlg--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Damerman", "published": "2017-12-07T03:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Originally Posted by EverydayBeast\nDunkirk is all my casual ass has seen from that list lol\nI haven't seen many either.

For the Home Bar \nGoing out for cocktails is one of life\u2019s greatest pleasures\u2014but so is staying in for them. Every drink connoisseur needs a home bar to match, so here are a few suggestions to spruce things up. \nGrand Marnier Cordon Rouge \nWith a recipe dating back to 1880\u2014and unchanged since then\u2014Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge is a timeless liqueur that has earned its place on any bar shelf. With an alluring tropical, bitter citrus aroma that seeps from the bottle as soon as the cork is pulled, and a beautiful glossy orange colour that coats the glass like velvet, this spirit is one to be cherished and shared. The cognac blend is aged for six months in oak casks to help give it that irresistible sweet-but-not-too-sweet flavour of toffee and orange. \nSpecial for the 2017 holidays, Grand Marnier has released a sleek limited-edition gift box (obtainable at select B.C. liquor stores) that takes its inspiration from the year Cordon Rouge was created by Louis-Alexandre Marnier Lapostolle in France. Have this liqueur in a cocktail or by itself\u2014it shines either way. \nTiffany & Co.\u2019s Gold Vermeil Crazy Straw \nPart of Tiffany\u2019s Everyday Objects collection is the Crazy Straw\u2014a playful yet sophisticated take on the childhood classic item. This one might not be for blowing bubbles in chocolate milk, but it is sure to be just as fun to use nonetheless. Made of sterling silver with gold vermeil and an enamel accent in signature Tiffany blue, the piece is available at the brand\u2019s Burrard Street location , as well as its holiday pop-up at Holt Renfrew Vancouver . Just imagine employing it for sips of sweet daquiri or tart margarita. \nPeak Ice Works Crushed Ice Tray \nWhen regular ice cubes are just too, well, regular, consider pouring drinks over jagged crushed ice. The Peak Ice Works tray, designed by W&P and available at Walrus home shop in the Cambie Village, is BPA-free and dishwasher-safe, and comes with a lid that also acts as a funnel to help guide the ice into the glass. It only produces a single serving of ice, but the thin silicone mould means the water freezes quickly between fills. \nRose Gold Cobbler Shaker \nPlated in luxurious rose gold, this lustrous cocktail shaker is made of professional-quality Japanese steel. Available at South Granville\u2019s classic store Atkinson\u2019s , the three-piece tool is sure to elevate anyone from mere mixer to mix-master. \nSeedlip Spice 94 \nFor those who prefer to keep things booze-free but don\u2019t want to miss out on the fun, consider Seedlip non-alcoholic spirits. The British company harvests natural ingredients that are then cold macerated, distilled, and blended. The result? Liquor-free liquor that doesn\u2019t skimp on taste. It is already served at some of the world\u2019s best bars, including Dandelyan in London and French Laundry in Napa , and is even on the menu at Vancouver\u2019s own Rosewood Hotel Georgia . Available in Western Canada exclusively at Litchfield , Seedlip\u2019s Spice 94 is made with cardamom, oak, all spice, grapefruit, and lemon. Cheers to that. \nWalter Craft Caesar Rim \nFrom the makers of Canada\u2019s Walter all-natural craft Caesar mix (disclaimer: this author\u2019s brother is one of its owners) comes a proprietary rim salt that is free of gluten, high-fructose corn syrup, and artificial colours and flavours. Comprised of salt flakes, smoked paprika, organic cane sugar, dehydrated garlic, onion powder, vegetable oil, and spices, this bottled rim mix raises the Caesar from basic to bold. \nBaccarat Harmonie Tumbler \nNothing says crystal quite like Baccarat, so why not splurge on some elegant tumblers? The chic, classic Harmonie collection features consecutive parallel cuts that flow down the glass, creating a layered yet clean look. This bestselling design is part of a collection that also includes highball glasses and an ice bucket. \n\u201cCold Spell, Cocktails and Savouries for a Northern Winter\u201d \nA collaboration between Whitehorse chef Michele Genest (writer of the bestselling cookbook The Boreal Feast ) and Free Pour Jenny\u2019s bitters founder Jennifer Tyldesley, Cold Spell, Cocktails and Savouries for a Northern Winter features an array of cocktail and snack recipes using ingredients native to the Canadian North. Enjoy everything from mulled wine and \u201cMoose Milk\u201d to biscotti and spiced mixed nuts in this fun coiled book, which is ready for the taking on Free Pour Jenny\u2019s website. \nSo mix up, drink up, and be merry. Someone\u2019s got to. \nExplore the wonderful world of cocktails .

We present the first study addressing molecular effects of fractional non-sequential ultrapulsed CO 2 laser treatment using a 3D skin model that allows standardized investigations of time-dependent molecular changes ex vivo. While histological examination was performed to assess morphological changes, we utilized gene expression profiling using microarray and qRT-PCR analyses to identify molecular effects of laser treatment. Irradiated models exhibited dose-dependent morphological changes resulting in an almost complete recovery of the epidermis 5 days after irradiation. On day 5 after laser injury with a laser fluence of 100 mJ/cm 2 , gene array analysis identified an upregulation of genes associated with tissue remodeling and wound healing (e.g., COL12A1 and FGF7), genes that are involved in the immune response (e.g., CXCL12 and CCL8) as well as members of the heat shock protein family (e.g., HSPB3). On the other hand, we detected a downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3), differentiation markers (e.g., LOR and S100A7), and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1\u03b1.\nOverall, our findings substantiate the understanding of time-dependent molecular changes after CO 2 laser treatment. The utilized 3D skin model system proved to be a reliable, accurate, and reproducible tool to explore the effects of various laser settings both on skin morphology and gene expression during wound healing.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AzlrSw", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:38.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8734d88e2ffc16d8db6287d312d17cd9f115b88e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90RBpXqxmMo5HNwChpE6qka4OIF46hxvCeypGIrpsE3FnGgqUYVv8ZkMd2IzV8awuWeEAlsNU66Q--", "site_full": "www.ejbc.co.uk", "site": "ejbc.co.uk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tax_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "News", "title_full": "News", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.219, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8734d88e2ffc16d8db6287d312d17cd9f115b88e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90RBpXqxmMo5HNwChpE6qka4OIF46hxvCeypGIrpsE3FnGgqUYVv8ZkMd2IzV8awuWeEAlsNU66Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "News", "text": "Low-emission vehicles plug-in grant Source: HM Revenue & Customs | | 28/11/2017 \nThe low-emission vehicles plug-in grant can help you save up to \u00a34,500 on the purchase price of a new electric or hybrid car. The scheme was first launched in 2011 and is available across the UK and offers a grant towards the price of eligible new cars. The paperwork for the grant application is handled by the dealer you purchase your car from. \nHMRC publishes a list of qualifying cars, and only cars listed are eligible for the grant. The list is divided in to 3 main categories. Category 1. Vehicles with CO2 emissions lower than 50g/km and a 'zero-emission' range of at least 112km. Category 2. Vehicles with CO2 emissions lower than 50g/km and a 'zero-emission' range of at least 16km. Category 3. Vehicles with CO2 emissions of 50 to 75g/km and a 'zero-emission' range of at least 32km. \nThe maximum grant of \u00a34,500 (previously \u00a35,000) is available for cars listed in category 1. For cars listed in categories 2 and 3, the maximum grant is \u00a32,500. The grant will pay for up to 35% of the purchase price for these vehicles up to the monetary cap of each category. The scheme is open to qualifying purchases by private individuals and businesses. \nPlanning notes \nTo qualify for the grant, the cars must also come with a warranty covering batteries for at least three years, or 60,000 miles. There is also an 'on the road' price cap of \u00a360,000 over which no grant is available. This means that many popular environmentally friendly electric cars such as some Tesla models are not available under the scheme. \nAs part of the Budget measures, it was confirmed that the a further \u00a3100m has been set aside to ensure the scheme will remain available until at least 2020 to help encourage the growth of this sector.

Post and Courier via AP, Pool, File Grace Beahm FILE - In a Nov. 29, 2016 file photo, former North Charleston police officer Michael Slager testifies during his murder trial at the Charleston County court in Charleston, S.C. Slager, who fatally shot a black motorist in 2015, could learn his fate as soon as Wednesday afternoon, Dec. 6, 2017, as his federal sentencing hearing winds down on its third day. Post and Courier via AP, Pool, File Grace Beahm Judge weighs 2 decades in prison for ex-cop's fatal shooting By MEG KINNARD Associated Press  32 AM UPDATED 4 MINUTES AGO CHARLESTON, S.C. \nA white former South Carolina police officer committed second-degree murder when he shot an unarmed black motorist to death and should expect to spend about two decades in prison, a judge said Thursday as he prepared to sentence the ex-officer for a federal civil rights violation. \nU.S. District Judge David Norton had to decide whether Michael Slager's shooting of Walter Scott in April 2015 was manslaughter or murder before he sentences the ex-officer. After he found that the shooting was murder, the judge said he'd work from guidelines that recommend Slager spend 19 to 24 years in prison. \nA formal sentence was expected later Thursday, after the judge hears testimony from Scott's family and friends. Scott's mother, Judy Scott, said through tears that her faith in God gives her the ability to forgive Slager. Scott's brother Anthony Scott echoed that sentiment. \n\"I'm not angry at you, Michael. Michael, I forgive you, and Michael, I do pray for you now and for your family, because we've gone through a traumatic time,\" he said.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nThe shooting was captured on a bystander's cellphone and shared around the world, setting off Black Lives Matter protests across the U.S. as demonstrators said it was another egregious example of police officers' mistreatment of African-Americans. \nThe shooting angered local African-Americans who complained for years that North Charleston police harassed blacks, pulling them over or questioning them unnecessarily as they cracked down on crime. But the Scott family successfully pleaded for calm, asking everyone to let the justice system run its course. \nTwo months after the shooting, a young white man killed nine black church members in a racially motivated attacked during a Bible study in Charleston. The family members of the church shooting victims struck a similar forgiveness tone after that attack. \nAttorneys for Slager said he shot the 50-year-old Scott in self-defense after the two fought and Scott reached for Slager's stun gun. They said Slager never had any \"racial animus\" toward minorities. \nStill, Slager pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott's civil rights. As part of the plea agreement reached in May, prosecutors dropped state murder charges. A year ago, a state judge declared a mistrial when jurors deadlocked. \nThe bystander's video started recording after the struggle between Slager and Scott. The video showed Scott running away from Slager and the officer firing eight times. Scott was hit in the back five times. \nAfter the shooting, Slager picked up his stun gun and placed it next to Scott. Slager contends he was securing the weapon. Prosecutors think he put it there to bolster his self-defense story. \nThe judge also found that Slager, 36, obstructed justice when he made statements to state police after the shooting. \nOn Wednesday, Scott's youngest son spoke so he could return to his high school classes. Clutching a photograph of his father, Miles Scott said he has had trouble sleeping ever since his father's death. He said he misses watching football games with his dad. \n\"I miss my father every day,\" Miles Scott told the judge through tears. \"I would like you to sentence the defendant to the strongest sentence the laws allows because he murdered my one and only father.\" \nA pre-sentencing report for Slager found that he committed manslaughter and recommended 10 to nearly 13 years in prison. But the judge was not bound by that decision. \nConvictions in police officer shootings are uncommon in the U.S. and prison time is even rarer. \nSouth Carolina has been aggressive in charging white officers who shoot unarmed black people. Four have pleaded guilty in state or federal court in the past six years. But only Slager and former state trooper Sean Groubert, who shot a man as he tried to get his wallet during a seat belt violation check, will have been sent to prison. Groubert was sentenced to five years behind bars.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael s", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "david norton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walter scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy savage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared fishman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fishman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miles scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judy scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "slager", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarlett wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael slager", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "meg kinnard associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north charleston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charleston county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charleston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charleston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:39.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8df531e82d1ea8d12cc0a5e5259e4222b3ee8613", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSX66fZOWxt.Y538NTwyHgQ_J7eCIRfTrL8tvv2fRqAXUmmPh05MX5k9e_luZeG8mzupYTJrnyKoAeNpG.q0SYMLuTv61Xwu8I4ZfW5j6f9wquoTD0r9RDkoEThCX_xud2", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Assassin's Creed", "title": "That is a Jack Cravelle above me.
