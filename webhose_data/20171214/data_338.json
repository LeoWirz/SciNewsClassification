Indraprastha Gas Limited     497,059   325.1 and high of 1624. The Success of India\u2019s Equity Market \nThe potentials of the Asian economy cannot be undermined especially when they are driven by the success and prospects of thriving economies such as that of India. \nThe equity market is one of any nation\u2019s gems. In India, the corporate sector represents roughly 14% of its gross domestic product (GDP). As a developing economy, this is already a compelling figure. In leading economies such as the US, the corporate sector represents 70% of national GDP. Indian Equity Market \nThe Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) are the two main stock exchanges in the country. They represent about 4% of India\u2019s GDP, with more than half of all publicly traded companies in the country listed on the BSE and the NSE. BSE \nThe BSE, founded in 1875, is the oldest stock exchange not just in India but in Asia as well. It is the first entity to get a permanent recognition in India under the Securities Contract Regulation Act of 1956. Presently, it is the 11th biggest stock exchange globally with a total market capitalization of $1.70 trillion as of January 2015. With a speed of six microseconds, the BSE is also one of the fastest stock exchanges globally. \nThe SENSEX 30 is the index monitoring the top 30 stocks on the BSE based on various factors such as liquidity and market capitalization. \nThe BSE first attained a four-digit figure in July 1990. When the Bhartiya Janta Party won the General Elections in October 1999, it first attained the 5,000 mark. The BSE first attained the 10,000 mark in February 2006 and the 20,000 mark in December 2007. When the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 broke out, the BSE had posted its biggest losses, declining more than 2,000 points in just two consecutive trading days in January 2008. Indraprastha Gas Limited is a stock traded on the Indian stock exchange. \nNonetheless, the BSE was able to recover from the turmoil. In March 2015, it first attained the 30,000 mark. Shortly after, it had once again posted one of its biggest one-day drop, losing 1,741 points in August 2015. The decline is primarily attributed to the devaluation of yuan. China is the biggest economy in Asia, which is why its economic downturn had a huge dent in the entire equity market of the region. NSE \nWhile the BSE is the first stock exchange in Asia, the NSE, founded in 1992, on the other hand, is the stock exchange that introduced electronic trading system in India. Because of its establishment, India had begun embracing and shifting to fully automated stock exchanges that are more efficient, reliable, and convenient. Indraprastha Gas Limited has relatively good liquidity. \nThe NIFTY is the index monitoring the top 50 companies across more than 20 sectors on the NSE based on different factors, particularly market capitalization. \nIndia is one of Asia\u2019s leading economies. With its growth prospects and potentials, the growth opportunities seem limitless as well. Consequently, investing in the Indian stock market is highly advised nowadays, given the thriving success of both the BSE and NSE. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect Indraprastha Gas Limited. \nMore important recent Indraprastha Gas Limited (NSE:IGL) news were published by: Economictimes.Indiatimes.com which released: \u201cBuy Indraprastha Gas Ltd. target Rs 334.2 : ICICI Direct\u201d on December 05, 2017, also Economictimes.Indiatimes.com published article titled: \u201cBuy Indraprastha Gas, target Rs 1620: Chandan Taparia\u201d, Economictimes.Indiatimes.com published: \u201cBuy Indraprastha Gas, target Rs 330: Sagar Doshi\u201d on November 22, 2017.

I don\u2019t watch that much TV), the beginning of my new campaign went for way over my normal 4 hours. It was probably closer to 7. Therefore, this\u2026 what exactly are these, anyway? Session reports? Recaps? Anyway, this one will be in 2 parts. This is part 1. Part 2 will be out in a few days (hopefully). \nI bought Out of the Abyss ages ago (2016), but only ran the first chapter. I ran it horribly. So, here we go! \nI began with my usual three players (the ones from the Planescape campaign). We had: \n\u00b7          Robert as Mishann Duvahkin, a female Halfling Rogue (how original*) \n\n\u00b7          Wayne as \u201cJake \ud83d\ude0a \u201d, a male Half-Orc Barbarian (also original**) and \n\n\u00b7          Jason as Darrak Unqart, a male Hill Dwarf Wizard (slightly original***) \n\n*Sarcasm \n**Also sarcasm \n***Not sarcasm \nNote that Wayne told me at the end of the session that he wanted to a make new character, which I allowed. Unless he changes his mind, Wayne will be a Tabaxi Cleric (cat people from Volo\u2019s Guide). Also, Robert recently told me he would be quitting the game.\n\n\nWe began in a Drow prison. The heroes had been captured on a raid. Also, it turns out that Drow is pronounced like drown without the N. The players refused to say it like this (we had always said it like it rhymes with row). I ruled that this was because they had a \u201csurface accent\u201d. \nThe Prison There were ten other prisoners in the cell. They were: \n           Buppido, a mad derro (mutant dwarf) who secretly believes himself to be a god. \n           Prince Derendil, a mad quaggoth who believes himself to be an elven prince transformed into a quaggoth. \n        Eldeth Feldrun, a dwarf scout from Gauntlgrym. \n      Jimjar, a deep gnome with a gambling problem. He is secretly actually  a god. \n      Ront, an orc who is very mean. \n      Sarith Kzekarit, a mad Drow who killed a friend. \n      Shuushar, a kou-toa (fish person) who refuses to fight and mediates a lot. \n      Stool, a child mycronid (sentient fungi). \n      Topsy & Turvy, twin deep gnomes who are secretly were rats. \nAs soon as the adventure started, Jake attacked Darrak so as to assert himself as the prison \u201ctop dog\u201d, so that none of the other prisoners would attack him, and would do as he said when it was time to escape. \nBecause magic didn\u2019t work in the cell, Darrak got massacred. When he went down to 2 hit points, and Jake wasn\u2019t showing any signs of stopping, the guards came in to break up the fight. They did this by shooting Jake in the chest. He made his save against the poison (he has good constitution) and backed down. \nDarrak took advantage of the open door to slip out. He rolled well on stealth. He was free! His next move was to come up with some sort of plan to get everyone else out. He tried to get Buppido\u2019s attention (they\u2019d been talking earlier). Buppido noticed, but so did the two guards. They chased him, but he climbed around a stalactite (unless it was a stalag mite. I don\u2019t know. It came from the ceiling). Three more guards arrived soon after. \nMeanwhile, Jake decided to make another attempt to become \u201ctop dog\u201d. Now, after my last campaign , I explained to the players that I wasn\u2019t OK with child murder in my games, but I don\u2019t think the message sunk in. He immediately attacked Topsy and Turvy, who\u2019d been whispering to each other in the corner. Seeing as they were wererats, his punches did no damage to them. This weirded him out quite a bit. \nHe chased them to the other end of the cell, goaded on by Ront. Eldeth, however, stepped in and told him to knock it off. He responded with a slightly sexist comment. \nI wasn\u2019t quite sure how to handle this, and after a moment of thought I had Eldeth attack him. Hey, he was half-orc (her people were at war with orcs), he was beating up kids and he had insulted her. Generally, Jake would smash Eldeth in a fist fight, but this time around he was cursed by the dice gods. Not a single hit landed, and Eldeth started to really beat him up. \nThe guards noticed what was happening at this point, and broke up the fight. It was around this time that Robert realised the guards hadn\u2019t taken back the poisoned arrow they had shot at Jake earlier. This meant they had a weapon! \nThe guards eventually captured Darrak, and took him to their leader. Along the way, they passed a shrine to Lolth that took the form of a giant spider statue. The adventure said that you had to make a check to realise it was fake. Otherwise, you thought it was real. Well, it turns out Darrak has arachnophobia. \nLet\u2019s just say the Drow were not amused by his attempts to set their sacred shrine on fire. He ended up dangling from the ceiling of the cavern upside down while real giant spiders scuttled around in their webs above him. \nIn hindsight, I should have given him inspiration for this. I will next session. If there is a next session. \nAfter a few days of doing menial work for the Drow, during which Mishann managed to swipe a few crossbow bolts and a hand crossbow, they attempted their escape. Mishann began to threaten to hang herself with a 5-foot piece of rope she\u2019d stolen if the Drow didn\u2019t let them go. They came in to confiscate the rope. As they left, Jake slipped a rock between the door and the wall, so it wouldn\u2019t close completely. I rolled really badly for the Drow\u2019s perception. \nA bit later, Jake, Mishann, Darrak, Eldeth and Ront charged out. They quickly disabled the guards and went for the armoury. They were challenged by 2 normal Drow and an elite Drow warrior. The non-fighters in the group branched off and headed for the cavern floor. The rest attempted to fight their way through, but were outmatched. \nThe non-fighters reached the cavern floor, but encountered two more Drow guards. Darrak ran forward, and heroically cast burning hands, taking them both down with a single spell. A few rounds later, things started to get crazy. Flying demons attacked, which distracted the Drow for a couple of rounds. The heroes (who were about to become quite a bit less heroic) fled the scene, along with the rest of the prisoners. \nThe made it down to the bottom of the massive cavern, and decided to go down the south passage, which leads to Gracklstugh, Buppido\u2019s home city. \nI\u2019ll end this part of the review here, but keep an eye out for the second part (a few days. Hopefully). Hang on! I\u2019ll just quickly explain what they did to become less heroic. They ate Shuushar.

Speaking to ANI, Imam Sajid Rashidi said, \"This is true that these people want to do politics of hatred and spread terror in the country. They want to take the country towards Hindu Rashtra. This country cannot become Hindu Rashtra because it is multi-cultured.\"Earlier in the day, BJP leader Vinay Katiyar had claimed that Jama Masjid was originally Jamuna Devi Temple.\"There were about 6000 places that were broken down by the Mughal emperors. Delhi's Jama Masjid was originally Jamuna Devi temple, similarly Taj Mahal was Tejo Mahalaya\", said Katiyar.The Muslim cleric from Delhi further averred that if the matter of the Ayodhya dispute is settled and the Ram Temple is being construction, the BJP might start claiming for Jama Masjid and Kashi.He noted, \"The intention of these people is very well understood by their statements. If Muslims by any chance come to a negotiation and allow the construction of Ram Temple, their politics will end.

The victory was Nebraska\u2019s first true road win since defeating Michigan in Ann Arbor on Jan. 24, 2016, as the Huskers improved to 6-3 overall while handing the Jayhawks their first loss of the season, snapping KU\u2019s seven-game home winning streak. Whitish, who opened the game 0-for-6 from the field, hit all six of her second-half shot attempts and a three-pointer near the end of the first half to help the Huskers rally from a 13-point second-quarter deficit. For the game, Whitish hit 7-of-13 from the field including 4-of-9 from beyond the arc after starting 0-for-5 from beyond the arc. Whitish also hit 11-of-14 from the charity stripe, and added four assists, five rebounds and three steals on the night. Whitish made eight consecutive free throws in the closing minutes to help the Huskers win going away. While Whitish carried the offense, Nebraska\u2019s team defense was at its best in the fourth quarter, holding the home-standing Jayhawks to just four points \u2013 all free throws \u2013 forcing KU to go 0-for-14 from the floor in the final period. Nebraska held KU to just 13 points in the second half tying for the fourth-fewest points by an opponent in the second half in school history. Nebraska led 12-7 early on the strength of terrific defense until freshman center Kate Cain picked up her second foul with less than one minute left in the opening quarter. The Big Red led 12-10 at the end of the first, but Cain did not play in the second quarter and Kansas took advantage without Cain at the rim. The Jayhawks surged to their biggest lead at 33-20 after a three-pointer by Austin Richardson with 2:35 left in first half. Whitish, who was held scoreless for the first 17:41 in the game, hit a free throw with 2:19 left. Kansas native Emily Wood then hit a three for the Big Red with 1:16 remaining, before Whitish knocked down her first field goal with her own three-pointer with 24 seconds left to trim KU\u2019s margin to 34-27. Christalah Lyons, who led KU with 12 points on the night, hit a pair of free throws with five seconds left, to send the Jayhawks to the locker room with a 36-27 lead. But Whitish carried the confidence from her made three at the end of the half into the start of the third quarter, burying another three just 15 seconds into the half to pull Nebraska within 36-30. Five straight points from Whitish, including a three with 1:46 left in the quarter gave Nebraska its first lead of the half at 43-41, but KU responded with four straight points to regain the lead. Cain tied the score with her basket with 41 seconds left, before Bria Stallworth hit a free throw with 3.4 seconds left to send the Big Red to the fourth quarter with a 46-45 lead. Lyons hit a free throw to tie the score at 46 with 8:55 left, but Whitish dominated the last nine minutes of the game. She hit another three and added a jumper to give Nebraska a 51-46 lead, before Nicea Eliely got a layup with five minutes left to give the Huskers a 53-46 edge. Another two by Whitish and a three-pointer by Wood with 3:05 left gave Nebraska a 58-46 advantage, before Kylee Kopatich ended a 7:14 scoreless drought for KU with one free throw. Kopatich finished with 10 points, but went just 3-of-12 from the field. Whitish then sealed the win with eight free throws in the final 1:31 , and a Nebraska defense sparked by tenacious ball-hawking by Jasmine Cincore and the shot-blocking of Cain shut out the Jayhawks from the field. Whitish was the only Husker to produce double figures, but she was far from the Nebraska\u2019s lone contributor. Eliely added seven points, three assists and a steal, while Wood pitched in six points, two rebounds and an assist off the bench. Maddie Simon added six points, seven rebounds and two huge steals, while Cain contributed five points, a game-high nine rebounds and a game-high five blocked shots. Cincore added five points, four assists, two steals and a block while being a disruptive force on the defensive end, especially in the fourth quarter. In all, nine Huskers found the scoring column while 10 Huskers had at least one rebound. As a team, Nebraska hit 37 percent (20-54) from the field, including 32 percent (8-25), and 18-of-28 free throws (.643). The Big Red held KU to just 28.6 percent (16-56) from the field, including just 4-of-19 three pointers. The Jayhawks were 0-for-9 from long range in the second half. Kansas also hit 13-of-23 free throws (.565). Nebraska won the turnover battle, 16-9, and outscored the Jayhawks 18-5 in points off turnovers. The Big Red lost the rebounding battle, 42-40, but outscored KU, 8-5 in second-chance points. In a defense-heavy first half, the Huskers shot just 27.3 percent on 9-of-33 shooting from the field while Kansas shot 12-of-25 (48 percent), including 8-for-11 (.727) in the second quarter alone. The Jayhawks were also 3-of-5 in the quarter from long range. In the second half, Nebraska outscored Kansas, 39-13. The Huskers continue road action on Saturday when they travel to Drake.

Resistance in Sanaa called on all the Yemeni people in the governorates, which are still under the influence of Houthi militias, to \u201cunify ranks in support of the legitimate leadership, continue the uprising against militias and back the efforts and victories of the national army and popular resistance to eradicate this malignant Iranian cancer.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Council said it highly valued the great popular uprising that broke out in most of the provinces controlled by the coup militias and the Yemeni people\u2019s anger and categorical rejection of the return of the intransigent forces that are trying to take back the country to the period that preceded the blessed revolution of September 26.\u201d\nThe Council also called on the people of Sanaa to unify their stance and maintain the uprising against Houthi militias, which began before they invaded Sanaa.\nIt also urged the president and his deputy to act quickly to achieve military victory, saying that restoring the State\u2019s legitimacy and ending the coup were the only means to save the Yemeni people.\nIn the same context, the Yemeni Rally for Reform underlined its firm position on the need to unite all national forces under the umbrella of the legitimacy of the Arab alliance led by Saudi Arabia.\nThis came during an extraordinary meeting held by the Rally\u2019s General Secretariat to examine the recent developments across the Yemeni governorates, especially the great victories achieved by the national army on all fronts, as well as the events that took place in the city of Sanaa, which ended with the death of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.\nThe party praised the efforts deployed by the Saudi-led alliance in support of Yemen\u2019s legitimate government, which have greatly contributed to the liberation of most Yemeni cities and to stopping the tyranny of Houthi militias.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

Beat Manchester United next weekend and they will equal the mark for most consecutive wins (14, by Arsenal in 2002) in the Premier League era. They are nearly halfway to the most wins in a season (30, by Chelsea last term) and well on the way to the points record (95, by Chelsea in 2004-05) and goals record (103, Chelsea again, in 2009-10). A victory over United will put them on 46 points from 16 games, which would have been enough to come eighth last season, and their 46 goals are already more than were managed by the team that did finish in that spot, Southampton. They\u2019re pretty good, really. Nick Miller\n2) Brilliant Hazard challenged to aim even higher\nEden Hazard has played the best football of his career under Antonio Conte and it is clear that the Belgian can get even better if he trusts his manager. Conte is a relentless coach and, though he regularly champions Hazard\u2019s talent, the Italian was quick to point out that the world\u2019s finest players make their names on the biggest stages. Hazard excelled in Chelsea\u2019s 3-1 win over Newcastle United, scoring twice, but the forward has been challenged to aim even higher than destroying Premier League defences. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Eden is at the peak of his career,\u201d Conte said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for him to work, work, work in every training session to improve himself. You are at the top when you win the Ballon d\u2019Or the first time, when you win the Champions League, when you win the Word Cup. At that moment you are at the top of the world.\u201d Jacob Steinberg\n3) Lacazette showing his worth even in defeat\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger seemed a bit vexed trying to explain the slightly paradoxical nature of Arsenal\u2019s loss to Manchester United because he had seen something very positive from his team\u2019s attacking waves, yet it was all overshadowed by the result. One theme that has emerged in the last week, over the home games against Huddersfield and United, is how Alexandre Lacazette has taken a big step in his integration. Wenger took a cautious approach with his record signing in the first part of the season, rather puzzlingly holding off on starts and regularly substituting the French striker. The match against United was his first complete 90 minutes in the Premier League since the opening day. His adjustment to Arsenal\u2019s game \u2013 and his team-mates better reading of his excellent movement \u2013 has taken time but he now looks totally involved and pivotal to the way Wenger wants his team to attack. Amy Lawrence\n4) Pochettino unfazed by latest defensive setbacks\nWith Davinson S\u00e1nchez likely to miss three matches as a result of the straight red card he received for throwing his arm into Richarlison\u2019s face, Spurs are facing a defensive shortage. Toby Aldeweireld has suggested he could be out for as long as four months with injury, while Cameron Carter-Vickers is on loan at Sheffield United with no recall option. Mauricio Pochettino, therefore, has only Jan Vertonghen and Eric Dier with significant experience at centre-half. On the other hand, Ben Davies has deputised in a back three and there is the Argentinian teenager Juan Foyth, signed from Estudiantes in the summer. Pochettino remained unruffled, though, after watching his team battle for a point at Watford (only their second in four matches). \u201cI am not going to complain if S\u00e1nchez will be out for a few games\u201d, he said. \u201cThat is football. It is about the squad. If he cannot play we will play with another.\u201d Paul MacInnes\n5) Rooney renaissance enthuses Allardyce\nWayne Rooney gave a display of passing and pointing. His defence-splitting ball led to Dominic Calvert-Lewin\u2019s goal and he also enforced Sam Allardyce\u2019s orders, talking team-mates into position. This authoritative display, coupled with his hat-trick against West Ham three days earlier, came after he had been an unused substitute in the previous two league games. That may not happen again soon. \u201cHe produced a good performance today and a brilliant one on Wednesday,\u201d said Allardyce. \u201cSo we have to really make sure we get him ready for every game. If we get the physical side of Wayne right then that ability never ever leaves you.\u201d He remains such an admirer of Rooney that it feels possible the stand-in skipper will replace the injured Phil Jagielka as captain. \u201cHe has had more criticism in the last couple of years than he has had praise and I think that he has handled that brilliantly,\u201d added Allardyce. Richard Jolly\n6) Liverpool leave tantalising taste of what could be\nIt was a slightly curious experience watching Liverpool thrash Brighton 5-1. On the one hand their counterattacks were so good they were life-affirming. But on the other you were left with the nagging question: if Liverpool are this good, then why aren\u2019t they better? The win, their fifth in six Premier League games, took them up to fourth, but their vim and quality going forward is that of a side who should be challenging Manchester City. The obvious answer is their defence but the glint of mental fragility that led to them conceding a three-goal lead against Sevilla is a big part of it, too. After the win at the Amex J\u00fcrgen Klopp admitted that when Glenn Murray made it 3-1, that game flashed before his eyes. \u201cWhen you have it once, unfortunately it needs a bit of time to get rid of it completely,\u201d he said. When that speck of doubt is erased, Liverpool will be much stronger. NM\n7) Allen shows Swansea what they are missing\nIn a poor game at the Bet365 Stadium that served up precious few moments of class, Joe Allen was a shining light with his display in the centre of the Stoke City midfield. The Welshman set up Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s equaliser with a lovely through ball and was at the heart of Stoke\u2019s more promising moments, with the sort of composure and intelligent passing that deserved a better stage than a scrappy fixture between two uninspiring teams. It was, in summary, an excellent piece of business on Stoke\u2019s part when they signed Allen from Liverpool in the summer before last, and a glaring and unforgivable error from Swansea\u2019s point of view to miss out on him. Allen, after all, had wanted to return to the club that he continues to support. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to stick at it and, as a fan now, I\u2019m hoping they do just that,\u201d Allen said about Swansea after Stoke\u2019s 2-1 victory. Stuart James\n8) Further justification of Puel intentions\nWhen Leicester sacked Craig Shakespeare eight games into the season, a few months after he saved them from relegation, it was fair to wonder if the board had acted hastily. Less reasonable was the antipathy that greeted the appointment of Claude Puel. The rules that govern such matters are not scientific, but he had previously led Monaco to a Ligue 1 title and Lyon to the Champions League semi-finals. Then in his first season in England he took Southampton to a final \u2013 where they played superbly \u2013 and to an eighth-place finish, only to be sacked for football unbefitting the club\u2019s sophisticated tastes. At Leicester, he is extracting the most from Riyad Mahrez, Jamie Vardy, and Demarai Gray \u2013 whose talent Shakespeare was not prepared to trust. City, third-bottom when he was appointed, now sit ninth, two places and three points above ... Southampton. Daniel Harris\n9) Bournemouth hope for best of Fraser\nRyan Fraser\u2019s biggest challenge has been finding some consistency. If he can perform well regularly, Bournemouth will reap rewards. The Scotland winger\u2019s indifferent form has frustrated himself as much as it has Eddie Howe, so much so that he asked to play for the under-21s against Plymouth Argyle last month to build some confidence. Fraser, a \u00a3400,000 signing from Aberdeen four years ago, scored his first league goal of the season against Southampton on Sunday and Howe is hoping that strike will prove significant in the long run. \u201cI\u2019m one of Ryan\u2019s biggest fans,\u201d the Bournemouth manager said. \u201cFor whatever reason he\u2019s had a slightly stuttering start to the season. We haven\u2019t seen him at his fluent best. I can\u2019t speak highly enough of his ability as a player. I just hope he can do it on a consistent basis.\u201d Ben Fisher\n10) Field and Loftus-Cheek stand out in stalemate\nIt was edifying to see some of the best moments of quality from Saturday\u2019s goalless draw between two relegation-threatened teams at The Hawthorns come from a couple of England youngsters promising to make a consistent impact in the Premier League. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, now 21, has long been heralded as the best of Chelsea\u2019s loan stars and is playing without fear despite Crystal Palace only just rising off the foot of the table; Sam Field, 19, has returned to West Brom\u2019s team since Tony Pulis\u2019s dismissal and played three games in an unbeaten week. Recently promoted to the England under-21s after starring for Keith Downing\u2019s Under-20s, the local lad has grace and poise. Outstanding on his recent full senior international debut, Loftus-Cheek is also being edged into a wide role in a compact midfield four for Palace. But while he has licence to roam, he is also willing to track and do some of the dirty work required of that position in a lower-half team.

Along with 31 activists, the filmmaker filed a petition in the apex court on Tuesday, demanding a monument for national integrity instead of a mosque or temple at the disputed site.Speaking to ANI, Benegal on Wednesday said, \"The petition has already been presented. It has been left for the Supreme Court to decide on it. When it comes to a solution, we felt that it would be best if we had a monument that represented the diversity of our country. A national monument will include everybody as all religions are practised in our country.\"He further called for a united India and said there was no point in fighting on such issues.\"There is no point in taking sides. It is a dispute that will go on. There appears to be no real solution if you take one or the other side. We should keep India as a nation united. (We) can't afford to have fights among ourselves,\" he added.The top court is hearing a total of 13 appeals filed against the 2010 judgement of the Allahabad High Court in four civil suits.The high court had then ruled a three-way division of the disputed area at Ayodhya among the parties- the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and the Lord Ram Lalla.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shyam benegal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ram lalla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benegal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nirmohi akhara", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allahabad high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sunni waqf board", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ayodhya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ram mandir-babri masjid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maharashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:55.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b31adfc1dc721f5c7c0b8b9f2ae423c5a6bc9b3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kltitvMrFnH7H5dUHlkH4wQI53PSxl3.x0kecoJBYIg521csWALCl2yIkZDsi1KyWenpv7PAJ0br8J8MMLls0LRpMG1AxNP3rEWlG2Qc18Q--", "site_full": "www.seabreeze.com.au", "site": "seabreeze.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.seabreeze.com.au/forums/Surfing/Longboarding", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Longboarding - Surfing forums | Seabreeze, page 1", "title": "Interesting threads 49", "title_full": "Interesting threads | Surfing Forums, page 49", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 55346, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b31adfc1dc721f5c7c0b8b9f2ae423c5a6bc9b3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kltitvMrFnH7H5dUHlkH4wQI53PSxl3.x0kecoJBYIg521csWALCl2yIkZDsi1KyWenpv7PAJ0br8J8MMLls0LRpMG1AxNP3rEWlG2Qc18Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "SP", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Interesting threads 49", "text": "www.surfer.com/features/taylor-jensen-state-professional-longboarding/ Good article, great reply. To this question... There have been some changes discussed and thrown around (going single-fin, exclusively, for example). What would the three-time champ like to see change? I feel like the talk of going strictly single-fin was just talk. Someone jumped the gun and put it out there. From a business standpoint, that would be a silly move. Longboarding is already seen as a niche in the market so why would you go and cut your market audience in half by only appealing to a smaller percentage. That doesn't make any sense. It's also ridiculous to try and tell someone what they can or can't ride. Think about that for a second. You have someone out there saying, \"now you can only ride one type of board with one fin setup.\" That's such a close-minded approach to surfing and goes against the \"ride everything\" or \"ride the right board for the right conditions\" mentality that I believe in. It's detrimental to evolution and creativity. Imagine if the WSL came along and told the WCT surfers you now can only ride six-foot thrusters in every location. It's absurd. Right now there's a generation of longboard kids out there for who bought into the whole single-fin only mentality and they never learned how to turn a board. I feel for them because it's not their fault, they just listened to one piece of the much bigger story. Look at what's starting to happen in the traditional single-fin events. How do they separate the surfing from a judge's perspective when everyone can hang ten forever? It comes down to who does better turns. CJ Nelson won the Mexi Logfest and the DuctTape in Sayulita this year because he turns better than anyone else on a log. It's a testament to the fact that he's grown up riding everything imaginable so he knows how to set a rail and draw a turn. Now guys are putting hard edges on their logs, making them super refined and using lightweight carbon and epoxy construction. It's almost a re-re-evolution. It seems like it will just repeat the past until we end up back where we were in the late '90s and early 2000's when guys were riding high-performance single-fins like what Colin Mcphillips won his first World Title on. Then the natural evolution is to add some side fins so you can turn on a sharper angle in a tighter radius.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:55.021+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15119173, "moreResultsAvailable": 15119073, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512639415021&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 598}
