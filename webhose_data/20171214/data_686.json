U.S. health of... \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

is now in its ninth year, despite assertions by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration that it is on its last legs. \nAttahiru is being replaced by Major Gen. Rogers Nicholas in the wake of a series of \u201cembarrassing\u201d attacks, two military sources told Reuters. \nThey said the conduct of the war against the insurgents is now being reviewed. \n\u201cThe attacks that occurred during Attahiru\u2019s command included the kidnapping of members of an oil prospecting team which led to at least 37 people being killed in July, and deadly assaults on the towns of Magumeri, Biu and Madagali,\u201d the sources said . \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "boko haram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibrahim attahiru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammadu buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rogers nicholas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madagali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "attahiru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newspaperng army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigerian army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magumeri", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:31.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67f0d62637bdf6650e77a655b7cb7c672809aa0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wWZgYCvjxbU52DckWtWH2QriVKlNG5gAiMEj0IcrgQhAlvOzWJ32uuGhcZushbys-", "site_full": "www.bizrate.com", "site": "bizrate.com", "site_section": "http://www.bizrate.com/dolls/ratings_guide/listing__start--176.html", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "shopping"], "section_title": "Dolls Store Reviews and Ratings at BizRate", "title": "Pleasure Tease", "title_full": "Pleasure Tease Reviews and Store Ratings | Bizrate", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.088, "main_image": "http://s2.cnnx.io/s2static/us/br/03377324/br2/images/smiley/smiley_outstanding_200x200.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2215, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "380282fc720bb02e03dd254cf3fc4f2cdbc3b8e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wWZgYCvjxbU52DckWtWH2QriVKlNG5gAiMEj0IcrgQhAlvOzWJ32ukZ03hUX1jFn9jHZiIzcMbA--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Eazy", "published": "2017-11-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Easy shopping experience", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 4.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:31.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5f32fad48bf4b767149ae2db7efc75ec4209548", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxZK5VyZXAMPrRK7bf8bMGK9KN_5Ne_lQaSFhgvQ9v_Vn0UlRd0UcWTRhauXVGbitIRLmq6DV5q_1S_qOeaasog32GatoOXGL6oXv07B9AZkQ--", "site_full": "pr-junction.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://pr-junction.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "PR Junction", "title": "World Premiere of \"FRANCHISE FREEDOM - a Flying Sculpture by Studio Drift in Partnership with BMW\" During Art Basel in Miami Beach", "title_full": "World Premiere of \"FRANCHISE FREEDOM - a Flying Sculpture by Studio Drift in Partnership with BMW\" During Art Basel in Miami Beach", "published": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "TH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5f32fad48bf4b767149ae2db7efc75ec4209548", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxZK5VyZXAMPrRK7bf8bMGK9KN_5Ne_lQaSFhgvQ9v_Vn0UlRd0UcWTRhauXVGbitIRLmq6DV5q_1S_qOeaasog32GatoOXGL6oXv07B9AZkQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PRJunction !

And really, there\u2019s no wonder. Mascara is basically the magic wand of the beauty world. A simple swish and flick can volumize, lengthen, and make it look like you spent a heck of a lot more time getting ready than you did. \nBut as magical and mystical as mascara might be, can your favorite beauty bag staple actually be doing more harm than good? A quick Google search can lead you down a dark hole of mascara rumors, so we asked a few pros to help us cut through the clutter! What is mascara made of, anyway? \nOK, here\u2019s mascara rumor No. 1 on the internet, so let\u2019s clear this up right away. Mascara is not made with bat droppings. Sometimes mascara is made with guanine, an ingredient that is used to help darken the color of the formula. Unfortunately, guanine is sometimes confused with guano, aka bat droppings. Your favorite mascara is simply a mix of iron oxides, waxes, clays, and pigments. Nothing icky to see here. Thankfully. Can mascara harm my lashes? \nThe next most common concern with mascara is how it can affect lash health\u2014namely, does mascara make lashes fall out? The short answer is, it shouldn\u2019t. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it won\u2019t. \nS. Manjula Jegasothy, M.D., CEO and founder of Miami Skin Institute , explains that although specific mascara ingredients aren\u2019t known to cause fallout or thinning, it is possible that the actual act of putting on and removing mascara can irritate the lashes, potentially traumatizing them such that they grow in thinner or, worse, fall out. Certain drugstore formulas can also be particularly drying for lashes, but more on that later. \nIf you\u2019re still finding your lashes breaking or thinning, take a peek at some possible culprits: 01. You\u2019re removing mascara improperly. \nHere\u2019s where most makeup wearers find lash problems occurring. The eye area is quite delicate, and those baby hairs around your peepers deserve special attention. If you\u2019re experiencing eyelash fallout, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re simply being too aggressive with your removal. If you\u2019re rubbing your chosen makeup removal product such that it pulls or tugs around the eye area, then you may see lashes loosen or fall out. Instead, remove mascara gently with a cotton ball or Q-tip dipped in makeup remover to loosen the mascara on your lashes, explains Kristine Cruz, senior makeup artist at Antonio Prieto Salon in New York City. After loosening the mascara, carefully wipe off the makeup with a cotton ball, she adds. 02. You\u2019re picking at your lashes. \nAgain, this comes down to improper removal. \u201cThe only way a mascara can be worse for your lashes is if you are removing by picking at it and not using a makeup remover to properly remove the mascara,\u201d Cruz says. \u201cPicking at it will surely pull your lashes out!\u201d \nAnd although we\u2019re quite positive we are not removing mascara by picking off each and every lash, most everyone can admit to plucking a mascara clump or two from time to time. Mascara that goes on clumpy or clumps up during the day is likely a sign that it has gone bad or dried up and needs to be replaced. It also might just be a sign of a bad formula! \nSwitch up your formula to a non-clumping pick such as Cruz\u2019s favorite, Kevyn Aucoin The Volume or The Curling Mascaras . Cruz says this formula doesn\u2019t fall out and is easily removed with just water. \u201cThe mascara fibers loosen up and slide off your lashes,\u201d she says, adding that you can remove it without pulling or irritating the skin around your eyes and wiping too much. Plus, no clumps! 03. Your mascara gets stiff. \n\u201cSome mascaras do stiffen the lash\u2014this is based on their individual formulation ingredients\u2014and can be tough to remove,\u201d Dr. Jegasothy explains. Although stiff lashes can occur from a particular mascara formula, they can also occur from prolonged wear, aka sleeping in your mascara overnight. \nStiff lashes eventually dry out, and the mascara is more difficult to remove (especially if removing the next day!). In some bad cases, it can get into the eye and cause serious irritation. Waterproof mascara is formulated to be resistant to any moisture, making it extra stiff and drying, which can lead to breakage. It\u2019s also more difficult to remove waterproof mascara, and many of us are especially aggressive when trying to get it off. A study in 2013 reported a correlation between the use of waterproof mascara and eyelash fallout, so basically, try to give yourself a break from using waterproof mascara every single day. And whatever you do, always take off your mascara (waterproof or not) before hitting the sack. 04. You\u2019re using your lash curler incorrectly. \nAs essential as your lash curler might be to helping achieve that sky-high lash look, it can pull your lashes out if not properly used, Cruz explains. This is especially true if you\u2019re applying the mascara and then using the curler over your mascara-coated lashes for a second curl, she says. Although you might think you\u2019re getting the best of both worlds, this can be quite bad for your lashes, as the tips of the curler might get stuck to the not-quite-dried mascara and potentially lead to some lashes left behind. The proper way to use your tool is to curl your lashes prior to applying any mascara product to avoid any potential pulling. \nEven when curling before applying mascara, be gentle and don\u2019t clamp down too forcefully. Be sure to replace the pads on your eyelash curler periodically to avoid potential sticking or roughness\u2014and to keep things sanitary. How to Avoid Lash Loss \nIf you suspect that your mascara is causing breakage or fallout, Dr. Jegasothy suggests first switching to a hypoallergenic mascara and makeup remover to rule out an allergy. If you\u2019re having eyelid skin irritation issues in concurrence with the eyelash fallout, you might have some sort of generalized or focal allergic reaction and should see a dermatologist to sort it out. \u201cThe majority of skin and health issues that can occur from cosmetics in general are predominantly allergy mediated,\u201d she says. \nIf you don\u2019t have an allergy to mainstream mascara brands but want to avoid potential fallout, we suggest switching to a formula with organic ingredients that contain natural oils and waxes. The average drugstore mascara formula contains synthetic ingredients, which can increase chances for dried-out lashes, but organic brands tend to stick to naturally occurring formulas with organic beeswax, almond oil, sunflower seed oil, shea butter, and more. These oils hydrate your lashes and make it easier to remove, reducing the chance for breakage from drying or fallout from aggressive removal. \nCheck out our favorite natural mascara brands below: 6", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristine cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jegasothy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s. manjula jegasothy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevyn aucoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami skin institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio prieto salon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:31.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "086fe5d8593be220e85a8177bb4151696b5bb5fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Ue_IydOSDPOjQkxTDiTeuFYDAWaBb8aWpFdriID1Q1ul9waMeXbaZuiQe7a0JyI1dZ1CBzonRYHmwKz_FuYvWFGaiE8RxoXL.gvXDcdIFK8OA--", "site_full": "davidshadrach.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://davidshadrach.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "David Shadrach", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "086fe5d8593be220e85a8177bb4151696b5bb5fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Ue_IydOSDPOjQkxTDiTeuFYDAWaBb8aWpFdriID1Q1ul9waMeXbaZuiQe7a0JyI1dZ1CBzonRYHmwKz_FuYvWFGaiE8RxoXL.gvXDcdIFK8OA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Odibo shadrach (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Erdogan: US Jerusalem move puts region in ring of fire NEWS / PALESTINE Jerusalem Palestine Middle East SIGN UP Erdogan said the US has disregarded a 1980 United Nations resolution regarding the status of the city [Umit Bektas/Reuters] Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan has criticised US President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying it would throw this region into \"a ring of fire\". \"Taking such a step throws particularly this region into a ring of fire. What would you like to do [with this step], Mr Trump? What kind of stance is it?\" Erdogan said on Thursday, at Esenboga Airport in the capital Ankara, before leaving for a visit to Greece. Breaking with decades of US policy, Trump on Wednesday announced the transfer of American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, formally recognising the contested city as the capital of Israel despite widespread international opposition. \"I have determined that it is time to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\" he said in a speech in Washington. Ignite a 'powder keg' US analysts say Trump's announcement might risk igniting a \"powder keg\" at the heart of the Israel-Palestine conflict. \"Jerusalem has a tendency to explode when you fool around with the status quo,\" said Aaron David Miller, vice president at the Woodrow Wilson Center and a former Middle East adviser to the Clinton and Bush administrations. The Turkish president, who had earlier warned that the status of Jerusalem was a red line for Muslims , said that the US decision disregarded a 1980 United Nations resolution regarding the status of the city. He added that political leaders should work to bring peace, not stir things up. Calling Jerusalem \"also a sanctuary for Christians\", Erdogan added that he would speak to Pope Francis about Trump's decision this evening or on Friday. Turkey will host an extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) on December 13 to discuss the US move. Jerusalem at the core of the conflict Jerusalem remains at the core of the Israel-Palestine conflict, with Palestinians hoping that East Jerusalem might eventually serve as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Israel illegally occupied Palestinian territories in the 1967 war , including East Jerusalem in defiance of the international community, and wasted no time in declaring the city as its \"eternal, undivided\" capital. Trump had promised to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem during his election campaign. Saeb Erekat , the chief Palestinian negotiator, said Trump \"destroyed any possibility of peace\" and was \"pushing this region towards chaos [and] violence\". \"He is destroying all moderates in the region and giving power to extremists,\" \"This is the most dangerous decision that any US president has ever taken.\" Erekat said it is \"meaningless\" to have a Palestinian state without Jerusalem as its capital.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erekat",

This store is the beginning of a new chain store which gives emphasis in high quality products through a dynamic branding identity. \nThe interior design was undertaken by Harris Souliotis and Georgios Gougoulakis while the branding design was created by Bill Pappas. The concept design makes a reference to traditional Parisian bistros of 20\u2019s in combination with chic style features which create a mostly contemporary result full of \u201cstory narrations\u201d. The basic materials which are used within design are white chevron tile, oak wood, chess tiles and colors such as pale beige, vivid turquoise, white and red \u2013 Bordeaux. \nMinimal lines and fonts give a chic sense coming to a creative antithesis with vintage decorative features, such as framed pictures, mirrors and clocks. The logo portrays a filter coffee cup and a vintage French hat, referring to the most usual and loving habit of French people, coffee!

Anushka Sharma, Virat Kohli are not tying the knot in Italy \nWe know Shahid Kapoor is serious about his fitness regime. His Instagram account is flooded with selfies from the gym and even pictures from outside the gym. \nAnd now to take all the attention away from the controversies surrounding his ambitious film, Padmavati, the actor revealed the most challenging part of doing this royal saga. \nIn an interview to Mid-Day, Shahid revealed he lost 4 kilos in just 5 days for the role of Maha Rawal Ratan Singh. Like Seriously? Is it even possible? \nGiving a vaild explanation for it, Shahid said the armour weighed something between 30-40 kilos and that's how, Shahid said \"I lost four kilos in five days.\" \nWell, that's not his only achievement. For his first ever period film, Shahid even gave his hundred percent to make the sword fighting scenes look real on screen. \"Sword fighting is a very defined skill... We've done it in a very raw manner. As raw as it could get,\" Shahid said in the interview. Also read Saif Ali Khan hints at 'Kaalakaandi' getting delayed again only because of Sanjay Leela Bhansali film 'Padmavati' \n\"I don't find physical challenges as challenging as I find understating the psyche of the character that you are meant to play and be true to him and be able to find all the layers in him.\" Shahid even said there wasn't much research to refer to and he followed Bhansali's vision to play the part to perfection. Shahid said, \"I had to draw from my instinct and from what Sanjay sir had conceived in the script.\" \nBanned in states like Gujarat, Bihar, MP and UP, Padmavati was initially planned to release on December 1st. After the release getting deferred, makers are trying their best to make peace with Rajput who feel the film is distorting their history and pride.

In its first season, Claire Foy captivated audiences by portraying Queen Elizabeth II's ascension to the throne and her early reign. The premiere season was full of growing pains for the young monarch and her new marriage. It also revealed a dynamic relationship between the queen and her sister, Margaret, who was refused permission to marry the man she loved. \nOpinions of season two are divided. Many think the Suez Canal conflict that spans the new season fails to deliver much intrigue. I disagree. Where those early episodes were insightful and pleasant for the anglophiles among us, season two of The Crown , which drops December 8, is on an entirely new level. Having viewed the whole season (provided early by Netflix), I conjecture that anyone like myself, who liked but didn't love The Crown before , will soon be singing a different tune. Here's why. The Royal Marriage Faces Relatable Problems Netflix \nElizabeth and Philip's marriage becomes a character in and of itself in season two, and I found the show's study of expectations, jealousy, longing, pride, and other matters of the heart to all be shockingly relatable to not only \"normal,\" that is non-royal men and women, but also to modern relationships. \nSeason two brings a nuance to the royal marriage that just was not there before. As the episodes explore Philip's possible indiscretions (be prepared for much more screen time with Matt Smith this season), we see the characters face humanizing emotional trials. Isn't that what we're all after? To find out whether royals really are like us. Well, much like the royal family's real-life inaccessibility, season two brings Elizabeth's felt but unspoken thoughts to the forefront. As I watched, I was constantly wondering what she was really thinking and whether she would ever let emotion get the better of her. The Sisterhood Navigates Shaky Ground Netflix \nIn season one Margaret was devastated by the queen's refusal to let her marry Peter Townsend. We saw the siblings struggle, almost constantly, between family and country, never quite finding common ground. In season two, Margaret's love life is once again a key plot, but so is her desire for a bit more normalcy. For those who don't already know who Margaret's love interest is, I won't completely spoil it. But Downton Abbey fans will be pleased. \nAs the monarchy faces the challenge of changing times and the threat of irrelevance, Elizabeth homes in on preserving the crown while Margaret increasingly wants to explore life outside the palace walls. Of course, there's never a dull moment between the sisters. The Outside Circle Gets a Revamp Netflix \nSeason one was all about Winston Churchill when it wasn't focused on Elizabeth or her sister, Margaret. While John Lithgow played that part adroitly, I was pleased to see a woman outside of the royal circle take a prominent supporting role in season two. She's the wife of a royal secretary, and she adds a spunky rebellion to the show that even Margaret failed to bring in season one. Other cameos include JFK and Jackie and American evangelist Billy Graham, whom the queen takes a keen interest in. \nAll of these characters help illustrate the fascination we have when considering royalty as compared to \"average\" people. As one of the queen's advisors recalls, the job of the royal family is to \"inspire.\" Season two brings new faces into the palace circle, people who doubt the monarchy's role in modern society. Watching the still-quite-young queen face the challenge of adaptation is really quite captivating. \nLet us know what you think after you watch!

He again won the seat and became a minister of state for tourism in the Vijay Rupani government. \nPradip Bhai Advani, a self-confessed BJP supporter who runs a Pan Parlour in the heart of Veraval taluka, doesn't hesitate to say that the Congress is going to win this seat. Representational image. PTI \nHe explains why, \"Being a Koli, Vimal Bhai is getting most votes of his community. Muslims too will vote him. Besides he will get votes of Ahirs and some others.\" \nVimal Bhai belongs to Chorwad village where business-tycoon Dhirubhai Ambani was born and is a Nagarpalika Pramukh. \nManish Gohil, an employee of GIDC, said, \"Vimal Bhai is our brother and one among us. Definitely, those close to BJP would vote for Barad but a majority of Kolis would favour Vimal Bhai.\" \nBhagwan Bhai Jala, who runs a hotel in Somnath, said his village Bhalpara has around 12,000 voters consisting of Ahirs, Dalits, Bharwars, and Prajapatis and most of them would vote for the Congress. \n\"Barad has done nothing for the development of the area. There is a scarcity of water and power cuts. Our area produces peanuts but farmers find it difficult to sell them,\" he said, expressing his anger vis-a-vis the BJP government. \nHira Bhai Nagora and Ram Bhai Nagar echo the same sentiment. \nBusinessman Suresh Goswami in Tower Chowk area of Verawal said Kolis may support the Congress now but as the elections come close they all would vote for the saffron party. \n\"Kolis and Muslims can never be on the same page as both the communities are fundamentalists and ranged against each other. So finally Kolis will vote against Muslims,\" he said. \nRamji Bhai Badiya of Mota Kolpada rejects Goswami's claim. \n\"I know it very well that when the Congress comes to power, Muslims don't care for law and order. But these are things of past. This time the scenario is different. Vimal Bhai is one of our own. As long as he is here, such things won't happen,\" he said. \nJaydeep Bhai is a Kharwar and runs a small shop in Mandir area of Somnath. He said: \"There are other communities here too. The OBC community and a major chunk of (Scheduled Castes) SCs would vote in favour of the BJP.\" \nSomnath, a constituency in Gir-Somnath district, is a prestigious seat for the BJP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited the temple site and addressed a rally in the district. BJP president Amit Shah also visited this temple town twice after the polls were declared. \nCongress vice-president Rahul Gandhi visited the temple but a controversy erupted after his name figured in the Non-Hindu visitors' book. \nBesides Somnath, the Congress has fielded a Koli candidate in Una, an Ahir in Talala and a Dalit in Kodinar. \nRead complete coverage of Gujarat Elections 2017 here \nPublished Date: Dec 07, 2017 03:27 pm | Updated Date: Dec 07, 2017 03:27 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "somnath", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "koli", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jaydeep bhai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goswami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahul gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vimal bhai chudasama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hira bhai nagora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vimal bhai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ram bhai nagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pradip bhai advani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhagwan bhai jala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mota kolpada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jasha bhai barad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijay rupani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manish gohil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suresh goswami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhirubhai ambani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramji bhai badiya", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bharatiya janata party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "verawal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "non-hindu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prajapatis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gir-somnath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahirs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tower chowk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kharwar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhalpara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nagarpalika pramukh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "talala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chorwad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kodinar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandir", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:32.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07c0c39b174ba6c2afb08d97922cdca7965e8f89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7isP1zfmxVBFDtv2J_7GoxmP.6UxBk8AzTQyCa7Xfhz8yw9gnpTzOSqKOJLEb7vWZvIHCCyL_2ASy7QSX_1.4pjR6wpkZcSpzktRvd6guZIZ3fIsARcMiY", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/more-sports/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "More Sports Board | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Where does Dabo Swinney rank among college head coaches?", "title_full": "Where does Dabo Swinney rank among college head coaches? | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T08:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e430fcd62b9f72f1fb0ba678027b6e273eff5f92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7isP1zfmxVBFDtv2J_7GoxmP.6UxBk8AzTQyCa7Xfhz8yw9gnpTzOSqKOJLEb7vWZvIHCCyL_2ASy7QSX_1.4pjR6wpkZcSpzktRvd6guZIcwKK0TPnxio", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "beauchristopher", "published": "2017-12-07T11:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I don\u2019t think Harbaugh is even top 5.. he\u2019s about no different record wise than the previous coach at this point?\nHe gets a ton of hype but hasn\u2019t lived up to it at Michigan.\nDabo is top 3, possibly 2 soon.

0 SHARES \nAh, the winter holiday season for ugly sweater wearing, party hosting, and fumbling for the proper greeting. We love this time of year, but holiday etiquette can get confusing. As we juggle the influx of invites, family reunions, office festivities, cultural traditions, and gifting decisions, we often have to stop and think, \"Am I doing this right?\" \nWhichever way you spread holiday cheer, we figure a good goal would be to master these must-know, expert-recommended etiquette standards before you turn 30 (or ASAP) to celebrate free of faux pas. Respect All RSVP Deadlines and Host Requests \nIt's important to honor the wishes of the host or hostess who is putting in lots of time, energy, and love to prepare and host a festive gathering. This means observing to a list of \"don'ts\": Don\u2019t RSVP past the host\u2019s deadline, arrive unfashionably late, or overstay your welcome. Arrival etiquette can depend on the type of event, whether it\u2019s a drop-by buffet, seated dinner, white elephant gift exchange, volunteer activity, or drink reservations. If it's unclear whether there\u2019s a hard start or end time, it is your duty to ask. Party planning is stressful enough, so be a respectful guest by following the host or hostess\u2019 wishes\u2014dress code included. And when it comes to plus ones, don\u2019t assume it\u2019s okay to bring along your significant other. Etiquette and manners expert and author Diane Gottsman explains , \u201cDon\u2019t bring a plus one unless you have spoken to the host in advance.\u201d Never Show Up Empty-Handed \nYou\u2019ll likely grace several parties with your presence, so you don\u2019t need to splurge on extravagant host or hostess presents. But do always bring along a hit hostess gift for the hard-working organizer. Something sweet and simple will do : homemade treats, scented candles, a bottle of wine, holiday decor, flowers, etc. Sometimes a helping hand is the most appreciated\u2014and most affordable\u2014gift for a party planner! Even when the party-thrower insists on not needing anything, a thankful holiday card won\u2019t be unwelcome. And remember to be an engaging guest. Gottsman shares, \u201cIf your host asks for your help, by all means, oblige. If she says she\u2019s got the job covered, it\u2019s your responsibility to continue to be an interesting party guest.\u201d There is no better way to help your host then making their other guests feel welcome and at ease. Set Expectations for What (and How Much) to Give \nThe art of tactful gift-giving is all about setting clear expectations. If your funds are tight, be honest about it. There\u2019s no shame in frugality! There aren\u2019t any widespread guidelines, so just have open conversations with your family, friends, significant other, and coworkers about what you\u2019re willing to do or spend. Quality time can be a more valuable gift than material things, so suggest an activity like ice skating, hiking, or a game night instead. Playing Secret Santa and White Elephant is also a fun and affordable way to get everyone involved and limit expense. As Lizzie Post, co-president of the Emily Post Institute and co-host of the Awesome Etiquette podcast , suggests , \"Stick to whatever you decide. Don't go above and beyond and then make the other person feel lousy.\" Finally, be aware of the rules of re-gifting as a frugal gifting option, though. Keep it as a last resort and make sure the recipient has absolutely no connection to the original giver. Offer Tips to the People Who Serve Your Everyday Needs \nHoliday tips are appropriate to thank those who are involved in your daily life but might not be in your personal circle. The Emily Post Institute team explains , \u201cTipping is an end-of-year cash gratuity to a service provider such as your doorman, hairdresser, newspaper delivery person, babysitter, or dog groomer, to thank them for their consistent and outstanding service.\u201d As a general rule, it\u2019s best to tip the full cost of one service : the price of one haircut, the cost of one day of dog-walking, or a normal babysitting shift\u2019s pay. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable giving cash, a gift card is totally acceptable. Don\u2019t Skip the Office Holiday Party \nNo matter what your office dynamics might be, don\u2019t miss your team\u2019s holiday party. Etiquette expert Joy Weaver , author of \u201c How to Be Socially Savvy in All Situations ,\u201d believes it\u2019s a mandatory holiday event. She shares that not going \u201cshows disrespect for your company, supervisors, and colleagues and can be a career-killer.\u201d While there, make sure you\u2019re on your best behavior. While you might get tipsy at your best friend\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve bash, avoid overindulging on alcohol to prevent any career-limiting moves or rumors. Feel free to let the out-of-office side of you a little loose, but as Weaver advises, \u201cIt\u2019s just not the time to be over-served.\u201d Educate Yourself About Other Holiday Traditions \nLearn about the customs and practices of religious or cultural holidays different from those you celebrate. From Christmas and Hanukkah to Kwanzaa and the Chinese New Year, broadening your understanding will help you stay informed and sensitive to the different values and traditions of others. Do some research or just chat with someone to learn more about their culture's holiday practices. Mark the key dates on your calendar to know when the festivities start and end. This knowledge will also improve your holiday etiquette by decreasing the chances of unintentional tone-deaf salutations, gifts, or expectations. Don\u2019t be shy about sharing your own beliefs and traditions, too!

(just in case.) i had a slight headache within 30 minutes after observing this object. i honestly dont know what i just witnessed but i assure you this is real. whatever it was, it wasnt manmade. it was massive, larger than any aircraft that i've ever seen. it was bigger than an aircraft carrier for sure. everything seems to have settled down and returned to normal. im not sure if i am the only one who noticed this but i find it impossible that something that large could have glided by undetected. somebody else must have seen this object, or atleast heard the weird noises it made as it passed by. i do live near a highway and close to many conservation areas, parks, rivers, and there is an airport about 20 minutes or so away from my house. i know that wasnt an airplane. that wasnt a jet. i just dont know what it was. i couldnt get a picture of it, as it didnt appear on the camera when i tried. it was see through. \nLatest UFO Sighting \nCredit: MUFON \nAny duplication, in part or in whole, is forbidden without permission of copyright holder.

years of seeing couples split, this lawyer has figured out what makes marriage stick. 42 SHARES \nTake a moment to imagine the scene. Your former best friend, your once closest intimate, the man you pledged to spend the rest of your life with, is just across the table avoiding your eyes as you coldly go through your property and assets. Although you are both on your best behavior, the biting formalities and the stinging practicalities are knives to the heart. You would cry if you weren\u2019t so numb. \nIf you\u2019re like most people, this vision is enough to shake you to your core. It\u2019s our biggest relationship fear. No one wants the life they\u2019ve started with another to shatter into smithereens. \nOver the years, Manhattan-based divorce attorney Kari Lichtenstein , partner at Stutman Stutman & Lichtenstein , has witnessed a lot of broken hearts and bitter realizations. Not just despite her job title but because of it, she has found herself offering tips to young professional women on ways to avoid having a divorce. And it all starts by making sure that your partner is compatible with you before you say \u201cI do.\u201d \nHere\u2019s her advice: 01. When you see a red flag, address it\u2014don\u2019t push it underneath the rug. \n\u201cIf there are red flags, you will see them if you want to see them. And, if you don\u2019t want to see them, you won\u2019t,\u201d Lichtenstein says. She tells us that in retrospect, many of her clients tell her that the warning signs were there \u2014but they just refused to acknowledge them in hopes that they would disappear over time. They pushed their premeditations under the rug, believing and hoping that time mixed with their love for each other would be enough for them to transcend these kinds of fundamental problems. \u201cAs they say, when people tell you who they are, believe them,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s no different for a potential spouse.\u201d If your values don\u2019t align, or your personalities just don\u2019t jibe no matter the \u201cchemistry\u201d you may have, realize that you\u2019re actually signing up for an uneasy future. 02. Romanticizing weddings is fun, but don\u2019t get caught up in the idea of getting married\u2014no matter your age. \nWomen in particular can feel a lot of pressure to be married by a certain age and thus sometimes find themselves caught up in the romance, making compromises in places where compromises shouldn\u2019t be made. \u201cA lot of my clients tell me that they got married because their friends were getting married, or they felt they were at the age that they should be getting married,\u201d Lichtenstein says. \u201cThe problem is that although the timing seemed right, the person that they were marrying was not.\u201d After years in and out of the dating scene, it can be achingly hard to end a relationship that you\u2019ve invested so much into, but remember that if you\u2019re both not on the same page for what you want out of marriage, all the beautiful Pinterest boards in the world aren\u2019t going to change that. 03. Slow down and listen to your instincts. \nIf he\u2019s making your stomach turn, or your anxiety worsen, chances are your body is trying to tell you something that your mind has forced itself to ignore . \u201cSo many clients have told me that they knew they should not have married their spouse, but they were afraid to admit it or to back out,\u201d Lichtenstein says. While there are some people who are legitimately afraid of commitment\u2014even with the right person\u2014take some time to explore whether the hesitation is healthy or not. It certainly takes a lot of gumption to break off an engagement , but as Lichtenstein remarks, \u201cIt is a lot easier than down the line going through a potentially bitter divorce that may involve children.\u201d 04. Problems will not get better after you are married. \nOf course you\u2019re going to have conflict! Conflict doesn\u2019t mean doom and gloom. But if fights are already taking an extraneous kind of effort, and it is beginning to define your existence as a couple, remember that dating\u2014while it has its trials\u2014is supposed to be the fun, easy part. As Lichtenstein explains, \u201cIf you are not getting along before you are married, there is very little chance that things will improve once you are married.\u201d Remember, marriage with the right person can be amazing\u2014but even then, it isn\u2019t without its stressors: be it money, in-laws, children, and both physical and mental stress. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a solid foundation when you get married, it will likely be much harder to face those inevitable life issues as a married couple,\u201d Lichtenstein says. So ask yourself a tough question: Does your relationship make living your life easier or far harder? 05. Be honest about what you want out of life and from a partner. \nRomance is wonderful, but it\u2019s not the magical cure for unreconcilable differences\u2014in fact, it\u2019s typically the first thing to go when a couple comes up against differences they can\u2019t easily solve. \u201cSome of my clients have told me that they never took an honest look at their potential spouse,\u201d Lichtenstein reveals. \u201c[They] did not address the fact that they did not have the same ideas about how to live their life or raise their children.\u201d You're going to want to have a practical conversation or two before you agree to spend your life together . For ambitious women in particular, she frequently sees how they may be frustrated with a husband who is less ambitious. As for people who value financial security, they often find themselves frustrated by the partner\u2019s spending habits. So although you may love someone, if you have completely different ideas about the kind of life you want to lead or the kids you want to raise, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that these differences can be unsolvable, leading to painful resentment if not addressed appropriately. \nBefore you think that all marriages are scary, consider this. Marriage is, in a way, like scuba diving. It can be thrilling, breathtaking\u2014taking you to incredible depths and beautiful places\u2014but without the right preparation, it can be a horrible, risky adventure. Committing to some kind of skills-based training together is critical to marital happiness. But the most important part of readiness for marriage is finding the right partner. If your guy isn\u2019t someone you feel totally comfortable diving in with, it may be best to stay in the boat and wait for a better fit.

i'm guessing that it was the same thing because it was that same bright, white light. it didn't have any flashing effects or anything, it was just white light, and it seemed a lot dimmer or further away this time. i think it was just dimmer, i think it was probably about the same distance from me, and it was a bit towards the right, so it was heading towards the tree line, and it was sort of bobbing up and down. it sort of looked like it was in the ocean, almost? it was moving in a very fluid path, and there didn't seem to be any sort of rhyme or reason to how it was moving. so i started trying to get my phone out at that point, but it was too dim for it to pick it up, because the video recorder on it isn't the greatest. it was too grainy and dark to see anything and by the time i actually had it out it was already in the tree line. and like, i could still see it with my eyes, but my phone wasn't picking it up. i could see the light being covered up behind the parts of the sky with trees, it was definitely an object in the distance, not a reflection. so it bobbed around for a few seconds until it either turned its lights off again, or just disappeared behind the tree line. i stayed after a few minutes to try and see if i could see it again, but i didn't. it was dusk at the time and the only clouds in the sky were a few contrails. after i saw it i was pretty shaken, but i made a recording of me recounting what i saw pretty much immediately after it happened, and the majority of this text comes from that directly (i don't know how to upload that to my computer though). after that i made a quick sketch (included). it was hard for me to focus on anything and my heart was racing, but i think that was less \"supernatural abilities\" and more just me freaking out. it was weird for sure. \nLatest UFO Sighting \nCredit: MUFON \nAny duplication, in part or in whole, is forbidden without permission of copyright holder.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

Kevin Spacey. Louis C. K. Matt Lauer. \nThe news is inundated these days with allegations of sexual assault and misconduct. Men in powerful positions have been accused of using their positions to sexually assault and harass others. Victims, most of whom are women, have been encouraged by the bravery of those speaking out against their assaulters. From formal, public accusations to the #MeToo movement, women are finding their voices, and they are finally being taken seriously. These are big names though, and it\u2019s easy to feel helpless as these victims come forward, unsure of how to proceed or make any kind of real change. \nAll of the men listed above, after determining that accusations against them were credible, quickly found themselves without work. Networks, studios, and TV shows have run far, far away, quick to show the world that they will neither support nor condone this kind of behavior. \nAnd yet, in the not-so-distant past, while trespasses like this certainly cast a shadow on the accused, they were not career-ending. Not wanting to give up on favorite movies or TV shows, many used the excuse that they could still enjoy the art separately from the person. \nOne such story that distinctly comes to mind is that of Woody Allen, whose new movie Wonder Wheel was just released. \nIn 1992 Woody Allen came up against sexual abuse allegations during his divorce from Mia Farrow. In custody proceedings, Farrow accused Allen of sexually assaulting their young daughter, Dylan. Witnesses stepped forward, telling stories of the two that seemed damning. Allen fought back, declaring his innocence and shoving the blame onto Farrow, whom he accused of poisoning their daughter against him in anger. After evidence was presented, a judge ruled in favor of Farrow, denying all visitation rights to Allen. But he was never charged for sexual assault. \nDespite the allegations, Allen\u2019s career didn\u2019t falter much. He continued to write and direct movies with great success and acclaim, even earning award nominations. His movies continue to be a draw for the best in Hollywood and moviegoers alike. \nIn recent years, the Allen saga became even more muddled, though. In 2014, as an adult, Dylan told the New York Times that Allen had, in fact, molested her. Still, Allen\u2019s career barely skipped a beat. Then in 2016, Ronan Farrow, Dylan\u2019s brother, wrote a viral column for the Hollywood Reporter condemning the media for not taking Allen to task on the gross allegations against him. Allen vehemently denied it all. \nEven though we\u2019re just a year and a half removed from Ronan\u2019s lightning bolt call to action against his father, Ronan\u2019s expos\u00e9 of another Hollywood man caught traction in such a way Allen\u2019s never has. That man, of course, was Harvey Weinstein. Ronan was one of the first to unveil Weinstein\u2019s legacy of sexual deviance in a piece for the New Yorker in October. Weinstein\u2019s unraveling began a reckoning that shows no signs of slowing down. \nSo if Kevin Spacey was ousted from House of Cards , Matt Lauer swiftly dethroned by NBC, Louis C. K. humiliated on the very day of his movie premiere, what\u2019s to be expected for Wonder Wheel , the latest work by a man who allegedly ranks among these others and which was produced by Amazon Studios, whose executives have also come under fire for sexual offenses? Allen\u2019s fate seems to lie with the us , the audience, a bit more than these others have. \nPerhaps it\u2019s easier to blame the victims, to think that they are accusing in anger, want to make some money, or even, dare I say it, had it coming. It\u2019s perhaps more comfortable to think those things than to believe that someone we have developed an attachment to through their fame, on-air personality, or performance would be capable of something so terrible. Or maybe it\u2019s easier not to think about it at all. After all, those things happened to someone else, and it doesn\u2019t affect my life, right? \nBut doesn\u2019t it? \nAs a woman I have been sexually harassed with words, inappropriate grabs, and, yes, an attempt at something far worse. I can recount stories of friends and family who have faced similar and often much more terrible instances of sexual assault. It\u2019s hard to share those stories. It feels embarrassing, like I\u2019m the one who did something wrong instead of the attacker. It\u2019s easier to protect that shame, hide it, bury it, and pretend it never happened. I imagine it\u2019s even harder to share on an extremely public stage, against a very famous person, where the skeptical public is ready to direct ire at the victim. \nAs a woman, I won\u2019t stop at a gas station alone at night. I walk to my car, always scanning the area around me. When I leave to go to the bathroom in a public space at night, I make sure to have someone with me. Every time I exit my car at night, I put 911 on my phone and get ready to push call, just in case. This is my reality\u2014and I think it\u2019s one I share with many women. \nI will have to teach my daughters and my son about these things. I have to tell them and show them that it is not OK to be treated like this or to treat others in this way. But as I\u2019ve seen promotions for Allen\u2019s latest film, glittering with Coney Island scenery and the star power of Kate Winslet and Justin Timberlake, I\u2019ve come to realize that if I\u2019m to genuinely teach my children about not accepting this behavior, I can\u2019t give myself a pass. And part of that means not watching movies, sports, or TV shows or listening to music that support these offenders. \nI just can\u2019t. \nMaybe Hollywood won\u2019t miss my $14 movie ticket or my ten plays of a song on Spotify, but it might if more people\u2014men and women alike\u2014refused to do the same. Just like those victims who came forward and gave courage to others, we too can stand together and let our voices be heard. We aren\u2019t helpless to support them. Nor are we blameless if we choose to avoid what\u2019s happening around us (and to us). Wonder Wheel reminded me that I can play a role. And sometimes that role is as simple yet impactful as choosing a different movie to see on Saturday night.

My teacher said to me earlier that I need to be using trig functions. These are the notes she gave me, as well as the answer I came up with.\n1. An equilateral triangle with a side of 1 inch\nThe first thing you do is split the triangle into two 30-60-90 triangles. The base of those triangles is going to be the side over 2 and that means it is \u00bd. The side opposite the 60 degree angle will be the square root of 3 times the side 1 over 2. So it is \u221a3 \u00bd. So I already know the base is one and now I have to find the height by doing the sqr of 3 times 1 over 2. I also know that to find the area of a triangle you have to do \u00bd of the base times the height. So you multiply the numerators. Which is Sqr 3 1 times 1= sqr 3 1\nAnd then you multiply the denominators. 2 times 2=4\nyou end up with \u221a3 \u00bc and multiply them and you get the answer. The sqr of 3 is 1.7320 and the you multiply it by 1 over 2. When you simplify it the answer is 0.433\nRecall that the area of a triangle is (1/2)*Base*Height. The base of this triangle is s. You can determine the height by breaking the triangle into two right triangles and using the trig function for tangent (you'll need to figure out what the appropriate angle measure is if it's not given).\nArea=(1/2)*Base * Height\nFind the height of the triangle using trigonometry. (The height would be opposite of the base angle. The side of the right triangle will be 1/2 of the side of the polygon.)\ntan(angle\u00ba) = opposite/adjacent\ntan(angle\u00ba) = h / (s/2)\nh = [tan(angle\u00ba)] * (s/2)\nYou now have the base, s, and the height, [tan(angle\u00ba)] * (s/2). Substitute these values in the formula\nArea = (1/2)*Base*Height\nIf s is 1 meter, the area would be 0.344 square meters. If s is 5 inches, the area would be 25*0.344 square inches, or 8.6 square inches.\nYou just need to use trig to find the height of the triangle, then use that to find the area of the triangle, then multiply it by the number of triangles in the polygon.\nThe trick when faced with any polygon is to be able to find the missing information, whether it's the missing height of a triangle or the missing base of a trapezoid.

If you extend the 10 line until it reaches the 20 line you will see this splits the shape into a rectangle and a triangle. By subtracting 8 from 20 you'll get the size of one side of the triangle. Even though it points downwards in the image, let's call that the height. You also need the base of the triangle. Easiest way to get this is by using Pythagoras' theorem. With two sides you can calculate the third (the base).\nGoing back to the others, for an equilateral triangle and a hexagon divided into equilateral triangles, all sides are equal so you can use sin cos or tan. I think cos is the easiest but there's not much difference in the calculation. I've realised that it'll have to be tan for the pentagon because the distance to the centre of the pentagon is not the same as the side so cos is not possible. Sorry about that. I have edited my earlier post so it doesn't put any other reader off.\nQ1.

(AP) - New Jersey lawmakers are set to vote on legislation that would make it illegal to operate a drone while drunk. \nThe Democrat-led Senate is scheduled to vote on the legislation Thursday. \nThe National Conference on State Legislatures says at least 38 states are considering drone legislation this year, going beyond the Federal Aviation Administration's regulations. \nThe New Jersey bill would make operating a drone under the influence of alcohol a disorderly persons offense, which carries a sentence of up to six months in prison, a $1,000 fine or both. It also would make using a drone to hunt wildlife and endanger people or property a similar offense. \nThe legislation has already cleared a committee in the Democrat-controlled Assembly.

Out of fear he might harm Winter, who was still being attacked by the 140-pound dog, he elected not to try and shoot the animal, but rather to wrestle the dog, pinning its head to the ground, and allowing Winter to retreat to a safe area. Once the dog was controlled, Combs turned his attention to Winter's wounds. Winter was later airlifted to Riley Children's Hospital in Indianapolis for surgery. \n\"He is a hero, as is Winter as well,\" Swistek said. \"Winter is a brave hero for surviving that incident that day. She wasn't trying to fight off the dog, she was as calm as can be. She did the right thing to survive this attack, and is a very, very brave young girl for 12 years old.\" \nWinter, who is now out of the hospital, but still in recovery from wounds and injuries sustained during the attack, was presented with a bicycle in her favorite color (purple) and also a gift card from the MCPD. \n\"She's got a long road to go,\" said Winter's mother Ruth Hall. \"We probably have more trips down to (Indianapolis), she got bit everywhere, (except) her face and her left leg. I'm just glad she is alive, because my first thought was my child is not going to be alive when I got there.\" \nHall also added that Winter has had five total surgeries since the attack. \n\"Everything is healing well,\" Hall added. \"She might need a another skin graft, she might not.\" \nHall also added that Winter has been out of the hospital since Nov. 17. \nSwistek also said the 140-pound male bull mastiff that attacked Morgan was euthanized 10 days later on Nov. 20.

And no, you don\u2019t have to go to every single one\u2026 \nBeing able to present your work at a conference is great for a variety of reasons. During doctoral study, I\u2019d recommend going to at least two (e.g. one \u2018postgrad\u2019 and one \u2018international\u2019) to get feedback on your work, to practice communicating your ideas to a different audience, and to get your face \u2018known\u2019 in your research community. The conference might even be in a more exotic part of the world, so why not take a a few days before or after the conference to do some travelling? \nBut of course, there\u2019s also a catch or two\u2026 \nConferences can be ridiculously expensive, not only in terms of travel and accommodation, but also just for being able to attend and present the work that you\u2019ve offered to share for free(!). Sometimes there are reduced fees for Ph.D students and part-time staff, but don\u2019t expect it to be cheap in any case. Even conference dinners \u2013 that legendary place where (apparently) \u2018all the real work gets done\u2019\u2013 can cost a ridiculous amount. For example, I recently saw a conference charging nearly \u00a3200 as an attendance fee for doctoral students (nearly \u00a3300 if you\u2019re full-time staff), and an extra \u00a360 for said conference dinner regardless of your employment status. If you\u2019re an invited speaker, your fees are often paid for you. If you\u2019re not at that stage \u2013 and a good number of us aren\u2019t \u2013 then best start budgeting (or applying for the scholarships and bursaries that are occasionally offered). \nIt\u2019s also worthwhile to consider the number of parallel sessions that will occur. It\u2019s usual to find conferences spanning 3 \u2013 5 days and with a few parallel sessions taking place (i.e. \u2018streams\u2019 of presentations occurring at the same time). Even if you\u2019re not presenting, parallel sessions inevitably mean clashes and/or running between rooms to get to the talks you wish to attend. Some conferences have grown so big that there may be 10 (or more!) parallel sessions occurring at any one time\u2026 \nConferences are a key part of the doctoral student experience, but be realistic: balance out how useful attendance will be against costs, time, energy, and likelihood of getting a good audience (especially at the bigger ones).
