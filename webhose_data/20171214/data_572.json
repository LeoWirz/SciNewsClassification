But why is this? \nGoogle\u2019s Project Treble was designed as a way to mitigate the problems of Android fragmentation going forwards. However, the initial seeding phase of the initiative has seen some teething pains, and Nokia\u2019s current run of Android phones are not immune. \nProject Treble, at its core, is pretty straightforward: it separates the core Android OS framework (Google\u2019s bit) from the vendor\u2019s )the phone maker\u2019s) customization so that updates can be pushed through to the phone OTA without the vendor needing to modify it. \nThis way, whenever a new update is ready, phones rocking Treble would receive the update OTA without the maker of the phone \u2013 LG, Samsung, Huawei, HTC \u2013 having to lift a finger. On paper, and in the future, it is a brilliant plan to solve the issue of Android fragmentation that plagues millions of devices in circulation. \nHowever, in order for Treble to do its work, it needs to be up and running on the phone before it is shipped to the customer \u2013 and it is here where some brands are running into trouble. Over time this will not be an issue, as all Android phones should ship with it, but for now, there is a bit of catch-up going on. \nAnd HMD\u2019s Nokia brand is firmly in the \u201ccatch-up\u201d camp, confirming that none of its current-generation Nokia Android phones will support Treble. Nokia says Treble cannot be retrofitted on a handset after it has shipped\u2026 but this isn\u2019t entirely true. \nHuawei, for instance, has confirmed that it will bring Treble to its older phones during the latter part of 2017, indicating that Nokia might just be telling porkies about not being able to install Treble on older handsets. \nHuawei also confirmed, during its Note 10 launch, that it has been working closely with Google on getting Android P better integrated with its Kirin chipset. The company, which is fast becoming one of the biggest players on the planet, is keen to usurp Samsung as the king of the Android space and is working closely with Google to achieve this. \nPerhaps Nokia should drop Huawei an email and find out how it\u2019s retrofitting Treble on older Android handsets. I\u2019m sure its punters would appreciate it!

Photo: AP \nMumbai: The rupee\u2019s rally since mid-November could see a turning point with elections in Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s home state of Gujarat, according to DBS Bank Ltd. \nClick here for live updates to Gujarat Elections 2017 \nWhile opinion polls are signalling a win for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Gujarat elections, the margin of victory is seen narrowing. The vote is viewed by investors as a gauge of \u201cModi fatigue\u201d and how much demonetisation and the introduction of the goods-and-services tax (GST) have hurt the BJP, DBS analysts including Philip Wee wrote in a note. \nA poll of opinion polls by news channel NDTV showed the party winning 105-106 seats in the western state, above the half-way mark to form a government, but well below the 150 seats it\u2019s aiming for. \n\u201cApart from a stronger tone for the US dollar in the region, the rupee will also move lower with Indian equities if investors start fretting about how small the margin of victory will be for Modi and the BJP,\u201d the DBS analysts wrote in Thursday\u2019s note. \nThe rupee jumped 1.3% over the last two months, with a major boost coming from mid-November\u2019s rating upgrade for India by Moody\u2019s Investors Service.

Photo: AFP / Marco Longari \nHARARE \u2013 Zimbabwe's new government signed a $153 million (R2-billion) loan agreement with China on Wednesday, its first post-Mugabe deal with a foreign government, to expand and refurbish its international airport in Harare as it bids to attract investors and tourists. \nEmmerson Mnangagwa , who was sworn in as president on November 24 after a de facto military coup ended Robert Mugabe's 37-year rule, has vowed to rebuild the country's ravaged economy and re-engage with the international community. \n\"This (airport) project) and the budget we are presenting tomorrow will show we are serious about reshaping our economy ... \" Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa said after signing the agreement, one of three, with Chinese ambassador Huang Ping. \nREAD: 'Mnangagwa presidency is...an opportunity as well a risk': SA think tank \nThe deal means \"we are back in business to build the capacity to honour our obligations not only to China but also to our international creditors,\" Chinamasa said. \nThe loan for refurbishing the Robert Gabriel Mugabe airport is payable in 20 years with interest rates of 2 percent per year and a seven-year grace period. The other two agreements are for grants worth 400 million yuan ($60.48 million) for a new parliament building and for expansion of a computing centre at the University of Zimbabwe. \nChinamasa, who was re-appointed to the finance ministry post last week, admitted that the country had failed to repay China for previous loans. But he said Beijing was still willing to deal with Zimbabwe. \n\"The Chinese government understands the economic situation we are going through,\" he said. \"We're under sanctions and had no lines of credit coming into the country. This is why we call them 'all-weather friends'.\" \nChinamasa is scheduled to present the 2018 national budget on Thursday. \nREAD: Zimbabwe grants looters 3 months grace to return funds and assets \nHe had been finance minister since 2013 until he was shifted to the new ministry of cybersecurity in October. During his time in charge, the economy stagnated. A lack of exports caused acute dollar shortages that crippled the financial system and led to long queues outside banks. \nThe issuance of billions of dollars of domestic debt to pay for a bloated civil service - a key component of the ZANU-PF patronage machine under Mugabe - also triggered a collapse in the value of Zimbabwe's de facto currency and ignited inflation. \nOne of Mnangagwa's most pressing tasks will be to patch up relations with donors and the outside world and work out a deal to clear Zimbabwe's $1.8 billion of arrears to the World Bank and the African Development Bank.

The airplane and a second freighter on order will help the airline expand its cargo business.\n\n\"The delivery of our first 777 Freighter is a milestone event in our cargo business,\" said Mr. \u0130lker Ayc\u0131, Chairman of the Board and the Executive Committee, Turkish Airlines. \"As a prominent sub-brand of Turkish Airlines, Turkish Cargo increased its freighter destinations served from 55 to 73 from the beginning of this year, reaching approximately one million tons of cargo with a 29 percent increase. It is surely beyond doubt that this is a remarkable success. We're sure that this significant delivery, which will bring great value to our rapidly growing cargo operations, will also enable our leading sub-brand to further compete, expand and reach new short and long-range destinations from our hub in Istanbul .\"\n\"We are honored to deliver the 777 Freighter to Turkish Airlines,\" said Marty Bentrott , Senior Vice President of Sales, Middle East , Turkey , Russia , Central Asia and Africa , Boeing Commercial Airplanes. \"This aircraft's range capability, combined with its enhanced cargo capacity, makes it a perfect airplane for Turkish Airlines to continue to profitably grow its global cargo service.\"\nThe 777 Freighter is based on the 777-200LR (Longer Range) passenger airplane and can fly 4,900 nautical miles (9,070 kilometers) with a full payload of 112 tons (102 metric tonnes or 102,000 kg). \nBased in Istanbul , Turkish Airlines is one of the fastest growing airlines in the world. It carries over 60 million passengers a year, with direct flights to 300 destinations in 120 countries. The airline made its first domestic flight in 1933 and the first international flight in 1947. Turkish Airlines was founded in 1933 with a fleet of five airplanes that carried a total of 28 passengers, expanding to 329 aircraft today. \nContacts: \nElena Alexandrova \nCommunications\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes\n+7 495 797 3415\n[email protected] \n \nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boeing-turkish-airlines-celebrate-the-airlines-first-777-freighter-300568303.html \nSOURCE Boeing", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "i\u0307lker ayc\u0131", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elena alexandrova", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marty bentrott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "turkish airlines", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "executive committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boeing commercial airplanes", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:51.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa0ac39b9c32552ba219dcf38cae5f78ab373112", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAiuKevosved9KNzmy79GdF00-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/other-desktop-device-please-specify", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "i need to get my account back it was stolen from this dude i borrowed need your help please", "title_full": "i need to get my account back it was stolen from this dude i borrowed need your help please - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87f7c4bd65f9dc33260b7a2541ffe23f3707af71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAiuKevosved9Kn3KxlwhicMBka3tPi1IuxA--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "C-Smith.\u26c5", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You shouldn't give out any login information to an account.

Al Franken (D-Minn.) looks over his notes prior to hearing Alex M. Azar II testify before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on his nomination to be Secretary of Health and Human Services on Wednesday, Nov. 29. (Ron Sachs/CNP/Zuma Press/TNS) WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrat Al Franken faced intense pressure from members of his own party on Wednesday to resign from the U.S. Senate over accusations of sexual misconduct.Minnesota Public Radio reported Franken would resign on Thursday. Franken\u2019s office said in an email that no final decision had been made and that the senator was still discussing the issue with his family.After accusations began surfacing three weeks ago, Franken said he would remain in office and work to regain the trust of voters in Minnesota, the state he represents.But on Wednesday, calls for him to resign came from the majority of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate, including Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and almost all of the Democratic women in the chamber, putting great pressure on him to quit.\u201cI consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\u201d Schumer said in a statement.Franken said on Twitter that he would make an announcement on Thursday, but he offered no details.In its report, Minnesota Public Radio cited a Democratic official who had spoken to the senator and aides.Late on Wednesday, news website Politico reported that Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton\u2019s was expected to appoint Democratic Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith to take Franken\u2019s seat if he resigned. She would hold the seat until a special election in 2018.Franken is one of a number of prominent American men in politics, media and entertainment who have been accused in recent months of sexual harassment and misconduct.Another accusation against Franken surfaced on Wednesday when Politico reported that a congressional aide said Franken had tried to forcibly kiss her in 2006, before he was first elected as a senator. Franken denied the allegations, Politico reported.Franken\u2019s office did not reply to a request for comment on the report.The calls on Wednesday marked the first time Franken\u2019s Democratic colleagues had publicly pressed for him to step down since the accusations surfaced. The party\u2019s chairman, Tom Perez, also pressed for him to resign.Schumer called Franken immediately after the Politico story was published and told him that he needed to relinquish his Senate seat, according to a person familiar with the situation.\u201cI\u2019ve struggled with this decision because he\u2019s been a good senator and I consider him a friend,\u201d Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut that cannot excuse his behavior and his mistreatment of women.\u201dFranken apologized for his behavior after earlier accusations and said he would cooperate with a Senate Ethics Committee investigation. Reuters has not independently verified the claims against him.Democrats are seeking the moral high ground in the wake of sexual misconduct accusations against numerous public figures, including Republican Roy Moore of Alabama, who is running for the Senate, and Democratic Representative John Conyers, who resigned on Tuesday. Both of those men have denied the accusations against them.Several Republican lawmakers initially called on Moore to step out of the race, but have since said the decision is ultimately up to Alabama voters. President Donald Trump has endorsed the candidate. The election is Tuesday.Franken, a former comedian who rose to national prominence as a cast member on the long-running television program \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d had been considered a rising star in the Democratic party since he was first elected in 2008.Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who was among those saying Franken should resign, told reporters that Democrats had been \u201chaving conversations\u201d about Franken for a while.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell joined the groundswell against Franken, saying in a statement, \u201cI do not believe he can effectively serve the people of Minnesota in the U.S. Senate any longer.\u201dFranken\u2019s Minnesota colleague, Senator Amy Klobuchar, wrote on Twitter, \u201cSexual harassment is unacceptable. This morning I spoke with Senator Franken and, as you know, he will be making an announcement about his future tomorrow morning. I am confident he will make the right decision.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "makini brice", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tina smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy klobuchar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex m. azar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom perez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mazie hirono", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark dayton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate committee on health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico reported.franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota public radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "public radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "health and human services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:51.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e8e0905a0bcad089070ef70b948bc347f77e652", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSg_7TRNN2B2DN3f5v2KhuTOmVyaGaTwg4KXm1LoyOW74KYNrW2gywSyKmpCWeSUNV13XNNy4PGWOfF_8JZh.i2JNYYfbdPSv82q5Hv86sU_PRtvfoszh0bw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "[IMAGE] Reddit, I never thought I could do it but today marks my 5 year Anniversary for when I decided to workout in my basement!!

Here\u2019s what their application process is like . . .", "text": "Bank of England Blog: Part Two by Erica Rowell The Bank of England, which was founded in 1694, is responsible for monetary policy and stability, producing bank notes and the Prudential Regulation Authority which means they hold a different ethos to other financial organisations. They have a culture of collaboration, and support employees to develop professionally and personally throughout their careers with the Bank.\nTheir interns and employees are assessed with the \u2018Vision 2020\u2019 model, which is made up of four assessment criteria: diverse and talented, analytic excellence, outstanding execution and open and accountable. Included alongside these is their mission statement: \u201cPromoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability\u201d. \nThe application process is the same for both their internships and graduate schemes. This means that someone who is successful in gaining an internship does not have to repeat the application process again when applying for graduate entry.\nThe Application Process \nOn-line application form \u2013 it is vitally important to research and understand the Bank, what their functions are, and spend some time thinking about what is attractive about the work. Online Test (Blended) \u2013 successful candidates will be invited to complete an online test which will assess a range of skills and is a mixture of situational judgement, motivation, numerical/verbal reasoning and analytical skills. It is important to do some practice in advance. The testing provider will provide some practice questions so don\u2019t skip these! Make sure the test is carried out in a quiet space, with no disturbance, because it is important to be able to focus on the test. For example, if you share accommodation with other people it may be worth warning them that you need some quiet time to yourself to be able to complete the test without disruption. It\u2019s important that your only focus during the test is doing your best, and not worrying about background noise etc. Video Interview \u2013 successful candidates will progress to the video interview. This tests a mixture of technical/commercial awareness and competency. Prepare by reading financial and business news and current affairs particularly if the Bank is mentioned. There is no one recording the interview \u2013 it is done through a programme where you are shown between four and five questions, given a short time (one minute) to prepare, and then are recorded (2 \u2013 3 minutes) delivering your answers. There are some simple practice questions at the beginning e.g. favourite film. Don\u2019t skip these as it gives you a chance to check that everything is working, to experience seeing yourself on the screen and check you are looking directly at the camera. Prepare for the questions in the same way as face-to-face interviews. A structured approach is best and the Bank advocates the STAR method. Consider the questions that might be asked: the Bank want to know if you understand what they do, the climate in which they operate, your reasons for applying to the programme and your compatibility with the Bank\u2019s values. As with the online test \u2013 make sure you\u2019ve got some peace and quiet to complete this! Keep an eye on timing to ensure your answers are succinct but full, and ensure that there is nothing distracting in the background of the video \u2013 a plain background is best. Assessment Centre \u2013 finally, you will complete an assessment centre which involves 2 group exercises (which will be a mix of soft skills and technical questions). The exercise will be a factual case study e.g. why you should be running a paperless office, and will be carried out in groups of 6. You will be assessed on working as a team as well as the recommendations that you make at the end of the exercise. The assessors are not interested in the dominant characters in the group but in those who can collaborate and encourage the team to be structured and keep to time. The time allowance is usually 20 minutes with a 3 minute presentation. Do check, as part of the exercise, who the presentation is to \u2013 the CEO or a client of the company. The Bank will be looking to see how you interact with others, and how you deal with time pressured situations to deliver an outcome. Spend some time thinking about the values they might be looking for, in accordance with the values and mission of the Bank, and have a think about how you can demonstrate and evidence these. Final Interview \u2013 this will be carried out by HR and a member of staff from the section of the Bank you have applied to e.g. operations, risk assessment, technology. The questions will be a mixture of checking out soft skills e.g. communication, and technical questions. To answer these questions you need to have a good overview of the stream you have applied for as well as the Bank itself. Remember!

Brown\u2019s assessment tallied with the downbeat tone from operators at a recent Huawei 5G event, which signifies a desire by the industry try to put the hype genie back in the bottle. \nBrown noted this is the fourth year in a row he has spoken about 5G at this Summit. In 2014 it was all about the kind of utopian use-cases that the industry was still banging on about at MWC this year, and a year later it was flashy new enabling technologies such as SDN. Last year things started to get real, regarding standardization, and Brown reckons this year has been the most productive yet, culminating in the freezing of the first \u2018early-drop\u2019 standard for non-standalone new radio (NSA NR) next week. It even has a new logo ! \nBut the move from the theoretical phase to the practical one has also resulted in some harsh truths hitting home. Now that we have a clearer vision of the technologies that will comprise early 5G it has become clear that, despite the very diverse performance requirements we have for 5G, at the end of the day its will be much more about boring old efficiencies than the utopian stuff everyone has been getting so excited about. \nEarly illustrations of this are the initial 5G implementations such as the recent Verizon announcement that it\u2019s thinking of doing something ill-defined in the area of fixed wireless access next year that it is branding 5G. The market seemed to be somewhat underwhelmed by this, which history may view as the first of many 5G anti-climaxes. \nThe serious mid-term 5G action will be all about New Radio, but Brown expressed concern about the decision to launch a non-standalone version , i.e. still using some 4G infrastructure, first. The big issue will be when standalone becomes a reality; how will we then integrate the NSA bit? There remains a lot of uncertainty around this, which is likely to cause a lot of future pain and most probably cause significant hesitation in taking the plunge with NSA. \nOne of Brown\u2019s slides (above) nicely illustrated how intimidatingly complex full-fat 5G will be to implement. A member of the audience asked which components of 5G need to be put in place first and Brown said operators are unlikely to make big 5G investments until there are a significant number of devices with 5G modems in circulation. Brown noted that both Qualcomm and Intel have been talking up their 5G modems, which makes it likely we will see them in devices in a year or so. \nWhile it\u2019s laudable that the industry is undergoing a somewhat belated reality check on 5G it does beg a somewhat ominous question. An illustration of the telecoms industry\u2019s current existential crisis is the absence of big kit vendors from this event, with previous multiple-sponsor Cisco\u2019s non-appearance especially notable. If 5G is no longer the light at the end of the cyclical tunnel that many has hoped it would be then what else is there to cling to?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott bicheno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabriel brown", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nsa nr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qualcomm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "verizon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:52.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "646b293bc297105f745436414b0148f980a4d363", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozPYJY8aXaKW3npuEgwIMN4KuqfNxsPDU5NOWp9K0gqVA5e2fOlYJzEikYZDyks8ylzyWkXe3_n7V2GNvk3E3xWpoSseCtahBA-", "site_full": "ipkitten.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/IpNewsflash-IpNewsWithinTheLast24Hours", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "IP Newsflash - news of the week", "title": "You snooze (for 40 years) you lose \u2013 HABITAT mark (un)enforced in bad faith (27 visits)", "title_full": "You snooze (for 40 years) you lose \u2013 HABITAT mark (un)enforced in bad faith (27 visits)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2lGYyW9KEeI/Wig6eJGVpoI/AAAAAAAAFmA/m9ycKX-r-80K3OjnnnlV2WlugbexSTcMACLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/habitat%2B%2528002%2529.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "646b293bc297105f745436414b0148f980a4d363", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozPYJY8aXaKW3npuEgwIMN4KuqfNxsPDU5NOWp9K0gqVA5e2fOlYJzEikYZDyks8ylzyWkXe3_n7V2GNvk3E3xWpoSseCtahBA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "You snooze (for 40 years) you lose \u2013 HABITAT mark (un)enforced in bad faith (27 visits)", "text": "The IPKat Passionate about IP!

Thursday, 7 December 2017 You snooze (for 40 years) you lose \u2013 HABITAT mark (un)enforced in bad faith Judicial reliance on the principle of bad faith in connection with trademarks can take many forms. A particularly unusual application of the principle recently occurred in a case in Israel, as reported by Kat friend Adar Ortal . \u201cThe District Court of Tel Aviv has ruled in Habitat Ltd. and Avraham Majerowicz vs. CAFOM, Habitat International S.A et al that the trademark HABITAT, registered in Israel in multiple classes more than 40 years ago by a local furniture and houseware retailer, should be cancelled on the ground that it was registered in bad faith, since it was done with the knowledge that HABITAT was an \"international mark\" that enjoyed \"international goodwill.\" Nevertheless, the District Court ruled that the local retailer will be permitted to continue use of the HABITAT mark in commerce since the holder of the international mark, i.e. Habitat International S.A. and other affiliated companies (\"Habitat International\"), had acted in bad faith in not seeking to enforce its rights in the mark for over 40 years. In so ruling, the District Court has favored the interest of the parties over that of the public and disregarded the basic notion of likelihood of confusion under trademarks law. Habitat International is a retailer of household furnishings. It opened its first store under the mark HABITAT in 1964 in London. By 1969, Habitat International had opened eight more stores in the UK and one in Canada and by 1976, it had more than 30 stores worldwide, but none in Israel. Mr. Majerowicz is a furniture retailer who opened a furniture and houseware store in Israel in 1972 under the name \"Habitat\". In 1976, Mr. Majerowicz sought to register the mark HABITAT in Israel but only then discovered (according to him) that the mark had already been registered by Habitat International in 1973. He thereupon successfully filed a non-use cancellation proceeding against the then-existing registrations. At the time, Habitat International did not file any arguments against cancellation of the mark. Continuously since 1972, Mr. Majerowicz has used the HABITAT mark in Israel in conjunction with furniture and household retailing activities. On or about 2016, Mr. Majerowicz became aware that Habitat International was contemplating entering the furniture market in Israel under the HABITAT mark. Accordingly, he sued Habitat International, seeking a preliminary injunction on the ground of anticipatory infringement. Habitat International counter-claimed that Habitat Ltd. and Mr. Majerowicz should be enjoined from using Habitat International's well-known mark and that the registration of the HABITAT mark should be cancelled on the ground of bad faith. In ruling that Mr. Majerowicz had acted in bad faith, the District Court pointed to two major grounds. First, Section 39(a1) of the Israel Trademarks Ordinance [New Version], 1972, provides that \"a notice of cancellation of a trademark based on claim that the trademark was registered in bad faith may be submitted at any time\". Second, and despite the fact that Habitat International had neither established goodwill nor operated in Israel in 1976 (the year that Mr. Majerowicz filed the HABITAT trademark application in Israel), he was aware of Habitat International and its world-wide operations under the mark. Therefore, the District Court concluded that Mr. Majerowicz had acted in bad faith in registering the mark. It should be noted that the District Court did not set out the test for determining bad faith but rather analyzed the specific facts at hand and then concluded, without more, that they constituted bad faith. Nevertheless, the District Court ruled, without providing any guidance as to the applicable legal standard, that Habitat International may not enjoin Mr. Majerowicz from using the mark HABITAT in Israel because it is not a well-known mark, nor had it established any goodwill in Israel. Since Habitat International, in bad faith, has not enforced its rights in the mark, it is not entitled to enjoin Mr. Majerowicz from using the mark in Israel, the court concluding as follows: \"Even if it is a legitimate business interest not to enforce trademark rights in Israel whilst there is no business decision to enter into the Israeli market, such decision has its price, especially considering the fact that the defendants had been aware of Mr. Majerowicz's activities in Israel. Such conduct constitutes bad faith and exploiting the [local] trademark, now that it has acquired goodwill by the plaintiffs, constitutes unjust enrichment.\" At this stage you might be wondering: what about likelihood of confusion? Did the District Court ignore such a basic notion of trademark law? The answer is \"kind of\". The District Court noted that \"the public's interest should be taken into account but it should not undermine the parties' interests\". That said, the District Court asked the parties to seek to reach settlement on the manner of use of the HABITAT mark in Israel. He ruled that if no such settlement is reached within 90 days of the decision, the defendants shall be permitted to use \"HABITAT INTERNATIONAL\u201d in their advertising material, and the mark \"HABITAT\" on the products themselves\", while Mr. Majerowicz will be permitted to use the mark HABITAT (in Hebrew). We are already confused\u2026 what will happen in practice? If Habitat International registers the mark HABITAT in Israel (since the registration in favor of Mr. Majerowicz will presumably be cancelled), will it nevertheless be disallowed to enforce its rights against Mr. Majerowicz pursuant to the District Court's ruling? This remains to be seen as the District Court's ruling is, to our understanding, being appealed to the Israel Supreme Court. The upshot is that if you are the holder, or its representative, of a mark used in a number of countries, and you are contemplating entering the Israel market, the instant case might be a bleak peek into your future. That is so, unless you make sure that the mark is not being used or registered in Israel and that you seek to enforce your rights sooner than later. A final note: This is not the first time that an international brand has sought to enter the Israeli market, only to discover that a local business has already taken over such brand. Examples include the Versace, Saks [Fifth Avenue], and Roots, each of whom has had to confront the \"hijacking\" of its mark by local businesses.\u201d Image at top left is by Helen Crook, contributed by Kalory.co.uk and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license Posted by Neil Wilkof at 08:37:00", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "neil wilkof", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eleonora rosati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tian lu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "majerowicz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mathilde pavis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cecilia sbrolli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark schweizer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "annsley merelle ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicola searle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kats rosie burbidge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hayleigh bosher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merpel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "internkats ver\u00f3nica rodr\u00edguez arguijo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helen crook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil j. wilkof", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avraham majerowicz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eibhlin vardy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kat", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "habitat ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "habitat international s.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel trademarks ordinance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the district court of tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "district court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "habitat international s.a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "habitat international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "versace", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:52.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e8e0905a0bcad089070ef70b948bc347f77e652", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSg_7TRNN2B2DN3f5v2KhuTOmVyaGaTwg4KXm1LoyOW74KYNrW2gywSyKmpCWeSUNV13XNNy4PGWOfF_8JZh.i2JNYYfbdPSv82q5Hv86sU_PRtvfoszh0bw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "[IMAGE] Reddit, I never thought I could do it but today marks my 5 year Anniversary for when I decided to workout in my basement!! : GetMotivated", "title_full": "[IMAGE] Reddit, I never thought I could do it but today marks my 5 year Anniversary for when I decided to workout in my basement!! : GetMotivated", "published": "2017-12-07T07:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 178, "participants_count": 146, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f4f97c138dc557040425cc94bfd859af134fc54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSg_7TRNN2B2DN3f5v2KhuTOmVyaGaTwg4KXm1LoyOW74KYNrW2gywSyKmpCWeSUNV13XNNy4PGWOfF_8JZh.i2JNYYfbdPSv82q5Hv86sU_PBAupVFYeEpKP9BB.x9XBlg7nRIJWjQ6A-", "ord_in_thread": 101, "author": "happyqasim", "published": "2017-12-07T10:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I actually try to look older than I am, by styling myself to look that way.
