The period saw the company invest \u00a31.4 million in new plant and machinery. Asked to comment on the reasons for the margin pressure in the dairy market, Mr Graham replied: \u201cThe dairy market is a big market, it\u2019s also very competitive. Managing the supply and demand of raw milk, set against a backdrop of an underpinning dairy market that is a lot more volatile than it was 10 years ago, brings a lot of challenges.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cImprovements in managing that, and how we forecast supply against how we are forecasting markets, is something we have done a lot of work on in the last 18 months, particularly in the last 12.\u201d\nWhile there remains pressure on margins, Mr Graham the company had seen \u201cphenomenal growth\u201d in turnover last year, driven partly by acquisitions and the launch of new products.\nThe acquisition of Glenfield dairy has also allowed the firm to diversify into products such as strained yoghurt and cottage cheese. These include its Protein 22 snack, which has broken into overseas markets such as the Middle East, and Quark, a soft cheese. Mr Graham said an ability to innovate, and be \u201cquick about it\u201d, and launch products like these is part of its strategy to improve margins.\nAsked whether the company is looking to pursue deals like its acquisition of Glenfield, where the company has invested more than \u00a31m in the last 12 months, Mr Graham said there is \u201cmore we can do\u201d at its existing sites. He that the company would achieve a \u201cstep change\u201d in its growth strategy should it get the go-ahead to begin the development of its proposed, \u00a320m national dairy centre in Stirlingshire.\n\u201cThat allows us to really accelerate both our new product development and production capability, as well as scale,\u201d Mr Graham said.\nThe plans, first revealed in 2015 and part of a broader scheme involving the building of 600 homes, new primary school and other public amenities at Airthrey Kerse, are currently being considered by the Scottish Government reporter after being refused by Stirling Council.\nMr Graham had no update to give on the long-running episode yesterday, but noted that it was \u201cinteresting\u201d that the Scottish Government has this week tabled new legislation aimed at streamlining the planning system. He said Graham\u2019s plans, which involve a joint partnership with housebuilder Mactaggart & Mickel, would solve what it claimed was Stirling Council\u2019s 1,000-unit shortfall in land supply.\nMeanwhile, Mr Graham said a focus for the company since year end has been on building sales south of the Border. Graham\u2019s currently does around 20 per cent of its business in England and said growing sales in the domestic market remains a priority, with the bulk of dairy products consumed in the UK imported from overseas.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "graham", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "robert graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glenfield", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "family dairy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stirling council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mactaggart & mickel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glenfield", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeenshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kintore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stirlingshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airthrey kerse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glenfield", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:04.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2eaf6ef4a1382cf0481017f32acb1f03d857cf7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7DDcg6gnLACfkNhvOJjvjG.C1d2.K2Js8OLczuCv.wVvASSTGBvIcY4OIs8PbaNkXW4q2kTrkam2pNwM5f6p_h8KAW_9Y3VbAg--", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wpf?sort=newest&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'wpf' Questions - Stack Overflow", "title": "c# - WPF Rotating ModelVisual3D changes coordinate system alignment", "title_full": "c# - WPF Rotating ModelVisual3D changes coordinate system alignment - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.978, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2eaf6ef4a1382cf0481017f32acb1f03d857cf7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7DDcg6gnLACfkNhvOJjvjG.C1d2.K2Js8OLczuCv.wVvASSTGBvIcY4OIs8PbaNkXW4q2kTrkam2pNwM5f6p_h8KAW_9Y3VbAg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nick M", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "c# - WPF Rotating ModelVisual3D changes coordinate system alignment", "text": "Lets say we have 2 ModelVisual3Ds A and B and a world object which contains all ModelVisual3Ds.

Excerpts\u2026 You were an unused substitute in the Super Eagles\u2019 first five games of the World Cup qualifying campaign, but finally got a chance to play in the dead-rubber clash against Algeria which ended 1-1. What went through your mind during those period? To be honest, nothing went through my mind during those period. I was there trying to stay prepared to give my best whenever the chance comes. I felt like that at some point, but the joy is that everyone was doing well and we were winning games. I\u2019m happy that at the end of it all we qualified and I got a chance to play against Algeria. As a team, we played better. We were in control and coming out with a 1-1 draw was great. We were just out to do the country proud and I\u2019m glad that it turned out well. Did you lose faith in the system, especially with a self belief that you possess the quality to start games as well? Hmmm no. There wasn\u2019t a time I lost faith in the system because of the qualitiies of players starting the games. Also my relationship with the manager gave me more confidence before I got my chance which was very key. I was just excited to be called up to the team and the fact that we qualified for the World Cup in Russia seamlessly. We achieved qualification without struggling a bit unlike in the past when we had so many difficulties. So for me, that was something to cheer about, rather than sulk on the bench. The current Super Eagles managed to stay unbeaten during the World Cup qualifying campaign. Just how good is this team judging from how you all played against Argentina, in which you were a beast in the midfield? The win against Argentina says a lot about the Eagles and we won\u2019t rest on our oars going into the World Cup. We have been together and we keep reminding ourselves we are here for a reason. Kudos to the coaches, the NFF and the fans who supported us all the way. First of all, the unity in the team has been key as we reach out for one another. Fighting for ourselves made us stronger too. The Super Eagles qualifying for Russia 2018 without losing was no fluke, and we showed that in the friendly against Argentina despite the fact that we were without five key players and the Argentine team paraded top quality players as well, regardless of Lionel Messi, Gonzalo Higuian and Mauro Icardi missing the game. You have played in different formations at club level. How difficult or easy was it playing in a 3-5-2 formation with the Super Eagles against Argentina? It wasn\u2019t difficult playing in the 3-5-2 formation, but the fact that the Super Eagles had one training session saw the team struggle in the first half. But we picked up in the second half and showed the class we were made off. Scoring four goals against an Argentine star-studded side isn\u2019t a fluke at all. We worked it out with our bond. Would you prefer the Super Eagles maintain this 3-5-2 formation when the missing players return, or rivert to the old 4-2-3-1? That is for the manager to decide. I\u2019m just in the team to carry out his match-day plan. Nigeria has faced Argentina more than any other team at the World Cup. Are you comfortable facing the La Albiceleste again in Russia, with the likes of Lionel Messi and Mauro Icardi in the squad? There are no easy teams all the teams that have qualified will be tough. We have to prepare for a game as it comes. It\u2019s the World Cup and not a friendly, so other factors will come to play. It\u2019s going to be Nigeria vs Argentina and not Lionel Messi vs Nigeria. As a team, we have the quality to break them down again even with the inclusion of Messi. They have had it smooth in the past, but it\u2019s time to end that jinx against Argentina in Russia. How far do you think the Super Eagles can go in Russia? It\u2019s not going to be easy. We will be out there to win games and play quality football. We have the talent and quality to go far. Watching the World Cup as a growing kid, tell us your best memory as a fan? Watching the world Cup as a fan was the game involving Nigeria and Spain in France 1998. We won 3-2, I remember the goal Sunday Oliseh scored won us the game. That team showed determination and great strength which is what we are also imbibing.

Redang is the largest of an archipelago of islands off the Malay Peninsula. This island is resort-oriented, but other accommodations options are available. Wherever you stay, though, is handy to beachcombing (the largest beach is Pasir Panjang) and other water activities. The island\u2019s main attraction is snorkeling on the spectacular coral reefs. Scuba diving is a close second. Don\u2019t know how to do either? Dive shops offer lessons for students of all levels. 7. Cameron Highlands [Where to Stay] \nNamed for the man who mapped them in 1885, the Cameron Highlands are a good place to hightail it to if the summer heat gets to be too hot for you in the lowlands. The habit of retreating to higher elevations during the summer began with British colonists in the 1930s. Travelers come today not only to cool down but to enjoy a cuppa and the spectacular views of tea plants growing on plantations throughout the region. Whether you tour a tea plantation, get in some good hiking or maybe visit a temple or two, the Cameron Highlands are a good place to chill out. 6. George Town dreamstime/ \u00a9 Grace5648 \nGeorge Town, named after Britain\u2019s King George III, is one of the oldest British settlements in southeast Asia. Established in 1786 on the island of Penang , the old town is a mixture of colonial and Chinese architecture. It\u2019s considered the food capital of Malaysia and is known for street snacks. The city has a lot to see and do, so plan on spending a few days here. If you believe in feng shui, visit Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion that was designed with this in mind. The graceful white city hall is a grand example of British colonial architecture. The Buddhist temple Wat Chaiyamangalaram has one of the world\u2019s largest sleeping Buddhas. 5. Kuala Lumpur [Where to Stay] \nKuala Lumpur, the capital and largest city in Malaysia, is a cultural melting pot that also blends the old with the new. Founded by tin prospectors in the 19th century, the British claimed it as a colony just a few decades later. The population is made up of Malay, Chinese and Indian peoples, each bringing their culture to the scene. Kuala Lumpur, or KL as it is frequently referred to, has a cityscape that features the world\u2019s tallest skyscrapers (Petronas Twin Towers) and Buddhist and Hindu temples, with the minarets of the Sultan Abdul Salad Building fitting right in. 4. Pulau Tioman [Where to Stay] \nPulau Tioman, an island about 30 km (20 miles) off the east coast, is reputed to be one of Southeast Asia\u2019s most beautiful places. If you\u2019ve seen the movie South Pacific, you\u2019ve seen Pulau Tioman; it was Bali Hai. Hills covered with lush vegetation are a nice contrast to the beaches and white coral reefs, so popular with scuba divers. While jungle treks are another popular activity, you won\u2019t need to go there to see huge monitor lizards; they roam through the villages. Hiking trails follow the power cables. For something different to do, you can volunteer at the Juara Turtle Project, a hatchery. 3. Langkawi [Where to Stay] \nLangkawi is the main island in an archipelago of 99 islands of the same name off the west coast. Because it\u2019s so scenic, it\u2019s been called the \u201cjewel of Kedah\u201d after the state it\u2019s located in. Conservation is important to the island as it should be with this much nature at stake. If you\u2019re energetic, you may want to climb the 350 or so steps to the Seven Wells Waterfalls where you can swim in one of the pools or walk through the jungle. Or you can take a cable car to the top of a hill then walk across a sky bridge for a short trek in the jungle. 2. Taman Negara [Where to Stay] \nEcotourists definitely will want to visit Taman Negara, site of one of the world\u2019s oldest tropical rainforests, estimated to be 130 million years old. Formerly known as King George V National Park, Taman Negara is a wonderful place to enjoy nature, from jungle hikes that may include crossing a river on a rope suspension bridge to mountain climbing on Gunung Tahan, at 2,187 meters (7,175 feet) high the highest point in Malaysia. Taman Negara also is a good place to see wildlife such as the sun bear, Malay tiger and Indian elephant. The best time to visit is the dry season between February to September. 1. Perhentian Islands [Where to Stay] \nAt some point during your travels in western Malaysia, you\u2019ll just want to sit back and relax, maybe do a little diving. The Perhentian Islands are just the place to do this. The islands feature palm trees swaying in the breeze, coral sand beaches and crystal clear turquoise water. There are two main islands, Perhentian Besar (Big Perhentian) and Perhentian Kecil (Small Perhentian). Kecil attracts more travellers due to cheaper accommodation options, while Besar is a little more expensive and caters more to families and those who want to avoid the backpacker party scene. \nBecause the water is so clear, the Perhentian Islands are a favorite with snorkelers and scuba divers. FYI: You don\u2019t have to feel guilty about skipping out on monuments and museums here; there are none. If you really want to exert yourself, however, there are some nice hiking trails on the island.

S \n7 December 2017 Get spiked by email \nS o, with a few retweeted anti-Muslim propaganda videos, US president Donald Trump did it again. He gave a bunch of irritants the oxygen of publicity. He gave them a platform. He gave them legitimacy. No, not the plums of Britain First, whose deputy leader, Jayda Fransen, originally posted the videos Trump retweeted, but those ever ready to tell us about the rise of fascism, those ready to warn us of the \u2018the reach of far-right groups in the UK and Europe\u2019, those ready to warn us that the spirit of Oswald Mosley\u2019s Blackshirts is among us once more. \nWhat\u2019s odd about the dark mutterings of fascism\u2019s rebirth is that in Britain there is simply not much to be reborn. The far right has remained, throughout its meagre British existence, a threat largely in imagination only, its overseas version treated with \u2018derision and contempt\u2019 according to Foreign Office minutes in the 1920s, and as no more than a public-order problem in the 1930s (they tended to provoke the left). Even when ex-Labour MP Oswald Mosley\u2019s British Union of Fascists was literally on the march in the 1930s, the far right\u2019s lack of traction was palpable. Such was its failure, that by the end of the 1930s, even Mosley himself was moved to complain that he was tired of \u2018pouring money down the drain of British fascism\u2019. \nIt is not an overstatement to say that the far right has never been able gain much of a foothold in British political culture. So while world war, fear of revolution and economic crisis in the interwar years were providing the social and political tumult in which fascism proper flourished in Europe, Britain\u2019s political institutions, comprising in the main a mass Conservative Party, a highly reformist, social-democratic Labour Party, and a trade-union movement largely free of syndicalist elements, proved adept at preserving capitalism, rather than threatening its overthrow. This meant that, with no clear threat of revolution, no spectre of communism, there was little to frighten the ruling classes into the arms of fascism. There was certainly anti-Semitism in British society, especially among its upper echelons, not to mention a fear of the Reds. But as opposed to the open class-based conflicts on the continent, the predominance of a reformist Labour Party \u2013 ready, if push came to shove, to ally itself with the Liberals and Conservatives \u2018in the national interest\u2019, as happened with the national government of 1931 \u2013 left the negligible British fascist movement stuck on the outside of political culture looking in. \nAgain and again Britain\u2019s far right has found history repeating itself, always in farce. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the National Front, which was itself an amalgamation of various residual fascist and racist grouplets hanging around in the aftermath of the Second World War, found itself persistently marginal, standing in elections\u2026 and losing its deposits in elections. Not because of the innate virtue of British politics, but because the ground on which it wanted to make its appeal \u2013 race and immigration \u2013 had been already largely cultivated by the British party-political mainstream. A Tory government introduced immigration controls in the early 1960s, and while Labour was initially pro-immigration, it too was soon making anti-immigration arguments. As Labour MP Roy Hattersley put it in 1965, \u2018I believe unrestricted immigration can only produce additional problems, additional suffering and additional hardship unless some kind of limitation is imposed and continued\u2019. \nMoreover, it has never helped Britain\u2019s tiny band of fascists and far-righters that British postwar nationalism has been dominated, ironically enough, by the so-called fight against fascism. Defeating the Nazis, indeed defeating the evil of fascism, has persisted as just about the only source of national pride for much of the past three-quarters of a century \u2013\u2018Why we have to cut off the head of fascism again and again\u2019, ran a broadsheet headline earlier this year. So important has the Second World War been to a sense of being British, on both left and right, that in a 2005 YouGov poll , \u2018defiance of the Nazis\u2019 was voted second only to \u2018free speech\u2019 as a defining characteristic of Britishness. Given the peculiarly anti-fascist flavour to a British nationalism long shorn of any attachment to Empire, it\u2019s hardly a surprise that Britain\u2019s far right, mired in a Nazi-invoking past, has consistently found itself unpalatable to the British public.

It reinforced its refusal to join a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. \nHowever, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear that he doesn't want a new election, and Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz reversed course. \nAt a previously scheduled party congress Thursday, Schulz is seeking members' approval for a resolution approving talks on \"whether and in what form\" the Social Democrats can support a new government. But some members want to specifically rule out another coalition.

launched following a serious assault on two paramedics on the line of duty. \nIt is believed the paramedics were assaulted after they were called to help a man who was bleeding in a street in Bacup on December 3 (Sunday). \nSpecialist paramedic Andrew Ormerod, from Burnley, was dispatched in a rapid response vehicle and on arrival the man quickly become violent. \nHe lashed out and threw punches as well as spitting blood, smashing Mr Ormerod's glasses in the process. \nAn off-duty police officer stopped to help and Mr Ormerod was able to use his radio to alert colleagues who informed the police. \nAn ambulance arrived minutes later and whilst trying to diffuse the situation a second paramedic was also injured in the attack, resulting in a fractured hand. \nPolice arrested a man but the ambulance crew continued to treat him for his hand injuries. \nOfficers are now investigating the incident. \nMr Ormerod described the experience as 'extremely traumatic'. \nHe said: \u201cIt was not something that I would expect when I turn up to help. \n\"I can\u2019t thank the off-duty police officer enough as I\u2019m sure the outcome would have been a lot worse if it wasn\u2019t for him. \n\u201cAdrenaline was pumping and all I could think to do was continue to help treat this patient. \n\"It was only afterwards that I realised that I had been badly injured in the attack and sought hospital treatment. \n\u201cIt makes me feel angry, both mine and my colleague\u2019s injuries could take months to heal and we need to take time away from frontline duties, something which I really don\u2019t want to do and not only affects us but also means that we are unable to attend further patients until we have recovered.\u201d \nMr Ormerod was immobilised at hospital over fears of a spinal injury. \nSector manager, Ian Walmsley said the attack was 'absolutely abhorrent'. \nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely abhorrent that our staff have been subject to such vile and disgusting behaviour by a member of the public after arriving to help. \n\u201cWe are only human and an extremely frightening incident like this is bound to have lasting effects not only physically but mentally too. \n\"We fully support the staff members involved and will push for prosecution. \n\"This treatment will not be tolerated.\u201d \nNorth West Ambulance Service (NWAS) are raising awareness of abuse to their staff on social media using the hashtag #BehindTheUniform.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ian

comment \nA FREELANCE group exercise instructor will complete a half-marathon on a treadmill to raise funds for surgery on a rescue dog that has been badly abused by his previous owner. \nGreyhound Seb was saved by a neighbour as he was about to be shot by his former owner. \nThe dejected and almost catatonic animal was taken to Rossendale Responsible Animal Rescue where it transpired that he needed both hips replacing as they were horribly dislocated; the lifesaving surgery will cost up to \u00a310,000. \nHaslingden High School Headteacher Mark Jackson\u2019s Personal Assistant Kay Turner is no stranger to raising money and has taken the plight of Seb as a personal challenge. \nKay, who has a rescue cat, said: \u201cI have been following Rossendale Responsible Animal Rescue online and started finding out about the work they did. When I read the story of Seb it broke my heart. \n\u201cI held a Weleda party in November and from my commission, a raffle and donations raised \u00a3130. \n\u201cI have already raised a further \u00a360 which has gone directly to Seb\u2019s hip fund account at Shuttleworth Vets in Rawtenstall. I intend to carry on fundraising for Seb and have a few more plans in mind. \n\u201cI was having tea with my friend Tracey Entwistle from Rawtenstall and told her about Seb. Tracey had already seen one of the postings on Facebook and told me that it had really upset her. \n\u201cTracey is a freelance group exercise instructor and offered to undertake a sponsored half-marathon on a treadmill at DW in Blackburn on Christmas Eve morning for the appeal. \n\u201cHe needs every penny he can get at the moment; he is a broken but beautiful little boy.\u201d \nSeb is 15 months old and comes from Rossendale. He had been kept in a shed and was severely malnourished. His legs were different lengths because he had two dislocated hips and so had compensated in order to walk. \nHe is now building up his weight and muscles to prepare for having both hips replaced and is also receiving hydrotherapy treatment in a swimming pool. \nKay said: \u201cHe was too frightened even to lift his head when food was put in front of him. His story just broke my heart.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kay turner", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tracey entwistle", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "seb jason kayley", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tracy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rawtenstall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tracey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "seb", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "weleda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rossendale responsible animal rescue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haslingden high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rossendale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rawtenstall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shuttleworth vets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackburn", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:07.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "52d35646edf288b4047488c1d39e8dc3e5323ea5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9NkSzzD55NUGrkT4M0TY7H0DyYNGpZNbkjvN8qcKbkqDcrzyaoNxk7MElEh_doGu53A--", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wpf?sort=newest&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'wpf' Questions -

More >> Scientists   \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Image: Pixabay 4 December 2017 GSN Contributor \nThere\u2019s a lot to think about when you\u2019re getting married and heading off on a honeymoon, but don\u2019t forget some of the practical things like keeping your home secure. \nYou don\u2019t want the nightmare of returning home from your honeymoon to find all of your gifts have gone missing. \nHere\u2019s some tips on how to boost your home security : Change the locks and make access difficult \nIf you\u2019ve just moved into a new home, it\u2019s sensible to change the locks. You\u2019re unlikely to know who the previous owners have given keys to, so it makes sense to start fresh and keep track of where the keys are. \nAdd deadbolts to your exterior doors for extra strength and security. If you have sliding doors, use metal bars that prevent them being opened. Interior door hinges are another good way to make unwanted access difficult. Strengthen vulnerable windows. \nDon\u2019t keep a key in the mailbox or near the front door. It may be convenient for family and friends, but it\u2019s also convenient for burglars. Install an alarm \nThere\u2019s lots of different types of alarm systems available on the market. Do your research and find an alarm that\u2019s right for you. \nIf you\u2019re installing an alarm, make sure that you conceal any exterior wiring \u2013 this is often a point of weakness that experienced burglars will look to exploit. Make it look as if you\u2019re home \nUse automatic timers to turn lights on and off while you\u2019re away. If a house looks like there\u2019s no one there, it\u2019s more likely to be targeted. Invest in security lighting \nSensor activated lighting at the front and rear of the home can be a great way to deter unwanted visitors. Got a news tip? Want to share your story?

Now many years later, it is a fortunate coincidence to have that nickname \u201clegacy\u201d as Teradata delivers on a long-desired capability of greater elasticity of the database environment with the hybrid cloud offerings and our Teradata Everywhere licensing models. Scalability and elasticity \nIt is first important to note that for elasticity to be realized, there must be the scalable foundation already in place. It makes no sense to expand platform resources if the software cannot fully take advantage of that expansion. \nWhile Teradata has been the leader in scalability for decades, that scale did come with some strings attached. Due to a variety of hardware and software design features, the ability to grow or shrink the Teradata environment required downtime to make sure the data was redistributed and the parallelism took full advantage of all resources. It was also true that Teradata was normally deployed as a physical system in a customer\u2019s data center. \nBut with the advent of cloud environments, both public and private, people are looking for a different type of scale and elasticity, which is much more on demand without outages. They also need to scale with much more granularity and frequency. People expect that all environments should be able to be quickly, and seamlessly, configured to fit the need of the day. More importantly, they also want to only pay for what was used for those purposes. \nAny one of these desires presents challenges and, when taken together, they look daunting. Clearly there is not one solution, but there needs to be a spectrum of options that provide an elastic continuum. Elasticity comes in many flavors \nThe hybrid cloud environment recognizes that companies will invest in many different types of deployment, from having on-premises physical systems to managed cloud offerings and to publicly available cloud providers. Being able to provide elasticity across all these options must include not only the hardware aspects but the software ones as well. Understanding each environment brings different challenges \u2014 and opportunities. Teradata has now four distinct types of elasticity to offer. These options are shown below: Dynamic Workload Prioritization \nWhile not elasticity in the classic sense, one of the goals of elasticity is to manage resources to meet demand. Here, there is a defined system, and rather than adjusting the amount of resources, the resources are directed for the most critical workloads. The underlying goal is to meet service level agreements and ensure that a prioritized workload gets completed. With Dynamic Workload Prioritization, systems can be configured to ensure that the right resources are applied to the right workloads, dynamically at the right time, according to business needs. Performance on Demand \nAs we move through the spectrum, being able to add more system capacity on demand provides for elastic demand, both up and down. In this instance, there is a physical platform, and, by using system controls, the CPU is capped at 75 percent, with reduced operating costs. As workload changes or peak periods are encountered, the system can have the additional resources made available, and charged for, in 1 percent increments. After the peak volume has passed, the system can be brought back down to the 75 percent level. This requires no downtime and ensure costs are more directly related to need and usage. The benefit here is that companies do not need to \u201cover purchase\u201d for the peak and have \u201cpaid for\u201d resources sitting idle during the normal workloads. Expand compute power \nWith the new IntelliFlex platform, Teradata can add CPU and IO independently. Teradata has taken this new capability to provide the next level of elasticity. In this option, nodes are connected to the platform and, with a small restart, additional CPU and memory resources are made available to handle peak workloads for a temporary timeframe, such as month-end processing or an annual peak demand, such as Christmas time. This is called \u201cunfolding\u201d a system. Again, after the peak need has passed, the system can be \u201cfolded\u201d to the original configuration, once again reducing costs. Rapid operational expansion \nIn the past, a Teradata system expansion required an extensive outage to redistribute the data to the new nodes in the system. Now with Teradata 16.10 and the introduction of multiple hashmaps, that is no longer required. In this scenario, new capacity is added to the system for a longer term capacity need. The customer then has the option to migrate tables to the larger configuration (i.e., more AMPs) at their discretion. Tables can be grouped to make the redistribution together, and it is no longer an \u201call or nothing\u201d expansion. \nThis option is more applicable when customers need to expand to accommodate data and processing growth and it is not expected to just meet a temporary surge. Getting what you paid for and paying for what you get \nElasticity is about making sure that you are getting the resources you need to meet your workload, but at the same time, only paying for the resources that you need to use to meet your needs at the time. By combining the above elasticity options across the software and hardware spectrums, with the Teradata Database licensing options, customers can now match their workload need to system resources throughout the ebb and flow of the business processes. \nStarting with Teradata in 1987, Rob \u201cStretch\u201d Armstrong has contributed in virtually every aspect of the data warehouse and analytical processing arenas. Rob\u2019s work in the computer industry has been dedicated to data-driven business improvement and more effective business decisions and execution. Roles have encompassed the design, justification, implementation and evolution of enterprise data warehouses. \nIn his current role, Rob continues the Teradata tradition of integrating data and enabling end user access for true self-driven analysis and data-driven actions. Increasingly, he incorporates the world of non-traditional \u201cbig data\u201d into the analytical process. He also has expanded the technology environment beyond the on-premises data center to include the world of public and private clouds to create a total analytic ecosystem. \nRob earned a B.A. degree in Management Science with an emphasis in mathematics and relational theory at the University of California, San Diego. He resides and works from San Diego.

has split over Brexit and the approach to a second referendum.\nFormer staff from Scotland in Union have formed a breakaway operation targeting a younger audience with aggressive \u201cpopulist\u201d messaging on social media.\nThe new rival campaign, UK Unity, holds its official launch event in Glasgow tomorrow.\nANALYSIS: Meet Scotland's alternative unionists\nCalling itself a \u201cvibrant and dynamic grassroots movement that has the best interests of our country at heart\u201d, UK Unity also warns darkly the country is being betrayed by political elites.\nA recent graphic on its Facebook page shows the First Minister with the slogan: \u201c Sturgeon says she wants to kill Brexit. We say, sod off. Send her a message\u201d.\nAnd in a video filmed outside Holyrood , the group\u2019s spokesman says \u201cseparatists\u201d want to use the \u201cdevolved assembly\u201d to block a UK-wide vote on Brexit.\nThe group opposes more powers for Holyrood on the grounds it would harm the Union.\nThe campaign has been set up by David Clews and Kyle Coats, who until last month were development manager and social media coordinator respectively at Scotland in Union.\nMr Clews, a former Renfrewshire councillor, said Scotland in Union was too \u201cscared\u201d to talk about Brexit, but UK Unity was \u201centhusiastic\u201d about making it part of the case for the UK.\nANALYSIS: Meet Scotland's alternative unionists\nUnless Unionists dealt with Brexit head-on, the SNP would demonise it to undermine the Union and engineer another referendum, he told the Herald.\nWith a \u00a31000 start-up budget, the London-registered group claims to have signed up more than 2000 supporters in a fortnight, with a social media campaign reaching 1m people.\nWith a blunt, confrontational style designed to set it apart from Scotland in Union, the goal is to replace it as the country\u2019s main non-party campaign for Unionism.\nRenfrew-born Mr Clews, 35, said: \u201cScotland in Union are agnostic on Brexit. They don\u2019t have a view on it, which is ludicrous when it\u2019s the only issue being talked about just now.\n\u201cI said they should at least come out and discuss it, but they were too scared of touching it.\n\u201cIntrinsically, all the people are Remainers. But it was a UK-wide decision and we have to respect it. What I\u2019m arguing is that with Brexit there is hope. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom.\u201d\nElected a Tory councillor in 2007, Mr Clews defected to Labour in 2011, and left elected politics in 2012, but remains an \u201con/off Labour member\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cI would describe ourselves as populist. We believe that in Scotland there\u2019s a need for a much more aggressive pro-UK campaign, one that can remind people of the hope that being part of the UK can bring.\u201d\nSNP MSP George Adam said: \u201cIt's refreshing to see the ultra-unionists experiment with independence - taking their own future into their own hands. But it's little wonder that this right-wing front is tearing itself apart over Brexit - much like the Tory party.\u201d\nThe split comes amid signs of strain at Scotland in Union.\nANALYSIS: Meet Scotland's alternative unionists\nA \u00a3250-a-plate fundraiser at Edinburgh \u2019s Prestonfield House raised an estimated \u00a3350,000 in late 2016 thanks to blue-chip patrons and a jaw-droppingly extravagant auction.\nWith guide prices up to \u00a312,500, lots included stays at private safari lodges in Kenya and Botswana, French and Swiss skiing chalets, centre court seats at Wimbledon, a polo festival in India, and assorted deer stalking, fishing and grouse shooting events in the Highlands.\nThere was a \u00a3100-a-ticket raffle to win a Mini Cooper convertible, a VIP tour of the Rangers FC training facility and seats in a director\u2019s box courtesy of Paul Murray, and a signed copy of the JK Rowling novel, A Casual Vacancy.\nIn January, with speculation mounting Nicola Sturgeon would call a second referendum, it hired former Labour MSP Graeme Pearson as its \u00a350,000-a-year chief executive.\nHe admitted he had \u201cnever heard\u201d of the group, which claims to have 25,000 supporters.\nBut after Ms Sturgeon delayed her plans, Mr Pearson quit in August and was replaced by Pamela Nash, the former Labour MP for Airdrie & Shotts.\nThis autumn, Scotland in Union held \u00a3150 and \u00a3100-a-plate fundraisers in London and Edinburgh, but on a far more modest scale than last year.\nAuction lots in London included a team building event at the Go Ape Tree Top Adventure, golf at Woburn, a brewery tour, and three nights in an Edinburgh flat.\nRaffle prizes included Union cufflinks, a sports shop voucher, and, instead of JK Rowling, a signed copy of Alex Salmond : My Part in His Downfall by Telegraph veteran Alan Cochrane.\nAsked if Scotland in Union was still cutting it, Mr Pearson said: \u201cI would like to hope so.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cThe challenge for Scotland in Union, given the Nationalist debate has gone into a cupboard because it\u2019s inconvenient, is to maintain some kind of opposition and be ready when the Nationalists come out to fight their argument again.\u201d\nAlastair Cameron, Scotland in Union\u2019s founder and executive director, denied it had lost its way.\nHe said: \u201cScotland in Union has no link to them [UK Unity] at all. I would not call them a breakaway group. I\u2019d call them individuals who were with Scotland in Union who have decided to do something else.\n\u201cIn terms of their suggestion that Scotland in Union has had is day, I don\u2019t think any of us who are with Scotland in Union would believe that is the case.\n\u201cWe think there is still an urgent need for a pro-UK, non-party campaign. Scotland in Union does not take a position on Brexit. Neither Leave nor Remain strengthens the case for separating Scotland from the rest of the UK.\n\u201cThe new group is not in any way connected to Scotland in Union.

It is a museum, but also a place of memory, part of the city and of the collective consciousness: a historical monument. It is also a project of multifarious landscapes and assorted natures, such as the urban scenario around the harbour and the area stretching from there to the south west of Estense Castle, the ex prison, and the inescapable relationship between the city of Ferrara and the Hebrew culture. In other words, a landscape through which memories run and intertwine in a highly articulated manner; a combination of marks and signs, both physical and intangible, ordered and given meaning through the architectural project. This project draws heavily on pre-existing buildings, contributing to the natural stratification of tracks, signs and sediments that has always been a part of the natural evolution of Italian cities. And this is not by chance: a courageous choice by the competition commission has permitted us to work in a substantial manner on a historical pre-existence, creating the fundamental hybridization that is the pursuit of evolution in every architecture. Like two-faced Janus, the identity of the thought behind this project is based on a double point of view: looking simultaneously at the past and the future. A critical eye selected the salient elements on which to position the new functions of the museum: the orientation, the placing of signs, the size and urban scale, the enclosure that would be interrupted to open the place up to the city. The walling, typical of an ex prison, must turn into an element from which to regenerate the relationship with the city: transforming closure into opening and distance into proximity. The Museum of Italian Judaism will be a museum of the city, a museum for the city, an open space: some areas will be freely accessible, such as the entrance lobby, bookshop, restaurants, part of the temporary exhibition area and the garden, which will be an imaginary place \u201cbeyond the wall\u201d, continuing the theme of Ferrarese gardens, from the Herculean addition made by Corso Ercole I d\u2019Este to the Garden of the Finzi-Continis. Volumetrically, the five elements coming in sequence one after another symbolically recall the five books of the Torah, the Pentateuch, becoming at the same time elements that contain and are contained: the book is a metaphor for awareness and reason. Prominent passages from the Torah, to be chosen with the Jewish community, will be written in bas-relief on the wall of the museum. Regulating the intensity of the internal light will be a transparent and permeable brise-soleil over the entrance facing the city with a recess in the exhibition part. The areas dedicated to exhibiting works of art have been conceived as neutral spaces so as not to interfere with elements on show: as in the inside of a fly tower, there will be a series of movable backdrops that can be placed in multiple configurations to generate varied possibilities of use for the space. All areas will be lit with indirect and diffuse zenithal lighting: by means of vertical apertures at the sides of the exhibition rooms, the city will enter and become a part of the construction of the internal space in a significant manner. Culture and memory are elements that are in continual evolution, interpretation and mutation, and they are characteristics with which the contents on exhibition will be contaminated: the internal fitting will be interactive and digital, showing images that are continually updated, adapting to the sensibilities of the visitors and the times. Designing a multi-medial project for a museum that is so rich in historical memories and iconographic references implies a complex use of the potentials of video. On the one hand, it is a case of making historic and iconographic material usable in the most functional manner possible, on the other hand, it is a question of immersing the viewer in another dimension, tied to the images in motion. All the natural existing interfaces designed at the cutting edge of interactivity will also become a part of the interior project; the architectural spaces can be made thematic and scenographic with large video images designed to fit them.

I got a most of my collection that way.\nAround 3 years ago when vinyl really got \"cool\" all of a sudden I wasn't finding ANYTHING in the used bins any more. I had previously collected rock and other 'pop' genres. A well known jazz artist or folk artist, etc. frustrated with wasting another trip, I decided to grab some classical LPs I was instantly impressed by the condition of the classical LPs over the rock ones I was used to grabbing. I started educating myself a bit on the labels, composers, conductors, etc. And now I've got 3-400 classical LPs, almost none of which I paid over a $1 for and practically all VG+ or better!\nanyway, i should check out that shop next time i'm over that way.
