This is a prospective, cross-sectional, study in a university-affiliated, tertiary-care hospital. We recruited 151 children with CP (mean age 6.11 years, SD 3.42, range 3\u201318yr). The Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS) and the dysphagia scales of Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), Swallow Function Scales (SFS), and Food Intake Level Scale (FILS) were used. The Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) and Viking Speech Scale (VSS) were employed to classify communication function and speech intelligibility, respectively. The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) with the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GFMCS) and the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) level were also assessed. Spearman correlation analysis to investigate the associations between measures and univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to identify significant factors were used. Median GMFCS level of participants was III (interquartile range II\u2013IV). Significant dysphagia based on EDACS level III\u2013V was noted in 23 children (15.2%). There were strong to very strong relationships between the EDACS level with the dysphagia scales. The EDACS presented strong associations with MACS, CFCS, and VSS, a moderate association with GMFCS level, and a moderate to strong association with each domain of the PEDI. In multivariate analysis, poor functioning in EDACS were associated with poor functioning in gross motor and communication functions.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2BQLJh9", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "spearman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ja young choi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yu-ra goh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seon ah kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pedi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jieun park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eun sook park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:32.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b4980fa7dd4808dfc32e4fc3679fa4c6876f48e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UdDiWV.JRdVi6ANaehSJe01apVv3NGJ6kly0sqtjD72.88QC62pg13cnL0IPRWj04BSC4hS6HAMXVa204kDyfCHjewBwf.g7MfjZfwNxie4RJf5legVg1N5", "site_full": "dc.news897.com", "site": "news897.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Kate McKinnon Confesses She Eats Food Out Of The...

When it comes to impressions, Saturday Night Live MVP Kate McKinnon can do it all. To paraphrase a quote from last week\u2019s Torah portion, \u201cTo see Kate McKinnon do an impression of Gal Gadot is to see the face of God. Apparently, while prepping for the show, Gadot shelled out some pretty sage advice to Kate and fellow castmember Aidy Bryant. After an appearance on The Tonight Show yesterday, Kate McKinnon gets to add another spot-on impression to her already impressive list which includes Hillary Clinton, Kellyanne Conway, and Jeff Sessions, just to name a few. It\u2019s hard to know where to start with this video of Kate McKinnon admitting that she eats garbage to Jimmy Fallon, except to say that it is hilarious.

There is only need for more content workshops to upskill their talent,\u201d she said. \nHe said the creatives should stick with their passion even in the face of funding and infrastructure challenges. \nMultiChoice Zimbabwe spokesperson Liz Dziva said they were committed to help local film and television producers get a chance to have their works showcased on various broadcast platforms as other channels were looking across Africa for content. \n\u201cThere are a number of platforms under the DStv umbrella that can be utilised by local film-makers and producers for continental and international broadcast of their work, most notably the Zambezi Magic channel, which was created to provide a platform for local producers to tell their stories,\u201d she said. \nDziva said after the

The bill is the first gun legislation in Congress since mass shootings in Nevada and Texas killed more than 80 people.\nThe House approved the bill Wednesday, 231-198.\nThe bill is a top priority of the National Rifle Association, which calls it an important step to allow gun owners to travel freely between states without worrying about conflicting state laws or civil suits.\nOpponents, mostly Democrats, say the bill could endanger public safety by overriding state laws that place strict limits on guns.\nDemocratic Rep. Elizabeth Esty of Connecticut called it \"unspeakable\" that Congress would expand gun owners' rights after the recent shootings and other deadly attacks.\n____\n1:20 p.m.\nA Maryland police chief is calling on Congress to pass legislation that prohibits the use of devices that allow semi-automatic rifles to fire at dramatically faster rates.\nJ. Thomas Manger, the police chief in Montgomery County, Maryland, says during congressional testimony the devices known as bump stocks have no legitimate sporting or hunting purpose.\nHe says, \"A device that results in a military attack, equivalent to full automatic firing, must be stopped.\"\nManger says the gunman who carried out the mass shooting in Las Vegas two months ago used bump stocks and was able to fire more than a-thousand rounds in a matter of minutes. Fifty nine people were killed and hundreds more were injured in the October shooting.\nManger also is president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\n____\n12:00 p.m.\nA woman who survived the mass shooting in Las Vegas is describing in wrenching detail of how she remained by the side of one of the victims as he died.\nHeather Gooze tells the Senate Judiciary Committee that she didn't know 23-year-old Jordan McIldoon. But she didn't want him to be a \"John Doe.\" Gooze held his hand as he lay on a makeshift stretcher.\nShe says, \"Then Jordan's fingers stopped holding mine.\" She recalled telling McIldoon's girlfriend and his mother that he didn't make it.\nGooze says she was a bartender at the country music festival in Las Vegas when a gunman opened fire.\nGooze says she doesn't know why she didn't run, even though she had opportunities. She says, \"I am not that strong. I am not that special.\"\n____\n11:30 a.m.\nThe acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says his agency anticipates being able to exercise regulatory control over devices that allow semi-automatic rifles to fire faster.\nThomas Brandon told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that the ATF and the Justice Department wouldn't have initiated a review of whether bump stocks should be banned \"if that wasn't a possibility at the end.\"\nThe Justice Department announced Tuesday a review of bump stocks to determine whether weapons using them should be considered illegal machine guns under federal law. They are currently legal and widely available.\nThe review comes after a Las Vegas gunman used the device during an October rampage that killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more.\n___\n10:40 a.m.\nDemocratic Rep. Elizabeth Esty says Republicans are catering to gun industry lobbyists by combining a bill on background checks with one making it easier to carry concealed guns across state lines.\nEsty, who represents Newtown, Connecticut, calls the GOP maneuver \"an insult to the folks in Sandy Hook,\" a Newtown village where 20 school children and six adults were killed in 2012.\nEsty says the background check measure would help ensure mental health and criminal records are loaded into a federal database. She says \"that will be a good thing to do.\"\nBut she blasted Republicans for including the measure in a \"horrible bill\" that she said will overturn tough gun laws in states such as Connecticut and ensure that \"the lowest common denominator would reign for the entire country.\"\n____\n3:05 a.m.\nThe Republican-controlled House is taking up a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines.\nIt is the first gun legislation in Congress since mass shootings in Nevada and Texas killed more than 80 people.\nRepublicans said the bill would allow gun owners to travel freely without worrying about conflicting state laws.\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi accused Republicans of doing the bidding of the National Rifle Association, which calls the concealed-carry law its top legislative priority. Pelosi said Republicans were \"brazenly moving to hand the NRA the biggest item on its Christmas wish list.\"\nThe House vote comes as the Senate Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on reporting criminal history information to the FBI.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "heather gooze", "sentiment":

It\u2019s an honour and a privilege to play in front of these fans.\u201d\nRead more: Europa League hasn't altered Celtic's plans for January window, says Brendan Rodgers\nBrown laughs off the obvious comparison with Dalglish, the Liverpool legend whose love affair with this competition came in simpler times. The former Celtic striker captured this title three times \u2013 1978, 1981 and 1984 \u2013 but while Brown must endure gruelling qualification matches just to reach the group stages (there will be eight of them next pre-season), with a first-round bye thrown in it took Dalglish just seven in total to claim the trophy in 1978, scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win against Club Bruges at Wembley. It is harsh, though, to say Brown \u2013 the pre-eminent Scottish player of his generation \u2013 has got the record just for good attendance.\n\u201cI\u2019d take that [seven games to reach the final],\u201d said Brown. \u201cWe play six just to get into the group stages now! It\u2019s just different generations. Kenny was a fantastic player in his generation and I have so much respect for what he did in the game and what he did for Scotland as well.\n\u201cTuesday was a special night for me but don\u2019t take anything away from Kenny - he was a fantastic player and I could not lace his boots if I tried,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve probably got more skill and flair than him! And more of a goal scoring threat as well! No, Kenny is fantastic. It\u2019s me just being around for a long time, that\u2019s what that shows. We play a lot of games he probably didn\u2019t play back then.\nRead more: Brendan Rodgers: Celtic have made progress in Europe - but we'll have to do better still to go further\n\u201cIt has been a long time. But I have enjoyed every single moment. There\u2019s been ups and downs, it\u2019s football. Managers come in and managers go out. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to still be here. And hopefully there is a long time to come for me.\u201d\nBrown reckons he is far from finished when it comes to racking up Champions League appearances. And why should he, considering the likes of Ryan Giggs were still gracing this level way into his late 30s? The Celtic and Scotland captain still has a fair way to go, almost 100 behind all-time record holder Iker Casillas (166), Xavi (151) and Cristiano Ronaldo (145).\n\u201cHow many more can I get?\u201d said Brown. \u201cHopefully quite a lot. I am enjoying my football. I feel as fit as I ever have been. I am still going there on 90 minutes, no cramp, no muscle pain. As long as I keep on top of my fitness, keep training well and look after myself off the park I don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t go on for three or four seasons.\u201d\nOne factor which may determine his longevity at this level, of course, is precisely how long he is prepared to prolong his international career. Having retired once already from international play, only to be talked into a return by his former club boss Strachan, Brown admits the apparent lack of urgency in the SFA\u2019s recruitment of a permanent Scotland manager is becoming a frustration. Talks are at an advanced stage about a friendly with Morocco in March, with matches in the all-new Uefa Nations League set to commence this September, and the Euro 2020 qualifying campaign under way in March 2019.\nRead more: Europa League hasn't altered Celtic's plans for January window, says Brendan Rodgers\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a pain in the arse to be perfectly honest,\u201d said Brown. \u201cYou are sitting back waiting on something happening and there\u2019s a match coming up in March. You\u2019d like a manager to be in charge for the start of the European campaign. Someone has to be there to see who can play - I know whoever comes in will probably have watched the games but it is different to watching them and actually being part of it and seeing what happens in the changing room and on the playing field as well.\n\u201cThere are a lot of players who are in their thirties so whoever the manager is might want a younger squad or a fitter squad,\u201d he added. \u201cIt will be hard if he only has one game or something and then straight into European qualification.\u201d\nWhere Dalglish and Liverpool once lorded it over the rest of Europe, Brown\u2019s only hope of getting in the mix for continental silverware comes via a concerted run in the Europa League, after a winter break in Dubai. \u201cWe have to see who we get,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will wait for Monday\u2019s draw and take it from there.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott brown", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gordon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strachan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gordon strachan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cristiano ronaldo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iker casillas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brendan rodgers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenny dalglish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenny - he", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xavi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan giggs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brendan rodgers brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalglish", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dunfermline", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "champions league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "celtic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europa league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uefa nations league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "club bruges", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakhtar donetsk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sfa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hibs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morocco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wembley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:33.053+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5eaada14e35128cd9985727148c5aa8ac2de8fcf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0pQseYh8hQLSTnb5MeL_QKRl6XqzJoaDDW1HRrAR8mU0Ke_YQZy2wvz14t6erzYIRVzeBF_U6O.L8KEWc3vHI", "site_full": "www.cxotoday.com", "site": "cxotoday.com", "site_section": "http://www.cxotoday.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "RSS Feed - CXOtoday.com", "title": "Cyber Security Predictions For 2018", "title_full": "Cyber Security Predictions For 2018", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5eaada14e35128cd9985727148c5aa8ac2de8fcf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0pQseYh8hQLSTnb5MeL_QKRl6XqzJoaDDW1HRrAR8mU0Ke_YQZy2wvz14t6erzYIRVzeBF_U6O.L8KEWc3vHI", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Moumita Choudhury", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Cyber Security Predictions For 2018", "text": "This year, cybercriminals caused major service disruptions around the world, using their increasing technical proficiency to break through cyber defenses.nbsp;In 2018, we expect the trend to become more pronounced as these attackers will use machine learning and artificial intelligence to launch even more potent attacks.\nGear up for a busy year ahead.nbsp;Incidents like the WannaCry attack, which impactednbsp; more than 200,000 computers worldwide nbsp;in May, are just the warmup to a new year of more virulent malware and DDoS attacks. Meanwhile, cybercriminals are poised to step up their attacks on the millions of devices now connected to the Internet of Things both in offices and homes.\nThe cybersecurity landscape in 2018 is sure to surprise us in ways that we never imagined. As 2017 draws to a close, here is what you can expect over the course of the upcoming year:\nmiddot;nbsp; Blockchain Will Find Uses Outside Of Cryptocurrencies But Cyber criminals Will Focus On Coins and Exchanges \nBlockchain is finally finding applications outside of crypto-currencies, expanding its functions in inter-bank settlements with the help of IoT gaining traction. However, these use cases are still in their infancy stage and are not the focus for most cybercriminals today. Instead of attacking Blockchain technology itself, cybercriminals will focus on compromising coin-exchanges and usersrsquo; coin-wallets since these are the easiest targets and provide high returns. Victims will also be tricked into installing coin-miners on their computers and mobile devices, handing their CPU and electricity over to cyber criminals.\nmiddot;nbsp; Cyber criminals Will Use Artificial Intelligence (AI) amp; Machine Learning (ML) To Conduct Attacks \nNo cybersecurity conversation today is complete without a discussion about AI and ML. So far, these conversations have been focused on using these technologies as protection and detection mechanisms. However, this will change in the next year with AI and ML being used by cybercriminals to conduct attacks. It is the first year where we will see AI versus AI in a cybersecurity context. Cybercriminals will use AI to attack and explore victimsrsquo; networks, which is typically the most labor-intensive part of the compromise after an incursion.\nmiddot;nbsp; Supply Chain Attacks Will Become Mainstream \nSupply chain attacks have been a mainstay of the classical espionage and signals-intelligence operators, compromising upstream contractors/systems/companies and suppliers. They are proven to have a high-level of effectiveness, with nation-state actors using a mix of human intelligence to compromise the weakest link in the chain. These attacks are moving into the cybercriminal space, becoming mainstream. With publicly available information on suppliers, contractors, partnerships, and key-people, cybercriminals can find victims in the supply chain and attack the weakest link. With a number of high profile successful attacks in 2016 and 2017, cybercriminals will focus on this method in 2018.\nmiddot;nbsp; File-less and File-light Malware Will Explode \n2016 and 2017 have seen consistent growth in the amount of file-less and file-light malware, with attackers capitalizing organizations that lack in preparation against such threats. With fewer Indicators of Compromise (IoC), use of the victimsrsquo; own tools, and complex disjointed behaviors, these threats have been harder to stop, track and defend against in many scenarios. Like the early days of ransomware, where early success by a few cybercriminals triggered a gold-rush-like mentality, more cybercriminals are now rushing to use these same techniques. Although file-less and file-light malware will still be outnumbered by orders-of-magnitude as traditional style malware, they will pose a significant threat and lead to an explosion in 2018.\nmiddot;nbsp; Organisations Will Still Struggle Withnbsp; Security-as-a-Service nbsp;(SaaS) Security \nAdoption of SaaS continues to grow at an exponential rate as organizations embark on digital transformation projects to drive business agility. This rate of change and adoption presents many security challenges as access control, data control, user behavior and data encryption vary significantly between SaaS apps. While this is not new and many of the security problems are well understood, organizations will continue to struggle with all these in 2018.\nCombined with new privacy and data protection laws adopted by regulators across the world, these will pose major implications in terms of penalties, and more importantly, reputational damage.\nmiddot;nbsp; Organisations Will Still Struggle With nbsp; Infrastructure-as-a-Service ( IaaS) Security ndash; More Breaches Due to Error, Compromise amp; Design \nIaaS has completely changed the way organizations run their operations, offering massive benefits in agility, scalability, innovation, and security. It also introduces significant risks, with simple errors that can expose massive amount of data and take down the entire system. While security controls above the IaaS layer are customerrsquo;s responsibility, traditional controls do not map well ndash; leading to confusion, errors and design issues with ineffective or inappropriate controls being applied, while new controls are ignored. This will lead to more breaches throughout 2018 as organizations struggle to shift their security programs to be IaaS effective.\nmiddot;nbsp; Financial Trojans Will Still Account For More Losses Than Ransomware \nFinancial Trojans were some of the first pieces of malware to be monetized by cybercriminals. From simple beginnings as credential harvesting tools, they have since evolved to advanced attack frameworks that target multiple banks, and banking systems that send shadow transactions and hide their tracks. They have proven to be highly profitable for cybercriminals. Today the move to mobile application-based banking has curtailed some of the effectiveness, so cybercriminals are now moving their attacks to these platforms. Cybercriminalsrsquo; profits from Financial Trojans is expected to grow, giving them higher gains as compared to Ransomware attacks.\nmiddot;nbsp; Expensive Home Devices Will Be Held To Ransom \nRansomware has become a major problem and is one of the scourges of the modern Internet, allowing cybercriminals to reap huge profits by locking up usersrsquo; files and systems. The gold-rush mentality has not only pushed more and more cybercriminals to distribute ransomware but also contributed to the rise of Ransomware-As-A-Service and othernbsp;specializationsnbsp;in the cybercriminal underworld. These specialists are now looking to expand their attack reach by exploiting the massive increase in expensive connected home devices. Smart TVs, smart toys, and other smart appliances can run into thousands of dollars and users are generally not aware of the threats to these devices, making them an attractive target for cybercriminals.\nmiddot;nbsp; IoT Devices Will Be Hijacked and Used in DDoS Attacks \nIn 2017, we have seen massive DDoS attacks using hundreds of thousands of compromised IoT devices in peoplersquo;s homes and workplaces to generate traffic. This is not expected to change with cyber criminals looking to exploit the poor security settings and management of home IoT devices. Furthermore, the inputs and sensors of these devices will also be hijacked, with attackers feeding audio, visual or other faked inputs to make these devices do what they want rather than what users expect them to do.\nmiddot;nbsp; IoT Devices Will Provide Persistent Access to Home Networks \nBeyond DDoS attacks and ransomware, home IoT devices will be compromised by cyber criminals to provide persistent access to a victimrsquo;s network. Home users generally do not consider the cybersecurity implications of their home IoT devices, leaving default settings and not vigilantly updating them like they do with their computers. Persistent access means that no matter how many times a victim cleans their machine or protects their computer, the attacker will always have a backdoor into victimsrsquo; network and the systems that they connect to.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "supply chain attacks will become mainstream  supply", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial trojans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exchanges  blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:33.055+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5136350bdcfe1b511b971426cdad28718977d94f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW1xf7ieD78V08ldQuj73MdRiG64.GxqzYocTIa7Ck2S30VjzYgwYRZeerbqvLKCDQQ0Cbp09Ejww--", "site_full": "news.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/news?query=s&start=120&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "", "title": "PM-N Korea", "title_full": "PM-N Korea : \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ub274\uc2a4", "published": "2017-12-07T08:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KS", "spam_score": 0.149, "main_image": "http://imgnews.naver.net/image/origin/001/2017/12/07/9736295.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5136350bdcfe1b511b971426cdad28718977d94f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW1xf7ieD78V08ldQuj73MdRiG64.GxqzYocTIa7Ck2S30VjzYgwYRZeerbqvLKCDQQ0Cbp09Ejww--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4 | \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ub274\uc2a4", "published": "2017-12-07T08:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "PM-N Korea", "text": "PM: S.

It\u2019s a time when loved ones get together in closed, confined spaces. Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles, Cousins, all of them asking you the same innocent question.\n\u2018So, have you got a boyfriend?\u2019\nThe question always comes up and my answer is always the same.\n\u2018Nope, I\u2019m focused on my career right now.\u2019\nMost of the time this seems to throw them off the scent for a little while. But we all know its really hard being single around the Christmas time. Who will pull your cracker with you! Who will help you decorate your tree! Who will you share you mince pie with!\nIf you\u2019re worried about being single this Christmas, then here are my top tips for you!\nHid e \u2013 The best way to avoid those awkward questions from your non-single family members\u2026hide, just hide. Grab a few snacks from the buffet table and disappear. If you have to socialise, keep it brief and vanish as soon as possible! They can\u2019t judge your single ass if they can\u2019t see it!\n\nFind other singles \u2013 Like those little fish on Blue Planet 2, there is safety in numbers! Find other singles and congregate! They can save you from Grandma\u2019s inquiries into when you\u2019re going to give her great-grand-kids!\nMake friends with the dog \u2013 If you\u2019re at a family event and they have a dog, make friends with it. That way you can spend the whole time with your new furry friend. He doesn\u2019t mind that you cry yourself to sleep alone every night! If they don\u2019t have a dog, you may want to invest in a dog for Christmas. If nothing else, it\u2019s a great topic to switch the conversation too. Hey, have you met my dog!? If this isn\u2019t possible, follow tip 1!\n\nLie \u2013 You\u2019re Mamma taught you better, but your Mamma never had to face this hell! When the question comes up, lie. Lie your little single butt off. \u2018Yeh, sure Auntie Mavis, I\u2019ve got a boyfriend..oh no he\u2019s not here! He has a really important job so he\u2019s in New York right now. He wanted me to go over and see him but I wouldn\u2019t want to miss the time to spend with my wonderful family!\u2019\nPhotoshop \u2013 If you\u2019re feeling confident in your abilities, follow on from the previous point by provided photographic evidence of your spouse! If you\u2019re not the best at using photoshop, then lens flares are your friend! They look artistic and cute, but they also distort the faces in the photos! Find a pic that could possibly pass as you! And edit the crap out of it! Tada! you have a first date photo. You\u2019re welcome.\n\nObviously, I am completely joking. There is nothing wrong with being single at any time of the year, I have been single for the last few years and I actually really enjoy it!\nIf you do struggle with the questions about your love life, whether they are from your family or friends, remember, your relationship status does not define who you are!\nEnjoy Christmas, Eat too much, drink\u2026responsibly and be merry!\nWhat\u2019s your favourite thing to do by yourself at Christmas?

The new generation of Windows 10 laptops will stay connected to the internet the whole day, come with a battery life of over 20 hours and will run typically on mobile phone software. Asus, Lenovo, and HP are the manufacturers of this high-class ultra-thin PCs. They\u2019ll come with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Processor and look more like the regular 2-in-1 Intel processor laptops. The outstanding difference is the windows 10 and Snapdragon processor in the new laptops. The Snapdragon 835 chipset will enable the Windows 10 machines to connect quickly to mobile networks. The ARM-powered laptops are expected to offer an up to Gigabits in download speed and beat the existing Intel processing laptops in battery life. Some of these laptops were revealed during the Snapdragon Tech Summit organized by Qualcomm. The first one will be Asus NovaGo which is said to have a battery life of up to 22 hours. That is if the laptop is on video playback. But if it is in standby mode, the battery will run up 30 days without going off charge. The joint work of Qualcomm and Microsoft brings to the world an always-on laptop with a 24/7 internet connection. The ultra-thin and fanless computers will function more like an iPad than the ordinary laptops. The always-on feature will make the waking time of the laptop much faster than of the standard windows laptops. In addition to that, the machine will not go off or drain power if you close the lid. If these computers live up to the hype, we are going to enjoy an LTE connectivity that has not been witnessed on other networks. HP and Asus will initially come with Windows 10 S, which is compatible with the standard mobile apps available on the windows app store. However, users will be able to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which is free, for now, and be able to install the normal PCs apps. Microsoft has developed a unique emulator to ensure 32-bit apps run well on the new laptops. They\u2019ll also use windows 10 S that works natively with the ARM. Note that this is not the first time Microsoft is coming up with ARM laptops. Five years ago the company came together with Nvidia to create Windows RT tablets. The project failed due to poor choice of software. The promises were more or less the same as these of Qualcomm and Microsoft. The tablet\u2019s battery was terrible, and the performance was pathetic. The two tech companies had promised users a desktop app running tablet, which never happened. We can, however, say that the idea of software emulation is a clear indication that Microsoft learned their lesson from the RT tablet mess. Neither Microsoft nor Nvidia has talked about the RT tablet; whether the project still stands or its dead. Microsoft says they\u2019ll continue testing new desktop app compatibility, as they have already proved that popular ones like MS word are working correctly. Lenovo ARM-Powered PC The company imagines a wide range of market for the new products ranging from students to established business people. Among the benefits of the ARM-powered laptops to businesses, as the manufacturers say, include: The 24/7 internet connection Improved security as you connect to your cellular network other than insecure Wi-Fi networks The reduced cost of internet as companies will no longer have to pay for so many internal networks Qualcomm promises their customers up to a gigabit of download speed. Earlier this year, a representative from the company downloaded a 30-minute full HD video clip in less than a minute, 30 seconds to be precise, using the cellular connection. Asus NovaGo comes with a 13.3\u201d High-Definition display, 8GB RAM and an internal storage of 256GB. It has a stylus support, 3 USB ports, a micro SD card reader, and an HDMI port. Asus NovaGo will start selling at $799. There is also the 4GB RAM and 84GB storage version of the NovaGo with a starting price of $599.

My priorities for economic development will be to effect cost-cutting measures, stamping out corruption and plugging all resource leakages where they have occurred. \n\u201cThis includes the compelling need to ensure that those who looted State resources return them or else the long arm of the State will catch up with them,\u201d he said. \nEarlier on, Mnangagwa had officiated at the renaming of KG6 Barracks in honour of the late Zanla Commander General Josiah Magama Tongogara, whom he described as the best military strategist the country had in its execution of the liberation war. \n\u201cWe should never ever forget the role played by the rest of the late gallant sons and daughters in liberating the country and as such the renaming of these cantonments should not appear as if it\u2019s erasing the exploits of other cadres who are too many to mention,\u201d he said. \nMnangagwa also called on the ZDF to introduce Tongogara memorial lectures to unpack the great role the nationalist played in the liberation of the country.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emmerson mnangagwa", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "mushava  mnangagwa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mugabe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mnangagwa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josiah magama tongogara", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "correctional services and central intelligence organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe staff college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zdf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe defence forces", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "malawi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "botswana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe republic police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tanzania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zambia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:34.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ffb4d3d75ce064f38ffec000cd635765f8c8822", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pEJmYP03ByBEG6w9VhJBMWGM6v9pBdXFN", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/aco/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/aco/ -

We've not even had any opportunity to discuss this audit yet. \n\"And we don't even know if Bradford Council will give us the Council Tax Support Grant. If not, that would be over \u00a3100,000 gone in the blink of an eye.\" \nCllr Michael Westerman said: \"It really is something when we should have to read this report in the press first before we've had a chance to discuss it ourselves. \n\"I don't understand how we can be 'haemorrhaging' money but at the same time be told we've got too much money. From what I can see we've actually had a good internal audit.\" \nCllr John Kirby said he wished Cllr Akhtar was present at the meeting, adding that if he had attended he would have asked him to explain the comments he made to the press. \nHe said that if Cllr Akhtar would not explain these comments he would then ask him to stand down as committee chairman. \nCllr Shazad Mahmood supported what his colleagues had said, adding: \"The chairman of our finance and audit committee is aware that we've been working very hard to try and find the right solution for the civic centre, which is not as simple as he says it is.\" \nMembers of the council agreed to implement the recommendations put forward by their latest internal audit. \nSpeaking to the Keighley News this week, Councillor Akhtar accepted he was not at the council meeting last Thursday where he came under fire. \nHe responded: \u201cCouncillors should have been expending their energies focussing on the task at hand and look at ways the council can address the very important issue raised by our audit report, instead of blaming the chair of finance committee for giving his view to the press after being approached for one. \n\u201cThe matter was first brought up at our committee meeting and if all committee members had attended then maybe they would have been aware of it prior to full council meeting. \n\u201cAt no point was this an attempt to bring council into disrepute or blame any individual councillor. \n\u201cAs the chair I am perfectly within my right to speak about financially-related matters \nwhich have a bearing not only on the finances of the council but also on the town \nprecept payers at a time of austerity. \n\u201cWe have a responsibility and obligation to our precept payers and to ask for only the money which this council requires to provide and run whatever necessary for the betterment of our town and its people. \n\u201cI am disappointed that some councillors have seen my comments as an attack \nor criticism of the council when they were merely a response to a question I was asked.\u201d \n\u201cThere are far bigger issues at this moment in time for us to concentrate on like \nattempting to take on services from our hauthority which are being reduced or \nfinished due to cutbacks, setting the budget for the year ahead, and making sure that \nthe council continues to be transparent, accountable and above all doing things \nlawfully.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cllr john kirby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "javaid akhtar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akhtar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cllr akhtar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cllr shazad mahmood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cllr michael westerman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cllr peter corkindale", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "keighley town council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keighley town council committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bradford council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council tax support grant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keighley news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north street", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:34.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "60927b3ba2f0229802a6bb9ebe0391ec58b63fbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95ijEsEoW9yBiJnSVULwl8dLrA1nQqT3.61i.Cm17orh0Gw--", "site_full": "www.newsday.co.zw", "site": "newsday.co.zw", "site_section": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NewsDay Zimbabwe", "title": "Zim sign $213m deals with China", "title_full": "Zim sign $213m deals with China", "published": "2017-12-07T04:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZW", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Chinese-ambassador-to-Zimbabwe--e1512585086693.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 74625, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "60927b3ba2f0229802a6bb9ebe0391ec58b63fbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95ijEsEoW9yBiJnSVULwl8dLrA1nQqT3.61i.Cm17orh0Gw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsday", "published": "2017-12-07T04:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Zim sign $213m deals with China", "text": "Zim sign $213m deals with China - December 7, 2017 \nZIMBABWE yesterday signed three agreements with China that will see the construction of the Parliament, high performance computer centre and rehabilitation of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport to the tune $213 million. \nBY FIDELITY MHLANGA \nOfficiating at the signing of the agreements yesterday, Finance and Economic Planning minister Patrick Chinamasa said the framework agreement on the concessionary loan amounting to $153 million for the upgrading and expansion of Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport would be administered through the Export-Import Bank of China. \n\u201cThe project entails the expansion of the terminal building, rehabilitation of the runway, installation of the communication system, refurbishment of the fire station and new satellite station,\u201d he said. \nThe loan will be paid in 20 years (including 7 years grace period) at an interest rate of 2% per annum. \nChina also extended two grants worth $60 million towards the construction of new Parliament building in Mount Hampden and the high performance computer centre phase two at the University of Zimbabwe. \nAlso present at the signing ceremony was Foreign Affairs minister Sibusiso Moyo, Higher and Tertiary Education minister Amon Murwira, Local Government minister July Moyo and deputy Finance minister Terrence Mukupe. \nChinamasa said the support springs from the State visit by Chinese President XI Jinping on December 1, 2015 where he pledged to support the construction of the new Parliament building, adding that more deals with China were in the offing. \n\u201cChina is the only source of infrastructure financing. If you look at Kenya, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo their source of funding is China. We look forward to China and we have a lot to know from them. They are second largest economy after United States of America,\u201d he said. \nChinamasa admitted that the country was failing to timeously service previous loans given by China for the past year or so due to the difficult economic environment. \nBut he, however, said today\u2019s National Budget presentation will show that the country was back in serious business and set to be fully integrated into the international community. \nChinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Huang Ping said China was committed to facilitate funds towards the construction of key projects in Zimbabwe. \n\u201cThe Chinese government will continue to support the Zimbabwean government and people in their economic revival and social development. The agreement we have signed today is just a testimony of our efforts and our true friendship that withstands the test of time,\u201d he said. \nZimbabwe has in the past received support targeting various projects in education, agriculture, energy, transport and communication. \nThe country sees China as its all-weather friend since looking East over a decade ago after relations with the West soured over human rights violations. \nWhile other countries have benefitted with China investing heavily in infrastructure, Zimbabwe has been lagging behind due to policy inconsistencies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sibusiso moyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terrence mukupe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amon murwira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "july moyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert gabriel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xi jinping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinamasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick chinamasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe huang ping", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "china zim", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "university of zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "export-import bank of china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national budget", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert gabriel mugabe international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mugabe international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic republic of congo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount hampden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethiopia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:34.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3cd750a0f8888ac37718125a107897746b253fb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApuzV2WawCWLsdYz0hVF.101aX6jRKUuoJDg6buzqrL8YE9WC..xyh3ciignW001tcTjwrXvFT_5StW1A9PtqsQdE1lkW9tZQNHlSCgkB77UAeoPJMkPdWCEUa5kV5Z7XDA-", "site_full": "medicineasfakiakianakis.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://medicineasfakiakianakis.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Medicine by Sfakianakis G.

Muscle-sparing techniques diminish this concern, but often sacrifice the quality of exposure. We describe a novel muscle-sparing, high thoracotomy approach for the treatment of ventral cervicothoracic and upper thoracic spine lesions.\nMethods A novel muscle-sparing, high thoracotomy approach is described, utilizing a midline posterior incision with lateral extension from the lateral decubitus position. Five patients are presented to illustrate the application of this technique in thoracic tumors with intimate spinal involvement.\nResults The muscle-sparing, high thoracotomy approach afforded gross total resection and spinal reconstruction in five consecutive patients, including stage IV lung carcinoma with invasion of the T5 and T6 vertebral bodies, two malignant fibrous histiocytomas causing thoracic cord compression, a metastatic T6 lesion of unknown primary with associated cord compression; and a Pancoast tumor. All patients seen at 6 months had full symmetric shoulder range of motion postoperatively.\nConclusions The described muscle-sparing, high thoracotomy approach provides excellent exposure of the ventral cervicothoracic and upper thoracic spine without the morbidity associated with the transection of shoulder girdle muscle bellies.

That has created a shortage of bonds, pushing a large chunk of the market into negative yielding territory.\n\u201cThis year, ECB buying is much bigger than net issuance, next year ECB buying is roughly in the same ball park as net issuance,\u201d said Seamus Mac Gorain, fixed income portfolio manager, JPMorgan Asset Management.\nABN AMRO forecasts net issuance will nudge into positive territory for the first time since before the ECB embarked on quantitative easing.\nIt estimates that net adjusted bond supply will up end up at 3 billion euros next year versus a decline of almost 300 billion euros this year.\nEven banks that believe ECB demand will still exceed the new supply see the mismatch reducing dramatically.\nDZ Bank said if new net purchases are discontinued at the turn of the year 2018/19, the net issuance volume adjusted for ECB purchases comes to minus 63 billion euros, having stood at minus 407 billion euros in the previous year.\n\u201cThe eurozone government bond market will be supported significantly in 2018 as the ECB will virtually take away all of the new supply flow,\u201d said ABN AMRO senior fixed income strategist in Amsterdam Kim Liu.\n\u201cThis comes on top of the already existing inventory on the ECB\u2019s balance sheet. However, this is still less favourable than in 2017.\u201d\nDIVERGENCE Bond strategists expect sharp divergences in the supply and impact of ECB bond buying to show up across the region.\nFrance and Italy were two countries in particular that were forecast to see supply outweigh ECB purchases next year.\nFrance, one of the first euro zone countries to provide details of its 2018 borrowing plans, said in September it would lift bond issuance next year as the state budget deficit and redemptions rise.\nIt will issue 195 billion euros of medium and long-term debt next year net of buybacks, up from 185 billion euros this year.\n\u201cWe estimate that net supply minus ECB bond buying will be 32 billion euros, the first positive figure since 2014,\u201d said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet.\nIn contrast, net supply in Germany and the Netherlands when ECB asset purchases are taken in to consideration, were expected to remain in negative territory.\nIn the Netherlands, an economic recovery, additional cash flows from the sale of private assets had reduced the state\u2019s need to borrow money and means net bond supply is expected to be negative for a third straight year.\nShrinking bond markets in these two \u201ccore\u201d euro zone countries is a reason why ECB bond buying was expected to keep bond yields at relatively low levels.\n\u201cRelating our issuance estimates to the anticipated ECB purchase activities next year it becomes clear that the central bank\u2019s buying flow still remains an important factor, even after net monthly bond volumes will have halved,\u201d said Benjamin Schroeder, senior rates strategist at ING.\nMore generally, overall euro zone debt supply was expected to fall given stronger economic growth and better public finances.\nCommerzbank, ING and ABN AMRO Bank expect debt sales to decline by 40-75 billion euros across the 19-member bloc in 2018.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe;
