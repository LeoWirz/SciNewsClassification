Mr. Putin has maintained his popularity in large part by persuading Russians that he is the guarantor of their national greatness against the machinations of a West forever conniving to keep Russia down. The Olympic ban was the perfect setup to declare his candidacy. Speaking at the giant Gorky Automobile Factory in Nizhny Novgorod where he announced his decision \u2014 a decision that will keep him in office for another six years, since he will be sure to win \u2014 Mr. Putin dismissed the International Olympic Committee\u2019s stern punishment as an \u201cabsolutely staged and politically motivated decision.\u201d The 17-month I.O.C. investigation that confirmed the \u201csystemic manipulation of the antidoping rules and system in Russia\u201d and led to the ban was accorded no credence. The committee has now retroactively banned 25 Russians who competed in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, for doping offenses, stripping 11 medals, and the investigations continue. The irony in the back-to-back announcements is that the same power plays that garner Mr. Putin plaudits at home have spectacularly backfired abroad. The annexation of Crimea, the interference in Ukraine, the meddling in American elections and the elaborate, state-sponsored doping of athletes, to name the more grievous of them, have sharply diminished Mr. Putin\u2019s, and Russia\u2019s, stature in much of the world. However Mr. Putin depicts the ban, the fact is that it\u2019s the least the I.O.C. could have done, and the sooner the Russians understand this the better for their great athletes. The I.O.C. has come under considerable criticism over the years for its anemic response to scandals and doping, but Russia\u2019s brazen and elaborate cheating at the 2014 Games, revealed by the former director of Russia\u2019s antidoping lab, rendered Russia\u2019s participation in the South Korean games unthinkable. Some will argue that the I.O.C. should have been even tougher, imposing a blanket ban on all Russian participation.

internet giant Amazon launched in Australia Tuesday in time for Christmas, with retailers scrambling to cut costs and boost their online offerings as they brace for an expected shake-up of the sector. \n\nThe arrival of the behemoth \u2014 which has grown from an online bookstore to one of the world\u2019s largest firms \u2014 poses a threat to a market already grappling with weak consumer confidence amid tepid wages growth. \n\nThe American giant is offering \u201cmillions\u201d of products from well-known Australian brands, as well as small and medium-sized Australian businesses selling on Amazon Marketplace. \n\nThey will be shipped from a warehouse in Melbourne. \n\nOnline shopping only accounts for between 8-13 percent of total sales in Australia, leaving room for growth in a sector estimated to be worth more than Aus$300 billion (US$227 billion) annually. \n\n\u201cWe believe Amazon\u2019s full entry into Australia will likely be a success,\u201d UBS analysts said in a note ahead of the launch, adding that Australia was an \u201cattractive market where online is under-penetrated\u201d. \n\n\u201cAustralian online shoppers spend the third-most globally of Amazon\u2019s markets.\u201d \n\nRetail categories most likely to be hurt by Amazon\u2019s entry include electrical, appliances, apparel and cosmetics, UBS added. \n\n\u2013 Faces challenges \u2013 \nThe US firm was likely to absorb losses initially to boost its market share, IBISWorld senior analyst Kim Do said, pressuring the profitability and margins of its competitors. \n\nSeveral top Australian retailers have recently succumbed to pressure from foreign giants such as Japan\u2019s Uniqlo and Sephora of France, while others have cut back on bricks-and-mortar stores. \n\nBut Australian Retailers Association executive director Russell Zimmerman welcomed Amazon\u2019s arrival, saying it provided an additional platform to boost sales. \n\n\u201cWith over 300 million active users already on Amazon\u2019s Marketplace, the majority of Australian retailers view Amazon\u2019s platform as a supplementary channel to their current retail offering,\u201d he said. \n\nSome analysts warned Amazon would face challenges, such as low access to broadband and the large size of the island continent. \n\n\u201cA key reason why Australia lags behind its peers (in the development of the e-commerce sector) is the low access to broadband,\u201d BMI Research, Fitch Group\u2019s research arm, said in a note. \n\nBroadband subscriptions in Australia stand at 57.3 per 100 people, rising to a forecast 60 in 2021, in contrast to markets like Singapore which is projected to have subscriptions of 75.3 per 100 that year, BMI said. \n\n\u201cSlower delivery speeds due to the large geographic size of the country and as a result, more costly delivery services\u2026 will not bode well for the success of an e-commerce company.\u201d \n\nRetail analyst Brian Walker said according to his research, Amazon was \u201cproducing a positive return\u201d in just one-third of the countries it was operating in outside of the US. \n\n\u201cThe rest are still in the various stages of

We present the first study addressing molecular effects of fractional non-sequential ultrapulsed CO 2 laser treatment using a 3D skin model that allows standardized investigations of time-dependent molecular changes ex vivo. While histological examination was performed to assess morphological changes, we utilized gene expression profiling using microarray and qRT-PCR analyses to identify molecular effects of laser treatment. Irradiated models exhibited dose-dependent morphological changes resulting in an almost complete recovery of the epidermis 5 days after irradiation. On day 5 after laser injury with a laser fluence of 100 mJ/cm 2 , gene array analysis identified an upregulation of genes associated with tissue remodeling and wound healing (e.g., COL12A1 and FGF7), genes that are involved in the immune response (e.g., CXCL12 and CCL8) as well as members of the heat shock protein family (e.g., HSPB3). On the other hand, we detected a downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3), differentiation markers (e.g., LOR and S100A7), and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1\u03b1.\nOverall, our findings substantiate the understanding of time-dependent molecular changes after CO 2 laser treatment. The utilized 3D skin model system proved to be a reliable, accurate, and reproducible tool to explore the effects of various laser settings both on skin morphology and gene expression during wound healing.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AzlrSw", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:27.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "307d77c2d044ebe59c0d66ffb1f0871e067ec126", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9JlNl3PwMZOEHuER.Fjfdqg2PRKkGduppFL8TsYajsXYP6kMCsemzzL5bFnvq43VuTC1JzU9qYp1r.aSu2UVMaMc27XRirGSr_GHJbru60nkCu_K.40nD76nnts8QcyH0-", "site_full": "www.capitalpress.com", "site": "capitalpress.com", "site_section": "http://www.capitalpress.com/section/rssfeed/1322&template=rss&mime=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Capital Press | AP Wire", "title": "Los Angeles moves toward legal pot sales milestone", "title_full": "Los Angeles moves toward legal pot sales milestone", "published": "2017-12-06T18:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.capitalpress.com/images/gravatar.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "307d77c2d044ebe59c0d66ffb1f0871e067ec126", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9JlNl3PwMZOEHuER.Fjfdqg2PRKkGduppFL8TsYajsXYP6kMCsemzzL5bFnvq43VuTC1JzU9qYp1r.aSu2UVMaMc27XRirGSr_GHJbru60nkCu_K.40nD76nnts8QcyH0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MICHAEL R.

BLOOD \nAssociated Press \nPublished on December 6, 2017 11:41AM \nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 In March, Los Angeles voters endorsed a plan to bring order to the city\u2019s long-unruly marijuana market while clearing the way for recreational sales to begin next year, making L.A. the biggest city with legal pot sales in the country. \nBut it\u2019s taken months to work out the fine print. \nOn Wednesday, the City Council is expected to consider a dense set of regulations that will dictate where pot can be grown and sold in the new market, along with how businesses that grow and trade in the leafy plant will be licensed. \nThe rules would keep pot businesses largely out of residential neighborhoods, while creating buffer zones around schools, libraries and public parks. \nThe long-delayed guidelines would be a milestone: Growers and sellers need local licenses before they can apply for state permission to operate in the new, legal pot economy. \nBut with the new year just weeks away \u2014 and the holidays coming \u2014 industry experts say it\u2019s not clear how many L.A. businesses will be ready to open their doors on Jan. 1 \u2014 if any. \nHow many businesses will be licensed in the city on Jan. 1 for legal recreational sales? \n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Adam Spiker, executive director of the Southern California Coalition, a cannabis industry group. \nSpiker and others fear a bottleneck in the emerging system that stalls or slows recreational sales could encourage customers to turn to the illegal market that has flourished in California for years. \nIf demand is not satisfied by legal sales then \u201cyou are just giving oxygen to the black market we all want to eradicate,\u201d Spiker said. \nThe route to legalization began last year when state voters approved Proposition 64, which opened the way for recreational pot sales to adults in the nation\u2019s most populous state. \nCome January, the newly legalized recreational sales will be merged with the state\u2019s two-decade-old medical market, which is also coming under much stronger regulation. \nFor years Los Angeles has been largely unregulated terrain for the marijuana industry, where hundreds of illegal dispensaries proliferated. \nEarlier this year, L.A. voters endorsed another attempt to regulate the pot business locally, leading to the regulations that will be considered Wednesday. \nThe legal marketplace is seen as a way to impose order, pushing out rogue operators while raising tens of millions of dollars in taxes for City Hall. \nIn general, California will treat cannabis like alcohol, allowing people 21 and older to legally possess up to an ounce and grow six marijuana plants at home. \nCalifornia is among 29 states where cannabis is legal, either for medical or recreational purposes. \nAs recreational sales approach, anxiety is widespread. \nMany cities are struggling to fashion local rules for pot shops and growers. Without the regulations, there could be limited options in many places for consumers eager to start the new year with a legal pot purchase. \nAt first, the state will issue only temporary licenses. And big gaps loom in the system intended to move cannabis from the field to distribution centers, then to testing labs and eventually retail shops.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "spiker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam spiker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael r. blood", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "capital press marketplace los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press  published", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l.a.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:27.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "727cd4f15fe2e9c58ecad4cda5109e18d97b6761", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5qMd_3.aqkAtIt.w3TL_8I-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "727cd4f15fe2e9c58ecad4cda5109e18d97b6761", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5qMd_3.aqkAtIt.w3TL_8I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "[    0.000000] Phoenix BIOS detected: BIOS may corrupt low RAM, working around i\r\nt.\r\n[    0.000000] MTRR default type: uncachable\r\n[    0.000000] MTRR fixed ranges enabled:\r\n[    0.000000]   00000-9FFFF write-back\r\n[    0.000000]   A0000-BFFFF uncachable\r\n[    0.000000]   C0000-C7FFF write-protect\r\n[    0.000000]   C8000-E3FFF uncachable\r\n[    0.000000]   E4000-FFFFF write-protect\r\n[    0.000000] MTRR variable ranges enabled:\r\n[    0.000000]   0 base 000000000 mask F80000000 write-back\r\n[    0.000000]   1 base 080000000 mask FC0000000 write-back\r\n[    0.000000]   2 base 0C0000000 mask FF0000000 write-back\r\n[    0.000000]   3 base 0CF700000 mask FFFF00000 uncachable\r\n[    0.000000]   4 base 0CF800000 mask FFF800000 uncachable\r\n[    0.000000]   5 disabled\r\n[    0.000000]   6 disabled\r\n[    0.000000]   7 disabled\r\n[    0.000000] Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-5-amd64 root\r\n=UUID=05f5ef75-32c7-4a18-8875-241fd18bd392 ro quiet\r\n[    0.000000] Memory: 3334872k/3398528k available (3080k kernel code, 476k abse\r\nnt, 63180k reserved, 1898k data, 592k init)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kernel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:28.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd330fa19c401063ab54fa6b1a2307bb59448287", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEsGJi2mFqcvcG7fJMbN64HFJpO15UvQxA6P5DJeZYlIz8K73H3ZMmSYKyBFbkUDROXhIBsGol5ZDNe9aVSq2VdsApBVE1bDq5TKWWnnPM2jJ6ZWlvv9g700", "site_full": "oriental-traditional-music.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://oriental-traditional-music.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Oriental Traditional Music from LPs & Cassettes", "title": "Munojot Yolchieva - MP3 To'plam - MP3 Collection - MP3-CD from Uzbekistan", "title_full": "Munojot Yolchieva - MP3 To'plam - MP3 Collection - MP3-CD from Uzbekistan", "published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd330fa19c401063ab54fa6b1a2307bb59448287", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEsGJi2mFqcvcG7fJMbN64HFJpO15UvQxA6P5DJeZYlIz8K73H3ZMmSYKyBFbkUDROXhIBsGol5ZDNe9aVSq2VdsApBVE1bDq5TKWWnnPM2jJ6ZWlvv9g700", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tawfiq (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "Munojot Yolchieva - MP3 To'plam - MP3 Collection - MP3-CD from Uzbekistan", "text": "\nHere a wonderful MP3-CD by the great Munajat Yulchieva, today the greatest voice of Uzbekistan.

The Canadian retailer caters to many shoppers with a broad offering of food, kitchenware, party decorations, toys and seasonal goods.\n\"We will consider them as competition as we consider all the other retailers in Canada as competition. But there's nothing for us to react to at this time.\"\nThe Quebec-based discount retailer (TSX:DOL) said it earned $130.1 million of $1.15 per diluted share in its third quarter, up from $110.1 million or 92 cents per share a year ago when it had more shares outstanding.\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of $1.11 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.\nSales in the 13 weeks ended Oct. 29 totalled $810.6 million, up from $738.7 million.\nComparable store sales grew 4.6 per cent as the average transaction size grew 4.5 per cent and the retailer saw a 0.1 per cent increase in the number of transactions.\nDollarama said it has no immediate plans to expand its price points beyond $4.\n\"We had 17-plus years to master $1, and it's going to take us a bunch of years to master $3.50 and $4,\" Rossy added.\nThe retailer also said it will likely wait for other retailers to hike prices in response to minimum wage increases before it follows suit.\n\"If they do, it gives us an option. And if they don't, obviously, we must, like all the other retailers, find a way to fight a good fight and figure it out,\" Rossy told analysts.\nDespite high expectations for the retailer, Dollarama again beat analyst forecasts for a 12th consecutive quarter, said Irene Nattel of RBC Capital Markets.\nShe said the company's revised guidance for the year and preliminary outlook for fiscal 2019 is likely \"conservative.\"\n\"Overall, we continue to believe Dollarama remains one of the best growth opportunities in Canadian retail,\" added Brittany Weissman of Edward Jones.\nDollarama had 1,135 stores at the end of the quarter, up from 1,069 stores a year ago.\nOn the Toronto Stock Exchange, Dollarama shares closed down 2.12 per cent to $149.73 in Wednesday trading.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dollarama", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "irene nattel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miniso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brittany weissman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil rossy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rossy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dollarama inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "toronto stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dollarama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rbc capital markets", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada montreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quebec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:29.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd519ec6463824c8846628afdd27e18ede7c8f8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZnDUHOX3VZLF0.WyNSX44v7GysVxnS0_OGNe5Tx1XKwQEbH5VDadJI5Bc8TEsO9WRJToNek3BT8UOzVGeX3Qd", "site_full": "catskills.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://catskills.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "craigslist catskills | for sale search", "title": "4x4 truck (cairo) $1200", "title_full": "4x4 truck (cairo) $1200", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd519ec6463824c8846628afdd27e18ede7c8f8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZnDUHOX3VZLF0.WyNSX44v7GysVxnS0_OGNe5Tx1XKwQEbH5VDadJI5Bc8TEsO9WRJToNek3BT8UOzVGeX3Qd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "4x4 truck (cairo) $1200", "text": "transmission: manual   83 gmc 4x4 half ton ok shape for the year typical rust but still solid truck standard shift electric plow setup but no blade runs but needs work has dead miss on number 7 cylinder call show contact info $1200.00 take it before snow flys   6415793580", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:29.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41fcf820c65d4f671138e859e6a7c4f861cb0bde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZShcLv2AiNvM8MAQEb8fCRCp73TrC3NQWSa.sgObY1jhEzxXiE4l0x35FG__._0.6zsosSMNB65Ilfme46TrFxu", "site_full": "forums.somethingawful.com", "site": "somethingawful.com", "site_section": "https://forums.somethingawful.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=175", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "The Ray Parlour -

Shares \nThe \u201coriginal\u201d home office network consisted of one, maybe two, PCs or laptops connecting to the internet. Now, there\u2019s a wireless network connecting any number of devices, including PCs, laptops, smart phones, tablets, TVs, smart home assistants, gaming consoles, IoT-enabled appliances \u2013 the list goes on and on \u2013 to the internet. This is before even considering the increasing numbers of these home offices serving remote workers. While security risks always existed, home office networks today are far more complex than ever before and more vulnerable to prevalent and sophisticated attacks than it may appear. \nIt\u2019s estimated that in 2016, nearly half of Americans spent at least some time working remotely, and nearly a quarter of workers performed some or all of their work at home. These remote offices are attractive to cyber-attackers because they sit at the network edge. In fact, unsecured remote access was found to be the number one cause of business data breaches, according to one 2016 study. Weaknesses in remote and home offices often include improperly configured security devices and programs and a lack of proper network security solutions that include firewall, VPN, IPS, web and email protection. \nRemote and home office networks can be susceptible to the same attacks as business networks: malware, ransomware and even distributed denial of service (DDoS). Malware attacks typically come in the form of a computer virus or worm, delivered via an email or document that\u2019s been shared. Modern malware can spread and hide out among files on a host computer, and often capitalizes on specific security holes in an operating system or application, or on improperly configured systems. Ransomware is also spread as a virus or worm, but it hijacks a computer and demands payment before releasing it. \nEarlier this year, a massive malware attack called WannaCry hit more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries, and loss estimates from the attack ranged from hundreds of millions to several billion dollars. A short time later, Petya hit. An attack characterized as wiper malware, Petya\u2019s aim was to destroy systems and data, and it seriously disrupted systems at large firms in Europe and the United States. \nDDoS attacks may not be directly targeting a home office network, but cybercriminals can surreptitiously use compromised routers in DDoS attacks or as part of a rented botnet that other nefarious actors pay to use. The remote users unwittingly involved typically don\u2019t realize the attack because there\u2019s only minimal impact on bandwidth resources. But the effects of a DDoS can be widespread. In late 2016, it was a high-profile cybersecurity attack that used internet-enabled cameras as launching pads for a DDoS that ultimately took down a number of websites, including Twitter, Netflix, Pinterest. \nHome office routers are often the entry point for cybersecurity attacks. Their passwords are often weak; many still use the factory settings, the \u201cadmin\u201d user ID, and hackable, weak passwords. One study, conducted in 2016 by researchers at ESET found that, among more than 12,000 home routers tested, many were insecure. There were, or course, weak passwords, but also bad access rights vulnerabilities, command injection vulnerabilities, and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which allow hackers to change router setups and run bogus scripts. The vendor also ran port scanning and found that network services were also accessible from internal and external networks. \nSo, how to prevent becoming a victim of a cybersecurity attack? What are the key elements and best practices of a secure remote or home office network? \nThe first order of business: use antivirus software and a firewall, and keep both updated. Antivirus software is readily available and easy to install; subscription-based solutions can be found online and downloaded. The best programs run in the background automatically, update themselves to protect against the latest threats, including harmful downloads and threats embedded in USB drivers, and protect all the versions of every device on the network. \nFirewalls add another level of protection. For years, most were too difficult or expensive for the home user. Now, there are stand-alone firewalls that are easy to use and cost-effective, can supplement any firewall mechanism that may be embedded in your PCs and laptops, and can include antivirus software. \nMany remote and home office users also currently lack visibility into and control over what\u2019s happening on their network, which is another critical element to effectively protecting what still are often relatively complex networks. Robust reporting is available with some next-generation firewall solutions (which can inspect traffic, not just restrict access by ports) to allow transparency to every facet of what\u2019s happening online: sites your kids are visiting, neighbors jumping on your wireless network, and your newest IP-enabled gadget phoning home. These solutions also can create rules for managing access to websites, applications, and content based on criteria like device, user, time of day, day of week and more, while also providing insights into the effect of those rules through detailed reports. \nI\u2019d be remiss if, in considering home office network security, we didn\u2019t talk about data privacy. This has always been a concern, but is even more so since March when Congress voted to eliminate the broadband privacy rules that required internet service providers (ISPs) to get explicit consent from consumers before selling or sharing web browsing data and other private information to third parties. Now, ISPs can continue to legally gather personal browsing information and sell it indefinitely. \nThere are, however, still things individuals can do to protect their personally identifiable information and browsing history: Use HTTPS - HTTPS (HTTP over SSL), which can obscure the specific pages someone visits. Be wary of plugins which may be collecting your browser history and selling the data to third parties. Always review both the end user license agreement (EULA) and permissions that the plugin requires.

One of his rivals was Lola the rabbit, who had managed to lose almost a quarter of her body weight. \nAlfie\u2019s owner Emily Simcox, a 25-year-old from Middlesbrough, admitted giving him treats to show she loved him. \nShe said: He couldn\u2019t even walk up the stairs; he\u2019d struggle halfway up and then had to stop for a rest before getting to the top. \nOn walks, he would sluggishly walk towards a ball we\u2019d thrown and often wouldn\u2019t bother even trying to bring it back. \nBut since being on the diet his tail hasn\u2019t stopped wagging. \nHe leaps and bounds, and is so full of energy. \nAlfie is proof that change is possible \u2013 we\u2019ll never look back. \nAlfie\u2019s transformation was down to sticking to a strict diet \u2013 and his owner showing him tough love by refusing to succumb to his demands for more food. \nBut Ms Simcox said it wasn\u2019t always easy. \nI was making a cheese sandwich and left it on the kitchen counter, she said. \nI walked back in the room to find Alfie licking his lips, and the cheese sandwich gone. \nAlfie\u2019s weight loss was supervised by PDSA vet nurse Steph Williams, who said he was now unrecognisable from the dog that waddled into our hospital for his first weigh-in. \nShe added: He\u2019s much healthier and will be able to enjoy a much happier life. \nAccording to the PDSA, up to 40% of the nation\u2019s dogs are fat \u2013but help is on hand for hounds shedding pounds.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alfie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emily simcox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steph williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simcox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lola", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pdsa pet fit club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middlesbrough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pdsa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:32.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b60c60c664bb97e463dcbfb47f8a32f358f961e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOifoumm2iTNOSgYngDntU7xslJsu7SLP7PflABUmiN0vaHkgRMNS5GOhEmmX1rt4pi7fKtD83msiZ", "site_full": "www.freelancer.de", "site": "freelancer.de", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.de/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Octane Render Studio by ivanosenbruggen", "title_full": "Octane Render Studio by ivanosenbruggen", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8b60c60c664bb97e463dcbfb47f8a32f358f961e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOifoumm2iTNOSgYngDntU7xslJsu7SLP7PflABUmiN0vaHkgRMNS5GOhEmmX1rt4pi7fKtD83msiZ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Octane Render Studio by ivanosenbruggen", "text": "3D Rendering Octane Render Studio \nAt Insignety, we put all our passion into creating personal jewellery of the highest quality.

Yes, so do I. \nI contacted C. Crane promptly, and to their credit, they immediately dispatched another unit from inventory, via UPS Next Day, along with a return label to send my faulty unit back to their engineering team. \nProduction Radio #2 \nThe second unit arrived while I was on Thanksgiving vacation, but was sent to me directly at my hotel. The day I received the replacement Skywave SSB, I put it on the air. The first listening session with it, alone, revealed that this unit did not have the internally-generated whine, however, this unit had issues with sensitivity . All of my comparison receivers were outperforming this Skywave SSB on the shortwave broadcast bands. When I compared it with the pre-production Skywave SSB unit and the first production unit, the second production unit was about four to five S-units less sensitive. Odd. \nI sent both production radios back to C. Crane with detailed notes and sample recordings. Their engineering team confirmed my findings and started looking into the variations in QC and double-checking their inventory to make sure none shipped with these problems. \nProduction Radio #3 \nA few days later, I was sent a third production unit. After putting it on the air, I immediately noticed the same faint noise characteristics of my first full production unit, which is to say, the notorious whine. \nOnce again, I contacted C. Crane. This time, I requested that no less than three radios be sent to me, and they kindly expedite the request. \nProduction Radios #4, #5, and #6 \nYesterday, I tested all three radios. What follows is a quick assessment of those radios: Performance \nIn a nutshell, the three production units I tested yesterday performed better than my second and third production radios on all bands. Strictly in terms of sensitivity , these were on par with the pre-production unit. Very good. \nBut with that said, even the last three production units I received had internally-generated noises that I couldn\u2019t help but notice. Disappointing. \nAt this point, I must assume these noises are prevalent throughout the first production run since all but one of the six CC Skywave SSB production units I tested have it. Meanwhile, the only one that didn\u2019t have the noise had serious sensitivity issues. Noises \nYesterday,, I spent two full hours searching for birdies (internally generated noises) and other anomalies on the three CC Skywave SSB production units I received Monday. Each radio\u2019s noise location varied slightly (within 20-40 kHz). The following locations are roughly the average of frequencies: \nBirdies \nBirdies are a fairly common occurrence among sensitive receivers, and the CC Skywave SSB has about an average number. The birdies I noted are outside the space where I do my broadcast listening: 2,305 kHz 11,520 kHz \nBackground audio whine/tone \nAll of the production units (save Radio #2) have a very slight audio whine present\u2013\u2013either via the internal speaker or headphones\u2013\u2013on certain portions of the spectrum. \nIn my first full production unit, I believe this whine may have slightly affected the unit\u2019s overall sensitivity. On the last three production units, it didn\u2019t seem to have as much of an impact on overall sensitivity. \nThe whine is still there, however, and occasionally when tuned to a weak signal within one of these zones, other faint sweeping noises could be detected in the background. \nSometimes it\u2019s even more noticeable when the broadcaster is weak and is located within one of the whine zones. Here\u2019s an example of 10 MHz WWV time station comparing the original Skywave with the Skywave SSB. Note that yesterday we had terrible propagation due to a geo storm, so WWV was very weak indeed. \nListen for the sweeping tones: \n</span></p> <p>Here are the frequency ranges where I noted the background whine:</p> <ul> <li>7,830 \u2013 8335 kHz</li> <li>8,610 \u2013 8,690 kHz (note: <i style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">very</i><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> faint)</span></li> <li>9,770 \u2013 10,415 kHz</li> <li>11,585 \u2013 11810 kHz</li> </ul> <p>Another oddity is a noise I found prevalent on CHU Canada\u2019s 7,850 kHz frequency. I\u2019m guessing it may be due to the combination of a DSP birdie on top of a relatively strong broadcaster.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a video comparing the original Skywave with one of the production models:</p> <p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"625\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xC94Wj0n2w?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"/></span></p> <p>I noted no birdies or noises on the mediumwave band. The FM, AIR band, and Weather frequencies perform beautifully.</p> <h2>Summary: The bad news\u2013\u2013and the good</h2> <p>At the moment, it appears the first production run of the CC Skywave SSB has some challenging QC issues. Therefore, unfortunately, I can only recommend it at present if you\u2019re willing to check your unit <i>very carefully </i>for any of the internally-generated noises I noted above.</p> <p>If, however, you\u2019ve already purchased a Skywave SSB and have noticed the noises, then please contact C. Crane. I\u2019ve been a C. Crane customer for many years and I\u2019m confident they will take care of your issue.</p> <p><a href=\"https://swling.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CC-Skywave-SSB-20-MHZ.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-29505\" src=\"https://swling.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CC-Skywave-SSB-20-MHZ-1024x630.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"625\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"https://swling.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CC-Skywave-SSB-20-MHZ-1024x630.jpg 1024w, https://swling.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CC-Skywave-SSB-20-MHZ-300x185.jpg 300w, https://swling.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CC-Skywave-SSB-20-MHZ-768x473.jpg 768w, https://swling.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CC-Skywave-SSB-20-MHZ-624x384.jpg 624w, https://swling.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CC-Skywave-SSB-20-MHZ.jpg 1033w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\"/></a></p> <p>This being said, the truth is, I sympathize with C. Crane. It must be challenging to get things right and truly consistent on the first production run of a radio\u2013\u2013especially on a tiny compact radio like the Skywave SSB. It must be especially hard to keep noises out of the audio chain when so much is crammed into such a tiny package.</p> <p>I fully suspect these issues will be sorted out in the second production run which, of course, I will test and review.</p> <p>But the good news, and it\u2019s sincerely good news, is this: <i>if C. Crane</i> <i>can produce a CC Skywave SSB as good as the pre-production unit,</i> they\u2019ll truly have a winner. So let\u2019s keep our fingers crossed that C. Crane can do it again\u2026and again.</p> </p></div> <p><script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbyg oogle.js\"></script> <!-- NEWS WEB responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8789617219962751\" data-ad-slot=\"6029707301\" data-ad-format=\"auto\"></ins> <script> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); </script><br /> <br /><a href=\"https://swling.com/blog/2017/12/the-c-crane-cc-skywave-ssb-first-production-run-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source link </a></p> <!-- Simple Share Buttons Adder (7.3.10) simplesharebuttons.com --><div class=\"ssba ssba-wrap\"><div style=\"text-align:left\">It's only fair to share...<a data-site=\"\" class=\"ssba_twitter_share\" href=\"http://twitter.com/share?url=http://radioaficion.com/news/the-c-crane-cc-skywave-ssb-first-production-run-review/&amp;text=The%20C.%20Crane%20CC%20Skywave%20SSB%3A%20first%20production%20run%20review%20\" target=&quot;_blank&quot; ><img src=\"http://radioaficion.com/news/wp-content/plugins/simple-share-buttons-adder/buttons/simple/twitter.png\" title=\"Twitter\" class=\"ssba ssba-img\" alt=\"Tweet about this on Twitter\" /></a> </div></div> </div> </article> <div class=\"post-nav section-container clearfix\"> <a class=\"post-previous\" href=\"http://radioaficion.com/news/croatia-confirms-new-60-meter-allocation-expanded-160-meter-privileges/\"> <i class=\"icon-entypo-left-open-big\"></i> <h3 class=\"title title-small\"> <span class=\"super-title\">Previous Article</span> Croatia Confirms New 60-Meter Allocation, Expanded 160-Meter Privileges </h3> </a> </div> <div class=\"about-author section-container clearfix vcard author\"> <div class=\"about-author-info\"> <h3 class=\"author-name title title-medium\"> <span class=\"super-title\">About the Author</span> <span class=\"fn\">SWL3409PL</span> </h3> <div class=\"author-bio\"></div> <div class=\"author-socials\"> </div> </div> </div> </div> <aside id=\"page-sidebar\" class=\"sidebar-wrapper col-sm-5 col-md-4\"> <div class=\"sidebar-inner\"> <div id=\"custom_html-2\" class=\"widget_text widget vw-sidebar-blog widget_custom_html\"><div class=\"textwidget custom-html-widget\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-24964 size-full\" title=\"Ailunce HD2 DMR Digital Tranceiver - 10 watts for mobile operation.- HD2 mobile DMR\" src=\"http://radioaficion.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ailunce_HD2_DMR_Digital_Tranceiver.jpg\" alt=\"Ailunce HD2 DMR Digital Tranceiver\" width=\"314\" height=\"244\" /> <a href=\"http://radioaficion.com/news/retevis-ailunce-hd1/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-24700 \" src=\"http://radioaficion.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Ailunce-HD1_brochure_link.jpg\" alt=\"Ailunce HD1\" width=\"306\" height=\"434\" /></a> <script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block\" data-ad-format=\"autorelaxed\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8789617219962751\" data-ad-slot=\"2960913645\"></ins> <script> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); </script></div></div><div id=\"categories-2\" class=\"widget vw-sidebar-blog widget_categories\"><h3 class=\"widget-title\">Categories</h3> <ul> <li class=\"cat-item cat-item-8\"><a href=\"http://radioaficion.com/news/china-two-way-radios/\" title=\"Made in China Two Way Radio China Products\">China Two Way Radios</a> (134) </li> <li class=\"cat-item cat-item-9\"><a href=\"http://radioaficion.com/news/dx-news/\" title=\"HAM Radio - DX News - DXPeditions - DX Information information about HAM Radio, Radio Amateurs, DX Peditions, DX News, about DX and DXing.

Part of the confusion stems from the historic evolution of its consumer-facing store brand: from Walmart (1962) to Wal-Mart (1964-1992) to Wal*Mart (1992) to Walmart (2008 to present).\nWhile its corporate brand stayed behind in the Wal-Mart era, \u201cWalmart\u201d has been used since 2008 in its stores, website, signage and marketing, as its Wikipedia entry shows visually.\nCEO Doug McMillon says the chain is legally changing its corporate name to \u201cWalmart Inc.\u201d on February 1, 2018, so it matches the name that consumers know it by. The move essentially creates a \u201cOne Walmart\u201d and a seamless brand, as investors, analysts, lawyers and its corporate partners can now bid Wal-Mart farewell and welcome Walmart.\n\nNot only does this clean up any usage clunkiness between its corporate and consumer branding, a press release notes that the name change and removal of hyphen and awkward punctuation \u201cchiefly demonstrates the company\u2019s growing emphasis on serving customers seamlessly however they want to shop: in stores, online, on their mobile device, or through pickup and delivery.\u201d\n\u201cOur customers know us as Walmart and today they shop with us not only in our stores but online and with our app as well,\u201d McMillon said. \u201cWhile our legal name is used in a limited number of places, we felt it was best to have a name that was consistent with the idea that you can shop us however you like as a customer.\u201d\nWalmart adopted \u201cWal-Mart, Inc.\u201d as its corporate name when it incorporated in 1969 and changed it to \u201cWal-Mart Stores Inc.\u201d a year ater. It\u2019s been using the current Walmart logo in its stores and website since 2008.\n\nThe post So Long, Wal-Mart: It\u2019s a One-Walmart Era in Corporate Rebrand appeared first on brandchannel: .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dale buss  walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug mcmillon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcmillon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wal-mart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal-mart stores inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wikipedia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal*mart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walmart inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:32.075+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33b146e83a2eff2128750170160976ff2a42da2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzqEVdnq1krjll98jX3EUVCiqzn3WMypMKfV2Dc8WwZgxA--", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/pt/lawrence-s.en-gb.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Lawrences Hotel, Sintra, Portugal - Booking.com ", "title": "383 Verified Hotel Reviews of Lawrences Hotel | Booking.com", "title_full": "383 Verified Hotel Reviews of Lawrences Hotel | Booking.com", "published": "2017-01-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 53, "participants_count": 45, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.24, "main_image": "https://t-ec.bstatic.com/static/img/facebook-image-else/566c7081f1deeaca39957e96365c3908f83b95af.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 105, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1616442457320ca551281c7238660e78659ecbd2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzqEVdnq1krjll98jX3EUVCiqzn3WMypMKeOktVKA59CO9b7UkkTYD9C1dXhHwqaQSwAtgDRRPLbJiSUjhLKFu11", "ord_in_thread": 51, "author": "Tom", "published": "2017-11-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Friendly staff and good location but would not come back.\"", "text": "\ub209 Breakfast was rubbish, with rotten milk in my cappuccino and pastries that had been left out for what felt like a couple of days\n\ub207 The location", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 2.5, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:32.094+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33832bfb4ab3c930967c9a738fb4274160de06b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.atIXNnaXxGciShFBUBfPw7yHysig.py0cBgpjkrjA7QnG9cdRIofLm1BrdcOUeFrTC4dBddHHZcwbjm_eOm.5", "site_full": "www.ramforum.com", "site": "ramforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.ramforum.com/f38/", "site_categories": ["entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "General Discussions - DODGE RAM FORUM - Dodge Truck Forums", "title": "Are new 1500 orders on hold now? - Page 2", "title_full": "Are new 1500 orders on hold now? - Page 2 - DODGE RAM FORUM - Dodge Truck Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T12:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "77f1eb7ff3c2ea9b0a9b08e5e89980e2b829fe29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.atIXNnaXxGciShFBUBfPw7yHysig.py0cBgpjkrjA7QnG9cdRIofLm1BrdcOUeFrTC4dBddHHZQtCtw7l847uwBzwlXwb7q0fGxMaZl6npg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "corneileous", "published": "2017-12-06T13:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Well crap, I sure hope this isn\u0092t true.

The scandal has so far cost the company as much as $30bn (\u00a322.4bn). \nSchmidt admitted charges of conspiring to mislead US regulators and violate clean air laws. \nThe German national was in charge of the company\u2019s environmental and engineering office in Michigan until February 2015, where he oversaw emissions issues. \nHe then returned to Germany where he was told of the existence of the software. \nAccording to the terms of his guilty plea, he conspired later that year with other executives to avoid disclosing intentional cheating in a bid to seek regulatory approval for diesel models. \nThe judge told Schmidt: It is my opinion that you are a key conspirator in this scheme to defraud the United States \nYou saw this as your opportunity to shine\u2026 and climb the corporate ladder at VW. \nSchmidt read a written statement in court acknowledging his guilt, saying: I made bad decisions and for that I am sorry. \nEngineer James Liang co-operated with the FBI and was sentenced to 40 months in prison last summer. \nSix others at VW or Audi were charged, but they are in Germany and out of reach of US authorities. \nVW pleaded guilty as a corporation in March and agreed to pay $4.3bn in civil and criminal penalties on top of billions more to buy back cars.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james liang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean cox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oliver schmidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schmidt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volkswagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "audi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:32.109+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c20aac288da4b2afa7e140b9f1ed8f80dd82e867", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je6_5hfcg0hGS6.AB5X03hjKHL.ISy5ohyxbtX.y0I8I7DvUAX9EbY81IMjajH42LxRolwnAyRQY3EhWtF6ZQKI5c5fIVbGjSR1975xezzU2S0AxLGR26EB", "site_full": "carbuyinghintseasy.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://www.carbuyinghintseasy.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Car Buying Hints", "title": "How much time Will it really Acquire to buy a Identify Coming from a Fresh Family car Supplier?", "title_full": "How much time Will it really Acquire to buy a Identify Coming from a Fresh Family car Supplier?", "published": "2017-12-06T03:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/3uBx8NWqRR-mGhwbgJUqL1GXU4hp57c1ProB0xANN4l19fR_ZpDWKhxFlkNnP1frlIXWU63vmBdAJkAAWQ9F_pQvxG0ILuX9C5q3DngKRi9xnSJ0BrDOPHz-hgxq_8PuVm9_O_Y2zQjsHWmZfupHTb2VbJZT8vi6G_M5h11Q=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c20aac288da4b2afa7e140b9f1ed8f80dd82e867", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je6_5hfcg0hGS6.AB5X03hjKHL.ISy5ohyxbtX.y0I8I7DvUAX9EbY81IMjajH42LxRolwnAyRQY3EhWtF6ZQKI5c5fIVbGjSR1975xezzU2S0AxLGR26EB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (Jennifer R.

2017 \nCalifornian wildfires have engulfed homes in the upmarket Los Angeles neighbourhood of Bel Air, with firefighters warning they cannot contain the spread. \nHomes in the area popular with celebrities were evacuated as flames swept down the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains. \nMultimillion-dollar mansions were set ablaze as more than 1,000 firefighters attempted in vain to contain an increasing number of fires igniting across southern California. \nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said the blazes had spread across 150 acres with zero containment by 10am (6pm GMT). \nPolice were forced to shut down nine miles of the Interstate 405 freeway, one of the busiest in the US, early on Wednesday morning. \nMotorists described seeing the mountainside near Bel Air glowing and an orange fireball burning its way through the drought-ridden terrain. \nThe blaze has been dubbed the Skirball fire as it is right next to the Skirball Cultural Center, as well as the acclaimed Getty Center museum. \nSeveral other fires are raging across southern California, with the Skirball the latest to ignite due to 50mph wind gusts \u2013 which are set to increase to 70mph on Thursday. \nThe strong winds have prevented planes and helicopters operating as it is too dangerous to fly. \nThe largest blaze is the Thomas fire in Ventura County, just north of LA, which has devastated 65,000 acres and forced 27,000 people to flee after igniting on Monday evening. \nMark Lorenzen, Ventura County fire chief, said: The prospects for containment are not good. \nReally, Mother Nature\u2019s going to decide when we have the ability to put it out. \nHundreds of homes have been destroyed and a further 12,000 buildings and structures are threatened by Thomas alone, officials said. \nMore than 1,000 firefighters are trying to battle the blaze but cannot enter the area due to the intensity of the fire, county officials said. \nThe Creek fire, north of downtown LA, had destroyed 11,000 acres by Tuesday night, while the Rye fire devastated 7,000 acres by Monday morning. \nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in the area on Tuesday. \nHe said: This fire is very dangerous and spreading rapidly. \nIt\u2019s critical residents stay ready and evacuate immediately if told to do so. \nUS President Donald Trump tweeted his thoughts and prayers to California. \nHe said: Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of California\u2019s wildfires, \nI encourage everyone to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials. \nTHANK YOU to all First Responders for your incredible work! \nIn October, wildfires raged through California\u2019s wine country , destroying 27 wineries in the famous wine producing counties of Sonoma and Napa. \nA total of 44 people were killed, some 106,000 people were evacuated and 110,720 acres were devastated by the fires. \nInsurance claims for the October fires have reached more than $9 billion (\u00a36.7bn), the state\u2019s top insurance regulator said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas", "sentiment":
