Fliegl responded to this challenge with a low loader trailer which has a broad-gauge chassis with reinforced stabilisers. With the axle uncoupled, the trailer allows loading from the rear at almost ground level over the entire vehicle width. \nThe ride height can be selected flexibly for transporting loads that are wide, often extremely tall, and weigh tonnes: The height can be reduced from 400 to 250 millimetres simply by turning the sunk keys in the wheel recesses. The width is also variable: the loading surface can be extended to 3.30 metres in the wheel recess area. All this produces the necessary space for carrying combine harvesters, tractors, wheel loaders, tow trucks, slurry tanks, field sprayers - it can even carry lorries. \nThrough dialogue with experienced users, Fliegl has optimised this special vehicle, simplified the design, replaced materials, got rid of the superfluous and so optimised the payload. So the vehicle is also suitable for carrying large modern machinery. Harvesters, for example, are becoming larger and larger and heavier, but the permitted total weight of the trailer remains unchanged and must not be exceeded. \nHow it operates: before driving onto the loading platform, the parking brake is applied on the trailer. The driver then lowers the air suspension at the rear chassis. All supply lines to the rear chassis are shut off, the pneumatic pin locking mechanism is released and the rear chassis is swivelled to the side and pulled away. After the trailer is loaded, all the steps are repeated in the reverse order. The whole process depends on a failure-resistant mechanical system, and handling is logical and comfortable. \nAs standard, the new generation hot-galvanised low loader weighs 5500 kg and offers a load capacity of 14,500 kg. To secure the loads, there are 2 pairs of 5-tonne lashing rings, 4 pairs of 6-tonne lashing lugs on the side of the flat bed, and 5 5-tonne lashing lugs between the longitudinal members. \nWith this two-axle low loader trailer, Fliegl has given a sustainable response to particularly demanding transport requirements, which ensures flexibility and security of investment.

The temple is constructed with Lime Mortar, tiles, and marbles while the idol is made out of rare stone. The shutters of the Sanctum Sanctorum look beautiful because of having been covered with silver sheets. \nA beautiful hall known as Jagmohan is painted with mythological scenes.

Flowers of this Bagicha are used in the worship of God. \nPhalgun Mela (fair) is the main festival which is celebrated every year.

Everyone is shopping, buying and wrapping gifts. But what if you don\u2019t have too much money to spend? \nSave as soon as possible. A little bit at a time helps. If you can, put away 10 or 20 dollars once or twice a month. If you can, put your money into a bank account. This way, you will accrue interest. Talk to your employer and/or bank about setting up an automatic transfer. If you never see the money coming out of your paycheck in the first place, you\u2019re a lot less likely to miss it. \nFigure out your budget. Work out how many people you want to give a gift to and how much money you have. Stick with your budget. Don\u2019t dilly-dally or use the budget as a rough estimate; a budget is a promise, so keep it. Use software to help you budget. In the age of the internet, budgeting has become easier, faster, and more intuitive. Use budgeting software to help you meet your goals! Don\u2019t count on windfalls or bonuses. Only factor the money that you know you\u2019re going to have into your budget. \nThink about making gifts. It is the thought that counts for gifts and not how much money you spent on it. Make a necklace for your sister, or a stuffed animal for your baby cousin. Here are some other items to consider crafting if you\u2019re that sort of person: A leather-bound scrapbook or sketchbook is easier than you might think. A trivet using leftover wine cork, assembled into a nice snowflake or star pattern. Turn a mason jar into a quirky, retro lamp. Make flower lights out of an egg carton simply and quickly. Great for lasting holiday value! A wreath or other door-decorations for that special person to show their holiday spirit. \nIf you have the time, look for items you have but don\u2019t want. One man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure, but only if that treasure is still intact, useful, and respectable. You don\u2019t want to give anyone a broken faucet just because it\u2019s lying around your garage. Once you run out of money, that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t justify spending extra money because it\u2019s such a great deal or you have to have it. Find other, creative ways to get around the money constraint. \nFigure out the personality of the person you\u2019re buying a gift for. Buying a gift successfully depends on knowing what the person likes. That may seem like a no-brainer, but we often buy gifts that we think are cool or appealing. Always keep the perspective of the gift recipient in mind. For example, if your cousin is a music promoter, consider getting her a CD or vinyl LP of an up-and-coming artist that she might enjoy. If, for example, your brother is an avid explorer, consider getting him a travel guide or a photography book about a place he\u2019s interested in going to. Balance out the interests of the gift recipients with the need to stay frugal. You can get your friends and loved ones great, appropriate gifts without breaking the bank. \nFind out what the person has and doesn\u2019t have. Peruse their room, office, or closet for items. This will give you both an idea of what the person likes, and what the person doesn\u2019t already have. Ask yourself when you do a little reconnaissance if the person is technology-oriented, book-, music- or media-oriented, travel-oriented, food-oriented, or any number of other interests. Ask the gift recipient\u2019s family or friends what sort of gifts they think the person might want to receive. Sometimes, you won\u2019t be able to snoop your way through their closet like Sherlock. \nPrioritize. Buy for people of the most importance to you first. Your family is the most important. After you do that, buy gifts for your close friends and then your acquaintances.

This track recalls visits to Scotland as child. By the way that is his late stepfather\u2019s Eric Cantona shirt in his hand throughout the song. \nIan: \nFantastic. Never heard of him before, but a great song. Funnily enough, my #16 has a spiritual background, though no Gospel choir. Sounding like the love-child of Bruce Springsteen & Billy Corgan, David Le\u2019aupepe\u2019s band Gang of Youths released their second album \u201cGo Farther in Lightness\u201d this year. Far from demonstrating the feared sophomore slump, it ascends to great heights lyrically and musically. Reflecting on his failed marriage to a woman who recently died of cancer, it is an incredibly personal exploration of his faith (he is a member of the biggest evangelical congregation in Sydney), mental health and the philosophical issues of mortality. The album includes an abundance of literary reference, drawing on the New Sincerity movement, which includes works by writers like David Foster Wallace and Zadie Smith, and songs which overtly reference philosophers like Ayn Rand & Albert Cumus and the mythology of Virgil and Homer. The success of the band\u2019s masterpiece was recgonised a couple of weeks ago when they won four awards, including Album of the Year, at the ARIAs (our version of the Brit Awards). The track I have chosen, \u201cAchilles Come Down\u201d is not one of the many singles from the album, but is the stand out track for me. It uses samples of Camus speaking alongside string orchestration and lyrics documenting the writer\u2019s suicidal impulses. Here\u2019s \u201cAchilles Come Down\u201d. It is geoblocked on Youtube so here is our first spotify link ( it is track eight): \nRoy: \nFor my 16, more electronica, this time from one of the more unlikely \u2018comebacks\u2019 of the year. The Hatrnoll brothers have got a claim to fame to inventing this kind of thing and they certainly have an unmissable signature sound, front and centre on this excellent new track.

Like a non-racist version of the 50s or early 60s. Sure, there was the crack epidemic and the AIDS epidemic, but the economy was great and everyone mostly got along.

We just took it as a sign of working out the racial tensions. The race war predicted by manson has always been one of their plans and they took the blacks into the black fraternities and sports and music and art and acting, gave them some of the secret knowledges, then continued to plot against them at the higher levels (from what i have gathered, no inside info here, just connected dots).

Credit: Courtesy Palm Beach Marriott Singer Island Credit: Courtesy Palm Beach Marriott Singer Island Credit: Courtesy Palm Beach Marriott Singer Island prev next comments It\u2019s hard to imagine that folks who live in Palm Beach County, Fla., would ever feel the need to get away. After all, they live surrounded by splendor: the sea, the beach, the culture, the shopping and more. But folks do. And when they do, they know to just head down the road, over the Blue Heron Bridge and submerse themselves in the beautiful world that is Singer Island.\nSinger Island, named for the son of Singer Sewing Machine magnate Isaac Singer, is just three miles north of Palm Beach but has a wonderful feeling of escape. While it\u2019s not big, it packs a total vacation punch, but in a seaside, chill kind of way.\nYou won\u2019t find shopping malls and theaters on Singer Island. Those luxuries are a quick jaunt over the bridge if you need them. You will find nature parks, marinas, hiking trails, sea sports, scuba diving, snorkeling and miles and miles of sandy beaches nestled up to the warm Gulf Stream. Singer Island\u2019s beaches are, in fact, the closest to the Gulf Stream in all of America.\nLife on the island centers around the 4.7 miles of sparkling beaches. Hotels are tucked along it. As you walk the beaches, you will find plenty of ways to have fun. Rent boats, sign up to paddle board and parasail and more.\nYou can learn to scuba or snorkel. There\u2019s plenty of great spots, but a true favorite is under the Blue Heron Bridge that brought you to the island. There, even beginner snorkelers (as well as expert divers) can find delight in the vibrant sea life. Besides the usual array of tropical fish drawn to the warm waters, you often spot starfish, hat fish and even seahorses. It\u2019s a must-do for visitors, with plenty of companies to help you do that, such as Pura Vida Divers, located on the island.\nYou can ride atop of the water on a peaceful paddle boarding adventure (also simple to learn on site). Check out High Point Paddle Adventures. To kick things up a bit, visit Get Wet Watersports for all kinds of active water fun.\nSinger Island embraces nature, too. The best spot to soak it in is at MacArthur Beach State Park, the only state park in Palm Beach County. Tucked between the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Worth Lagoon, the park\u2019s 438 acres is home to almost countless plants and animals. (Seven of those plants and 22 of the animals are endangered.) You can lose yourself wandering there, take educational tours or soak in the park\u2019s beautiful beach and rock reef. It\u2019s like a beach trip with a nature preserve wrapped into one.\nWhere to stay? The beach is dotted with fabulous hotel choices, and the island has a wealth of lovely condos available. You cannot do better than a stay at the Marriott Singer Island Resort, which is, according to Conde Nast, a top resort in Florida and the best in Palm Beach.\nJust 13 miles from the airport, the Marriott Singer Island Resort is the only all-suite beachfront resort in the county \u2014 and there\u2019s a balcony in every suite. That makes it friendly for all: families, couples, business, weddings and more. With so many amenities, you might be tempted to never leave. You can snorkel in the resort\u2019s own reef. With pools and an expansive beach, you can tuck into a lounge chair and call it home.\nWhile suites mean easy in-room cooking, you\u2019ll want to go out, since the Marriott Singer Island Resort is like a foodie paradise. The three restaurants \u2014 from the casual fun of the Reef Tiki Bar to the Caribbean vibe at Lagoon Cantina, to the upscale Americana fare and 400-bottle wine list at 3800 Ocean \u2014 offer chef-inspired excellence.\nSi Spa, the resort\u2019s in-house spa, is heralded for focusing on using products from the sea. This is the only spa in the area to offer \u201cComfort Care Classes,\u201d a wellness program for those either going through or recovering from cancer treatment.\nLearn more at palmbeach marriottresort.com.\nSo what if you settle into this paradise and suddenly get a hankering for, say, culture or sports?\nThree miles up the road (and over that bridge) is all that and more in Palm Beach. You\u2019ll find music, art, shopping, everything you can desire. Baseball lovers are right at home, too. Roger Dean Stadium, where the St. Louis Cardinals and Miami Marlins settle in for spring training, is just a few minutes to the north. To the south, you\u2019ll find The Ballpark of Palm Beaches, spring training home to the World Series champion Houston Astros and the Washington Nationals.\nOver the Blue Heron Bridge, locals know, is the way to go for a total beach escape.

The Social Flash BANTAM, like its historic counterpart, the Social Flash RANGE, is a digital, open-range, unattended device that can be used at baseball parks, resort hotel lobbies, restaurants, movie theaters, church events, recreational sports venues, dentist offices and dozens of other venues. \n\u201cThe introduction of the BANTAM Photo Kiosk comes in at a radical disruption to the pricing in the industry. Our new price points, which include the connection to our cloud-based social marketing platform, allow companies to leverage their customers into brand ambassadors and create tremendous social virality, brand engagement and brand awareness for a few dollars a day and a few pennies for each new prospective customer clicking over to their website or Facebook page,\u201d said Derick Alderman, President and Co-Founder of Social Flash Media. \n\u201cThe BANTAM offering, with price points starting at $145 per month for unlimited usage and requiring only about 60 square feet of floor space really begins to open up new market segments for leveraging the digital photo booth to turn customers into brand-advocates. The power of our endorsement-based marketing, whether using our Kiosks or our MOBILE solutions, can change the competitive dynamics of an industry segment these days,\u201d said Stephen Scherer, Co-Founder and Vice President of Business Development at Social Flash Media. \nThe Social Flash BANTAM is based around the iPad Pro and connects wirelessly to the Internet and the Social Flash Media Cloud-Based social marketing platform. It uses the marketing platform to facilitate branding and sending taken photos to customer\u2019s smart phones and email addresses and subsequently sharing those over social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Bantam subscription plans range from $145 to $295 per month depending on the purchase/lease options and subscription duration. \nThe subscription plans allow unlimited photo taking, sending to mobile phones, and social sharing by customers to Facebook and Twitter. Photos are branded and tracked, and extensive analytic and demographic reporting is available. The platform offers businesses a streamlined management of their content and drastically increases their social media marketing efficiency. \nAbout Social Flash Media \nSocial Flash Media, Inc. is a leading provider of the enterprise level Endorsement-Based Marketing platform that enables companies to promote their brands through social awareness, social branding and social endorsement by converting their customers into brand ambassadors leveraging advocate-based marketing techniques.

You can create quality content in your bedroom with your old laptop and here is how to do it. For vloggers \nNow phones have pretty good cameras so you can take good photos and film decent videos and to make it even more pretty, you don\u2019t need professional expensive lighting , all you need is the sun. Take the pictures or film in from of a large window or even outside. Many times natural lighting is better than the professional lightings. Even big and rich vloggers choose natural lighting which is free by the way. \nWe all know that if you choose to vlog as a business another important thing for high quality content is a tripod . Is better if your hand is not shaking and you have a stable and clean video and for this you need a tripod. There are very expensive tripods or one that cost like $20. If you can\u2019t afford to buy the $20 tripod, here is a tip for you: you can use a lot of books to add height and act like a tripod, no one will know. \nNow that we filmed the video we have to edit it. Hmmm\u2026 I don\u2019t have a great software or a Macbook, how should I supposed to edit it? Use every video editing software you have, even if is Windows Movie Maker. All you need is to add some text, music and cut little parts of the video that you don\u2019t like or the bloopers. So for the Windows Movie Maker is more than enough. \nAnd now after you edited and saved the video, upload it to Youtube and don\u2019t forget to share it to social media. For bloggers \nFor bloggers can be a little easier working on a budget. Of course buying a site domain and a theme for your blog can be expensive, but you don\u2019t have to do it. Just create a WordPress account and start writing, but let\u2019s take it step by step: Sign up to a blogging platform Choose your blog\u2019s name Choose from the free themes Change the colors and customize the theme.

I'm so ashamed of the quite awful comments people who've never met the poor girl have made. Why can't we just enjoy the show for the show? To me, she comes across as a really lovely lady, clearly desperately trying to be as real as she can to show she means no harm at all. I really don't know what she can do - if she cries they say its fake, if she laughs, shes fake, if judges mention the recent death of her mum, she's somehow to blame. Hell, if she DANCES well, its because of having learned 3 steps as a kid, if she DANCES badly she leaves - what exactly did she DO to these horrible people (look at the list of names below my post) to cause them to say such horrible things? Look at that one below: \"Jennifer Coombes \u00b7 Our Lady's College Greenhills She needs to stop using the fact her mum has died for sympathy votes!\" - I mean honestly, how disgusting and distasteful? Now there is someone who should be picked up by the media and bullied - brought out in the public and shown for the nasty little piece of work they are. I'm with a couple of other people in the comments - I find myself just enjoying the show - a rare bit of loveliness in an awful world packed full of Jennifer Coombes', but I never actually voted in these things. I am honestly going to go out of my way to vote for Alexandra. Not just because she's been bullied senseless but actually because shes the one I really look forward to watching dance - giving that whole energy and feeling into what shes doing. I doubt Alexandra reads any of this any more but if she did, I really really hope she sees that the intelligent minority who mean something in the world think shes amazing, talented beyond belief and her mum would be SO proud.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:17.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d2a701f2e5a2968f573eec41bd4a8a7f6fae7ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZmXnKw2etcrK45EPxIxrkkz", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "/balt/", "title_full": "/int/ - /balt/ - International - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 149, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.07, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d020099e39c106cdbc2254c16523a1f0d5e28c5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZmXnKw2etcrK_Uwm_SdqFm.yF1hnMzb1NA-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>82715744\nIt's ok to be shy anon.\nJust go with the flow", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:17.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b5351bcfa2607aaa7e83f08f13a7c50781922a53", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPJfRaFQuzYnATy633_L2pqkqk2C.nqRgV0A1u5KxaHHVfbPk3NT8pwYbc7g1mCDeZLTzyvDIEp_uUwDNyGm4A9LUDaPwOdE9gTg4d.FnP7yx0v7NsjcVPMrPHfQMjdTO0VC6enSfmfuAipkdFmbnI7IEd0liKdzghXoy4RMR2fResMorAbh2TIz_9OAbeZ.DDzxZ8yZ.jb5iRFmy6P96F6TKpJsSZfMK9OfPUspVTxCX.zc9fjH4CZg--", "site_full": "www.military-technologies.net", "site": "military-technologies.net", "site_section": "http://www.military-technologies.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["table_tennis_ping_pong", "financial_news", "finance", "sports"], "section_title": "MilTech", "title": "Preclinical Tomography System China Market: (Bruker, SEDECAL, MR Solutions, Scanco Medical, PerkinElmer) Trends, Drivers, Strategies, Segmentation, Application, Key Players & Forecast to 2022", "title_full": "Preclinical Tomography System China Market: (Bruker, SEDECAL, MR Solutions, Scanco Medical, PerkinElmer) Trends, Drivers, Strategies, Segmentation, Application, Key Players & Forecast to 2022", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b5351bcfa2607aaa7e83f08f13a7c50781922a53", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPJfRaFQuzYnATy633_L2pqkqk2C.nqRgV0A1u5KxaHHVfbPk3NT8pwYbc7g1mCDeZLTzyvDIEp_uUwDNyGm4A9LUDaPwOdE9gTg4d.FnP7yx0v7NsjcVPMrPHfQMjdTO0VC6enSfmfuAipkdFmbnI7IEd0liKdzghXoy4RMR2fResMorAbh2TIz_9OAbeZ.DDzxZ8yZ.jb5iRFmy6P96F6TKpJsSZfMK9OfPUspVTxCX.zc9fjH4CZg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Craig Francis", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Preclinical Tomography System China Market: (Bruker, SEDECAL, MR Solutions, Scanco Medical, PerkinElmer) Trends, Drivers, Strategies, Segmentation, Application, Key Players & Forecast to 2022", "text": "Get Customization in the Report, Enquire Now @ https://www.htfmarketreport.com/enquiry-before-buy/830457-china-preclinical-tomography-system-market-by-manufacturers-regions \nThere are 18 Chapters to deeply display the China Preclinical Tomography System market. \nChapter 1, to describe Preclinical Tomography System Introduction, product type and application, market overview, market analysis by Region (province), market opportunities, market risk, market driving force;

The application was refused by Stafford Borough Council after great pressure from locals, the general public, animal rights and animal welfare organisations, local parish councils, Staffordshire County Council, Environmental Health and the Highways Agency, to name but a few. \nUnfortunately, the applicants have now appealed to the secretary of state following the refusal. This means the application and the decision will be reviewed by an independent inspector, who will look at the case and either agree with or overturn the decision. \nWe simply cannot allow this decision to be overturned. Allowing a rabbit battery farm will represent such a huge backwards step for farm animals in the UK. The barbaric and outdated practice of farming animals in cages has no place in the 21st century, and it should simply not be allowed to come into fruition. Barren battery farming severely restricts the natural behaviour of rabbits. They are unable to hop, run, stretch out, stand on their hind legs (periscope), binky, or even turn around. This is severely detrimental to both the mental and physical well-being of the rabbit, and can lead to many skeletal issues, splay leg, sore hocks or the development of stereotypical behaviours such as excessive grooming and repetitive gnawing of the cage bars. There will be nothing for them to do and nowhere for them to hide. Suffering in European rabbit battery farms has been widely documented, and we do not believe it has any place in modern society. \nPlease, reject the appeal!
