He never donned the garnet and gold as a player, but he has managed to one-up that goal. Taggart was introduced as the 11th head coach in Florida State history Wednesday, returning to the state after one season at Oregon. The 41-year old Bradenton, Florida, native coached at South Florida from 2013 to 2016 before taking the Ducks job. The news conference capped a hectic two weeks at Florida State that included Jimbo Fisher resigning last Friday to accept the opening at Texas A&M. \u201cGuess I wasn\u2019t good enough to get a scholarship to play here,\u201d quipped Taggart, who played and later coached at Western Kentucky. \u201cNo matter where I went, I rooted for the Seminoles. Until I went to South Florida. That was the first time I had to root against the Seminoles. \u201cPeople say blood is thicker than water. Not in my household. We\u2019re playing the Seminoles, and my brother, die-hard \u2019Nole fan, was talking about the game and said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, bro, I love you. But I can\u2019t go against my \u2019Noles.\u2019 That\u2019s just how it was.\u201d It was an emotional news conference for Taggart, who fought back tears when he talked about returning home and cheering for FSU stars Deion Sanders, Charlie Ward and Derrick Brooks when he was growing up. Three days after Fisher resigned, Taggart met with Florida State president John Thrasher, athletic director Stan Wilcox and board of trustees member Ed Burr on Monday in Scottsdale, Arizona. After weighing the offer overnight, Taggart accepted on Tuesday and informed his players at Oregon. Taggart said he appreciated Oregon athletic director Rob Mullens for giving him his first chance at a Power Five job, but he added that the chance to coach at the school he has followed since childhood was too good to pass up. \u201cI know I let him down, and I\u2019m sorry. The timing was probably not right, but it is never right,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cThis one chance was perfect. To be closer to family and coach in a Power Five and an opportunity to win a national championship are personal goals.\u201d Taggart will earn $30 million over six years. Florida State will also pay the remaining $1.37 million he still owes South Florida and the $3 million owed to Oregon as part of buyouts of his previous contracts. Taggart has a 47-50 career record, including 7-5 at \u00adOregon this season. He has a reputation of rebuilding Western Kentucky, USF and Oregon, but he views coming to Florida State as more of a realignment effort. 18945395 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "taggart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "willie taggart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joe reedy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john thrasher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed burr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimbo fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deion sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stan wilcox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob mullens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derrick brooks", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "florida state", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fsu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "texas a&m", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "power five", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seminoles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ducks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fla.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tallahassee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bradenton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scottsdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u00adoregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:41.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51f324b17abe70b76e6820485f63628b6e30d032", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950Kd2SI3sDyOm1", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp;

Top Five Wednesday was created by gingerreadslainey and is now hosted by Thoughts on Tomes ! Visit the Goodreads group if you\u2019re interested in joining! This week\u2019s topic is:\nDecember 6th \u2013 Bookish Things You\u2019re a Grinch About \nSince being a grinch is a funny thing, try not to make this serious topics that make you angry (like lack of diversity or abusive relationships in fiction, etc) as this is supposed to be more of a petty bookish things you hate. This can be stuff about covers, dumb tropes, etc. Have fun with it. Thankfully I read the description first, because I already had a bunch of serious topics in mind. So today, I am going to talk about some petty bookish things I hate, but try not to repeat things I have said in previous posts, like cover changes and movie tie-in book covers.\n1. real people on book covers Take the cover of The Brightsiders by Jen Wilde, for example. I love that the colours of the bisexual flag were used, but I\u2019m really not a fan of this cover. I just don\u2019t like real people on covers, okay?! There are some exceptions (like Tyler Johnson Was Here ) but bad covers are a dealbreaker for me. I\u2019m not sure yet whether I\u2019ll buy a physical copy, even though I am dying to read this book once it\u2019s released.\n2. overused tropes Most tropes can be very interesting (like the missing princess, the chosen one, etc.) but my problem is that they are so overused, it has made a lot of Young Adult fantasy series incredibly predictable. When a missing princess is mentioned, it\u2019s not that hard to figure out that our protagonist \u2013 who happens to be an orphan \u2013 is the one they\u2019re talking about.\nLike I said, those tropes aren\u2019t bad, but they\u2019re predictable. And more often than not, they\u2019re only revealed towards the end of the book, whereas the reader knew all along. And then you have to read the rest of the series to discover the aftermath of that reveal\u2026 meh, I just don\u2019t have the patience to read books like that anymore.\n3. disappointing conclusion I am very difficult when it comes to the end of a book series. I want some heartbreak, but I don\u2019t want it to be predictable (e.g. Crooked Kingdom ). I want things that were mentioned earlier on in the series to be addressed (e.g. The Raven King failed doing that). It\u2019s just incredibly disappointing when you invest a lot of your time in something, and the finale is a let-down.\nYes, I do realise that finales must be incredibly difficult to write. But as a reader, I can\u2019t say many final instalments have really satisfied me. Perhaps that\u2019s why I prefer to read standalones these days.\n4. overhyped books EVERYWHERE When looking for bookish merch, when asking for recommendations, when checking out book awards, etc. the same books tend to pop up each time. I sometimes feel very disconnect from the Bookstagram community in particular, because my reading tastes are completely different. It\u2019s so tiring that after so many years, the same book series are still shoved down your throat, just because the authors can\u2019t seem to put an end to it.\nAdditionally, I wish the community talked more about books that aren\u2019t Young Adult fantasy series. Some readers e.g. refuse to read The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas because they don\u2019t like to read contemporaries. Well, that\u2019s fair I guess, but if you only read those overhyped YA fantasies, you are missing out on a lot of great things.\n5. books with promising starts that go downhill Name something more disappointing than picking up a book thinking it\u2019s going to be a 5 star read, only to end up hating it. Why do bad things happen to good people?! I\u2019m just kidding, but it\u2019s still incredibly frustrating.\nSo these are some bookish things I\u2019m a Grinch about. Honestly, I could\u2019ve added many more things to this list, but I tried to keep it as light as possible \nWhat are some bookish things you are a Grinch about?

In Japan a deep geological repository is planned, which is a receptacle buried deep underground. However, nobody wants to have such thing in their community. That is why a deep geological repository is still not available in Japan. Right now, for the time being, radioactive wastes are stored in a village called Rokkasho, Aomori.\n2Nobody wants a nuclear power plant in their neighborhood. Therefore, the government decided to give monetary rewards to the communities that welcome nuclear power plants. These communities are usually with aging population and little money. This reward system itself is often criticized.

Franken said he will resign from the Senate in coming weeks following a wave of sexual misconduct allegations and a collapse of support from his Democratic colleagues, a swift political fall for a once-rising Democratic star. Senate TV via AP) Combative Franken quits, points to GOP tolerance of Trump By ALAN FRAM Associated Press December 07, 2017 06:27 PM UPDATED 4 MINUTES AGO WASHINGTON \nSen. Al Franken, a rising political star only weeks ago, reluctantly announced Thursday he's resigning from Congress, succumbing to a torrent of sexual harassment allegations and evaporating support from fellow Democrats. But he fired a defiant parting shot at President Donald Trump and other Republicans he said have survived much worse accusations. \n\"I of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party,\" Franken said. \nThe 66-year-old Minnesotan, a former \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian who made a successful leap to liberal U.S. senator, announced his decision in a subdued Senate chamber three weeks after the first accusations of sexual misconduct emerged but just a day after most of his Democratic colleagues proclaimed he had to go. His remarks underscored the bitterness many in the party feel toward a GOP that they say has made a political calculation to tolerate Trump and Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore, who've both been accused of sexual assaults that they've denied. \nIn largely unapologetic remarks that lasted 11 minutes, Franken said \"all women deserve to be heard\" but asserted that some accusations against him were untrue. He called himself \"a champion of women\" during his Senate career who fought to improve people's lives. Never miss a local story.

SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"Even on the worst day of my political life, I feel like it's all been worth it,\" he said. \nFranken's departure, which he said would occur in \"coming weeks,\" made him the latest figure from politics, journalism and the arts to be toppled since October. That's when the first articles appeared revealing sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood titan Harvey Weinstein and energizing the #MeToo movement in which women have named men they say abused or harassed them. \nDemocratic Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton will name a temporary successor, who will serve until a special election next November. \nFranken's comments appended a melancholy coda to the political career of the one-time TV funnyman who became one of his party's most popular and bellicose liberals. \nJust two days earlier, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a civil rights hero who'd been the House's longest-serving current member, resigned after facing sexual harassment allegations of his own. The two departures underscored the party's determination to show no tolerance for such behavior, a strategy that can bring stunningly fast conclusions to political careers but that party leaders believe could give them high moral ground on a subject that's shown no sign of fading. \nOn a 2005 audio tape released shortly before last year's presidential election, Trump is heard talking about grabbing women, and several women accused him of sexual assaults. Women in Alabama have accused Moore of unwanted sexual contact and pursuing romantic relationships when they were teenagers and he was in his thirties during the 1970s. \nAsked about Franken's comment about him on Thursday, Trump merely replied, \"I didn't hear it, sorry.\" \nAt least eight women had accused Franken of inappropriate sexual behavior. Until this week, he'd said he'd remain in the Senate and cooperate with an investigation into his behavior. \nThe breaking point came Wednesday, when a former Democratic congressional aide said he forcibly tried to kiss her in 2006, an accusation he denied. Hours later, another woman said he'd inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. \nThe accusations started last month when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. She also released a photo of him with his hands at her breasts as she napped aboard a military plane. \nOn Thursday, Franken walked to the Senate chamber shortly before noon, hand-in-hand with his wife of 35 years, Franni. As he spoke, members of his family watched from the visitors' gallery, some sobbing. Franken said that thanks to them, \"I'm going to be just fine.\" Related stories from The Sun News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeann tweeden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruben kihuen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy klobuchar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex brandon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota state fair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "d-minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-nev.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington  minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:41.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ca18e106469a61b04bf8d7e6785118c71a47194", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf7zAALQ0ASmD1Jt5_H1V8Rpc_rj6p9Mp6Om9rjK2XIXtuM5xN4yoMosFKA4DJtFI0dhfxT2eQQgLg--", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Alla-Hotell-I-Toronto.d178314.Reseguide-Stad-Alla-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Alla hotell i Toronto", "title": "Plaza Hotel", "title_full": "Toronto Plaza Hotel (Toronto, Kanada) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-10-15T03:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "310adfcbf57501b8dfed8c731ec8ad1df0d4b939", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf7zAALQ0ASmD1Jt5_H1V8Rpc_rj6p9Mp6Om9rjK2XIXtuM5xN4yoMosFKA4DJtFI0e7Rk9SDDIG16S_G459HveqbBG1f3p2r2JhM55J.wib5A--", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-27T22:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hotel felt unclean, Not well kept, Needed updates.

They could be follow-ups on restaurant reservations, hotel accommodations, or purchases from online shops. Whatever they're about, all of them can make the holiday rush difficult to handle.\n\nTo make things worse, receiving calls from cranky customers during the holidays is unavoidable. Customers may complain about an item that ran out of stock, shipping delays, or system glitches. Blunders like this often happen during the holidays when everyone's trying to cope with surging consumer demands. \n\nIt's important for customer support agents to be able to handle angry customers at a time when sales are skyrocketing. So, how do you effectively handle them? Here are three essential tips you should bear in mind.\n\n1.   Patience is your strongest weapon. \nWorking in the customer service industry requires dealing with irate callers, especially those who shout and throw shade at the agent when something isn't going their way. While such customers may be unreasonable, being at the frontline leaves you the task of keeping customers happy and addressing their complaints. It may sound unfair, but failing to appease customers will result not only in further frustration but also in unfinished transactions. \nOne useful technique when dealing with angry customers is to focus on the problem. Allow yourself to have a better view of the situation to have a deeper understanding of where the customer's coming from. That way, you'll never have to deal with angry customers. Instead, you'll focus more on the problem that needs resolving.\n\n2.   Look for effective solutions quickly. \nOnce you understand the customer\u2019s real concern, look for a concrete answer to the problem. Offer a solution that you think will best guarantee customer satisfaction. Also, always fix the issue as soon as possible to avoid further complications. To do this, you may consult your product knowledge bank. It's also worth identifying the most common problems customers encounter during the holidays so you can prepare accurate responses accordingly.\nIf expediting the process isn't possible, assure the customer that you're trying your best to come up with a fitting solution. Otherwise, ask the customer how they want the problem solved. The point is, you must remember not to leave customers unhappy with your service. Because by then, they might call it quits.\n\n3.   Win your customer through empathy. \nOne thing that creates a bad impression among customers is a scripted conversation. While some call centers may prescribe a script for agents to follow, this doesn't mean you should only read what\u2019s written in the paper.\nBe genuine when conversing with customers. You may follow a script, but only use it as a guide for the proper flow of the call. Let them know that you care about their situation, and that you sincerely understand how it affects them. Also remember to ask them if there\u2019s anything else you can do after their concern has been resolved. \n \nTruth be told, things are easier said than done, but you must be prepared to handle cranky customers during the holiday season. Treat this as an opportunity to represent your brand in the best way possible, as well as the outsourcing company you're working for. At the end of the day, nothing beats a well-accomplished job and a satisfied customer who'd surely come back for your service.  \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:42.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51f324b17abe70b76e6820485f63628b6e30d032", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950Kd2SI3sDyOm1", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender - 4chan", "title": "/ftmg/ - female to male general", "title_full": "/lgbt/ - /ftmg/ - female to male general - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-02T16:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 248, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.073, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c8dca2fb7f4e05a31fa21424277155e882f6386b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtMOgPxW950KRaW7KJgGW5S_8uWiGuRtlo-", "ord_in_thread": 238, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T05:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9248827\n>>9248677\nNot that anon but knew someone just like the friend he's describing. Was normal and fine with being female (had no dysphoria or anything) until she discovered tumblr and became obsessed with being a korean gay twink and wanted more oppression points. Was a decently good-looking girl beforehand and then she cut her hair, dyed it bright pink, declared herself a \"non-binary demiboy\" and rushed into transitioning. Eight months of T later and she'd started to get actual gender dysphoria from being seen as and looking male (yes, she literally gave herself gender dysphoria lol) and realised that being a man wasn't all \"male privilege\" and having everything handed to you like tumblr had told her. Now she's detransitioned and a couple of years have passed but she's still stuck with a deep voice, masculine features, is probably permanently sterile, and makes a very honnish ugly girl. Moral of the story: transitioning isn't to be taken lightly and you should be 100% it's what you need before jumping into it and should never ever do it on a whim. Sure, it's turned out great for me but everyone isn't so lucky.

U.S. health officials are beginning a huge study to compare traditional mammograms with 3-D versions, to see if the newer choice might really improve screening for breast cancer. Montefiore Health System via AP) A better mammogram? Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer December 07, 2017 03:55 AM UPDATED 1 MINUTE AGO WASHINGTON \nA better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray \u2014 and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat \u2014 overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms \u2014 known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" \u2014 with standard two-dimensional digital mammography.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2014 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2014 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2014 that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tova koenigs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "otis brawley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tova koenigsberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etta pisano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccaskill-stevens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "worta mccaskill-stevens", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "montefiore health system", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mobile & apps in", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "u.s. preventive services task force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montefiore einstein center for cancer care", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american cancer society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beth israel deaconess medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american college of radiology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national cancer institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauran neergaard ap medical", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:43.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "57549b0335b985c1507144747dd3ed415199d378", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvxjMKbALpBCAmJMqbecfCclIdYfdeqLEt7CvkUjDvJBfQ--", "site_full": "forums.warframe.com", "site": "warframe.com", "site_section": "https://forums.warframe.com/forum/36-general-discussion/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "General Discussion - Warframe Forums", "title": "Hunting the huntress", "title_full": "Hunting the huntress - General Discussion - Warframe Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T13:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://content.invisioncic.com/Mwarframe/monthly_2017_07/warframe_share.png.bec3c989c4517e865df9b45a300e63e0.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7793, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "30b9215e59eca79ec0e217c874e51166bf8391c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvxjMKbALpBCAmJMqbecfCclIdYfdeqLEt4Rst1KQbKCJO8_l0RaU09J", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Cifrer", "published": "2017-12-07T15:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I used Ash with a Shade.

A replacement Supersport rider hasn\u2019t been announced. Multi-time Superbike champ Josh Hayes has moved to a new role as a Yamaha Factory Racing Brand Ambassador and bLU cRU Rider Coach. \nYamaha and Graves Motorsport are introducing a new Graves/Yamaha YZF-R3 Support Program for riders competing in MotoAmerica\u2019s new 2018 Junior Cup Championship. Two levels of race-prepped R3 motorcycles are on offer, which include Graves Motorsports components and ongoing technical support from Graves and YMUS.

Each year, it\u2019s like a dream come true for me to be able to continue with this great family as their rider on the awesome R6. For me, racing in the MotoAmerica Supersport Championship again, I think, will be best for my continuing development as a rider. We made a lot of mistakes last year, so, for 2018, I\u2019m extremely determined to fix those, have a great season, and win back the #1 plate on my R6. I feel like I\u2019ve got some unfinished business in this class. I want to get that taken care of first, and then set my sights on the next goal in my racing career.\u201d \nGraves/Yamaha YZF-R3 Support Program For 2018 MotoAmerica Junior Cup \nGraves Motorsports, who is beginning its third decade as a partner with Yamaha Factory Racing, is offering, in cooperation with YMUS, two levels of race-prepped R3 motorcycles, both of which include Graves Motorsports components and ongoing technical support from Graves and YMUS, for competing in the 2018 MotoAmerica Junior Cup Championship. \nIn addition, Yamaha Factory Racing Brand Ambassador and bLU cRU Rider Coach Josh Hayes will serve as a mentor for Graves/Yamaha R3 Support Program riders competing in the 2018 MotoAmerica Junior Cup. \nCommenting on the program, Chuck Graves, president of Graves Motorsports said, \u201cWhat a great way to begin our 21st year of working with Yamaha Factory Racing! With this Graves/Yamaha R3 Support Program, we\u2019re helping to develop the grass roots of motorcycle road racing here in the U.S., and also in the MotoAmerica AMA/FIM North American Road Racing Championship. Ever since Yamaha launched the R3 a couple of years ago, we\u2019ve been continually developing more and more race-ready parts for the bike. It\u2019s an excellent motorcycle on which riders can develop their riding and racing skills, and we\u2019re really looking forward to the inaugural season of the MotoAmerica Junior Cup Championship. Yamaha fans and Yamaha racers\u2019 families now have another Championship in which they can cheer on Yamaha bLU cRU riders.\u201d \nFor more details about the Graves/Yamaha R3 Support Program, call Graves Motorsports at 800-867-6480, extension 800, or send an email to sales@gravesport.com \nFor more Yamaha racing news, results, photos, and videos, visit http:// www.YamahaMotorsports.com/Racing \nAlso, check out \u201cYamahaMotorUSA\u201d on your favorite social media site.

Frei will return to the scene of his greatest professional moment Saturday when the Sounders face Toronto in the championship match trying to become the fourth team in Major League Soccer history to win consecutive league titles. A year ago, Frei made one of the most stunning saves in the history of MLS championship matches, changing directions and leaping in desperation to get his left hand on Jozy Altidore\u2019s attempted header in extra time that seemed destined for the top corner of the goal. It was the save Seattle needed to get to penalty kicks, in which Frei made another save on Michael Bradley and Roman Torres eventually won the title for the Sounders with his made penalty in the sixth round. But it was the save on Altidore that everyone remembers and is certain to be shown repeatedly prior to Saturday\u2019s rematch. \u201cI\u2019m going to try and do the same thing as last year and, at some point, really zone out you guys and social media and just focus on the game,\u201d Frei said. While last year\u2019s game will get a lot of the attention this week, it is the defensive performance in this year\u2019s playoff run that deserves the focus. Seattle has yet to allow a goal in four postseason games. The Sounders have not allowed a goal since a 2-0 loss to Philadelphia on Oct. 1. That is a span of six full games since a shot got past Frei or backup Tyler Miller. Miller started the first leg of the West finals against Houston while Frei was slowed by a leg injury. In the postseason, the Sounders have not allowed a goal since the first leg of the 2016 West finals, the longest postseason shutout streak in MLS history. \u201cIt builds confidence throughout the squad when you have someone like Stef in goal,\u201d Seattle forward Will Bruin said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make a big save when needed.\u201d For Frei, the final in Toronto will be the conclusion of nearly two nonstop seasons of soccer. It started in February 2016 when Seattle opened its training camp. Between the length of last year\u2019s MLS season and being called into the U.S. national team training camp last January, Frei had only a few weeks of rest in between last year\u2019s championship match and the start of preparations for this season. But this has arguably been his finest season in MLS. Frei led the league with 13 shutouts in the regular season. In a sign of how much Seattle has improved defensively, he was forced to save just 84 shots in the regular season, the fewest of his four seasons with Seattle. Frei made it a point to appreciate the atmosphere and celebration after Seattle beat Houston to clinch the Western Conference title last week. A year ago, all Seattle celebrations took place away from home. When the final whistle blew last Thursday, Frei climbed on the crossbar of his goal in front of Seattle\u2019s most rabid supporters and pumped his fists in celebration. While the championship match will again be in Toronto, at least part of this run was shared with the fans at home. \u201cIt was awesome. I wish I could have given everybody in the stadium a hug,\u201d Frei said. \u201cWe were so fortunate to get on that run last year and capture two trophies, but unfortunately both of them were away from home. So this last weekend when we had a chance to win one at home was amazing.\u201d 18934292 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stefan frei", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "frei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "torres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jozy altidore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stef", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will bruin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael bradley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "altidore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler miller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "major league soccer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sounders", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:44.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2ab6058353c901367d64c5b3d9f702665b81d29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtbLXzObJGQph6t_sAs4nVA", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender - 4chan", "title": "why are there so many polyfags here? why is everyo", "title_full": "/lgbt/ - why are there so many polyfags here? why is everyo - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T12:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 26, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.064, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf84a7351ccb25238a3d1ea39ba13ce6c0617ffc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtbLXzObJGQpnuxtJKd3enW11G4pB99ZbA-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9250923\nOh, so you're still repressing.
