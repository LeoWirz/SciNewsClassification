Board Game: 18MEX [Average Rating:7.65 Overall Rank: 2873 ] The Mirror United StatesNew York I played a three player game of 18MEX this weekend for the first time against two relatively experienced players, and trounced them. I'll let one of the others describe how that went down. Needless to say, I'm happy to be in training for 1841. Lol, like I'll ever play an 18xx with 5 people at the same time.

Board Game: Greed Incorporated [Average Rating:7.02 Overall Rank: 1494 ] Brian SomervilleMassachusetts I've had this sitting around for a couple of years (thanks, John Rogers !), and played about a half game early on, but it hadn't hit the table since.Last night it got played by 4 people in about 3.5 hours after rules teaching. Two opponents cashed out of a first company pretty early, ~turn 3, and got out to an early lead, but the result was that I was CEOing 3 companies, which I was able to use to bleed two of them dry after massive profits on turn 5, and the 3rd on turns 6 and 7.I ended up with the last 3 gold-frame rewards and the victory. It's plausible that more careful arithmetic by my RHO might have forced a tiebreaker by making us split the last two turns' gold and silver rewards.The game is definitely interesting, and I'm pretty sure it's a good game on top of that. I'm less sure that it's a game I enjoy - it seems that the \"right\" way to play it is very careful analysis of negotiations, and that's a very very slow process. I'd cheerfully play it a few more times soon to be sure.

It includes a few McGuffins - mail routes, a long distance run to Mongolia where you count up how many spots you \u201ccan\u201d reach to the off-board location, etc. He map consists of expensive terrain costs almost covering the entire board. This is mitigated by the mail routes which pay half the starting and ending cities value into the companies treasury for a single train. Fun game, still has the feel of 1830, except longer (17,000 bank). I was out of the game after the 6\u2019s broke and cruised to a 4th out of 5. One player went with a brown strategy which might have paid out if we would have had another set of ORs. Good change of pace from 1830 with the same feel.

[ Community Rules ] Edited 4. Board Game: Lisboa [Average Rating:8.30 Overall Rank: 246 ] Jake Blomquist ColumbusOhio Got a three player game of this in Wednesday night. I won with a score in the 140s, both of my opponents ended in the 110s.My starting church tile gave me a discount of one public official when I opened a public building, so I decided to try opening a lot of public buildings. Both of my opponents early on got a church tile and a treasury card that increased the money they got for selling a particular good, so they both had goods selling at $9 each early on. So I picked up a church tile that gave me two extra points whenever one of my ships set sail and also two extra points per ship at end game, and I got an early level one ship. One of my opponents got the other level one ship, and so they both tried to avoid shipping with me when they could to prevent those points. By the end of the game both of us with the level one ships got level three ships as well, no one took any twos or fours. I think only once did another player fill one of my ships, but I still got about 12 points from that church tile.It took us a decent amount of time to get to the mid-game reset (though none of the card stacks were empty before the player to my right got two sets of rubble, and I got my second set the first action of the second phase). And after that I was hitting public buildings pretty often and so for a little while it looked like the game would be ending relatively early. But once I was one blue cube short of four sets I started slowing down because there was more I wanted to get done. It was definitely nice having control of when the game was ending. I ended with four rubble sets to three to two, and we emptied maybe one pile of cards but another round and we may well have emptied three and triggered the end that way.One player built a lot of pink stores in the five point column, hoping to capitalize on having the high sell value for pinks, but then he only produced twice. I think there were a total of five productions done in our game. I built a total of three stores, a blue, a brown, and a gold. There wasn't a ton of building in this game and because it was fairly focused, the worst any of my stores did was second place in the majority scoring at the end, which was nice. And I believe they each scored either 8 or 9 points from public buildings. There were enough public buildings that it was rare for a store to not score at least reasonably well.I ended up never tucking a treasury card, just because it never quite seemed ideal. I think a total of three got tucked all game (the two +$2 ones already mentioned, and one that made the blue cubes free for building stores). I had one that gave me an additional two public official discount in my hand, but by the time I got it I only had one more public building I wanted to build, enough officials already out, and some nobility cards with really strong immediate effects for when I wanted to do two minor actions that it wasn't worth it.The church track was a bit weird, with some starts and stops. Better than our last game where we got to a point with three church tiles no one wanted relatively early and then it just never moved after that. I ended up with four church tiles at one point, so I was done taking that action until we got the chance to trade them in, which finally happened fairly late. I traded in two for three points each (the starting one with the public officials discount, and one that gave me a two influence discount when visiting the king, another thing that made it easier for me to open so many public buildings), and I think everyone else gave up all of theirs at that point since it was pretty late.I think where I won the game was in the decree difference. I managed to get eight of them, and they all worked really well for what I was doing. I had a point for leftover blue goods, a point per blue rubble, and a point per red rubble which were each worth four to me, five points for having the most completed blueprints and five points for most decrees which both scored, and two points per green blueprint, two points per green public building in the north, and one point per two officials on completed blueprints which were each worth six. I think each of my opponents had maybe four decrees and scored a bit over ten each for them, so they weren't able to take as good ones as I did.I think our group tends to prioritize getting going early and worry about points later, and previously the marquis was the least visited of the main three. And the other two players in particular I think approached this game a bit more like an engine builder than they should have, thinking they were going to build a bunch of stores and produce more. This plus me getting my sets done meant I was able to get a big lead on decrees which I think was basically the difference in our scores.We also were letting each other follow more often, I remember in the past we'd been much more hesitant to visit a noble if other people (especially if at least two other people) had the appropriate king's favor. And I think we were doing it right this game, where as long as you make sure you can make good use of the secondary action it's worth it. Especially because the treasury was consistently so high.I like this game a lot. I really enjoy the central card-play mechanism as well as the way that the various systems of the game feel so interconnected. It's also really cool how different two games of this can be, just with stuff like where the treasury sits and how much the clergy moves. And the way the players determine what scores via the public buildings is a really cool twist to try to figure out.But I still think Kanban is the better game for me. Every time I've played this it just felt like I never quite had that moment of awe I get with my absolute favorite games, and I couldn't put my finger on why. On paper the game seems right up my alley, but one of the other players made an observation last night that made a lot of sense to me. The game is just more tactical than I prefer out of my absolute top tier favorites.It was really rare to plan more than a turn or so ahead too concretely since you might at any time get a follow action, the next card you can draw might be better than anything currently in your hand, or new decrees or church tiles might come out that you really want to go for. Or maybe you're waiting for the next public building to come out but the player who you're expecting to build the available one isn't in any particular rush. There are a lot of things about the game that encourage you to be opportunistic, but then for me just optimizing a single turn isn't as exciting as formulating a long term plan and getting a bunch of stuff to line up perfectly.I think the obvious comparisons are to Gallerist and Kanban, and in the latter you really have to be careful about the sequence of actions you take because they all lead into each other in a really clever way and they have to be performed fairly precisely. In this game there are multiple competing sequences like that, I particularly like how the build up to building a public building is done at the same place where you build a store, and the best way to build up for a store is to tuck a treasury card and/or sell goods on ships. So you do have to be thoughtful about these sequences, but there are so many other things you can be doing and there's a bit more freedom to set yourself up for one of these actions and then finish them whenever is convenient.Gallerist I feel is similar to Lisboa in this way, where you have a lot of freedom in when you want to actually finish off the big point sequence you started. And I wonder now if that's similarly because of the variable nature of the follow actions. But Gallerist also loses a bit on this one since I think the sequence to scoring is a bit more straightforward, whereas in Lisboa it requires dealing with two interacting systems.And to be clear, just because I'm not so happy about the way this game handles the following (I think that's a decent chunk of what makes it so tactical) I'm not opposed to this kind of player driven stuff. But when I think about the games that I really love for their interesting player interaction (Brass, CO_2, The Great Zimbabwe) they have methods for influencing and incentivising the behavior you want out of the other players and/or have bigger rewards for predicting and taking advantage of your opponents' plans, which is what makes their interaction work so brilliantly. Here it sort of just feels like you're waiting until your opponents inevitably do something you can capitalize on, which is less interesting than the above games in that regard while also increasing the level of tactics vs strategy in the game.And here is where I need to make it clear that I do really enjoy this game quite a bit. I think I may seem critical because Vital is my favorite designer and so the expectations are higher. I could easily have seen this game entering my top 10, and as it is it's almost certainly hovering in the teens somewhere. Which is really good.

Under a stampede of plague\r\nimmigration, deregulation, privatization, and\r\nglobalist bullshit. Australia saw its countryside\r\nraped, its cities fracture into third world\r\ncesspits, and wealthy parasites fatten in their\r\nwalled estates. These are the new lunatics:\r\nwell-bribed public officials droning about how\r\ndiversity is the best thing about Australia;\r\nscreeching faggots riddled with incurable\r\narse-infections; gibbering multicultural idiots,\r\nand subhuman locusts.\r\n\r\nThe genocidal anti-Australian agenda of multiculturalism\r\n\r\nWe are teaching our children that living in\r\nChinese-style \"Stack and Pack\" slums is the way of\r\nthe future - that we can't stop it happening\r\nbecause of multicultural dogma. This is\r\nsociological abuse and national cowardice. Yes,\r\nmulticulturalism is racist and genocidal. It is\r\nimportant for us as Australians to admit how\r\nfutile and destructive multiculturalism has been\r\nfor Australia. Even the majority of immigrants\r\nhate it intensely. Growth-mad politicians and\r\nmedia drones parrot the drivel that diversity is\r\nour strength. It is only the strength of those who\r\npush this tripe. It is the strength of profiteers\r\nseeking cheap labour, and of political, commercial\r\nand ethnic interests.\r\n\r\nSuppose your insane multicultural prayers aren't answered by your glorious globalist Moloch. What do you do then - sacrifice a white baby or two?\r\n\r\nUrban land and energy prices are high and rising.\r\nThe price of an average house in 1973 was 3.5\r\nyears of median wage, with the land about 30% of\r\nthe price, now it is 7.5 years of median wage, 8-9\r\nyears in some cities, with land 75% of the price.\r\nAustralia's globalist government reckons the\r\nanswer to environmental problems is higher prices\r\nof energy - not caring that Australia's economy\r\nwill go downhill because working class Australians\r\ncan't afford the new prices. We cannot find any\r\npractical way to disperse our overpopulation from\r\nthe worsening putrid cities, so we must STOP\r\npopulation growth in Australia. The growth mantra\r\nchanted by both major political parties is\r\nenvironmentally destructive.\r\n\r\nA globalist dark age based on multicultural hysteria\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the property racketeering\r\nindustry provides selective statistics to support\r\nthe property market Ponzi scheme and advantage\r\ntheir members, particularly developers. This is a\r\nmassive confidence trick on a whole nation. How\r\ndid the government address unaffordable housing,\r\nto ensure that hard working Aussies can secure\r\nbasic shelter? By giving home owners grants which\r\ndid nothing apart from line the pockets of real\r\nestate agents, property speculators and investors.\r\nThe sacred cow of mass immigration is part of some\r\ndeep and dark puzzle that confounds the experts,\r\nand is supposedly benefiting most existing\r\nAustralians, despite evidence that it isn't. The\r\nonly safe assumption is that we are heading for\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nHow imported scab labour breaks unions and drives down wages\r\n\r\nOne of the lines that pro-Asian multiculturalists\r\ntrot out, is that Australia is part of Asia.\r\nAustralia is not a part of Asia. I've never heard\r\nthese suckholes say Australian Aborigines are\r\nAsians. Australian society is a legacy of white\r\nEuropeans. Under globalist rule, human beings are\r\nto be concentrated into \"human settlement zones\"\r\n(Stalinist \"Stack and Pack\" slum cities). Those\r\nglobalists who exploit slaves and rape the earth\r\nmay live thousands of miles away from the areas\r\nthey destroy. We better not embrace the mangy old\r\npro-growth ethic that \"more is better\" - unless we\r\nare insane or suicidal. Yes, I know the \"Greens\"\r\nabandoned concerns about overpopulation some\r\ndecades ago, but we don't need to also be\r\nglobalist stooges.\r\n\r\nThe irrational belief that more imported scab labour is always better\r\n\r\nLike a drug addict who has forsaken proper\r\nnutrition for energy, the rotten new economy of\r\nreal estate growthism relies on an immigration fix\r\n(and birth incentives to a lesser degree) for\r\nenergy. There is every reason to be angry about\r\npopulation growth when it means struggling to live\r\nin putrid Chinese-style \"Stack and Pack\" slums\r\nthat displace communities and wildlife. It is hard\r\nto exaggerate just how awful this can be. Our\r\npathetic and corrupt nation, once a leader in so\r\nmany things, is reduced to supporting developers,\r\nspeculators, bankers and real estate Ponzi schemes\r\nwhile importing cheap scab labour. What does this\r\nsay about Australian values?\r\n\r\nThe multicultural horror club\r\n\r\nTo get past this dialogue of the deaf, let me\r\nstate what most would agree is a reasonable\r\nproposition about mass immigration: Every nation\r\nhas the right and the obligation to manage its\r\nimmigration to accord with its core values and\r\nneeds. An enormous surplus population of third\r\nworld misery will come to thee also, my awful\r\nlittle multicultural drones. Did you think your\r\narses were covered? It's a grim thought, that\r\nAustralia is a nation of lemmings and spineless\r\njellyfish. The globalists highjacked the political\r\nsystem, so there is no democracy. The average\r\ncitizen is no more than an economic share cropper\r\nthese days - if one can even find a paying job.\r\nIt's time to eat the rich. They shipped your jobs\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\nA national day of screeching multicultural hysteria\r\n\r\nIf Australians are racists because they reject\r\nmass immigration, then many third world nations\r\nmust be hate mongers and racist because their\r\nstrict immigration policies allow very little\r\nlegal immigration and tolerate no illegal\r\nimmigration. Aussies followed the smell of\r\nglobalist deceit. It led them to the stinking\r\ncorruptions of multiculturalism and plague\r\nimmigration. Everything there is stripped bare by\r\n\"reforms\" and \"free market\" forces. The great\r\nmulticultural plague immigration nightmare is\r\nthrusting Australian life into a downward slide\r\ntoward third world poverty, congestion and chaos.\r\nOnly morons would \"celebrate\" the miseries of\r\nsystemic poverty or environmental destruction.\r\n\r\nA globalist government and a bloated establishment you didn't elect\r\n\r\nFanatical devotion to national deconstruction\r\nunder multiculturalism, is the new globalist\r\nplague. Plague immigration and cultural diversity\r\nare major weapons and tools furthering this new\r\nsecular theology and infectious mental disease.\r\nUnder globalism, Aussies are working towards a\r\ngoal. That goal is their own replacement by\r\nimported scab labour. Australians have\r\nsubordinated all their citizenship rights to\r\ninimical alien agendas. Surrender is easier than\r\nconfrontation. Most immigrants don't focus on the\r\nwell-being of their new country any more than they\r\ncared about the well-being of their old third\r\nworld pesthole. So don't expect toxic immigration\r\nto enhance national solidarity any time soon.\r\n\r\nPreparing \"Stack and Pack\" slums for the third world's unwanted breeders\r\n\r\nAustralians no longer ask questions of a moral and\r\nethical nature about saving their own nation and\r\nits resources. That might anger the globalist\r\nbillionaires too much. The immoral \"dog eat dog\"\r\nstruggle must continue. I did not labour hard at\r\nanalyzing the train-wreck of Australian politics\r\nsimply to benefit the nongs. I don't care what\r\nhappens to the nongs. I write to inform those who\r\nmight help to avert a catastrophe while creating a\r\ntrue national democracy. The multicultural\r\n(homosexualized) weaklings must get over their\r\npolitical correctness and stop sucking on mass\r\nimmigration. Plague immigration policy is best\r\nwhen it only happens to some third world country\r\nfar away where we can't hear them scream.\r\n\r\nThe laughable vehemence of plague immigration policy\r\n\r\nThe entire political left buys into plague\r\nimmigration, year after relentless year, and\r\nunsurprisingly, they lose more and more. Notice\r\nwhat is never up for debate: The massive\r\ndisplacement of the Australian populace by mass\r\nimmigration. The world is catastrophically\r\noverpopulated, and moving the surplus population\r\nfixes nothing. Something has to change, and change\r\nmust start somewhere. Let's start it here, in\r\nAustralia. Stop plague immigration and the baby\r\nbonus. One great big, festering third world\r\npesthole Australia, with toxic immigration driven\r\nunaffordable housing making it carnival time for\r\nthe plague landlords. An overdose of globalism\r\nfrom spin merchants and breeding subhuman locusts.\r\n\r\nIt's a grim thought, that Australia must be culturally disintegrated so that the wealthy can greatly increase their unearned wealth\r\n\r\nThe globalist attempt to create a coffee-coloured\r\nmaster race in Australia is a form of racial\r\ngenocide. The claimed desirability and necessity\r\nfor the multicultural obliteration of Australians\r\nshows that whites cannot be tolerated. That\r\nglobalist stooges are so strangely desperate to\r\npush extreme and expensive \"projects\" onto the\r\nbacks of ordinary citizens should remind us to\r\nwonder for whose benefit we toil. Our tapeworm\r\n\"leaders\" no longer fear us - perhaps they should.\r\nThe overpopulation boosting Vatican acts behind\r\nthe scenes, through a relatively small number of\r\nAussies who give the Church their loyalty for\r\nreasons unrelated to religious practice, but\r\nrather for advancement, power and privilege.\r\n\r\nThe rapidly approaching globalist end-game\r\n\r\nInstead of abolishing the widespread poverty of\r\nAustralian citizens, our elected quislings chose\r\nto massively import ethnic breeders and cheap scab\r\nlabour. This was done to advantage Jewish\r\nbillionaires and other parasitic plutocratic\r\nfilth. China's one child policy does more to\r\nprotect the climate than the rest of the world\r\ncombined. Australia must stop further nett\r\nimmigration and enforce a two child policy for a\r\nstable population, with no religious group\r\nexempted. Eternal bondage to plague immigration is\r\nassured by the political establishment's vigorous\r\npolicy of real estate Ponzi scheme debt-bubble\r\ninflation. Only the wealthy benefit from the\r\ngrowth-fever that marks the end of a\r\ndisintegrating Australia.\r\n\r\nSo we find ourselves living in the plague immigration Ponzi scheme housing nightmare\r\n\r\nIf the immigration debate was framed in terms of\r\nresource depletion and infrastructure, people\r\nwould focus on the point that the nation is \"full\"\r\nin a social, economic and ecological sense. Never\r\nunderestimate human willingness to live the seven\r\ndeadly sins in varying degrees. Combine that with\r\nthe overriding instincts of self preservation, and\r\nthe need for procreation and human capacity for\r\ndestruction becomes and is boundless. Until the\r\nplague immigration pigeons come home to roost and\r\nshit on politicians or their estates, this dirty\r\ntravesty will continue. Nothing will be done to\r\ncurb plague immigration. Who asked for this shit\r\nin the first place?\r\n\r\nMost citizens don't want to know about the twisted minds of multicultural hypocrites\r\n\r\nUnaffordable housing, rising costs, wage\r\nrestraint, unemployment, endless job-seeking,\r\nrandom violence, unavailable medical and hospital\r\nservices, crowding and despair. This is globalism\r\noperating in Australia - a cosy nest for ethnic\r\ncuckoos. Globalists would like to teach citizens\r\nhow to toil long hours for less money, and how to\r\nlose cultural and material control over their own\r\ncountries. Using a plague immigration recipe for\r\noverpopulation, you too can cook your nation's\r\ngoose. The interwoven policies of deliberate\r\ntreason and pandemic immigration aim at the\r\nsubordination of Aussies and their interests to a\r\nglobalist pillage and conquest operation. Working\r\nclass desperation and social violence are just\r\nicing on the cake.\r\n\r\nCivilization was cut off at the knees by a political culture of bribery and corruption\r\n\r\nIn their quest to seize Australia's assets,\r\nglobalist chaos merchants tactically subverted the\r\nschools and universities - whereby plague\r\nimmigration suddenly became sacred, holy, exalted\r\n- no longer detrimental, destructive, deadly. The\r\nmulticultural confinement pods are opening. You\r\ncan feel the life giving national reality flooding\r\ninto the pods as the gases of globalist illusion\r\nare recycled back into the original bullshit of\r\ncultural diversity propaganda. Aussies are trapped\r\nin their globalist cities of terror. As national\r\nviability declines and plague immigration squeezes\r\neveryone, Aussies are clutching at straws and\r\nhanging on desperately. The \"level playing field\"\r\nis only level for gangsters.\r\n\r\nPay homage to your evil globalist masters\r\n\r\nWhile many have realized that unsustainable\r\npopulation growth in Australia is courting\r\ndisaster, there are those who have not.\r\nIdiotically, they argue we should continue our\r\nunsustainable population growth indefinitely -\r\nregardless of consequences. For decades, globalist\r\npoliticians and media drones refused to discuss\r\nbulk immigration and branded those who tried, as\r\nracist. If an election result swings on public\r\nrage at being deceived about mass immigration, we\r\nshall see them eat shit. Yes, we need to kill\r\nplague immigration. Only some parasite sucking on\r\nit or a complete fool would think otherwise. It is\r\neasy for the wealthy to be apologists for mass\r\nimmigration as they don't have to live with the\r\nrotten consequences.\r\n\r\nLabor expressed \"concerns\" about plague immigration, but that is all forgotten now, and the property rackets are firing-up again\r\n\r\nAfter years of multiculturalism, mass immigration\r\nand globalization, many aliens now seem to think\r\nthey have an unlimited right to criticize our\r\nsociety and its laws. We should deport them back\r\nto their dictatorships and third world pestholes.\r\nMany politicians are insane robots, running and\r\nfetching for rich property developers and other\r\nparasites. They have forgotten the \"no\" word, and\r\nrelentlessly clank ahead and over any public\r\nopposition. They obey their masters, and that's\r\nnot us. Mass immigration is neatly sandwiched\r\nbetween invasion and slavery. If the immigrants\r\nprosper, it is invasion; if they are kept down and\r\nexploited, it is slavery. Either way the local\r\ngangsters and landed gentry will profit while\r\nothers lose.\r\n\r\nAn unsustainable cargo-cult creates a truth famine\r\n\r\nIgnore the globalist propaganda about the great\r\nsocial harmony and \"vibrant\" cultural diversity\r\nclaimed for plague immigration. Just replace the\r\nbullshit with reality - it is all a swindle that\r\nwill leave Australians destitute in their own\r\ncountry. Plague immigration is a rapidly\r\ndepreciating liability. The sooner that Aussies\r\nditch it, the sooner they get their country back.\r\nGlobalist exploitation of this country and\r\ndispossesion by imported scab labour are dirty\r\nworms in the national apple. Do this: 1. Open a\r\nnew file in your PC. 2. Name it \"Plague\r\nImmigration\". 3. Send it to the Recycle Bin. 4.\r\nEmpty the Recycle Bin. 5. Your PC will ask: \"Do\r\nyou really want to get rid of Plague Immigration?\"\r\n6. Firmly Click \"Yes\" 7. Feel better?\r\n\r\nPlague immigration pushes our country ever deeper into ecological deficit\r\n\r\nThese gutless PC days, none dare to even allude\r\nthat restricting immigration can be part of open\r\ndebate. Billionaires have got our spineless\r\nleaders by the nuts, and they can squeeze hard!\r\nThe memory of an Australia for Australians is\r\nfading fast. Capitalism requires capital\r\nformation, yet plague immigration and its real\r\nestate Ponzi schemes cause huge debt-bubbles,\r\nrelentless capital destruction, the running down\r\nof natural systems and resource depletion. Nothing\r\nbut insane greed and error. The psychopathology of\r\nplague immigration displays no identifiable logic\r\nor philosophical coherence. The multicultural hate\r\nmonkeys are very malignant and act as major agents\r\nof ethnic subversion. How malignant is your\r\nmulticultural stupidity?\r\n\r\nOur elected quislings fudged and defamed their own commissioned report (Long-Term Physical Implications of Net Overseas Migration)\r\n\r\nGlobalist economists argue that most Aussies will\r\nhave to accept lower living standards as a\r\nprivileged group of people enjoy the benefits of\r\ndownward pressure on wages created by high\r\nimmigration, which in turn keeps house prices and\r\nrents rising. If you allow corrupt rezoning scams\r\nto continue, you should prepare for the landed\r\ngentry and property pimps calling for more\r\nimported scab labour and the proliferation of\r\nChinese-style \"Stack and Pack\" slums in your\r\nsuburb. Ritual cruelty toward animals is an\r\nintegral part of many cultures we stupidly import.\r\nHysteria, insane violence, gang-rape and general\r\nbrutality are mere threads in the blood-soaked\r\nmulticultural tapestry of the stone-age cultures\r\nwe now coddle.\r\n\r\nLiberal or Labor: Choosing crap or shit\r\n\r\nThe new paradigm of globalist corporate state\r\npower, coupled with its bizarre ideology of\r\nlimitless progress and impossible happiness\r\nthrough toxic immigration and multiculturalism,\r\nhas turned whole nations into monsters and zombie\r\nstates. Multicultural mass immigration bullshit:\r\nthe drivel of pre-digested cliches, and\r\nplatitudes; the parroted sound bites; the ad\r\nhominem attacks; the third world ethnic strife;\r\nand real estate Ponzi schemes that displace\r\nlegitimate economic activity. A generation ago, a\r\nsingle manual worker wage provided a family with a\r\nquality of life unimaginable on two professional\r\nsalaries today. Politicians and commentators\r\nrefuse to acknowledge that mass immigration\r\nactually brought rapid impoverishment.\r\n\r\nThe burdens on native-born Aussies will rise to meet the needs of the plague immigration Ponzi scheme\r\n\r\nWelcome to your new multicultural Australia. It\r\nwill certainly be increasingly diverse (chaotic),\r\njam-packed with \"vibrant\" ethnic strife, and rich\r\nwith hypocritical globalist dogs baying for white\r\nAussie blood and increased immigration. Do you\r\nenjoy living in the bubble of bullshit coprophilic\r\nmulticulturalism made for you? That good old \"wage\r\nrestraint\" and unaffordable housing. A slice of\r\nGST on top of the good things that your borrowed\r\nmoney buys. It doesn't get better than this. When\r\na resentful ethnic hates you, that conveniently\r\ndefines you as a racist or xenophobe. Merely not\r\nwanting plague immigration puts you beyond the\r\npale as some kind of genocidal nazi. There is no\r\nsimple way to clear such baseless defamation.\r\n\r\nCheap imported scab labour takes local jobs while locals are urged to \"job seek\" forever\r\n\r\nAlong with ethnic hate culture strife and disease,\r\nwe are importing poverty - typical plague\r\nimmigrants now consume more in services than they\r\npay in taxes. The rising price of goods and\r\nservices is overwhelming Aussie incomes. How could\r\nwe bring down the triumphalist arrogance of\r\nmulticulturalism and plague immigration ? There\r\nwould be terror in the universities if the\r\nsuperannuation of refugee-hugging academics was\r\nseized to pay ALL expenses of uninvited\r\nimmigrants. Maybe we are all equal, but the\r\n\"Yellow Australia\" multicultural imported scab\r\nlabour policy makes imported misfits even more\r\nequal. I think it is time we started deporting in\r\nearnest. Hanging a few quislings for treason might\r\nget the ball rolling.\r\n\r\nWhen the multicultural legions of Hell obscure the truth\r\n\r\nAny actual economic growth due to population\r\ngrowth will end when our resources run out. By\r\nthen it will be too late to be thinking about\r\nsustainability, and Australia will have starving\r\nand angry ethnic hordes within its borders. This\r\nlargely infertile land cannot be flogged to\r\nproduce more crops, logging, woodchips,\r\nagricultural products, and mining, without severe\r\nenvironmental cost. Our tertiary education\r\ninstitutions, including public ones, have become\r\nback-door immigration entrances to Australia. A\r\nsham export industry that is denying our own youth\r\njobs, course places, funded public education and\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\nDefiled by a cabal of globalist quislings\r\n\r\nAlthough the blatant plundering and fire-sales of\r\nAustralian and public national assets was\r\nthorough, it was not slow. Degraded people always\r\nassist their quisling governments to push them to\r\nthe sidelines. Spectator sport maintains mass\r\nidiocy. So you don't have a stake in plague\r\nimmigration? That's because you are not a rich\r\nparasite. The globalist rich will need\r\npolice-state terror to control public rage, once\r\nthe sheeple understand what is being done to them.\r\nThe corporate rats crawled out of the sewer: Urban\r\nTaskforce Australia, which represents 85\r\ncompanies, urged the government to resist pressure\r\nfrom \"anti-growth political forces\" when it draws\r\nup Australia's first population plan.\r\n\r\nGlobalist stooges will be in a dreadful pickle when we hold the treason trials\r\n\r\nNobody can blame the seething third world masses\r\nfor wishing to escape from their destroyed\r\ncountries to Australia and other Western\r\ncountries. What we can blame is our governments\r\nfor importing them as cheap scab labour and\r\ndesperate tenants. In 2050 a two per cent growth\r\nof 50 million would be a million - the population\r\nof Adelaide. Madness. You cannot build Adelaide\r\nevery year, no matter how competent the state\r\ngovernments or how aggressive the property\r\ndevelopers. Boosting plague immigration and\r\nengaging in desperate and greedy property\r\nspeculation, is a sure recipe for human misery and\r\nnational collapse if continued. Any economic\r\ngrowth will be jobless growth, and only wealthy\r\nparasites will benefit.\r\n\r\nTo further enrich property parasites\r\n\r\nIt cannot be called democracy when our billionaire\r\nfriendly politicians carefully conceal their\r\nintentions about increasing mass immigration, as\r\nthey approach an election. It is third world\r\noverpopulation by stealth.

By my look, none of them, but I may have missed something. I didn't say the embassies were impossible to use I said a big part of what those embassies offer is impossible to use.

Frankly, I expect a little bit more, considering there are a number of features of the game that are redundant in solo (some of the market cards also offer a take starting player option and that particular market card will be weaker than the others, that's another example, and then there's the hex that let's you take starting player and one clay.

In what was is that the case for you? Personally, I found that A) it's a lot of work to play a card and B) they're often over costed compared to doing something comparably on the board. You have to jump through a number of hoops to make them superior in value (like having an institute). It sounds like you prefer to mosty just skip the cards, is that right? Or just take one now and again if it happens to come your way? In which case, fair enough, you wouldn't notice much swinginess!!

Gloomhaven is a board game, with a rule book that controls what happens. Players have the ability to work within those constrained rules. The role-playing aspect is limited in that the scenarios and events are themselves highly constrained. D&D has a similar setting theme, and so on. But it's free-form in that every scenario and engagement is acted out, improvised and played by both the DM and the players. The monsters in D&D are more 'intelligent' in that the DM will make decisions for them. So in Gloomhaven, the rules dictate how a monster targets an enemy and moves. (And for what it's worth many of the discussions on this board around movement seem to me to be people trying to give monsters more intelligence than the designer felt could be accomodated sensibly without a DM). In D&D the DM does that. If he/she wants the kobolds to hang-back and wait for the goblins to get slaughtered, that's what they'll do. In GH they're not so tactically astute.Games like Pathfinder (D&D clone) also relate to GH in the use of 'pawns'. The vendors sell playmats, figures, etc., and the combat system (for 50 years) has been based on a 1\" grid and everything in those games flows from that. You don't need figures to play D&D/Pathfinder/etc, but it sure helps. And that's where people may be getting confused. THe use of the physical mat/map in the role-playing games helps to understand what's happening and the possibilities. In GH the board makes the rules.Don't conflate the two games.

I'm not going to give one, but several so you can see how my recommendations don't match the level of games yo seem to enjoy at all: Roads & Boats An interesting gather and process resource VP game. Here you only own that which is on your wooden transport meeples, and any buildings you make or resources produced by them are public domain. Don't worry, you can build walls if you want. In the base game, your goal is to eventually mine gold, process that gold into coins, then merge those coins with paper to make stock certificates (these three are what earn you VP at the end of the game). Like many Splotter games, players influence the game length. In this case, you spend resources to add bricks to a wonder; and then when enough bricks are added the game ends. Oh, and the wonder is another source of VP. The expansion & Cetera adds more mechanisms and ways to score VP.It can be played for a year because it is scenario driven with many different maps made from the modular tile. A logistics game that requires a lot of thinking and planning, and a costly one to get. I see the base game at about $200 and the expansion at around $50 - which is about a 100% or so markup over the original retail price, so it really isn't that big of a used game markup. Don't know if it will be reprinted any time soon. However, $250 for a game that you'll play for a year over and over isn't really all that bad - and its cheaper than getting on most Fantasy Flight Games expansion treadmills for LCGS or minis games. Leaving Earth I call it \"Roads & Boats in Space\" because this game is all about mission planning to get VP. Each player controls a historical space agency, gets a fixed annual budget, and uses that budget to buy tech/buy hardware/perfect hardware/hire anstronauts to try to complete mission goals that are randomly selected decks. The game is set 1956 to 1976 and there is some math involved, but the player aids let you avoid having to do too much math (more of \"each rocket can boost this much mass, so I have to get a total mass of this there... which means I need to use these many of this type of rocket to get that there and... oh my that's expensive; maybe I should buy rendezvous technology to make it easier and less risky...\").The base game has the worlds of Earth, The Moon, Venus, Mars with Phobos, and Ceres; and it also now includes the Mercury mini-expansion. Play base game first, trust me on this. Then add Mercury.The first expansion is Outer Planets. This adds the gas and ice giants; Jupiter and 4 moons, Saturn and 2 moons, Neptune, Uranus. Some new tech is added to handle sending probes out there.The second expansion is Stations and it adds a lot of awesome stuff. Reusable rockets, rovers, space station modules, ground habitats, new ways for handling exploring locations, and much more.The bad news is you must order direct from Luminaris Group's webpage and there may be a delay on shipping no copies are on hand. The up side is that the total cost of the game is $45 + $40 + $35 or $120 for all 3 expansions, and they will keep you busy for a year. High Frontier 3E Phil Eklund of Sierra Madre Games is a literal rocket scientist, and this his his game of near future space exploration. The game seems daunting at first, but you have a very simple base game with many modules to add in (for freighters, warfare and politics, colonists, auxiliary components in building your spacecraft, and so on). 3E was a horrible kickstarter to suffer through, and the game components were no better than normal Sierra Madre Games titles... well, almost. The board is beautiful. 12\" x 12\" panels that let you have a 1.5' x 2' board for the solar system, a 1.5' x 2' board for early interstellar expansion, and flip those boards and you have a massive mounted 2' x 3' board of the system that is good for aging eyes.Sadly, this is out of print, so you are looking at $200-$300 (which isn't uncommon for OOP Sierra Madre Games or Splotter titles), but in this case it is well worth it. 2E original MSRP was something like $80 for the game and expansion plus $40 for the zazzle map for interstellar plus $40 for the poster map of the base game system (the original game had more standard letter sized panels for its board also). Essentially, $200 is a fair market price compared to the retail components - and when kickstarted it was only $70 so that was a steal on the price for such a low volume print run (when you play niche games like wargames, you are used to high prices). Pax Pamir or Pax Renaissance or even Pax Porfiriana Yup, more Sierra Madre Games stuff. Some are out of print, some aren't. These small box games (The Grizzled sized boxes or 50% larger) are full games in a box. You get a good amount of cards but only use a subset for each. The rules are daunting due to the semi-archaic way that Phil Eklund writes, and because he believes in making it more useful when playing (common game rules are in a glossary of terms to quickly look up, so you have to constantly flip to the back of the book when reading it to learn... which means you need to know the typographical cues on when a term is in the back of the book to look up).At the core of these games is the market and victory triggering cards. The market is two rows with a cost to buy cards deeper in, and then you build a tableau off of these cards. Victory triggers either trigger a check for the current of 4 cards revealed to see if someone wins early or to activate a victory check card ( Pax Renaissance ). This makes the strategies subtle, and when combined with using a small subset of overall cards you have high replay value.Costs for acquiring these games vary, as some are out of print. I'd gladly pay $100 for Pax Pamir , it is a wonderful game. Still, costs are all over the board as these go out of print longer and longer.Related games that will have a kickstarter in January or February are Neanderthal and Greenland . Also, Bios Genesis and Bios Megafauna 2E (shipping in January/February) a set of games that you can play to simulate life evolving from the formation of earth to just post Chicxulub impact - and plans to work on a third game in the series are underway. However, these sets of games don't have quite the replay value as the Pax series; they might not keep you engaged for a full year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "phil eklund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bios genesis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jupiter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saturn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luminaris group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sierra madre games", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pax pamir", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ceres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neptune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicxulub", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:24.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ca29bd66f9d79718154c01aa9f7c56082b018370", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqtNymsWgmutf0agSWIMgFG9GYZKPR4Ti.4YGe9EuJPYKPoPYufb5yH0jPbhUyLyG8W9FoeQHbbA--", "site_full": "boardgamegeek.com", "site": "boardgamegeek.com", "site_section": "http://boardgamegeek.com/recentadditions/rss?domain=boardgame", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Recent additions | BoardGameGeek", "title": "Thread: Dungeons & Dragons: Tomb of Annihilation Board Game:: Rules:: Removing Trap Token", "title_full": "Thread: Dungeons & Dragons: Tomb of Annihilation Board Game:: Rules:: Removing Trap Token", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aMWAWY1iXoDut3BHQS6GqKPuRfA=/fit-in/1200x630/pic3596073.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2982, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ca29bd66f9d79718154c01aa9f7c56082b018370", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqtNymsWgmutf0agSWIMgFG9GYZKPR4Ti.4YGe9EuJPYKPoPYufb5yH0jPbhUyLyG8W9FoeQHbbA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BertGK", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Thread: Dungeons & Dragons: Tomb of Annihilation Board Game:: Rules:: Removing Trap Token", "text": "&dash; Time Left for 2017 Support - I supported because\u2026 \"The BGG provides me with invaluable info on new games, expansions, upcoming news, after action reports and more.

The book opens flat onto the table to reveal a colorful map or other illustration central to playing the game, with choices, story, and special rules on the opposite page.On her turn, a player draws 5 dice from the bag . The colors of the dice drawn determine the types of actions and options available to the player. As turns go by, black dice are also drawn, and after enough appear, minions emerge or attack, and the dice bag is reset!White dice can re-stuff stuffies injured in battle. Red dice perform melee attacks while green dice perform ranged attacks. Yellow dice search while blue dice are used for special actions and purple dice can be used as any color. Most dice can always find a strategic use, including moving, using items, or contributing to group tasks.

December 7, 2017 5:00am by Guest Author Who Is More Likely to Default on Student Loans? Rajashri Chakrabarti, Nicole Gorton, Michelle Jiang, and Wilbert van der Klaauw Liberty Street Economics November 20, 2017 \n\n\n\nThis post seeks to understand how educational characteristics (school type and selectivity, graduation status, major) and family background relate to the incidence of student loan default. Student indebtedness has grown substantially , increasing by 170 percent between 2006 and 2016. In addition, the fraction of students who default on those loans has grown considerably. Of students who left college in 2010 and 2011, 28 percent defaulted on their student loans within five years, compared with 19 percent of those who left school in 2005 and 2006. Since defaulting on student loans can have serious consequences for credit scores and, by extension, the ability to purchase a home and take out other loans, it\u2019s critical to understand how college and family characteristics correspond to default rates. \nTo better understand the determinants of student loan default , we ask the following questions in this blog post: Do default rates differ by college type? How do default rates of dropouts compare to those of graduates, and does this relationship vary by degree program? Does default vary with college major? Does college selectivity (defined below) matter for this relationship, and for student loan default more generally? Are students from less advantaged backgrounds more likely to default than students from more advantaged backgrounds? \nTo answer these questions, we utilize a unique data set that matches the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP), based on Equifax data, to National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) education data, allowing us to track student debt and educational attainment over time for a representative sample of young adults. Throughout this discussion, it is important to note that our analysis is descriptive and, while suggestive, does not necessarily imply causation. For example, our results could partially reflect differences in the backgrounds and financial means of students who choose to attend various colleges. \nAs in our previous work with this data set , we focus on individuals born between 1980 and 1986 and track their college attendance and student loan default status by age. In this post, since we focus on determinants of student loan default, we limit our sample to students who took out student debt to finance their education. We focus on the characteristics associated with the highest degree-granting institution a student attended before age twenty-seven. We study default rates by age: out of all student loan holders in the 1980\u201386 birth cohorts, what fraction of people of a given age has defaulted on at least one of their student loans? \nTo examine differences in default rates by college type , we classify student debt holders by the type of college attended: did they attend a public, private not-for-profit, or private for-profit college, and was it a two-year institution or a four-year institution? \nAs seen in the chart below, students who attended private for-profit institutions have the highest default rates after their mid-twenties (shown in the blue lines). In contrast, at every age, four-year private not-for-profit students\u2014the solid gold line\u2014have the lowest default rates. For every college type (public, not-for-profit and for-profit), two-year students (dashed lines) have higher default rates than four-year students (solid lines). While this largely reflects the higher earnings prospects enjoyed by four-year students, it also partly reflects the earlier start of the loan repayment period for two-year students and inherent differences between two- and four-year students. \nInterestingly, though the difference in default rates between two- and four-year private college students is not large (less than 5 percentage points at age thirty-three), this is not the case for public college students. Default rates for community college (two-year public college) students are nearly 25 percentage points higher than those for their counterparts in four-year public colleges. The chart below also shows that while for-profit students have the highest default rates, the default rates of community college students are not too different from those of for-profit students (36 percent versus 42 percent for two-year and 39 percent for four-year for-profit students, respectively, at age thirty\u2011three). \nThe next chart categorizes student debt holders by graduation status as well as by degree program. (Throughout this discussion, \u201cbachelor\u2019s\u201d and \u201cbachelor\u2019s or higher\u201d refer interchangeably to those with bachelor\u2019s or higher-level degrees.) Regardless of degree program, dropouts have higher default rates at every age than graduates\u2014likely because graduates enjoy the labor market benefits of having earned a degree, making it easier for them to find better jobs and repay their loans. However, among dropouts, the default comparison between associate and bachelor\u2019s degree students changes over time. Bachelor-seeking students who did not graduate default at nearly the same rate as dropouts in associate programs until age twenty-nine, when the associate default rate climbs substantially, surpassing that of bachelor\u2019s students. \nAmong graduates, those with associate degrees default at higher rates than those with bachelor\u2019s degrees since their early twenties; the difference by age thirty-three is much larger among graduates (13 percentage points) than among dropouts (4 percentage points). This chart strongly suggests that graduation markedly reduces defaults, and the bachelor\u2019s degree premium (as far as defaults are concerned) is considerably greater among graduates than dropouts. To put these numbers in perspective, 53 percent of debt holders graduate and 90 percent of those people earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. Among loan holders who drop out, 28 percent were enrolled in an associate program. \nIn the next chart, we categorize student loan holders by the selectivity of the college they attended and by the major they pursued. Using Barron\u2019s Profile of American Colleges (2001) ranking of college competitiveness, we classify four-year colleges into two categories: \u201cselective\u201d (colleges ranked \u201ccompetitive\u201d or above by Barron\u2019s ) and \u201cnonselective.\u201d In addition, we classify students into one of four fields, based on their major: \u201cArts and Humanities\u201d (majors such as languages, sociology, theater), \u201cBusiness and Law\u201d (economics, legal studies, management), \u201cSTEM\u201d (science, technology, engineering, mathematics), and \u201cVocational\u201d (aviation, cosmetology, welding). \nIn analysis not reported here, we find that Arts majors have the highest overall default rates, while STEM majors default at the lowest rates. Both Business and Vocational majors default at higher rates than STEM majors, but at rates closer in magnitude to STEM majors than to Arts majors. Next, we separate students not only by major, but also by school selectivity; the chart below presents patterns at age thirty-three. We find that students attending nonselective colleges have higher default rates no matter what they study. Arts majors have the highest default rates regardless of college selectivity, but major matters much more among students at nonselective colleges: the gap in default rates between the best performing major and worst performing major is much smaller (3 percentage points by age thirty-three) among students at selective colleges than among students at nonselective colleges (8 percentage points by age thirty\u2011three). \nNext, to analyze differences with respect to family background, we categorize individuals according to the average 2010 income in the zip code in which they resided at the youngest age we observe them in our data. We divide the panel between individuals from areas with an average income above $55,000 and those from areas with an average income below $55,000 (as measured in 2010). In analysis not reported here, we found that students from less advantaged family backgrounds have higher default rates. To understand this relationship, we investigate whether this correlation differs by college type. \nIn the chart below, we group debt holders by our family background measure, as well as by college type. We find that within each college type, students from less-advantaged backgrounds have higher default rates than their peers from a more-advantaged background. There is a nearly 30 percentage point difference in default rates between the group with the highest default rates (private for-profit students from less advantaged backgrounds) and the group with the lowest default rates (private not-for-profit students from more advantaged backgrounds). However, public college students from more advantaged backgrounds default at nearly the same rate as private not-for-profit students from less advantaged backgrounds (about 20 percent by age thirty-three). As before, at every age, for-profit students have the highest default rates, and students from less advantaged backgrounds attending for-profit colleges default at an even higher rate. \nThese stark differences in default rates with respect to school type, graduation status, college selectivity, major, and family background continue to hold even when we look at conditional correlations in a simple regression framework, introducing all these variables simultaneously. Attending a four-year private for-profit college correlates most strongly with increasing default, while dropping out is the second strongest predictor of default. These patterns are consistent with our finding that students from different educational and family backgrounds experience different returns on their academic investments . Our data show that students who drop out before earning a degree, enroll in an associate degree program as opposed to a bachelor\u2019s degree program, major in the arts, attend a for-profit institution, community college or non-selective college, or come from a less advantaged family background are more likely to default by their late twenties compared to their peers. This represents preliminary evidence that later life outcomes\u2014for example, the ability to buy a home and maintain a strong credit score\u2014may vary widely among student loan holders based on their educational choices and backgrounds. \nChart data \nDisclaimer The views expressed in this post are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.

Here's why... By - Dec 7, 2017 \nWhen a small self-administered scheme (SSAS) or self-invested personal pension (SIPP) purchases a commercial property the requirement for a limitation of liability clause within the subsequent lease between new owners and tenant should be put on the table at the earliest possible juncture. \nThis clause is as far removed from its \u2018LOL\u2019 acronym (used in text speak) as it could be, and in our experience not flagging it at the earliest opportunity can cause real problems down the line. \nAt its worst, it can waste thousands of pounds of valuable pension scheme funds. Certainly no LOL matter. \nSo what is it and what does it do? \nA limitation of liability is a clause inserted within a lease that ensures if any liability arises, then it will be restricted to the value of the individual\u2019s pension scheme funds. It should be clearly flagged within a lease and an example of the typical wording would be: \n\u201c It is hereby agreed by the parties hereto that the liability of ABC Pension Trustees shall not exceed the net value of the assets within its control in THE A SMITH SIPP and that save for that the TENANT shall not have any claim whatsoever against ABC Pension Trustees.\u201d \nThis protects both the professional trustees and, where they are a trustee, the member in their individual capacity. By ring-fencing liability to the assets of the SIPP member\u2019s fund that is making the investment, it also ensures that the assets of other pension trust members are not exposed where they are all held under one trust. \nWhen is it required? \nI would strongly recommend that the limitation of liability clause is included in every lease. \nThis would include agreements with the freeholder (when purchasing long leasehold) or the tenant (when granting a lease as a freeholder or long leaseholder). \nIn my experience persuading the other party to accept this requirement usually falls into one of two categories; either completely straightforward or very complicated, there doesn\u2019t seem to be many that fall in-between. \nA straightforward example might be when a SSAS or SIPP is purchasing and leasing the property to a connected party. \nIn these circumstances it won\u2019t usually cause a problem, as while the owner-tenant must act independently (wearing the two hats of pension scheme and tenant), there is no commercial favour being granted and both parties benefit as it is in their interests to have their pension scheme assets protected. \nIn our experience, the lawyers representing both parties will agree to the clause and the lease will be executed. \nWhere it becomes complicated is when a property is being purchased subject to an existing lease already being in place. In these circumstances, you are asking an existing tenant to vary the terms of the lease to include the limitation of liability clause. \nWhile in practice it should not cause them any concerns, you are still beholden upon them acceding to the request and in our experience where the tenant is someone like a large national supermarket, betting chain or retail outlet, they have standard leases with all their landlords and can be unwilling to give any local or specific flexibility. \nAn absolute must \nThe limitation of liability clause is a pre-requisite for most SSAS and SIPP providers and, taking us back to the first point, it must be raised at the outset otherwise you run the risk of a commercial property purchase costing thousands of pounds in legal fees only to get to a point where the SSAS or SIPP realises it cannot proceed with a transaction because the tenant will simply not agree to the clause. \nWe have thousands of SSAS and SIPP commercial properties within our portfolio and have purchased hundreds this year, all of which will have the limitation of liability clause. It should not be a problem as long as it is explained clearly and at the right time. \nOh, and assuming the tenant is reasonable, which they always are, LOL! \nJohn Keenan is corporate development manager at Xafinity SIPP and SSAS TAGS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john keenan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sipp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abc pension trustees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xafinity sipp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith sipp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:24.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d2a701f2e5a2968f573eec41bd4a8a7f6fae7ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZmXnKw2etcrK45EPxIxrkkz", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "/balt/", "title_full": "/int/ - /balt/ - International - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 149, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.07, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "77a33525d272b5134630373a8006a50eed9138b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZmXnKw2etcrK_Uwm_SdqFm.ksYWNwHHeio-", "ord_in_thread": 65, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>82716050\n>>82716057\nControl your autism please Mikito.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:24.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4aefcde0eae5b4e7dc8c1471f75c6402f42f92bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqtNymsWgmutf0agSWIMgFG9GYZKPR4TjeRcJzkQ2PlHSjrXZnE.vLN4Ithx4wfiRUvjncq33EaHfnMwKo.tJYB11CooFYsoUEBw7ufgBV92pEEOMyPtt8", "site_full": "boardgamegeek.com", "site": "boardgamegeek.com", "site_section": "http://boardgamegeek.com/recentadditions/rss?domain=boardgame", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Recent additions | BoardGameGeek", "title": "Reply: BGG General:: Re: Microbadge Submissions, Design, and Feedback", "title_full": "Reply: BGG General:: Re: Microbadge Submissions, Design, and Feedback", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/geekfacebook.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2982, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4aefcde0eae5b4e7dc8c1471f75c6402f42f92bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqtNymsWgmutf0agSWIMgFG9GYZKPR4TjeRcJzkQ2PlHSjrXZnE.vLN4Ithx4wfiRUvjncq33EaHfnMwKo.tJYB11CooFYsoUEBw7ufgBV92pEEOMyPtt8", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BlackSheeper", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "Reply: BGG General:: Re: Microbadge Submissions, Design, and Feedback", "text": "a_traveler wrote: kevan wrote: Have had a go at making a microbadge for my local board game cafe, based on their official logo.

Review", "text": "- En Garde (Knizia)It will be no surprise to my gentle readers that I\u2019m a big fan of Bucket #3. (For the record, I\u2019d throw Snow Tails , Downforce and Royal Turf into de derde emmer \u2013 Dutch for \u201cthe third bucket\u201d. I\u2019m a veritable linguist today.)But a great sports game experience can come from any of the three types \u2013 one of my favorite gaming memories is playing Dynasty League Baseball and Pizza Box Football on the same night with a crew of sports/board game fans at Gulf Games.Still, when I\u2019m choosing a sports game to play, more often than not I\u2019ll choose something simple yet evocative\u2026 like Flamme Rouge . \u201cI Want To Ride My Bicycle, I Want To Ride My Bike\u2026\u201d One of the first games I bought from directly from Germany back in the late \u201890s was the 1992 Spiel des Jahres winner, Um Reifenbreite (which loosely translates as \u201cBy the Width of a Tire\u201d).The description on The Game Cabinet (which was the landing page for board game geeks before BGG appeared) had me practically salivating\u2026 so I ponied up the big bucks to have the team from Funagain Games scour the used game stalls at Essen to find me a copy. And, true to their word, they did.Um Reifenbreite uses a combination of roll\u2019n\u2019move with card play (to simulate pushes to the front or climbing ability) along with a random event card to evoke the feel of team cycling. Each player has four cyclists and they can draft off other riders as they race around the board. The board design allows for four different races (two shorter, two longer) that can be chained together into a series of stages for a \u201c Tour de Spelrum \u201d. (The last phrase \u2013 \u201cTour de Game Room\u201d \u2013 is brought to you by the mashup of French & Swedish \u2013 let\u2019s call it Swench. Or Frendish. You pick.)I have few complaints about Um Reifenbreite \u2013 it\u2019s been in my top 20 games for nearly two decades. Probably my own concern is how difficult it is to get to the table \u2013 due in part to the cartoonish French art style and the roll\u2019n\u2019move nature of the game. \u201cWhenever I see an adult on a bicycle, I do not despair for the human race.\u201d Fast forward to Essen 2016\u2026 and the nice folks from Lautapelit.fi in Finland released Flamme Rouge . (Ok, kids, say Terveydeksi ! to our Nordic friends\u2026) Seeing pictures (and positive reviews) from the folks across the briny blue just made me want to play Um Reifenbreite again.That is, until I had the opportunity to play Flamme Rouge \u2013 and suddenly all of the \u201cthumbs up\u201d noise began to make sense.The game itself is a model of streamlined design \u2013 the rules only take four pages, and that includes the cover & components list. Players start by choosing a track from a selection of six different tracks and then build it in the center of the table. (You can, of course, build it on the edge of the table\u2026 heck, march to the beat of a different drummer. But if you\u2019re playing at my house, it goes in the center of the table.) The track itself is a series of double-sided straights, gentle curves and right angle curves.After placing their two riders in the starting grid, the race begins. Players have two decks of cards, one for each racer \u2013 a rouleur (I call him \u201cmountain guy\u201d) and a sprinter. Simultaneously, players choose one of their two decks and draw a hand of four movement cards \u2013 then they choose one and place the other three under that deck face up. Then the player does the same with the other deck, leaving them with two cards ready to play.When all players are ready, they turn over their cards and resolve movement in order from the front to the back of the racers. Cyclists may move through other riders but cannot stop on a full space (one with two riders). After all the riders have moved, drafting is calculated, starting at the back of the pack and moving forward \u2013 any group of cyclists who have exactly one space between them and the next group slide up a space to close the gap. When all movement and drafting are taken care of, the lead cyclists in each group have to take an exhaustion card and add it to their discards at the bottom of your deck.There are a couple of twists \u2013 there is no drafting when going uphill (and your maximum speed is 5). By the same token, your minimum speed if you start on a downhill slope is 5, regardless of which card you play.The first rider to cross the finish line wins the game for his team. If multiple riders cross in the same turn, the one who goes the farthest first wins. \u201cNothing compares to the simple pleasure of riding a bike.\u201d As I finish typing up this description, I\u2019m reminded of one of the many reasons I love this game: it is unbelievably easy to teach. While folks have varied in their ability to figure out winning tactics, no one has come away frustrated that the game was too difficult to comprehend.Another element I love is the way in which these simple rules create a game that \u201cfeels\u201d like team cycling. I\u2019ll admit I was skeptical \u2013 what with my deep love for Um Reifenbreite \u2013 about a team cycling game with only two cyclists\u2026 but much like StreetSoccer\u2019s five player game of fu\u00dfball, Flamme Rouge manages to capture the ethos without getting bogged down by fleshing out a full cycling team. There are attempts to break from the pack, lagging to conserve energy, blocking to hold back leaders, slow starts, fast starts, breakdowns due to exhaustion\u2026 it\u2019s all there. Flamme Rouge is also a quick game \u2013 once everyone has a game under their collective belts, races should clock in at about 30 minutes. There is an unofficial iOS app that allows groups to create stage race series if you want to link races together \u2013 but the game works just fine playing stand-alone races. \u201cLife is like a 10-speed bicycle. Most of us have gears we never use.\u201d Flamme Rouge is best with 4 players, though it works very well with 3. Two players is fine \u2013 but you really need more riders on the track to get the full feel of the game.The Peloton expansion was released last month at Essen and it adds the ability to play with 5 or 6 players\u2026 something I\u2019m looking forward to greatly. (Stronghold Games will be bringing the expansion over in early 2018.)We\u2019ve played all of the official track configurations in the game \u2013 and the only one we\u2019re unlikely to play again is La Haut Montagne. (Reason: it ends with an uphill climb \u2013 which is would be fine in a stage race situation but is a little anti-climactic when you\u2019re playing one-off races.) \u201cLearn to ride a bicycle. You will not regret it if you live.\u201d While Flamme Rouge has not replaced Um Reifenbreite in my collection, it has hit the table over and over throughout 2017. The short playing time is certainly a factor \u2013 and as we get to add the Peloton expansion, it will be suitable for a wider variety of player counts. So with the attractive production (we love the cyclist pawns), the variable tracks, the easy-to-learn rules and the excellent fit between theme and gameplay, this is a winner \u2013 a maillot jaune . (I couldn\u2019t end this review without one more linguistic bon mot \u2013 ok, make it two.)

There's another theory: this has already happened. We have played this game with an adult and a 7 year old. The box denotes this as 10+ years. The 7yo is heavily interested in the three investigators (which is a big thing, over here in Germany) and she likes riddles of all kind.It was easy for her to get a grasp of the gameplay. She could not have solved all the riddles on her own, but only slight guidance was needed. Spoiler (click to reveal) Except for the water glass and the shirts. It was a very nice and satisfying experience and I would recommend giving it a go, if your child is interested in this and likes riddles.I would not recommend this for adults who like riddles as it is (in my eyes) way too easy.

I thought it would be fun to take any element from the poem, A Visit from St. Nicholas. It is a story that my mum would read to me at the run up to Christmas and I could probably recite from memory! I was slightly concerned  that the original poem would be too long so, with great pains, I cut some of the verses. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas!\n\n\"'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house  \nNot a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;  \nThe stockings were hung by the chimney with care,  \nIn hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;  \n\nThe moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,  \nGave a lustre of midday to objects below,  \nWhen what to my wondering eyes did appear,  \nBut a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,  \n\nWith a little old driver so lively and quick,  \nI knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.  \n\nHe was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,  \nAnd his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;  \nA bundle of toys he had flung on his back,  \nAnd he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.  \n\nHe spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,  \nAnd filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,  \nAnd laying his finger aside of his nose,  \nAnd giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;  \n\nBut I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight\u2014  \n\u201cHappy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!\u201d\" \n\nAmy \nMiniature  sleigh  \n\nCarole \nBut a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer\n\n\nChristine \nThe first verse\n\n\nDiane Louise \n(A bundle of toys he had flung on his back) \n\nEmma  (Dressed all in fur....went straight to his work)\n\n\nJackie Reader\n\n\nJodie \nTitle\n\nKaren \n(Hang the stockings by the chimney with care)\n\n\nMrs Duck \n(St Nick, sleigh & 8 reindeer) \n\nZoe \n\nWendy L (Spanish Crafter) \nThe Title -
