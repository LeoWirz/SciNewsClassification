Kickoff is set for 11:30 a.m. at Joseph Milner Stadium-Lindy Callahan Field. \nThrough the help of Hines and Ware, the Jackets were able to reach the Class 6A State championship game under first-year coach Chris Jones. \n\u201cThey both played a major role in us having a whole lot of success this year with one on the offensive side and one on the defensive side,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey both made a lot of plays. I feel like they both made a lot of plays unexpectedly because they didn\u2019t have a whole lot of success last year. They caught a lot of people off guard and flew under the radar, but at the end of the day, I\u2019m a firm believer that the cream rises to the top and both of them ended up having pretty good senior seasons.\u201d \nAt wide receiver, Hines had 70 catches for 917 yards and 12 touchdowns for SHS. \nHines is thankful to God and his coach for the opportunity he had with the Jackets. \n\u201cIt was the grace of God,\u201d Hines said during the season. \u201cIt\u2019s a big blessing as well as coach Jones just giving me a chance. My main offseason goal was to become a team leader and a big asset to the offense.\u201d Ware had 74 total tackles, 13 tackles for loss, two interceptions and one fumble recovery from his defensive back position. \n\u201cI had to step up,\u201d Ware said. \u201cWe needed a leader on defense and I had to do that personally.\u201d \nGeneral admission tickets for the Bernard Blackwell Classic are $10 per person at the gate with all seats general admission. This will be the ninth consecutive year the game will be held on the Gulf Coast. Jones plans to attend the game to support his players. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to go down and watch them play Saturday and watch their last high school football game,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI wish them well.\u201d \nThe game will be televised by Mississippi Public Broadcasting, including Mississippi State's WMAB-DT Channel 2.

Herman Miller\u2019s Liveable Office Award is Now Open! \nDoes your workspace deftly capture the identity of your company? Does it foster engagement and agile work behaviours? It may be eligible for entry into Herman Miller\u2019s Liveable Office Award 2017 \u2013 2018. BY David Congram hermanmiller.com \nSince its inauguration in 2013, the Herman Miller Liveable Office Awards have recognised excellence in workspace design. Highlighting the centrality of good design for companies hoping to leverage broader organisational goals, the Awards celebrate commercial sector design and specification within the Asia Pacific region that engages with challenges old and new in innovative, striking ways. Against the backdrop of today\u2019s rapidly evolving commercial sector and the changing workplace, the Awards are more relevant than ever. \nToday, the commercial sector \u2013 particularly office space \u2013 is enjoying a renaissance as a new, hybrid form that cross-pollinates the best elements from residential design with those from the hospitality sector. The resulting spaces marry the cosiness and comfort of home with the durability, sleek design, and high performance of the hospitality and commercial worlds. \nToday\u2019s best workspaces \u2013 those which the Awards honour \u2013 are those that engage with common contemporary workspace problems of collaborative space, branding, and fostering engagement. They also anticipate work behaviours, positioning themselves to address not only the needs of today but also those of tomorrow. \nRepresenting a diverse cross-section of the Asia Pacific design industry, the independent Liveable Office Award jury is comprised of six distinguished design industry professionals including Professor Cees de Bont, the Dean of School & Swire Chair Professor of Design at the School of Design at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Pradyumna Vyas, the Director of India\u2019s National Institute of Design, and Melbourne-based textile designer, design educator, and incumbent National President of the DIA, Claire Beale. \nA more technical, business-driven understanding of the complexities of the commercial furniture industry comes by way of Kartik Shethia, Vice President of Herman Miller Asia Pacific, and Toshiaki, Matsuoka, Chairman of Japan Society for Office Study (JOS) and the President/Management Consultant of Matsuoka Research Institute, Inc. Rounding out the panel is Raj Nandan, Managing Director and Publisher of Indesign Group Asia, whose cross-platform experience in design publishing places him in good stead to comment on excellence within the industry. \nAs always, the 2017 \u2013 2018 Awards invite designers to submit projects that reframe the workplace as more than a mere utilitarian site. As Kartik Shethia explains, \u201cWe find meaning and fulfilment in work. Working is about living your passion, and the workspace should empower everyone to be active contributors.\u201d As such, the Liveable Office Award recognises creative interpretations of the workplace that uses design acumen, a nuanced understanding of client needs, and the latest and greatest in commercial sector design and specification to deliver vibrant, dynamic workplaces. \nThe Jury will consider entries in terms of five key criteria: contribution to corporate culture, enabling of focus within an open space, support of collaboration, creation of a health-positive working environment, and environmental responsibility. Winners will be selected in the four categories of: Commercial Business \u2013 Workspace Design Award, Co-working and Collaborative Space Award, Best Tech Award, and People\u2019s Choice Award. Online voters will select the winner of the lattermost category. \nSince 2013, the Awards have been a springboard for designers across the region, launching their work into the minds and hearts of Herman Miller\u2019s wide consumer base. Past winners include Geyer\u2019s Herald Weekly Times Project in Melbourne, GPT Group\u2019s office design for Sydney\u2019s MLC Centre, and the Donuts Co. Ltd Inc design by Flooat Inc. in Tokyo. \nWith cash prizes of up to US$5,000 and an all-expenses-paid trip for four to the Herman Miller Flagship Store in New York, the competition is not one to be missed. To submit your project, head to the Herman Miller competition website and complete the submission form before 15 February 2018. The competition is only open to projects completed in the Asia Pacific region between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017.

Sinopec alleges it never received full payment for 45,000 tons of steel rebar it agreed to sell PDVSA for $43 million and which was delivered in 2013. \nThe lawsuit, while small in size, says PDVSA through its U.S. subsidiary Bariven reneged on repeated promises to pay Sinopec, at one point costing the Chinese company $2 million in losses after it entered into arbitration with a supplier it agreed to purchase the steel from to carry out the deal. \n\"This is not simply a case of a broken promise to pay,\" Sinopec said in the court documents, accusing PDVSA of \"deceit\" and \"willful deception\" in its refusal to pay its bills. \"Rather, this case involves a complex commercial transaction specifically calculated to leave Sinopec without a remedy.\" \nThe Chinese \"usually take a more diplomatic tone\" and are clearly angry, Russ Dallen, head of local brokerage Caracas Capital, wrote in a report Wednesday in which he revealed the existence of the lawsuit. \nThe dispute comes as Venezuela is seeking fresh financing to restructure its huge foreign debt on which it is behind payment. \nChina has been one of Venezuela's biggest creditors, providing it loans, cash and investment totaling more than $65 billion between 2007 and 2016, according to a database maintained by Boston University and the Inter-American Dialogue. But it has so far failed to come to President Nicolas Maduro's rescue as he tries to shield the OPEC nation from triple-digit inflation, fast-declining oil production and financial sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. \nA spokesman for Beijing-based Sinopec Group confirmed that a U.S. subsidiary of a Sinopec trading company had launched a lawsuit against PDVSA about \"a dispute over payment owed.\" \n\"As a big company, it is normal for us to have such commercial dispute and it is normal to resort to law if there is a dispute,\" Sinopec spokesman Lu Dapeng said by phone. \nGeng Shuang, a spokesman of China's Foreign Ministry, said the issue was nothing more than a regular commercial dispute and that China remains willing to cooperate with Venezuela on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. \n\"I think this is a common commercial dispute and there is no need to make over-interpretations of it,\" Geng said. \"I want to stress that China attaches great importance to the development of China Venezuela relations.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press researchers Yu Bing and Shanshan Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.

It appears Meek Mill is staying a busy man behind bars. According to TMZ , the MMG rapper is currently bouncing around between several different jobs at the moment, and he\u2019s only making 19 cents an hour while doing so. Talk about a paycheck difference. Meek used to get booked for $30K a night, now he\u2019s making pennies on the dollar, literally. RELATED : Meek Mill Judge's Investigation Urged By Two Social Justice Organizations Serving his 2 to 4 years at the Pennsylvania SCI Chester, Meek is reportedly part of the general labor crew, getting his hands dirty in various random projects. A source says Meek does everything from clean cell blocks & tidy up prison grounds to cook food & wash dishes, he does whatever \u201cgeneral labor\u201d is necessary at the time. He also apparently serves food too, which I'm sure fellow inmates appreciate. The source says Meek is doing all this work with a smile on his face too, and is considered a model inmate who\u2019s been getting some nice perks due to good behavior. Meek reportedly gets access to electrical and carpentry shops, and he's waiting to get into some therapy courses. Mind you, he\u2019s only receiving 19 cents an hour too, which if you think about comes out to be only $1.52 over an 8-hour shift. Talk about brutal. As for Meek\u2019s latest legal woes, his lawyers just filed a new bail motion in efforts to continue their appeal, but we\u2019ll have to see what happens. They were just denied bail last week after the judge said Meek was a \"danger to the community .\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "meek", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "meek mill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cents an hour marcus ingram/ getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "two social justice organizations serving", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pennsylvania sci chester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meek", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:25.034+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a93fccf138f5a9fed2169b5668ef5e36ed6feb42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_wWkB_4GQJ89YEo4smCxXqO", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Luciferian Prayer.", "title_full": "/x/ - Luciferian Prayer. - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T18:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 116, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "880f66735c49c836cf78507ec30954ae7d16bb04", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_wWkB_4GQJ89cTcQW7CYcqQuWPKL0zanNU-", "ord_in_thread": 113, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>20001235\nno. why would you think that?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:25.036+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a93fccf138f5a9fed2169b5668ef5e36ed6feb42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_wWkB_4GQJ89YEo4smCxXqO", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Luciferian Prayer.", "title_full": "/x/ - Luciferian Prayer. - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T18:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 116, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "99ec338e197cad693cb74743d7ab96293ae3efd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_wWkB_4GQJ89cTcQW7CYcqQjk_s7JA01f4-", "ord_in_thread": 116, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>20001342\nIt's more like Disneyland", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:25.037+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2149d961a15658c0282b2897619f161788bcca38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEsX9NP2JFROqwGWoBBEj_E6NDYfiOUaUY37UGaC7_oh.KG0YigJJVaLLGtsvARwjC7LGFROUfK558W9PKl9SDo_g8L6nCjLMFvqq4luMX43Gw--", "site_full": "orlpubmednews.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://orlpubmednews.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "OtoRhinoLaryngology News", "title": "Effect of Body Position on Pharyngeal Swallowing Pressures Using High-Resolution Manometry", "title_full": "Effect of Body Position on Pharyngeal Swallowing Pressures Using High-Resolution Manometry", "published": "2017-12-07T11:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2149d961a15658c0282b2897619f161788bcca38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEsX9NP2JFROqwGWoBBEj_E6NDYfiOUaUY37UGaC7_oh.KG0YigJJVaLLGtsvARwjC7LGFROUfK558W9PKl9SDo_g8L6nCjLMFvqq4luMX43Gw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexandros G.

Using high-resolution manometry (HRM), this study aims to identify positional adaptations of pharyngeal physiology by evaluating swallowing pressure patterns in a series of inverted body positions. Ten healthy adults each underwent swallowing tasks with pharyngeal HRM at six body positions using an inversion table (0\u00b0[upright], 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0[supine], 110\u00b0, 135\u00b0, and 180\u00b0[fully inverted]). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess impact of position on pressure parameters, and pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients translate. Velopharyngeal pressures varied by position ( P < 0.001), with significantly higher pressures generated with inversion \u226590\u00b0, compared with upright and 45\u00b0. Change in position did not significantly affect common mesopharyngeal pressures or swallowing pressure durations. UES valving mechanisms were preserved during inversion, with subtle variations observed in integral pressures ( P = 0.011). Pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients changed with position ( P < 0.01), increasing with inversion > 90\u00b0 compared to upright and 45\u00b0. Mechanisms of deglutition may differ with position and relative direction of gravity, particularly when at > 45\u00b0 inclination. Increased palatal pressure is generated in the upside-down position to achieve nasopharyngeal closure and prevent regurgitation. While other classically measured pressures may not consistently differ with positioning, many individuals exhibit adaptations in pressure gradients when inverted, likely due to a combination of changes in pharyngeal driving force and UES opening mechanisms. Identification of these changes, relative to position, further builds on our understanding of the adaptability of the pharyngeal swallowing system.\n\n\nfrom #ORL-AlexandrosSfakianakis via ola Kala on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2nzWiCa", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hrm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anova", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ola kala", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:26.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91c8a147fb839ed6e658d1cdbfed90b7545cd703", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DH4fzRhcB2ytsamPoXFtZdKz.vXPJ74oRlClRAuoG_WjBTCP6QC5eXOWPI7.Zmvs1Ty83j4JuuPA6E7tXTNLM3FiQNBuYrUHJr8T7pqGaBtCWRjRDVinN_MA--", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site": "huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/christmas/3/", "site_categories": ["politics", "financial_news", "law_government_and_politics", "finance"], "section_title": "Christmas | HuffPost UK", "title": "This Is When You Should Put Your Christmas Tree And Decorations Up", "title_full": "This Is When You Should Put Your Christmas Tree And Decorations Up", "published": "2017-11-20T17:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "http://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.huffingtonpost.com%2Fasset%2F1200_630%2F5a12bb40150000331b858ecc.jpeg&amp;client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&amp;signature=5aa178506b88393a64d35a63d20385549c1af8ed", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3053, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9e8ed8f0063643241acd925997b24955be269453", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DH4fzRhcB2ytsamPoXFtZdKz.vXPJ74oRlClRAuoG_WjBTCP6QC5eXOWPI7.Zmvs1Ty83j4JuuPA6E7tXTNLM3FiQNBuYrUHJr8T7pqGaBtCULr82QP80RibAZGvpSa6SN", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "David Bickenson", "published": "2017-12-03T14:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Decorations should be put up on Christmas eve and taken down by Jan 6th - twelve days of Christmas.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:26.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "afb9920fe19b7d20ba3d254b255fa0a9f180f124", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSgu_iamq6Ha.3SFknFBETPvtXBOAWUQk2h89eFuTEJojDiJdDaXeWaH.IsvRVV3hKPKe_6S8.9xLe1SOV_c3VOeO6zi.USJ53XCuqTz2obVonTH2P0z4JZtR9wjmgUyPThXEk7691usA--", "site_full": "ls1tech.com", "site": "ls1tech.com", "site_section": "https://ls1tech.com/forums/generation-v-internal-engine-174/", "site_categories": ["auto_racing", "vehicles", "auto_parts", "sports"], "section_title": "Generation V Internal Engine - LS1TECH - Camaro and Firebird Forum Discussion", "title": "Vengeance Racing Drop in Piston Kit for LT1!!!", "title_full": "Vengeance Racing Drop in Piston Kit for LT1!!!

Improper alignment can be really bad for your car, but unfortunately there\u2019s no handy notification light that shows up on your dashboard when it happens. Signs Your Car\u2019s Alignment Is Messed Up \nFortunately, there are some telltale signs your car\u2019s alignment is out of whack: The car pulls to one side when you\u2019re driving. The steering wheel is crooked when you are driving straight. The car\u2019s tire treads are unevenly worn. \nFirestone recommends getting your car\u2019s alignment checked every 6,000 miles and says improper alignment can shorten a tire\u2019s lifespan by thousands of miles. \nHaving a mechanic perform a front-end alignment costs about $50 to $75 , according to Angie\u2019s List. But luckily some creative people on the internet have come up with a DIY hack to make it easier and much cheaper to adjust your own front-end alignment. \nAs with any car maintenance, it\u2019s probably best to consult a professional mechanic, but if you feel comfortable trying this yourself, here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to aligning your front wheels at home using common items such as two tape measures and a pair of bricks. Step 1: Check Your Owner\u2019s Manual \nBefore doing any work on your car, always consult the owner\u2019s manual for the proper specifications of your car. When checking alignment, the important specs to know are your car\u2019s ideal toe-in/toe-out measurement (the inward or outward direction at which the tires are pointed when looking at the car from its front) and its camber (the vertical angle at which the wheels tilt, affecting how flat they are when they hit the ground). \nFor our purposes, we will be focusing on the car\u2019s toe-in/toe-out measurement. Toe measurements vary from model to model but Mobil says a car\u2019s front tires should be slightly pigeon-toed , pointing inward from 1/32- to 1/8-inch. Step 2: Gather Your Materials \nThere are dozens of DIY alignment hacks online but the simplest one we found was from Jalopnik , which recommends using two 24-inch pieces of angle iron, two identical tape measures, two bricks and your car\u2019s jack, which should be located in the spare-tire compartment of the trunk. \nFor this job, jacking the car up is apparently optional, as we found several methods that left the car on the ground, including this easy video from Ratchets & Wrenches: Step 3: Loosen Nuts On Tie Rod \nThe tie rod is what connects your car\u2019s steering rack to its steering arm. It\u2019s basically the piece that allows your steering wheel to turn the front tires . The tie rod can be found between the front two tires, but if you\u2019re unsure where to find it on your vehicle, check the manual or look it up online. \nThere should be two nuts attached to the tie rod that can be loosened. Once you\u2019ve loosened them, you\u2019re ready to change the alignment of your front tires. Step 4: Roll The Car Forward and Backward \nIf you jacked it up, your car should be back on the ground at this point. Now you need to put the car in neutral and push it about 10 feet forward and backward to allow the car to settle into its proper driving suspension. Step 5: Straighten Your Steering Wheel \nGet inside the car and turn the steering wheel until it looks and feels straight. This is your baseline and your tires should be at their straightest when the steering wheel is in this position. \nJalopnik says you can ensure your steering wheel is straight by measuring the rods that come out of both sides of the tie rod. If the measurement is equal on both rods, the steering wheel is perfectly straight. Getty Images | Alexander Koerner Step 6: Set Up The Tape Measures \nJalopnik recommends placing a brick on the ground to the side of the front tires at the center of both wheels. Then, you set a piece of angle iron on each brick, with the flat side resting against the tire. \nFinally, you bookend the tires with the two tape measures by hooking the metal end of the tape measure onto one piece of angle iron and stretching it to pass over the other piece of angle iron, resting the tape measure\u2019s casing on the ground. \nYou should be left with two tape measures stretched from one side of the car to the other, resting against the front and back of both front tires. Step 7: Look At The Measurements \nThe tape measure stretched across the front of your tires will show how your toed-in or toed-out the wheels are. Again, they should be slightly toed-in, but check your car\u2019s owner\u2019s manual for the desired specs. Step 8: Make Adjustments To The Tie Rod \nIf your tires need to be turned inward, the tie rod should be rotated counter clockwise, according to How Stuff Works . If they need to be turned outward, the tie rod should be rotated clockwise. A small turn will make a big difference here, so don\u2019t rotate the tie rod too far. \nBelow is a look at two typical tie rods that are disconnected from a car. Flickr | BrownGuacamole Step 9: Check Measurements Again \nAfter making your adjustments, the tape measures should now either show an even distance from the front and back of your tires or a difference that is acceptable, based on your car\u2019s specs. Continue to make adjustments to the tie rod until the measurements are proper. Step 10: Tighten Tie-Rod Nuts And Test Drive \nWhen you\u2019re done aligning your front tires, tighten the tie-rod nuts back up and take your car for a test drive. If done correctly, the car should drive perfectly straight when the steering wheel is centered. \nNow pat yourself on the back for saving $75.

However, the answer to businesses energy woes may lie in developing technology. \nTechnology is rapidly shaping our lives- not only personally but professionally. Data-driven decision making is beginning to cement itself as a business standard, with the ability to collect and analyse data becoming increasingly accessible and invaluable for organisations. \nNot only is the manufacturing industry seeing huge impacts from the wave of innovation but the energy sector is being offered several software solutions that can help support the management of business operations, their associated costs and ways to monitor and reduce carbon emissions. \nSuch leaps in technology assistance are now driving energy efficiency up the executive agenda as many become aware of the substantial savings available. Perhaps, as all eyes now fix on how technology is evolving, the prevalent issues in energy costs and usage can be addressed with the evolution of supporting technological solutions? \nFor example, Building Energy Management Systems (BeMS) allow businesses to operate buildings in a more efficient way through monitoring the usage of internal settings, like heating and lighting, as environmental changes occur. For a while, BeMS was an expensive and complicated tool to utilise; however, standardisation, updates and cloud computing has allowed the software to be utilised cost-effectively by many businesses, regardless of their size. \nDiscussing the implementation of technology within the energy sector, Head of Origination at market-leader E.ON, Dr Chris Horne, stated: \u201cThe technology has changed- it\u2019s now accessible to many more customers and there are new products which help to improve engagement with energy through displays that can be placed in public areas\u2026 By bringing this data into a central system, monitoring many sites, and abnormal usage patterns can be identified against other sites within a company\u2019s portfolio or by comparison with similar sites from other companies.\u201d \nAs larger businesses dread the energy triad periods, where predicted fees are set to put a large dent in expenditure during in-demand times, intelligent software can help alleviate the sting by allowing companies to be smarter about their energy usage. The triad charging system, which was implemented in the 90s, highlights the peak electricity demand period between November and February, and those who are classed as peak users will be charged energy tariffs that reflect the pressure they put on the system. It is, therefore, vital that organisations not only have a clear understanding of their own energy usages but how they compare in relation to the marketplace in order to avoid pricey bills. \nNot only will such software allow you to compare your energy usage against competitors but it will permit you to see if there are any unnecessary or particularly expensive assets in your establishments that are causing higher costs and a larger eco-footprint. By easily identifying where your problem areas are, it is easy for business consultants to highlight alternative solutions and the best providers. Additionally, the software can also monitor the performance of solutions and, in some cases, fix any issues remotely to save you additional costs and time. \n\u201cBeMS act as the brains for a building and how it operates so it should be considered a fundamental and key building block in any organisation with aspirations to save energy, cut operating costs and reduce their environmental impacts by lowering carbon emissions,\u201d according to E.ON\u2019s Direct of Strategic Accounts, David Grundy. \nIf businesses want to ensure they are operating efficiently, the implementation of software will be a highly instrumental tool, as will financial business consultants who can not only identify the essential software but the best energy providers suitable to the needs of the business.

The company had named Ravi Kumar as Rao's deputy to run the delivery organization earlier this year and the latter was named acting CEO following the resignation of Vishal Sikka in August. Parekh will need to eliminate the overlapping structures and functions for better execution. \n\nThe new CEO will also need to manage expectations as Kumar, along with BFSI head Mohit Joshi, was the internal candidate in the longlist for the CEO gig. Dealing with candidates who were passed over for the job is never an easy task for an outside nominee. \n\nAs reported by TOI, Parekh's appointment has caused heartburns internally that could lead to some shake-up. While Infosys chose to go for an outsider, industry observers like HfS Research CEO Phil Fersht believe that the board did so to get the balance right. \"Having someone who hasn't been sucked into this internal quagmire and can drive change with a little distance from the intense (and proud) history is the right way to go,\" he said. \n\nThough Parekh is likely to rope in a handful of lieutenants from Capgemini \u2014 his previous company \u2014 he would be mindful of not upsetting the apple cart by making sweeping changes that's not aligned with Infosys' DNA and culture. \n\n\n\n\"I am sure he will make some changes in areas where Infosys is lagging, such as bringing in some new counsel for growth and strategy. I would be surprised if Ravi Kumar or Pravin leave, as this was likely a key component in the new appointment \u2014 someone who wouldn't decimate the current structure like Sikka did. I expect Parekh to be more externally focused \u2014 on M&As, clients and driving the overall strategy, while Pravin and Ravi will work on executing against these directions,\" Fersht said. \n\nParekh has spent a long time in financial services, worked with global banks like HSBC and grew accounts like Royal Mail and GE. Constellation Research CEO Ray Wang said, \"Salil gets the shift in IT services. He was responsible for the growth at Capgemini in his regions. He also understands the Indian services firms' culture. Having a consulting, global view, and position to influence growth are all good factors.\" \n\nAngel Broking said in a report, \"Parekh takes up the mandate at the time when Infosys is battling with the industry challenges like commoditisation of traditional services and foray into new services like digital.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "salil parekh", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pravin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ravi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vishal sikka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sikka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phil fersht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parekh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pravin rao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fersht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ravi kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ray wang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohit joshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "times of india bengaluru", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "infosys", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "constellation research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bfsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hfs research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capgemini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hsbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal mail", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:27.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f12f89a6d7259ffe475c5957e715768fdd9a748", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT2yHVgC5Mysm7rQyUMMcsYJQCP64OWapOJ0ag_Yb2PmJFBHbg_g0yLkyLE1bvnzjkiT7ucvDvObl3Y22AWsatrF5g56ZlAKghiRBTAmtcLnXbvyXRWxsok_OEzS98MA2xbqu3lTdN2j.yT8PPPls8Ws19Ew.nlWNzaRUVtBNm8UMKlH5dxIVuPV2yOUs8tpG79lhkb2RdEP.GJISXz5FYGutiH55OhUQAsZxpamCOb_CN1s9i4nA2BX5.BRGEBKedpOciJa70lpwDZP66xbQKTFItEmkorQKlRbDQXBHu5.cgeilxWEdQV", "site_full": "login.ntm.eu", "site": "ntm.eu", "site_section": "http://corren.se//nyheter/varlden/rss", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Corren.se - V\u00e4rlden", "title": "Katalansk flaggdag i Bryssel", "title_full": "Katalansk flaggdag i Bryssel", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0f12f89a6d7259ffe475c5957e715768fdd9a748", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT2yHVgC5Mysm7rQyUMMcsYJQCP64OWapOJ0ag_Yb2PmJFBHbg_g0yLkyLE1bvnzjkiT7ucvDvObl3Y22AWsatrF5g56ZlAKghiRBTAmtcLnXbvyXRWxsok_OEzS98MA2xbqu3lTdN2j.yT8PPPls8Ws19Ew.nlWNzaRUVtBNm8UMKlH5dxIVuPV2yOUs8tpG79lhkb2RdEP.GJISXz5FYGutiH55OhUQAsZxpamCOb_CN1s9i4nA2BX5.BRGEBKedpOciJa70lpwDZP66xbQKTFItEmkorQKlRbDQXBHu5.cgeilxWEdQV", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Katalansk flaggdag i Bryssel", "text": "1kr f\u00f6rsta m\u00e5naden, d\u00e4refter tillsvidare 189kr Oops.

He joins the organization after spending five years in the same position for Seton Hall University, where he coached Toros defender Kai Greene. Like Gonzalez, Echeverry has a history with Houston Dynamo head coach Wilmer Cabrera. He was an assistant coach under Cabrera with the US U-17 national team and helped bring in and scout players in the system. Before his coaching career, he played in MLS and in the top division in Colombia. In regards to the qualifications I expected the organization would target during the search, Gerson checks all the boxes. He speaks fluent Spanish and his familiarity with Wilmer will allow for vertical integration, which is imperative for player development. Echeverry will work with the Dynamo front office to make determinations of the 2017 Toros roster, deciding who to bring back, and search to bring in new talent.

Nathan Lyons, who also serves as Atkinson\u2019s Drug Abuse Resistance Education officer, has resigned from the police department after he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence following a crash in Newton.Police Chief Al Brackett confirmed Wednesday that Lyons submitted his resignation on Dec. 1, effective immediately.Lyons, 36, of Plaistow, was suspended without pay after the Nov. 21 crash in Newton while the Atkinson Police Department conducted an internal investigation.Brackett said that investigation is now closed since Lyons is no longer working for the department. He declined to release a copy of the resignation letter, saying it\u2019s part of a personnel file.Lyons has pleaded not guilty to charges of driving while intoxicated, reckless operation and conduct after an accident.The DWI charge alleges that Lyons was under the influence of \u201cintoxicating liquor and/or controlled drug, prescription drug, over-the-counter drug, or any other chemical substance, natural or synthetic.\u201dNewton police said Lyons struck a car, failed to stop, and continued driving until he crashed into a utility pole on North Main Street.Selectman Jason Grosky, the board\u2019s chairman, informed selectmen Monday that Lyons had resigned.

He dies the day the mosque is brought down. Mirza once said, the film \"was an epitaph to the dream that India gave itself at the time of Independence.\" \n\nWhen hordes of karsevaks shouted, \"Ek dhakka aur do, Babri Masjid tod do,\" and brought down the 16th century structure hoping to build a Ram Mandir in its place, many Indians also felt the same way wondering if the nature of national politics had altered forever. The masjid's razing was the final outcome of the Ram Janambhoomi movement which had gathered steam since 1990. The movement was piloted by the Sangh parivar with top BJP and VHP leaders at its forefront. \n\nWatch: Babri Masjid-Ram Mandir dispute - A timeline \n\nCustomize | Align | Delete \n\n\nGraffiti at the site a day after the Masjid was razed. (TOI file photo by Manoj Chhabra) \n\n\nTwenty-five years on, the jury is still divided on the long-term impact of the controversial issue. Some believe it was a game-changing moment, others differ. BJP politician Chandan Mitra says that the masjid's demolition marked \"a decisive turn\" in the nature of Indian politics whereby the idea of \"cultural nationalism\" overtook the existing \"ideological nationalism\" that India saw since Independence. \n\nBlog: Listen to Babri Masjid's ghost \n\nTill then, he says, identity politics was confined to caste and small groups. \"This was a supra identity that sought to be established as a kind of majority nationalism. The idea has been gaining ground since then and has established itself as the dominant theme in Indian politics,\" he says. \n\n\n\n\nPolitical scientist Imtiaz Ahmed provides a counter. He says the demolition is \"a peripheral issue\" in Indian politics today, raised sporadically \"to influence the electoral process.\" Even the electoral relevance of Babri Masjid or building the Ram Mandir has declined, he says. \n\nMuslim trio guards, dresses and lights up Ram idol For the past two decades, whenever heavy rain or storms have broken the sharp, barbed concertina wires guarding the Ram Janmabhoomi perimeter in Ayodhya, the public works department (PWD) has sought Abdul Wahid's help. \n\n\"The BJP recognises this. It is not interested in building the temple but in keeping the issue alive. BJP occasionally talks about it only to use it to polarise the votes and gain some advantage. Look how the Babri Masjid issue is irrelevant in the forthcoming Gujarat election. Even in the UP state election this year, it was not an issue,\" says Ahmed. \n\nA BJP-led Union government ruled between 1999 and 2004. The saffron party enjoys a majority in the Lok Sabha since 2014. But the issue, as Ahmed says, has never been on the front-burner. Mitra points out that building the temple is \"very much\" a part of BJP's agenda. However, he says that the Supreme Court order, which says that there can be no construction at the site, has \"taken the sting out of the movement.\" \"It will be difficult to violate SC's order unless the two communities are in agreement. That too does not seem likely,\" he says. \n\n\nThe front page of The Times Of India's editions across the country on December 7, 1992, a day after the Babri Masjid was brought down. \n\nDalit commentator Chandrabhan Prasad too feels the impact of the masjid's demolition has been limited. \"In UP, we've seen BSP and SP roar to power with absolute majority. If the politics had changed permanently, this wouldn't have happened,\" he says. \n\nPrasad believes that liberalisation had a far greater impact on long-term national politics than the flattening of Babri Masjid. \"Dalits have been the biggest beneficiaries of the Constitution and the market economy,\" he says. \n\nSocial scientist and politician Yogendra Yadav provides the big picture saying that the demolition signals a shift in popular opinion. \"The middle ground of public opinion decisively shifted towards majoritarianism thereafter. It taught us that secularism cannot be defended merely with instruments of law or arms of the state. We realised that when public opinion shifts, everything else - politics, state institutions, even judiciary, shifts,\" he says. \n\n\"Therefore, the real lesson is that the battle to save secularism has to be fought in the minds of ordinary people. That sadly is a battle secular Indians have not seriously engaged with. This would mean a deeper engagement with our traditions, in Indian languages, and with the common sense of ordinary people. The longer we delay it, the weaker our republic becomes, and susceptible to the kind of thuggery we see today,\" Yadav says.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "saeed mirza", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "naseem", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "prasad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yogendra yadav", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yadav", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babri masjid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mirza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdul wahid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandan mitra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manoj chhabra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandrabhan prasad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imtiaz ahmed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "| india news - times of india", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babri masjid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ram mandir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vhp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babri masjid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "urdu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayodhya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lok sabha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:27.056+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7bb85fee69a8c99c3a27291bcc7eabbeadd840e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_yWQiuMVyJBSYMPv8CZ39pk", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Star Child", "title_full": "/x/ - Star Child - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 42, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.719, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c8e11eb23acae207558f2989aca10ce76653c0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_yWQiuMVyJBSZk3UBuONOYRSEOxms3Jte8-", "ord_in_thread": 31, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>20001264\nI can't tell you everything but know that you can always change your life.

Most scientists are beginning think reality is a simulation. If you want, focus on the center of energy in you body The energy itself, in it's base state. It's infinite. As light doesn't age, only shifts away from other photons. The energy doesn't ever disappear or go away. It only transforms. You already infinite because the Universe can manifest your data.
