The video aired started by showing children of various races watching political speeches by opposition members on laptops, mobile phones and tablets. One of the speakers the video focused on was former DAP man Hew Kuan Yau, and touched on his \"Malays screwing Malays\" remark made last year. The children then gathered at a playground, but when a Chinese girl, Mei Lin, asks a Malay girl, Sasha, to play with her, the latter reflects back to Hew's speech. Wary, the Malay girl turns down the invitation saying: \"No Mei Lin, you will use me.\" The video ended with the friendship of all the children in tatters, and a warning that children are easily influenced by what they see. \"Do not expose them to negative values,\" the video says. Hew had made the remark about \"Malays screwing Malays\" during the Sarawak state election last year, while campaigning for Batu Kitang candidate Abdul Aziz Isa. He claimed that the remark, made in Chinese, had been  twisted  out of context. The anti-opposition video was aired during the lunch break of today's proceedings at the Putra World Trade Centre's Dewan Tun Hussein Onn. Other \"negative influences\" in the video were PKR vice-president Rafizi Ramli and activist Hishamudin Rais. Footages of violence taking place during the Bersih rallies and the Nothing to Hide 2.0 forum were also shown in the video. Besides the video aimed at parents, other propaganda videos shown today included one blaming DAP for racial tensions in Malaysia, and another playing up Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak's meeting with US President Donald Trump in September.- Mkini ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sasha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafizi ramli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "- mkini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mei lin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "batu kitang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdul aziz isa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hishamudin rais", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib abdul razak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hew kuan yau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dewan tun hussein onn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "umno", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "putra world trade centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarawak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:51.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b9616d7ccb6b1be1ff29acc65ea823bcca10701", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkd6Ay60oCLGDiMR7KMA37s7pesBZydBrXloJnBHmveNVG9vUMVYZXnXg34B1wCv5.u4gcod2D7vAoGaZPA0vQp4ocWSdWTUYqXmvk.NAPNqI7I8AwU6HKjoXuPW6Cw3Yh4HLL3Y_Wd14XM8R6UXhh_w", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/AmericanBankingNews", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "8point3 Energy Partners LP (CAFD) Receives Consensus Recommendation of \u201cHold\u201d from Brokerages", "title_full": "8point3 Energy Partners LP (CAFD) Receives Consensus Recommendation of \u201cHold\u201d from Brokerages", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/8point3-energy-partners-lp-logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6b9616d7ccb6b1be1ff29acc65ea823bcca10701", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkd6Ay60oCLGDiMR7KMA37s7pesBZydBrXloJnBHmveNVG9vUMVYZXnXg34B1wCv5.u4gcod2D7vAoGaZPA0vQp4ocWSdWTUYqXmvk.NAPNqI7I8AwU6HKjoXuPW6Cw3Yh4HLL3Y_Wd14XM8R6UXhh_w", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABMN Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "8point3 Energy Partners LP (CAFD) Receives Consensus Recommendation of \u201cHold\u201d from Brokerages", "text": "Tweet \nShares of 8point3 Energy Partners LP (NASDAQ:CAFD) have earned a consensus recommendation of \u201cHold\u201d from the nineteen ratings firms that are presently covering the stock, Marketbeat.com reports.

The vitriol came from all over Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, causing the group to close its accounts on those social media networks. Here is a video of the girls introducing themselves: While some netizens are up in arms over the teens calling themselves a \u2018K-pop girl group\u2019, some of Singapore\u2019s own starlets have spoken out in support of the girls, including singer Nathan Hartono, social media stars Preetipls and Dee Kosh, and radio DJ Nic Shields. Preetipls, who is known for her parody videos, was apparently very frustrated by requests to parody Beaunite. ??? @ the people asking me to parody #beaunite \nfirst of all wtf let them live and \nsecond of all leave me alone and let me recover from my damn wisdom tooth surgery!!! \n\u2014 Preeti Nair (@plspreeti) December 6, 2017 YouTuber Dee Kosh also did not see the point in bashing the group, and released a barrage of tweets targeting haters for their comments, starting with this one: To all you Kpop fans asking me to bash that beunite group that\u2019s just having some fun. Y\u2019all are disgusting. These are literally kids just \u201cplaying Kpop\u201d just how you used to play doctor when you were young. \n\u2014 Dee Kosh (@TheDeeKosh) December 5, 2017 Radio DJ Nic Shields also shared a tweet about the group, along with a retweet stating that Beaunite already have hate accounts dedicated to them. omg they\u2019re just a bunch of young girls doing something they like. \nI\u2019m so Glad we didn\u2019t have the Internet when I was growing up so that people couldn\u2019t hate on all the innocent children based activities I did. https://t.co/4eVa5yGbuo \n\u2014 nic (@nicshields) December 5, 2017 Singer Nathan Hartono, who finished third in last year\u2019s Sing! China competition, also came to the defence of the group: #beaunite thoughts: art and beauty have different shades. what matters most is having people who are willing to try being a part of that wonderful spectrum. try and fail. try and succeed. try and try again, crazy ones. but all is lost when all we do is *~bitch and moan~* \u2764\ufe0f \n\u2014 Nathan Hartono (@NathanHartono) December 6, 2017 Blogger Xiaxue, who got into a Twitter war with fans of K-pop groups Monsta-X and EXO earlier this year, kept quiet on the issue, choosing to only share Hartono\u2019s tweet. A member of a K-pop dance cover group in Singapore, who declined to be named, said \u201caspiring to be like your idols or role models isn\u2019t wrong\u201d. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s healthy for youths to have dreams and goals to work towards to,\u201d she told Yahoo Lifestyle Singapore. \u201cThe unfortunate thing about these girls is that they took things the wrong way, and that in turn caused a public controversy and bad image on K-pop cover dancers as a whole,\u201d she said .

And this sends its signal back to the RC. Click to expand... I have tested it outside and it worked. It is not a solid solution and often require to switch off many times everything until you are ready to go but I had few flights in FCC mode by using this method.\nI don't know why, I think once you manage to force the FCC mode correctly the switching window will not appear until RC and AC will lose connection, then it will get back to CE mode. I mean, I think it's not constantly searching for the country area you are In, there is something (like disconnection between rc and ac) that triggers it.\nI don't like messing with GPS but there is no other way by now. It is not just the 500 meters limit distance on CE mode, it is even worse not being able to have a solid connection and video feed even the ac is right in front of you hovering...

Al Green, 70,  introduced a House resolution (H.Res. 646) to impeach President Trump on Wednesday. Representatives motioned to table the articles that claimed Trump \u201cis unfit to be president\u201d and should be \u201cimpeached for high misdemeanors.\u201d\nHowever, the resolution to impeach Trump was voted down by a 364-58 margin, with many members of the Democratic Party voting against Trump\u2019s impeachment.\nIn his articles of impeachment, Green issued two specific articles. The first said that Trump has \n\u201charmed the society of the United States\u2026 by associating the majesty and dignity of the presidency with causes rooted in white supremacy, bigotry, racism, anti-Semitism, white nationalism, or neo-Nazism\u201d on multiple occasions.\n\n\nIn his second article of impeachment, the seven-term representative said that Trump \u201charmed American society by publicly casting contempt on individuals and groups, inciting hate and hostility, sowing discord among the people of the United States, on the basis of race, national origin, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.\u201d\nGreen also specifically referenced the most recent travel ban to six mostlymuslim countries  that fulfilled Trump\u2019s campaign promise of a \u201ccomplete shutdown\u201d of Muslims entering the U.S., the banning of transgender individuals serving in the military, as well as denigrating comments he made about NFL players, Puerto Ricans, and Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.).\nGreen\u2019s efforts to impeach Donald Trump failed woefully, even Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) who can't stand Donald Trump opposed the move.\nPelosi in a statement said:\n\u201cNow is not the time to consider articles of impeachment.\u201d\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frederica wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:52.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f89b90852753bada4392e867d286faf84368c814", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYAzcr8i4cYU.g8YVkl1y.vr", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "Bitfinex is insolvent.

His replacement is American designer Casey Cadwallader. Doesn\u0092t ring a bell? That\u0092s because Cadwallader has spent most of his career behind the scenes. After graduating from Cornell University with a degree in architecture, he worked at TSE, Narciso Rodriguez, Loewe, and J. Mendel before returning to Narciso Rodriguez to become design director for women\u0092s ready-to-wear and accessories. In 2015, he was appointed design director of Acne Studios\u0092s pre-collections, a position he held until being named creative director of Mugler.It\u0092s likely that Cadwallader\u0092s Mugler will look markedly different than that of his predecessor. During the tenure of the label\u0092s founder, Thierry Mugler, the brand stood for a techno-sexuality, embodied by cinched waists, a haute irreverence, and bold architectural curves. In recent memory, first under Nicola Formichetti and then Koma, Mugler became a mainstay of the after-dark scene, the place to shop for slinky, strong separates for a night out. If Cadwallader\u0092s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and Instagram page, which is flooded with images of fine art, are any indication, the designer has an architect\u0092s precision paired with a softer, more organic feel.\n\u0093The Clarins Group is very happy to welcome Casey Cadwallader to Mugler,\u0094 said Sandrine Groslier, president of the Clarins Fragrance Group, Mugler Fashion and Fragrance, in a release. \u0093His determination and unique sensitivity to Mugler\u0092s artistic and experimental heritage will enable us to pursue the renewal of the house in the long term. We are confident that his personal vision and talent will position Mugler among the most sought-after avant-garde fashion brands of today.\u0094 vogue.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:52.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ed9a541dff0304d4837fa12518b60da1ade4914", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSzHN3ayyqN_B80XcdQ8fjUEbih62WuhilXd5AQhPY.GGBE1EbgU938sqE30B1uQqKwqU14Y8HRRC9ZCJlgMyPOUaoAOClfrSFzxSHjjRkVQp1I5gTWOHxuc7EqYQdaKmSZeQYl3Y4Lor_419NptBqDiSMx5Oj4s5RjbU7_uErYLw--", "site_full": "phantompilots.com", "site": "phantompilots.com", "site_section": "https://phantompilots.com/forums/phantom-se.144/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Phantom SE | DJI Phantom Drone Forum", "title": "P3 SE - solution to switching between FCC and CE mode, I used both, and it works for sure! | Page 6", "title_full": "P3 SE - solution to switching between FCC and CE mode, I used both, and it works for sure! | Page 6 | DJI Phantom Drone Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T12:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://phantompilots.com/styles/drift/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 42906, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b495f70c9428ac402a2b12d4dc03cd1108e8821", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSzHN3ayyqN_B80XcdQ8fjUEbih62WuhilXd5AQhPY.GGBE1EbgU938sqE30B1uQqKwqU14Y8HRRC9ZCJlgMyPOUaoAOClfrSFzxSHjjRkVQp1I5gTWOHxuc7EqYQdaKmSZeQYl3Y4Lor_419NptBqDiSMx5Oj4s5QQniqrz_9qyEeEIJgilR_c", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "PhantomFlyer3SE", "published": "2017-12-06T15:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Psycho Andy said: \u2191 After going back to FCC I checked the following scenarios:\n1- Keep GPS FAKE ACTIVE: in this case I stay in fcc with no switching window but I find my drone limited to 50 meters distance, 30 meters height with no way to change this.\n.

(By the way beginner mode limitation is different, it is 30 m distance) I have no Idea what is this 50 meter limitation, and what can be the trigger which activate it.\nBut I readed on the DJI forum more people complain about 50 meter limitation after firmware upgrade...\nSo I realy hope, that it is a just a coincidence that this bug appeared toghether with fake GPS flight.

JoJo's Photography & Design Use this content by Kristen Booth \nLADIES throughout Emerald came together last Friday night, December 1, to show support for each other, whilst raising money for a cause. \nHeld at the Irish Village, Scentsy consultant Cassie Watene and Sarah Clemow organised the event as a way to bring together stay-at- home mums in Emerald. \n\"I wanted to do a night and incorporate other stay- at-home mums with home businesses to be able to network,\u201d Ms Watene said. \n\"Because we don't have a retail set-up, our business is based off who we meet. If we aren't making contacts and meeting people in the community, our businesses can't flourish. \n\"For a lot of people, this is their source of income, so this event was to help get their names out there.\u201d \nThirteen local mums with home-based businesses set up stalls in the car park to help promote their businesses, with the ladies who attended free to browse and socialise at their leisure. Sonya Smith, from Lomani Lane. JoJo's Photography & Design \nStall holders also donated an item from their range to the multiple raffles which were held throughout the night. \nMore than 100 women attended the gold, pink and sparkly fundraising event, which raised $4000 for the nominated charities, the Leukaemia Foundation and local charity Tickled Pink. \n\"After seeing the family of a little boy in my son's class go through a leukaemia diagnosis and their journey for treatment, it seemed like a good cause to get behind,\u201d Ms Watene said. \n\"We wanted to do leukaemia because Sarah knew that little boy as well. Tickled Pink does a lot of fundraising and wanted to keep it local. \n\"The theme was gold, pink and sparkly and everyone dressed up - it was great. \n\"A lot of people went all-out with gold and pink and sparkly things and they bought raffles on the night. Vanessa Bullough, Rebekah Dillon and Lauren Thomasson. JoJo's Photography & Design \n\" Ladies purchased from the market stalls and socialised with their friends. \n\"I wasn't expecting to raise $4000, I was really excited when we raised that much. \n\"The night was great. Everyone seemed to have fun.\u201d \nMs Watene said the event was so successful, she hoped to make it an annual event. \n\"I would love to do the event again next year and I would hope it would be bigger and better,\u201d she said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cassie watene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristen booth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah clemow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rebekah dillon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauren thomasson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jojo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonya smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanessa bullough", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "leukaemia foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jojo's photography & design  stall", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "emerald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scentsy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lomani lane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish village", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:52.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "59648437aab95cb8e403ca4b18ac73d0d02fa5b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSoDRmOR4WuvSAry.cAZP0NvmOfp1o3qK4iOvn4Zclr8virIGkwkjFsujVjWfyIS_0W4cT81VGZjee0MCPS0qNWb5gqSIlV4_x7pgSYGb52tZIUdj04tF8iw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Modern_Family/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "What's the plan, Phil?", "title": "Modern family Season 9 episode 9 \"Tough Love\" discussion thread", "title_full": "Modern family Season 9 episode 9 \"Tough Love\" discussion thread : Modern_Family", "published": "2017-12-07T04:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bcf1d30a9fc91e8d28a072c2b7e6946c37e3e180", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSoDRmOR4WuvSAry.cAZP0NvmOfp1o3qK4iOvn4Zclr8virIGkwkjFsujVjWfyIS_0W4cT81VGZjee0MCPS0qNWb5gqSIlV4_x7pgSYGb52tbLYP867.hBzBvEtUwxtSy6xWLToWrdexo-", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "popkvlt", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Olivia Sandoval .

If one country has a 35% maximum, but deductions and special treatment mean the average effective rate is more like 15% and one compares it to a country with a 25% maximum, but no dodges, which is the more highly taxed?\nHi Tamhas - There are 2 problems here. 1 is the absolute rate and whatever it is 25 or 35% it's still high, period (at a time when all other countries are reducing theirs). The other is the complexity. You have 35% federal plus frigging local/state corp tax plus all of the dodges/work arounds/deductions etc. I can't even imagine how much of headache it is - it's bad enough as an individual.\nThe net result is inversions and untaxed $ overseas. Basically it assigns America the same kind of tax status as a place like Argentina - ie the levels and the complexity drives legitimate business away. The only difference and reason US isn't an economic disaster like Argentina is - it's a massive domestic economy fuelled by a large and well educated talent pool and IP, other policies are generally more pro-business and the IRS/Corp tax cops and corp governance are more stringent in the US.\n80% of the Argentine economy is in the black. Mostly the reason for this is the complexity and hassle factor. I stopped my economic interest in Argentina because it is just unsustainable and not because of the tax rate.\nThe reasons Singapore and HK win best places to do business every year is a combination of the fact that their corp tax rates are a low and simple 20% rate but ALSO the hassle factor is just not there in terms of corp admin, tax complexity, dodges and work arounds etc.\nAnt", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:53.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8453ed274d5415346d4f1fa0bcf41642ab40c80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpT5QECWesuOuwjhSuV5wCqYX.INSzlv9F2Hbq8xkmUnxLJxQlbpxn8VGdzkUpOFfBfMVFHHuNMzh9NnOiNdo6RA", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/free-hot?layout=horizontal", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Free Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK -

The Auggies claimed a 7-6 lead three minutes into the game and maintained the lead throughout the first half, taking a 41-35 lead into the intermission. \nGustavus limited the Auggies to a 30.4 field goal percentage in the second half, out-rebounding them 19-17 as well. 12 unanswered points gave the visitors a 54-53 lead with 7:31 remaining in the game.

PETER, Minn. \u2013 For the third-straight game, the Gustavus women\u2019s basketball team was able to erase a first quarter deficit and proceed to a convincing win, this time 78-56 over Augsburg on Wednesday.

The Gusties slowly added to their lead throughout the second half and never allowed the Auggies to come within striking distance. \nThe Black and Gold did most of its damage from close range, outscoring the Auggies 50-20 in points in the paint. The Gusties shot 54.1 percent from the field, including 61.5 percent in the second half, and edged the rebounding margin 33-32. \nFour Gusties reached double figures, led by Mikayla Miller\u2019s (Sr., Goodhue, Minn.) 20 points on 9-of-15 shooting from the floor. She also added seven assists. Miranda Rice (Sr., Forest Lake Minn.) tallied 18 points, Justine Lee (Jr., Dawson, Minn.) had 14, and Kendall Thompson (Jr., Eden Prairie, Minn.) added 10. Thompson led the Gusties on the glass with six rebounds.

PETER, Minn. \u2013 After sweeping Bethel last weekend in MIAC action, the Gustavus women\u2019s hockey team is set for a top-10 battle this week against UW-River Falls. In a rematch of last season\u2019s NCAA quarterfinal game, the No. 6 Gusties host the No. 5 Falcons at 7 p.m. tonight before traveling to River Falls, Wis. for the second game of series 2:05 p.m. Saturday. The Gusties enter the series 6-1-1 overall, while the Falcons are 6-2-1. \nGUSTAVUS GAME NOTES \nLast time they met: The Gusties scored twice on the power play en route to defeating the University of Wisconsin-River Falls by a score of 3-2 in a NCAA Tournament first round matchup on March 10, avenging their two regular season losses against the Falcons. With the score deadlocked at 2-2 near the end of the third period, a power play goal from Kaitlyn Klein with 3:53 left in the game along with a strong goaltending performance by Amanda DiNella lifted the Gusties to their first NCAA Tournament victory in four years. The Gusties took an early 1-0 lead on Allie Lewis\u2019 ninth goal of the season. Lewis crashed the net and put home the rebound after an Erica Power backhand shot from the high slot, just 6:27 after the opening faceoff. UW-River Falls tied the game 5:44 into the second frame at 1-1, where the score stood for the remainder of the period, out shooting Gustavus again 15-11. Just 32 seconds into the final period, the Falcons converted on the power play to take a 2-1 lead. The Gusties added a power play goal of their own at the 4:39 minute mark. Power won the draw back to Kristen Cash, who took a shot from the point that redirected its way past the Falcon netminder to tie the game at 2-2. With four minutes remaining in the game, the Falcons were handed an interference penalty in which Gustavus quickly took advantage. On the ensuing face off, a fitting game-winner went to the Gusties\u2019 Kaitlyn Klein, as she tallied her team-leading 11th goal of the season after coming back from a season-ending broken neck the season prior. With help from Emily Gustafson and Diana Draayer, Klein buried a rebound as she was placed in the perfect spot back door on the man advantage.

(photo by Matt Berkner, Gustavus Sports Information) \nBOX SCORE | PHOTO GALLERY \nST. PETER, Minn. \u2013 In a high-profile game between two top-10 teams in the nation, it was senior captain Diana Draayer (Deephaven, Minn.) who came up big for the Gustavus women\u2019s hockey team, recording her second career hat trick in a 4-3 win over UW-River Falls on Wednesday night. The No. 6 Gusties move to 7-1-1 with the win, while the No. 5 Falcons fall to 6-2-2. \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier for Diana,\u201d Head Coach Mike Carroll said. \u201cShe\u2019s had a great career and she\u2019s a good leader. She actually wasn\u2019t playing her best in the first period and as the game wore on I flipped her to the other wing to try something different. I don\u2019t know if it made a difference but she works so hard day in and day out, and it\u2019s nice to see her get rewarded.\u201d \nAmelia Vosen (So., Anoka, Minn.) gave Gustavus an early 1-0 lead 4:23 into the game, assisted by Laine Fischer (Jr., Northfield, Minn.) and Kristen Cash (So., Roseville, Minn.) , and the Gusties held the one-goal advantage into the first intermission despite getting outshot 7-2. \nDraayer netter her first goal of the game at the 8:16 mark of the second. Kaitlyn Klein (Sr., Plymouth, Minn.) sent a pass to Katy Fuller (Sr., Minneapolis, Minn.) in the corner who then back-handed a pass directly to Draayer in the slot to bury the puck. Just over a minute later, UW-River Falls ended the shutout and then tied the game 2-2 with 4:20 remaining in the second on a power play. \nAt the 6:42 mark of the third, Draayer tallied her second goal of the game in short-handed fashion. A breakdown in the Falcon defense at its own blue line allowed Draayer to collect the puck and slide it five-hole for the go-ahead goal. The Falcons netted the equalizer at the 11:29 mark, but with 1:55 remaining in the game and the Gusties on the power play, Draayer was looking to center from the corner and fired a shot on net that found the top corner to complete the hat trick. \nUW-River Falls outshot the Gusties 33-16, but goalie Amanda DiNella (Jr., Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.) stood tall with 30 saves. \n\u201cAmanda continues to do really well,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cShe was very upset that she let in those three goals and that\u2019s a tribute to her character. That\u2019s good because she\u2019s thinking what she can do to get better. That resonates through our whole team when you get a goalie that can make some saves when we need them the most.\u201d \nThe Gusties and Falcons complete the series at 2:05 p.m. Saturday in River Falls, Wis. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to learn from this and give a little better effort Saturday because they are a very good hockey team,\u201d Carroll said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt berkner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katy fuller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "draayer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diana draayer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amanda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike carroll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristen cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carroll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laine fischer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gustavus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amelia vosen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaitlyn klein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amanda dinella", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "uw-river falls draayer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gusties", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deephaven", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gustavus sports information", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "falcons", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "so.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minneapolis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oakbrook terrace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roseville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plymouth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ill.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "river falls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. peter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anoka", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:54.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f89b90852753bada4392e867d286faf84368c814", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYAzcr8i4cYU.g8YVkl1y.vr", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "Bitfinex is insolvent.
