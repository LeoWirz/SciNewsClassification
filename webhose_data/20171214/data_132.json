By : Aprameya C December 7, 2017 14:10 IST Sachin Tendulkar (second right) during the launch of his mobile game in Bengaluru on Thursday (December 7). Aprameya .C \nFormer captain and batting legend Sachin Tendulkar has picked his \"100 important innigs\" of his life that shaped his career. And the knocks are not restricted to only international cricket. \nTendulkar, who set several records during his illustrious 24-year international cricket, on Thursday (December 7), launched his mobile game \"Sachin Saga Cricket Champions\" in Bengaluru and after unveiling it he spoke about his best 100 innings. \nAlso read: Tendulkar on ball tampering \nThe Master Blaster, who holds the world record for scoring most centuries in international cricket - 100, has picked his best knocks and can be seen only on his mobile game. \n\"That is not the case. We are talking about 100 important innings of my life which shaped my career. We are not looking at only hundreds,\" Tendulkar said when asked whether the 100 innings were only about his 100 tons. \nThe 44-year-old explained that apart from hundreds there were matches where even a half century as \"priceless\". \nHe said, \"There could be important 60 runs scored in a match. Those 60 runs are priceless. Eventually I had to assess which match was important. It was like, my first Ranji Trophy game was most important game at that stage. Because there were still question marks over my selection for Mumbai, whether a 15-year-old would go out and be able to play or not. If he doesn't perform that should not destroy his confidence. It should not shatter him. Those kind of things were going on. Then I go out and socred a hundred. \n\"It sorted out for me and for the rest of the guys. The remaining part of the season also I had lot of runs. Basically we have taken those kind of matches. It is not that everytime you go out you have to score a hundred. It could be important 65 runs. We have chosen those kind of games. And again you have to score same number of runs as I did in that particular game. It is a challenge.\" \nIt would have been a difficult task for Tendulkar to pick 100 knocks from his career. He played in a world record 200 Tests, 463 ODIs and one T20I. Overall, he featured in 310 first-class, 551 List A (50-over) and 96 T20s. \nTendulkar's mobile game is available to download for free on Google Play. One can enjoy match situations of Tendulkar and bat like him in this mobile game.

We noted that this series would only serve the purpose of basic information about SME loan in the focused banks adding that you may need to visit the banks for more information. Naira \nFor Stanbic IBTC we also noted that one of the key offers to SMEs is what they call, SME Overdraft, designed to help SMEs make payments from their business current account even when the amount they needed exceeds the available cash balance in their account. Details are in our last week\u2019s edition and also online. \nBut today we conclude this opening part of the series with basic requirements for Stanbic IBTC SME Overdraft. \nFirst you need to know that you should be maintaining a current account in the bank in your company name. \nSome basic requirements for this loan includes, the full names and official positions of those signing the loan deal, usually owners in the position of managing director, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer (may be the head of accounts or chief accountatnt). \nThey should supply their curriculum vitae as well as those of other management team. \nYou should also state the reason you need the overdraft, usually captured as business plan on how the loan would be utilised. \nThese should be accompanied with your companies\u2019 financial statements, including an income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statements. \nThere should also be a personal statements of assets and liabilities of all the partners, members or directors of your company. \nFinally, you should provide a 12-month cash flow estimate of your business. \nIt is advisable to use financial experts for most of these requirements, but the bank can also help you out.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emeka anaeto  stanbic ibtc", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stanbic ibtc bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanbic ibtc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "small & medium enterprises", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:58.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cce9b4f0044044aa5f77cc4c9dd3a6fa4b372b08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_svaRXjWvcw5kfkKF.LfsurZ2_NuqI6jesd4QEeBOFX1_rMiwltpr7YIiXdkeEsdaGjrLmNx.Kq77r849SKDYdrm798JLeP0r.IBQo1EdIBk9DTJsfl4QjpzgLGV01GoNkEiHySXogRbblvZsC1KZj", "site_full": "www.info-mauritius.com", "site": "info-mauritius.com", "site_section": "http://www.info-mauritius.com/forum/maps/forum/mauritius-hotels-unterkunfte/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Site map of Mauritius Hotels-Unterk\u00fcnfte", "title": "http://www.nutritionofhealth.ca/t-boost-explosion/", "title_full": "http://www.nutritionofhealth.ca/t-boost-explosion/ : Fragen zu Mauritius", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.448, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cce9b4f0044044aa5f77cc4c9dd3a6fa4b372b08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_svaRXjWvcw5kfkKF.LfsurZ2_NuqI6jesd4QEeBOFX1_rMiwltpr7YIiXdkeEsdaGjrLmNx.Kq77r849SKDYdrm798JLeP0r.IBQo1EdIBk9DTJsfl4QjpzgLGV01GoNkEiHySXogRbblvZsC1KZj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "http://www.nutritionofhealth.ca/t-boost-explosion/", "text": "T Boost Explosion By adding this supplement in your daily routine, you will be able to develop your desired muscles naturally.

Stewart lived in Dunnegan when he was hired in August 2016 and moved to Bolivar in November 2016, Lampert said. \nLampert said when Stewart was hired, he was told he needed to be \u201cavailable in an emergency \u2026 This was rare, for emergencies, if the sewer was having major flooding and back up. This is not an everyday thing.\u201d \n\u201cHe was told at the time he was hired he just needs to be a reasonable distance away,\u201d Lampert said. \u201cThere was no hard distance.\u201d \nAccording to the city\u2019s response in the court file, the public works department \u201chas had an internal policy (admittedly unwritten) in place that all new hires for the WWTP must live in close proximity to the WWTP so that they can be on call\u201d since March 2014. The document said Public Works Director Jerry Hamby and WWTP Supervisor Joe Cornell told Stewart about the requirement at the time he was hired. \nThe city\u2019s job description for a waste water laborer, provided to the BH-FP by Lampert, does not indicate a residency requirement. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re in government, there\u2019s no such thing as an unwritten rule,\u201d Lampert said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to rely on a rule, it needs to be written down. Otherwise, it\u2019s non-existent.\u201d \nLampert said he knows of four instances of verbal or written reprimands \u201cfor unsatisfactory performance\u201d in Stewart\u2019s six months with the city. \nAccording to the city\u2019s response provided by Lampert, Stewart was verbally disciplined twice in November 2016, once for careless driving and once for failing to follow procedures when keeping record of WWTP samples. \nIn February, after the city was aware of Stewart\u2019s plan to move to Springfield, he received a written warning \u201cto put the WWTP loading hose in the barn to keep from freezing.\u201d The city\u2019s response said he was given a verbal warning three times, but Lampert said he does not have documents verifying the verbal warnings. \nOn the same day, Stewart also received a written warning for failing or refusing to answer his city-issued cell phone when Hamby and Cornell attempted to contact him.

The robustness and ability of an application is an important aspect of making a good application for excellent user experience. \nThe simulation results in the prototype help boast developers confidence and encourage to add few more features to the prototype because of the if the virtual works the real isn\u2019t far behind. \nPrototyping tools have proven out to be the best user experience and user interface and are as fascinating for an artist as it is for a coder. The artist can sketch his mind image using different shades and see the final results for its prototype whereas, on the other hand, it\u2019s a friend to the coder as he can walk his application walk through all stages and see the implementation virtually.\nThe server code for API can also be built with the help of the prototyping. \nLet\u2019s check out some of the app prototyping tools \n\uf0fc Ionic creator: This tool helps the mobile app developers to create and manage the ionic app . It is a drag and drops prototyping tool or every platform may it be iOS, Android or web. \n\uf0fc Sketch: It is an exclusively macOS prototyping application. Although sketch comes embedded with other prototyping tools like Photoshop. \nThe only advantage sketch has is it has flexible symbol usage. \n\uf0fc Baslamiq: This prototyping tool runs on the web, OS X and windows, and prototypes for Android, web, iOS. The feature it offers is rapid prototyping, brainstorming, designers who like sketching. \n\uf0fc Invision: The main feature of Invision is that it is designed for large teams. Commenting directly on the prototype is given by Invision for instant feedbacks; the reminders for auto-update are initiated by the tool and the synchronization with dropbox, cloud, Google drive, and slack. \nSteps to keep in mind while developing an app prototype \nStep 1: Find the problem The very first step is to see the problems around you to be solved and if the solution for the same is possible or not and how can it be relevant for profit as well. Step 2: Identify the features of your application The application with just one feature is no more accepted by any user, there has to be a unique feature of the application and all other features as well. Step 3: Decide the screen for your application Now that the concepts have been built around what problem needs to be solved and what features will the application hold? Now it\u2019s time for screen orientation selection. The contents and the interface of the application can be drawn using prototyping tools. Step 4: Convert your sketch to wireframes After the sketch for the screen is read prepare for the wired frames which means how the application is going to react to the user. For example, first there will be a login page, then the filters, product display and finally payment gateway. Step 5: Wireframes into the prototype The prototype is now ready for the trail by the audience and the tools can help integrate the wireframes into an application prototype from which the feedback can be drawn for future improvement. Step6: Final Design Finally, its time to showcase your application now to get your application on the pixels you can contact the top-rated mobile application development companies or contact freelancer for the same. \nTo conclude: The prototyping tools are the saver of mobile app developers , it adds the real hardware experience to the application and helps remove the errors possible on an emulator in order to minimize the error after the implementation is done and the application is out for trial. These tools help a developer overcome the possible failures by providing testing by users, proofs of concept, a test of concept etc. \nThe application prototype may be prepared for different industries and might require a different kind of tools.

December 7, 2017 14:09 IST RBI Governor, Urjit Patel Reuters file \nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has fixed a lower merchant discount rate (MDR) for businesses with a turnover of below Rs 20 lakh. The move will allow small shops to accept more debit card payments as they have to pay less fee to the bank on card transactions. \nThrough the new regime, the RBI removed the progressive charge structure that was introduced during demonetisation. Under this structure, the merchants had to pay more for higher value transactions irrespective of their scale of business. \nHowever, after the decision to reduce the fees on debit card transaction value, a small merchant will pay only 0.40 percent of the transaction value if his turnover for the previous year is below Rs 20 lakh. \nBesides this, the maximum fee has been capped at Rs 200 which means that for all debit card payments above Rs 50,000, the merchant will pay a flat fee of Rs 200. Also, the maximum fee for large businesses has been capped at Rs 1,000. \n\"We thought a further push to debit card usage is needed and we decided to rationalize MDR which is intended to widen the network of merchant establishments who use debit cards,\" said B.P. Kanungo, Deputy Governor at RBI. \n\"This new rule will leave money on the table for merchants so that they add more technology,\" he added. Government is pushing for higher digital transactions to turn India into a less cash economy. (Representational Image) REUTERS \nThe new structure will push more digital payments and the banks will also have to ensure that the MDR levied on merchants should not exceed the cap rates and that the merchants on-boarded by banks do not pass on MDR charges to customers. \nThe new rates will be effective from 1 st January 2018. \n\"While there should not be any price regulation by the regulator, but the final guidelines are much clearer. Its benefits will trickle down to the lowest merchant category,'' said Naveen Surya, Chairman, Payments Council of India. \n\"I don't see any specific exemption given to the government transactions which is a positive move,\" he added.

Kaiser and phys ician Sidney Garfield. Kaiser Permanente is made up of three distinct but interdependent groups of entities: the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (KFHP) and its regional operating subsidiaries; Kaiser Foundation Hospitals; and the regional Permanente Medical Groups. As of 2014, Kaiser Permanente operates in eight states and the District of Columbia, and is the largest managed care organization in the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Kaiser Permanente had 10.2 million health plan members, 186,497 employees, 18,652 physicians, 51,010 nurses, 38 medical centers, and 622 medical offices. As of December 31, 2015, the non-profit Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals entities reported a combined $1.9 billion in net income on $60.7 billion in operating revenues. Each Permanente Medical Group operates as a separate for-profit partnership or professional corporation in its individual territory, and while none publicly reports its financial results, each is primarily funded by reimbursements from its respective regional Kaiser Foundation Health Plan entity. KFHP is one of the largest not-for-profit organizations in the United States.\nKP's quality of care has been highly rated and attributed to a strong emphasis on preventive care, its doctors being salaried rather than paid on a fee-for-service basis, and an attempt to minimize the time patients spend in high-cost hospitals by carefully planning their stay. However, Kaiser has had disputes with its employees' unions, repeatedly faced civil and criminal charges for falsification of records and patient dumping, faced action by regulators over the quality of care it provided, especially to patients with mental health issues, and has faced criticism from activists and action from regulators over the size of its cash reserves.\n\n\nStructure and governance \n\nsource : Kaiser Permanente fined $4 million over long waits for mental ... \nKaiser Permanente provides care throughout eight regions in the United States. Two or three (four, in the case of California) distinct but interdependent legal entities form the Kaiser system within each region. This structure was adopted by Kaiser Permanente physicians and leaders in 1955.\nGovernance Each entity of Kaiser Permanente has its own management and governance structure, although all of the structures are interdependent and cooperative to a great extent. There are multiple affiliated non-profits registered with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. According to Form 990 governance questions, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan do not have members with the power to appoint or elect board members, meaning that the board itself nominates and appoints new members.\nChairman and CEO George Halvorson retired in December 2013, after serving since 2002.\nOn November 5, 2012, the board of directors announced that Bernard J. Tyson, Kaiser's president and chief operating officer for the last two years, would replace Halvorson \u00e2\u20ac\" the first time an African American was appointed to that position.\nNational structure The two types of organizations which make up each regional entity are:\nKaiser Foundation Health Plans (KFHP) work with employers, employees, and individual members to offer prepaid health plans and insurance. The health plans are not-for-profit and provide infrastructure for and invest in Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and provide a tax-exempt shelter for the for-profit medical groups. Permanente Medical Groups are physician-owned organizations, which provide and arrange for medical care for Kaiser Foundation Health Plan members in each respective region. The medical groups are for-profit partnerships or professional corporations and receive nearly all of their funding from Kaiser Foundation Health Plans. The first medical group, The Permanente Medical Group, formed in 1948 in Northern California. Kaiser doctors become Permanente stockholders after three years at the company. In addition, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals operates medical centers in California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii, and outpatient facilities in the remaining Kaiser Permanente regions. The hospital foundations are not-for-profit and rely on the Kaiser Foundation Health Plans for funding. They also provide infrastructure and facilities that benefit the for-profit medical groups.\nRegional entities Kaiser Permanente is administered through eight regions, including one parent and six subordinate health plan entities, one hospital entity, and nine separate, affiliated medical groups:\nIn addition to the regional entities, in 1996, the then-twelve Permanente Medical Groups created The Permanente Federation, a separate entity, which focuses on standardizing patient care and performance under one name and system of policies. Around the same time, The Permanente Company was also chartered as a vehicle to provide investment opportunities for the for-profit Permanente Medical Groups. One of the ventures of the Permanente Company is Kaiser Permanente Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in emerging medical technologies.\nHistory \n\nsource : Kaiser Permanente\u00c2\u00ae | UC Berkeley | University of California \nEarly years The history of Kaiser Permanente dates to 1933 and a tiny hospital in the town of Desert Center, California. At that time, Henry J. Kaiser and several other large construction contractors had formed an insurance consortium called Industrial Indemnity to meet their workers' compensation obligations. Dr. Sidney Garfield had just finished his residency at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center at a time when jobs were scarce; fortunately, he was able to secure a contract with Industrial Indemnity to care for 5,000 construction workers building the Colorado River Aqueduct in the Mojave Desert. Soon enough, Garfield's new hospital was in a precarious financial state (with mounting debt and the staff of three going unpaid), due in part to Garfield's desire to treat all patients regardless of ability to pay, as well as his insistence on equipping the hospital adequately so that critically injured patients could be stabilized for the long journey to full-service hospitals in Los Angeles.\nHowever, Garfield won over two Industrial Indemnity executives, Harold Hatch and Alonzo B. Ordway. It was Hatch who proposed to Garfield the specific solution that would lead to the creation of Kaiser Permanente: Industrial Indemnity would prepay 17.5% of premiums, or $1.50 per worker per month, to cover work-related injuries, while the workers would each contribute five cents per day to cover non-work-related injuries. Later, Garfield also credited Ordway with coming up with the general idea of prepayment for industrial healthcare. Garfield also later explained that he did not know much at the time about other similar health plans except for the Ross-Loos Medical Group.\nHatch's solution enabled Garfield to bring his budget back into the positive, and to experiment with providing a broader range of services to the workers besides pure emergency care. By the time work on the aqueduct concluded and the project was wrapped up, Garfield had paid off all his debts, was supervising ten physicians at three hospitals, and controlled a financial reserve of $150,000.\nGarfield returned to Los Angeles for further study at County-USC with the intent of entering private practice. However, in March 1938, Consolidated Industries (a consortium led by the Kaiser Company) initiated work on a contract for the upper half of the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state, and took over responsibility for the thousands of workers who had worked for a different construction consortium on the first half of the dam. Edgar Kaiser, Henry's son, was in charge of the project. To smooth over relations with the workers (who had been treated poorly by their earlier employer), Hatch and Ordway persuaded Edgar to meet with Garfield, and in turn Edgar persuaded Garfield to tour the Grand Coulee site. Garfield subsequently agreed to reproduce at Grand Coulee Dam what he had done on the Colorado River Aqueduct project. He immediately spent $100,000 on renovating the decrepit Mason City Hospital and hired seven physicians.\nUnlike the workers on Garfield's first project, many workers at Grand Coulee Dam had brought dependents with them. The unions soon forced the Kaiser Company to expand its plan to cover dependents, which resulted in a dramatic shift from industrial medicine into family practice and enabled Garfield to formulate some of the basic principles of Kaiser Permanente. It was also during this time that Henry Kaiser personally became acquainted with Garfield and forged a friendship which lasted until Kaiser's death.\nWorld War II In 1939, the Kaiser Company began work on several huge shipbuilding contracts in Oakland, and by the end of 1941 would control four major shipyards on the West Coast. During 1940, the expansion of the American defense-industrial complex in preparation for entrance into World War II resulted in a massive increase in the number of employees at the Richmond shipyard. In January 1941, Henry Kaiser asked Garfield to set up an insurance plan for the Richmond workers (this was merely contract negotiation with insurance companies), and a year later Kaiser asked Garfield to duplicate at Richmond what he had done at Desert Center and Mason City. Unlike the two other projects, the resulting entity lived on after the construction project that gave birth to it, and it is the direct ancestor of today's Kaiser Permanente.\nOn March 1, 1942, Sidney R. Garfield & Associates opened its offices in Oakland to provide care to 20,000 workers, followed by the opening of the Permanente Health Plan on June 1. From the beginning, Kaiser Permanente strongly supported preventive medicine and attempted to educate its members about maintaining their own health.\nIn July, the Permanente Foundation formed to operate Northern California hospitals that would be linked to the outpatient health plans, followed shortly thereafter by the creation of Northern Permanente Foundation for Oregon and Washington and Southern Permanente Foundation for California. The name Permanente came from Permanente Creek, which flowed past Henry Kaiser's first cement plant on Black Mountain in Cupertino, California. Kaiser's first wife, Bess Fosburgh, liked the name. An abandoned Oakland facility was modernized as the 170-bed Permanente Hospital opened on August 1, 1942. Three weeks later, the 71-bed Richmond Field Hospital opened. Six first aid stations were set up in the shipyards to treat industrial accidents and minor illness. Each first aid station had an ambulance ready to rush patients to the surgical field hospital if required. Stabilized patients could be moved to the larger hospital for recuperative care. The Northern Permanente Hospital opened two weeks later to serve workers at the Kaiser shipyard in Vancouver, Washington. Shipyard workers paid seven cents per day for comprehensive health care coverage; and within a year the shipyard health plan employed sixty physicians with salaries between $450 and $1,000 per month. These physicians established California Physicians Service to offer similar health coverage to the families of shipyard workers. In 1944, Kaiser decided to continue the program after the war and to open it up to the general public.\nMeanwhile, during the war years, the American Medical Association (AMA) (which opposed managed care organizations from their very beginning) tried to defuse demand for managed care by promoting the rapid expansion of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield preferred provider organization networks.\nCourage to Heal , a novel by KP Historical Society President, Paul Bernstein, MD, is based on the story of Garfield's life, his struggles with the AMA, and the origins of Kaiser Permanente.\nPostwar growth In 1948, Kaiser established the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, (also known as Kaiser Family Foundation), a U.S.-based, non-profit, private operating foundation focusing on the major health care issues facing the nation. The Foundation, not associated with Kaiser Permanente or Kaiser Industries, is an independent voice and source of facts and analysis for policymakers, the media, the health care community, and the general public.\nThe end of World War II brought about a huge plunge in Kaiser Permanente membership; for example, 50,000 workers had left the Northern California yards by July 1945. Membership bottomed out at 17,000 for the entire system but then surged back to 26,000 within six months as Garfield aggressively marketed his plan to the public. Sidney Garfield & Associates had been a sole proprietorship, but in 1948, it was reorganized into a partnership, Permanente Medical Group.\nDuring this period, a substantial amount of growth came from union members; the unions saw Kaiser Permanente care as more affordable and comprehensive than what was available at the time from private physicians under the fee-for-service system. For example, Fortune magazine had reported in 1944 that 90% of the U.S. population could not afford fee-for-service healthcare. Kaiser Permanente membership soared to 154,000 in 1950, 283,000 in 1952, 470,000 in 1954, 556,000 in 1956, and 618,000 in 1958.\nFrom 1944 onward, both Kaiser Permanente and Garfield fought numerous attacks from the AMA and various state and local medical societies. Henry Kaiser came to the defense of both Garfield and the health plans he had created.\nIn 1951, the organization acquired its current name when Henry Kaiser unilaterally directed the trustees of the health plans, hospital foundations, and medical groups to add his name before Permanente. However, the physicians in the Permanente Medical Group deeply resented the implication that they were directly controlled by Kaiser, and successfully forced him to back off with respect to their part of the organization. That same year, Kaiser Permanente also began experiments with large-scale multiphasic screening to identify unknown conditions and to facilitate treatment of known ones. Simultaneously, although no one questioned his medical competence, Garfield's deficiencies as an executive were becoming apparent as the organization expanded far beyond his ability to manage it properly.\nHenry Kaiser became fascinated with the healthcare system created for him by Garfield and began to directly manage Kaiser Permanente and Garfield. This resulted in a financial disaster when Kaiser splurged on the new Walnut Creek hospital; his constant intermeddling led to significant friction at every level of the organization. The situation was not helped by Kaiser's marriage to Garfield's head administrative nurse (who had helped care for Kaiser's first wife on her deathbed), convincing Garfield to marry the sister of that nurse, and then having Garfield move in next door to him. Clifford Keene (who would eventually serve as president of Kaiser Permanente) later recalled that this arrangement resulted in a rather dysfunctional and combative family in charge of Kaiser Permanente.\nKeene was an experienced Permanente physician whom Garfield had personally hired in 1946. During 1953 he had been trying to get a job at U.S. Steel, but on the morning of December 5, 1953, with internal tensions worsening day by day, Garfield met with Keene at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco and asked him to turn around the organization. It took Keene 15 years to realize that Kaiser had forced Garfield to ask Keene to become his replacement. Due to the chaos on the board, Keene at first took control with the vague title of Executive Associate, but it soon became clear to everyone that he was actually in charge and Garfield was to become a lobbyist and \"ambassador\" for the HMO concept.\nHowever, even with Garfield relieved of day-to-day management duties, the underlying problem of Henry Kaiser's authoritarian management style continued to persist. After several tense confrontations between Kaiser and Permanente Medical Group physicians, the doctors met with Kaiser's top adviser, Eugene Trefethen, at Kaiser's personal estate near Lake Tahoe on July 12, 1955. Trefethen came up with the idea of a contract between the medical groups and the health plans and hospital foundations which would set out roles, responsibilities, and financial distribution. Trefethen, already a successful attorney, went on to a successful career with Kaiser Permanente and in retirement became a famous vintner.\nWhile Keene and Trefethen struggled to fix the damage from Kaiser's micromanagement and Garfield's ineffectual management, Henry Kaiser moved to Oahu in 1956 and insisted on expanding Kaiser Permanente into Hawaii in 1958. He quickly ruined what should have been a simple project, and only a last-minute intervention by Keene and Trefethen in August 1960 prevented the total disintegration of the Hawaii organization. By that year, Kaiser membership had grown to 808,000.\nManaged care era Having overseen Kaiser Permanente's successful transformation from Henry Kaiser's healthcare experiment into a large-scale self-sustaining enterprise, Keene retired in 1975. By 1976, membership reached three million. In 1977, all six of Kaiser Permanente's regions had become federally qualified health maintenance organizations. Historians now believe then-President Richard Nixon specifically had Kaiser Permanente in mind when he signed the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, as the organization was mentioned in an Oval Office discussion of the Act, where John Ehrlichman characterized Kaiser's philosophy thus: \"All the incentives are toward less medical care, because the less care they give them, the more money they make.\" In 1980, Kaiser acquired a non-profit group practice to create its Mid-Atlantic region, encompassing the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. In 1985, Kaiser Permanente expanded to Georgia.\nRegional evolution By 1990, Kaiser Permanente provided coverage for about a third of the population of the cities of San Francisco and Oakland; total Northern California membership was over 2.4 million.\nElsewhere, Kaiser Permanente did not do as well, and its geographic footprint changed significantly in the 1990s. The organization spun off or closed outposts in Texas, North Carolina, and the Northeast. In 1998, Kaiser Permanente sold its Texas operations, where reported problems had become so severe that the organization directed its lawyers to attempt to block the release of a Texas Department of Insurance report. This prompted the state attorney general to threaten to revoke the organization's license. Kaiser Permanente closed health plans in Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham in North Carolina four years later. The organization also sold its unprofitable Northeast division in 2000. The Ohio division was sold to Catholic Health Partners in 2013.\nIn 1995, Kaiser Permanente celebrated its fiftieth anniversary as a public health plan. Two years later, national membership reached nine million. In 1997, the organization established an agreement with the AFL-CIO to explore a new approach to the relationship between management and labor, known as the Labor Management Partnership. Going into the new millennium, competition in the managed care market increased dramatically, raising new concerns. The Southern California Permanente Medical Group saw declining rates of new members as other managed care groups, notably HealthCare Partners, flourished.\nKP HealthConnect In 2002, Kaiser Permanente abandoned its attempt to build its own clinical information system with IBM, writing-off some $452 million in software assets. This information technology failure led to major changes in the organization's approach to digital records. Under George Halvorson's direction, Kaiser looked closely at two medical software vendors, Cerner and Epic Systems, ultimately selecting Epic as the primary vendor for a new system, branded KP HealthConnect. Although Kaiser's approach shifted to \"buy, not build,\" the project was unprecedented for a civilian system in size and scope. Deployed across all eight regions over six years and at a cost of more than $6 billion, by 2010, it was the largest civilian electronic medical record system, serving more than 8.6 million Kaiser Permanente members, implemented at a cost exceeding a half million dollars per physician.\nInternational reputation Early in the 21st century the NHS and UK Department of Health became impressed with some aspects of the Kaiser operation, and initiated a series of studies involving several healthcare organizations in England. Visits occurred and suggestions of adopting some KP policies are currently active. The management of hospital bed-occupancy by KP, by means of integrated management in and out of hospital and monitoring progress against care pathways has given rise to trials of similar techniques in eight areas of the UK.\nIn 2002, a controversial study by California-based academics published in the British Medical Journal compared Kaiser to the British National Health Service, finding Kaiser to be superior in several respects. Subsequently, a group of health policy academics who were experts on the NHS published a competing analysis claiming that Kaiser's costs were actually substantially higher than the NHS and for a younger and healthier population.\nQuality of care \n\nsource : Kaiser Permanente Medical Center \u00e2\u20ac\" San Bruno Chamber of Commerce \nIn the California Healthcare Quality Report Card 2013 Edition, Kaiser Permanente's Northern California and Southern California regions, Kaiser received four out of four possible stars in Meeting National Standards of Care. Kaiser North and South also received three out of four stars in Members Rate Their HMO. KP's performance has been attributed to three practices: First, KP places a strong emphasis on preventive care, reducing costs later on. Second, its doctors are salaried rather than paid per service, which removes the main incentive for doctors to perform unnecessary procedures. Thirdly, KP attempts to minimize the time patients spend in high-cost hospitals by carefully planning their stay and by shifting care to outpatient clinics. This practice results in lower costs per member, cost savings for KP and greater doctor attention to patients. A comparison to the UK's National Health Service found that patients spend 2\u00e2\u20ac\"5 times as much time in NHS hospitals as compared to KP hospitals.\nIn June 2013, the California Department of Managed Health Care levied a $4 million fine, the second largest in the agency's history, against Kaiser for not providing adequate mental health care to its patients. Alleged violations of California's timely access laws included failures to accurately track wait times and track doctor availability amid evidence of inconsistent electronic and paper records. It was also found by the DMHC that patients received written materials circulated by Kaiser dissuading them from seeking care, a violation of state and federal laws. DMHC also issued a cease and desist order for Kaiser to end the practices. DMHC conducted a follow up investigation which published in April 2015. The report found Kaiser had put systems in place to better track how patients were being cared for, but still had not addressed problems with actually providing mental health care that complied with state and federal laws. Kaiser's challenges on this front were exacerbated by a long, unresolved labor dispute with the union representing therapists.\nKaiser appealed the findings, the order, and the fine, and sought to keep the proceedings closed, but in September 2014, in the face of the administrative judge's order to keep the proceedings open, and facing the beginning of public testimony, Kaiser withdrew the appeal and paid the $4 million. It also issued a statement which denied much of the wrongdoing. Kaiser faces ongoing inspections by DMHC and three class-action lawsuits related to the issues identified by the DMHC.\nHistorical issues In 2006 Kaiser settled five cases for alleged patient dumping\u00e2\u20ac\"the delivery of homeless hospitalized patients to other agencies or organizations in order to avoid expensive medical care\u00e2\u20ac\"between 2002 and 2005. Los Angeles city officials had filed civil and criminal legal action against Kaiser Permanente for patient dumping, which was the first action of its kind that the city had taken. The city's decision to charge Kaiser Permanente reportedly was influenced by security camera footage, allegedly showing a 63-year-old patient, dressed in hospital gown and slippers, wandering toward a mission on Skid Row. At the time that the complaint was filed, city officials said that 10 other hospitals were under investigation for similar issues. Kaiser settled the case, paying $5,000 in civil penalties and agreeing to spend $500,000 on services for the homeless. During that same period, the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General settled 102 cases against U.S. hospitals which resulted in a monetary payment to the agency.\nIn 2004, Northern California Kaiser Permanente initiated an in-house program for kidney transplantation. Prior to opening the transplant center, Northern California Kaiser patients would generally receive transplants at medical centers associated with the University of California (UC San Francisco and UC Davis). Upon opening the transplant center, Kaiser required that members who are transplant candidates in Northern California obtain services exclusively through its internal KP-owned transplant center.\nWhile it was in operation, the Kaiser program had a 100% survival rate, which is better than other transplant centers. However, patients who needed a kidney were less likely to be offered one. Northern California Kaiser performed 56 transplants in 2005, and twice that many patients died while waiting for a kidney. At other California transplant centers, more than twice as many people received kidneys than died during the same period. Unlike other centers, the Kaiser program did not perform riskier transplants or use donated organs from elderly or other higher-risk people, which have worse outcomes. Northern California Kaiser closed the kidney transplant program in May 2006. As before, Northern California Kaiser now pays for pre-transplant care and transplants at other hospitals. This change affected approximately 2,000 patients.\nResearch and publishing \n\nsource : Kaiser Permanente Insurance Quote - 44billionlater \nKaiser operates a Division of Research, which annually conducts between 200 and 300 studies, and the Center for Health Research which in 2009 had more than 300 active studies. Kaiser's bias toward prevention is reflected in the areas of interest\u00e2\u20ac\"vaccine and genetic studies are prominent. The work is funded primarily by federal, state, and other outside (non-Kaiser) institutions.\nControversies \n\nsource : Kaiser Permanente Design Standards Take Holistic Approach \nMandatory arbitration In order to contain costs, Kaiser requires an agreement by planholders to submit patient malpractice claims to arbitration rather than litigating through the court system. This has triggered some opposition.\nWilfredo Engalla is a notable case. In 1991, Engalla died of lung cancer nearly five months after submitting a written demand for arbitration. The California Supreme Court found that Kaiser had a financial incentive to wait until after Engalla died; his spouse could recover $500,000 from Kaiser if the case was arbitrated while he was alive, but only $250,000 after he died. The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights contends that Kaiser continues to oppose HMO arbitration reform.\nWatchdogs have accused Kaiser of abusing the power imbalance inherent in the arbitration system. Kaiser engages in many cases whereas a customer will usually engage in just one and Kaiser can reject any arbitrator unilaterally, thus they can select company-friendly arbitrators over those that rule in favor of customers. As a large organization, Kaiser can also afford to spend much more on lawyers and orators than the customer, giving them more advantages. In response to criticisms, Kaiser established an Office of Independent Administrators (OIA) in 1999 to oversee the arbitration process. The degree to which this office is actually independent has been questioned.\nPatients and consumer interest groups sporadically attempt to bring lawsuits against Kaiser Permanente. Recent lawsuits include Gary Rushford's 1999 attempt to use proof of a physician lie to overturn an arbitration decision.\nIn one case, Kaiser attempted to significantly expand the scope of its arbitration agreements by arguing it should be able to force nonsignatories to its member contracts into arbitration, merely because those third parties had allegedly caused an injury to a Kaiser member which Kaiser had then allegedly exacerbated through its medical malpractice. The California Court of Appeal for the First District did not accept that argument: \"Absent a written agreement\u00e2\u20ac\"or a preexisting relationship or authority to contract for another that might substitute for an arbitration agreement\u00e2\u20ac\"courts sitting in equity may not compel third party nonsignatories to arbitrate their disputes.\"\nLabor unions While Doctors of Medicine (M.D.) and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) are partners within the for-profit physician groups, many employees are members of various unions and guilds, depending on their role and service area.\nKP's California operations were the target of four labor strikes in 2011 and 2012, two (Sept 2011 and Jan 2012) involved more than 20,000 nurses, mental health providers, and other professionals. The National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW) has accused Kaiser of deliberately stalling negotiations while profiting $2.1 billion in 2011 and paying its CEO George Halvorson $9 million annually. The workers were dissatisfied with proposed changes to pensions and other benefits.\nOn November 11, 2014, up to 18,000 nurses went on strike at KP hospitals in Northern California over Ebola safeguards and patient-care standards during union contract talks. 21 hospitals and 35 clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area were affected.\nCash reserves Jamie Court, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights has said that Kaiser's retained profits are evidence that Kaiser policies are overpriced and that health insurance regulation is needed.\nState insurance regulations require that insurers maintain certain minimum amounts of cash reserves to ensure that they are able to meet their obligations; the amount varies by insurer, based on its risk factors, such as its investments, how many people it insures, and other factors; a few states also have caps on how large the reserves can be.\nKaiser has been criticized by activists and state regulators for the size of its cash reserves. As of 2015, it had $21.7 billion in cash reserves, which was about 1,600% the amount required by California state regulations. Its reserves had been a target of advertising by Consumer Watchdog supporting Proposition 45 in California's 2014 elections. At the end of 2010 Kaiser held $666 million in reserves, which was about 1,300% of the minimum required under Colorado state law. Those funds were in Kaiser's risk-based capital account, held to pay for disasters or major projects. In 2008, the Colorado regulator required Kaiser to spend down its reserves; after negotiations Kaiser agreed to spend $155 million of its reserves giving credits to its clients and building clinics in underserved parts of the state.\nSee also \n\nsource : Thank heaven for insurance companies: Is Kaiser Permanente ... \nHeather O'Rourke (1975\u00e2\u20ac\"1988) \u00e2\u20ac\" child actress who became ill in 1987 and was misdiagnosed by doctors of Kaiser Permanente Hospital.

Hopefully, they\u2019ll keep wearing the shirts they made and perhaps even dye a few more things in the future. \n\nNo related posts.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45b0b18280035d6bb88972b6a256e9447b052a44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZJQ0uU6gXzZkwKCvvpj80zCL8e_gXbGQrQBr7XT4xbFSkWBmY560ncIJj8LbNC93siuea0qTE776o_BD2mWAmMbO807mYv52pRLTeAamloFwICY40R2Z4", "site_full": "www.artmajeur.com", "site": "artmajeur.com", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ArtmajeurDaily", "site_categories": ["education", "fine_art", "entertainment", "art_history", "photography", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting"], "section_title": "Artmajeur - Latest Artworks", "title": "20171204-191257-1.jpg", "title_full": "20171204-191257-1.jpg", "published": "2017-12-07T10:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.artmajeur.com/medias/standard/j/e/jeannette-marlow/artwork/10555957_20171204-191257-1.jpg?v=1512636959", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51299, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45b0b18280035d6bb88972b6a256e9447b052a44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZJQ0uU6gXzZkwKCvvpj80zCL8e_gXbGQrQBr7XT4xbFSkWBmY560ncIJj8LbNC93siuea0qTE776o_BD2mWAmMbO807mYv52pRLTeAamloFwICY40R2Z4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply+849469@artmajeur.com (Jeannette Marlow)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "20171204-191257-1.jpg", "text": "Other art by Jeannette Marlow : Murchison Window - Painting, 76x50x4 cm \u00a92016 by Jeannette Marlow - Documentary, Canvas, History Old New Zealand - Painting, 80x80x4 cm \u00a92016 by Jeannette Marlow - Land Art, Canvas, History Beryl's Shoes - Painting, 91x122x4 cm \u00a92016 by Jeannette Marlow - Realism, Canvas, Fashion Betty's Cottons - Painting, 91x122x4 cm \u00a92016 by Jeannette Marlow - Documentary, Canvas, Home Security - Painting, 500x760x40 cm \u00a92016 by Jeannette Marlow - Realism, Canvas, Still life", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeannette marlow", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "history beryl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fashion betty", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f05c30b7f8039cf166227e4b8753275ebe6a4731", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsXWuQ18GB2Ve_B.uB1SXc89KO7trNqLGMP2KK9CFE_y0_FrhG7xu2W4MiFCSyzvaFvrAm9DcjF92PHyOdPVKGatS.CJx9no0t5", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : personalfinance", "title": "Reminder: Your initial fraud alert filed after the Equifax breach is expiring soon", "title_full": "Reminder: Your initial fraud alert filed after the Equifax breach is expiring soon : personalfinance", "published": "2017-12-07T09:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f05c30b7f8039cf166227e4b8753275ebe6a4731", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsXWuQ18GB2Ve_B.uB1SXc89KO7trNqLGMP2KK9CFE_y0_FrhG7xu2W4MiFCSyzvaFvrAm9DcjF92PHyOdPVKGatS.CJx9no0t5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "don7panic", "published": "2017-12-07T09:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Reminder: Your initial fraud alert filed after the Equifax breach is expiring soon", "text": "Just froze all my credits, no cost for new jersey.

A liquid market is breeding robust lender competition, and next year is likely to feature low interest rates, generous interest-only periods and compressed spreads. \n\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing all commercial assets being very attractive, (including) hotels, office and retail,\u201d said David Sonnenblick, co-founder & principal of Sonnenblick-Eichner Co. \nIn September, the Beverly Hills-based firm arranged $165 million of non-recourse, first-mortgage financing, including 15 years interest-only, to refinance a 1.3 million-square-foot mixed-use property on Oahu owned by AIPA Properties LLC. AIPA chose a life company execution for the deal, which also attracted conduits. \nLenders are refinancing assets in a climate marked by stability. The Mortgage Bankers Association estimates that commercial and multifamily originations in 2018 will be comparable to this year\u2019s projected $515 billion volume. \nNor do veteran investment bankers expect a big leap in refinancing costs, despite two 25 basis-point hikes in the Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark rate this year and wide expectations for a third increase by Dec. 31. If rates rise, borrowers may switch from floating to fixed terms because the difference between the two will narrow, suggested Gerard Sansosti, a Pittsburgh-based executive managing director for HFF. That said, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t see any real pressure on rates to rise until we see significant growth in the economy.\u201d Boldness and discipline \nLife companies have demonstrated characteristically disciplined underwriting, while commercial banks continue to show caution, particularly in originating permanent loans. One major change: the rising profile of debt funds. \u201cThey\u2019ve become much more aggressive \u2026 in terms of loan-to-value ratios, pricing and structure,\u201d Sansosti observed. \nMore welcome news: less volatility in the CMBS market, thanks to lender discipline, improved execution and well-timed securitizations. Moreover, Sansosti said, \u201cthe maturity wave everyone has been concerned about for years has proven anticlimactic because the amount of liquidity in the market has allowed the majority of maturities to be refinanced.\u201d \nAs in 2017, sponsors seeking to refinance will find variable underwriting. Lenders are \u201ca little more skittish\u201d about refinancing retail, reported Jason Bressler, vice president for originations with Mesa West Capital. The firm is \u201clooking to home in on (somewhat) more resilient deals with high-quality tenants, like grocery or drug anchors,\u201d he added. \nHotels, too, are often refinanced conservatively, yet lenders are receptive to high-quality new product, like the 330-room Aloft and 180-room Element in Boston\u2019s Seaport District. On behalf of the assets\u2019 co-owners, Ares Management LP and CV Properties LLC, HFF recently arranged $140 million from Starwood Property Trust. \nIn short, terms will depend on asset quality, but as Sonnenblick emphasized, \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of capital for all product types.\u201d \nOriginally appearing in the December 2017 issue of CPE.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jason bressler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sansosti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerard sansosti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonnenblick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey steele", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david sonnenblick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aipa properties llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mesa west capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cv properties llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aipa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cpe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mortgage bankers association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ares management lp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starwood property trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonnenblick-eichner co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seaport district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beverly hills-based", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:01.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e68e0d95f5a229d418a4815ef1ed33d0c7708506", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTaRnGq3lLl5DjV3ukC3j7JkM8_iZk3g2oaRaBUZ6jdAPlBbquLj4CVd9afOBmtuAHT4MwlA695ekxVcVd5ROAq", "site_full": "jackyslurpeepaws.deviantart.com", "site": "deviantart.com", "site_section": "http://backend.deviantart.com/rss.xml?q=+sort:time+meta:all&type=deviation", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "DeviantArt: Newest", "title": "''zora's story'' pg3", "title_full": "''zora's story'' pg3", "published": "2017-12-07T11:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://pre00.deviantart.net/120f/th/pre/i/2017/341/f/0/__zora_s_story___pg3_by_jackyslurpeepaws-dbvzr86.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 264, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e68e0d95f5a229d418a4815ef1ed33d0c7708506", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTaRnGq3lLl5DjV3ukC3j7JkM8_iZk3g2oaRaBUZ6jdAPlBbquLj4CVd9afOBmtuAHT4MwlA695ekxVcVd5ROAq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "''zora's story'' pg3", "text": "Digital Art / Drawings & Paintings / Other \u00a92017 JackySlurpeePaws jezz i had to redraw this 2 times ~_~ the layers where glitching and i had to reset...oh and also, the part where the \"error\" part is, that's her seeing scar, but it doesint last long, but it IS her vision.next: soon!

The following two reports take a closer look at the truffle oil and oyster mushroom markets, revealing where they are at and where they are headed. - Advertisement - \nA member of the Ascomycete family, truffles are a type of fungus that are commonly used in culinary dishes. In fact, the world-renowned French chef Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarian refers to truffles as \"the diamond of the kitchen,\" which is an appropriate title given its characteristics. Truffles are often said to have a musky aroma with a strong earthy flavor. As such, they are often used as an ingredient in high-end dishes. - Advertisement - \nOf course, there are several different types of truffles, each of which has its own unique characteristics. Some of the most common types of truffles include black truffles, burgundy truffles, white truffles and whitish truffles. In 1999, a 2-pound, 14-ounce white truffle was discovered in Croatia. At the time, this was the world's largest truffle ever discovered, for which it received recognition in the Guinness Book of World Records. Here's another fun fact about truffles: a massive white truffle recently sold for more than $61,000 at a Sotheby's auction. \nThe Global Truffle Oil Market by Manuf\u2026 Forecast to 2022 report by The Market Reports is a comprehensive study of the global truffle oil market. Within this report, you'll find key data on the truffle oil market, including its classifications, definitions, trends, industry chain structure, cost, price, revenue, market drivers, challenges and more. \nSome of the key truffle oil vendors profiled in this report include Urbani, Marcel Plantin, Truffle Hunter, Sabatino Tartufi, AROTZ, Monini, La truffe du Ventoux, Conservas Ferrer, Savitar, Gazzarrini and Tartufi. \nThe Global Oyster Mushroom Sales Market 2017 report by The Market Reports is a professional analysis of the global oyster mushroom sales market. Not to be confused with truffles, oyster mushrooms are another prized fungus used in culinary applications. In fact, they are one of the world's most frequently consumed mushrooms. Oyster mushrooms have smooth and elongated spores. Another characteristic feature of oyster mushrooms is the presence of decurrent gills. \nOyster mushrooms generally have a similar appearance to other common mushrooms. Unlike other edible mushrooms, however, they are typically torn up instead of sliced when used for culinary purposes. Additionally, oyster mushrooms have a tougher consistency than many other types of fungi. \nThis report segments the global oyster mushroom market by several criteria. On the basis of product type, the market is segmented into grey oyster mushrooms and white oyster mushrooms. On the basis of end-user application, the market is segmented into food, medical and other. Each segment is thoroughly scrutinized in great detail.

It changes the definition of marriage from solely between a man and a woman to \"a union of two people\" excluding all others. The legislation passed with a majority that wasn't challenged, although five lawmakers registered their opposition. \nThe Senate passed the same legislation last week 43 votes to 12. After royal assent and other formalities, the law will likely take effect in about a month, with the first weddings expected about a month later. \nChampagne and tears of flowed in the halls of Parliament House as gay celebrities including Olympic champion swimmer Ian Thorpe and actress Magda Szubanski hugged lawmakers and ordinary folk in a party atmosphere. \n\"What an amazing day, I'm a little bit delirious, it's extraordinary,\" said Szubanski, who sat in the public gallery during Thursday's daylong debate. \nThorpe thanked \"our straight brothers and sisters\" for strongly backing marriage equality in the two-month postal survey. \n\"Quite literally without them voting for us, this would never have happened,\" Thorpe said. \n\"It means that we've created an Australia that is more equitable, it's more fair, it's more just,\" he added. \nAmendments meant to safeguard freedoms of speech and religion for gay-marriage opponents were all rejected, though those issues may be considered later. The government has appointed a panel to examine how to safeguard religious freedoms once gay marriage is a reality in Australia. \nLawmakers advocating marriage equality had argued that the national postal survey in November mandated a change of the marriage definition alone, so changing the law should not be delayed by other considerations. \nGay marriage was endorsed by 62 per cent of voters who responded to the postal ballot. \n\"It is now our job as members of Parliament to pass a fair bill that does not extend or create any new discriminations,\" an emotional government lawmaker Warren Entsch, who helped draft the bill, told Parliament. \"It is a strong bill that already strikes the right balance between equality and freedom of religion.\" \n\"It's an historic day for Australia today and I think the celebrations around the country when we finally ... achieve marriage equality are going to be immense,\" Janet Rice said before the vote. Rice is a minor Greens party senator who was only able to remain married to her transgender wife of 31 years, Penny, because Penny remained listed as male on her birth certificate. \nPenny Wong, an opposition Labor Party senator who has two children with her lesbian partner, said, \"I am feeling happy.\" \nMost gay rights advocates believed the government should have allowed marriages years ago and saw various ideas for a public survey as a delaying tactic. The U.N. Human Rights Committee had called the ballot survey \"an unnecessary and divisive public opinion poll.\" \nThe current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from anti-discrimination laws. \nOne of the rejected amendments would have ensured Australians could speak freely about their traditional views of marriage without fear of legal action. It was proposed by Attorney-General George Brandis and supported by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, both gay marriage supporters. \nFormer Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a high-profile advocate of traditional marriage, told Parliament that Turnbull and opposition leader Bill Shorten had failed to deliver detailed protections for freedoms of speech, conscience and religion in the bill. \n\"A promise was made by the leaders of this Parliament and the promise has not adequately been delivered on,\" Abbott said. \nAbbott pointed to an Australian teenager who lost her job for advocating against gay marriage on social media and an Australian Catholic bishop who was taken before a state anti-discrimination tribunal over a pamphlet he published extolling traditional marriage. The complaint against the bishop was dropped. \n\"The last thing we should want to do is to subject Australians to new forms of discrimination in place of old ones that are rightly gone,\" he said. \nGovernment lawmaker Trevor Evans ruled out an Australian equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court case in which a baker who refused to provide a wedding cake for a gay couple argued he was exercising artistic freedom and was exempt from Colorado anti-discrimination laws. \n\"Let's be honest here, for a case like that to arise in Australia, it would require a gay couple who care more about activism than about the success of their own wedding, to find a business operator who cares more about religious doctrine than the commercial success of their own small business, and for both of them to commit to having a fight,\" Evans told Parliament. \n\"Typical Australians would genuinely question the bona fides of the players in a case like that and the slim prospects of that occurring doesn't warrant the pages and pages of commentary and debate that have been dedicated to it,\" he added. \nSeveral gay marriage opponents in Turnbull's conservative coalition have regarded marriage equality as inevitable and have welcomed an end to an issue that has long divided the government ranks. \nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann, a same-sex marriage opponent who oversaw the postal ballot, said he felt \"great satisfaction\" that the issue was resolved. \n\"It was a polarizing issue on which good Australians had strongly and sincerely held views on both sides of the argument,\" Cormann said. \nThe result is a political win for Turnbull, who became prime minister after deposing Abbott in 2015 in an internal government leadership ballot. \nAbbott was head-butted by a gay rights advocate during the postal survey campaign in September. Kevin Rudd, a centre-left Labor Party prime minister whom Abbott defeated in elections in 2013, blamed the postal ballot for an assault on his 19-year-old godson as he campaigned for marriage equality a week earlier. \nVeteran gay rights campaigner Rodney Croome said he expected the first same-sex weddings in Australia would not take place until February. \nThe law will likely take effect after a month. State laws then require couples to give 28 days' notice of their intention to marry, Croome said.

Most people don't need to use it but are very grateful to have it if they do need it.\nWe're insured for about $600K each. It would pay out the mortgage and pay for school fees and the extras around kids - you might need to pay someone to take them to their afterschool activities and jobs. It's also enough to give some breathing space to not have to work for a year if you need to get through the trauma and focus on the kids (we'd be able to get leave without pay from work for something like this but you wouldn't necessarily have enough leave you could take to cover a years worth of wages).\nOur kids are older so it's less of an issue.

Nabih al-Wahsh, a prominent lawyer in the country, was also fined 20,000 Egyptian pounds (\u00a3839) for inciting violence against women. \nNabih sparked controversy when he made the rape comment during a TV panel debate in October. \n\"Are you happy when you see a girl walking down the street with half of her behind showing?\" he said during the show on drafting a law on prostitution. \nAlso Read: Are men allowed to marry daughters born out of wedlock? Egyptian cleric says YES \n\"I say that when a girl walks about like that, it is a patriotic duty to sexually harass her and a national duty to rape her.\" \nHe further said that women who wear such revealing clothes are inviting men to harass them and raping them would be a way for them to learn self-respect. \"What she allows herself to do constitute depravity. Girls must respect themselves so others respect them. Protecting morals is more important than protecting borders,\" he added. \nHis statement sparked outrage in the country and Egypt's National Council for Women said that Nabih's comments \"explicitly promote rape and sexual harassment.\" \nThis is not the first time Nabih has sparked controversy. Last year, he had beaten an Australian-based imam who said on a talk show that wearing hijab is a choice and women should not be forced. Nabih lost his cool over the imam's statement and started beating him with his shoe on live television. \nIn another TV appearance, he said that women should not be allowed to become a mufti -- a Muslim legal expert qualified to give authoritative legal opinions -- as they would issue fatwas while they are on their periods. \n\"If we let a woman become a judge, why shouldn't she become Sheik of Al-Azhar? Why shouldn't she become the Mufti? Why don't we all just go to Hell?! Will she issue me a fatwa while she is menstruating?!\" he said, according to the Independent.

What alternatives are available?\nA: Unfortunately in some cases it may not be possible to calibrate the display directly using SpectraView due to compatibility issues with certain versions of Mac OS or Mac hardware. Such issues are normally out of our control, but we are always working closely with Apple to resolve these kinds of issues as soon as possible. In the interim time, the following solutions may be considered:\n1) If possible, calibrate the display on another Mac or PC that is supported. Since the display is hardware calibrated it can be moved to another machine and the calibration will remain valid. Be sure to also copy and associate the ColorSync profile of the display.\n2) If the issue is related to a particular version of Mac OS and you have another version of Mac OS installed on another drive partition, restart the Mac with the other Mac OS version, calibrate the display, then switch back to the original Mac OS partition.\n3) In some cases, it may be possible to calibrate the display using Windows under Boot Camp on the same machine. If you have an Intel based Mac and have Windows installed on your Mac, try using the Windows version of SpectraView. Note that it is not possible to calibrate the display using Windows running within Mac OS - only Windows running in Boot Camp is supported.\n4) Calibrate using a non-hardware based 3rd party calibration package. Such software may have been included with your color sensor or available from the manufacturer\u0092s website.\nEnd of Quote: .\nAs I had a specific Mac Pro and Mac OS X combination atuned with my other software I contacted Nec support and they explained that in my case if I wanted to use that combination I would have to bring my monitor to them to change the hardware configuration. This was midway where I changed the machine and the OS. To simplify, I was using Nec with my Mac Pro 1 and Mac OS 1 without any problems and using hardware calibration, but when switching to Mac Pro 2 and Mac OS 2 the hardware calibration no longer worked. Since sending the monitor back to Nec was not monetary doable for me I used only software calibration on the second machine.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.necdisplay.com/spectra-view-II/FAQ"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:03.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bcf016744fffacb3c3cda037c802e2e74ed4e538", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju36NP1vGI3oiSA.mlgAn5_fxTQ_KMFrBk4Bua1GMx2O_7vo9k3CjfO71pncoXiBnO3zVsezWxIq2gA--", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/nintendo-lobby.80041/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Nintendo Lobby | IGN Boards", "title": "~ Nintendo Lobby Christmas Card 2017 Sign-up ~", "title_full": "~ Nintendo Lobby Christmas Card 2017 Sign-up ~ | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T13:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 25, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7fec43cc9fb22e924533b4708c81d84992b59a39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju36NP1vGI3oiSA.mlgAn5_fxTQ_KMFrBk4Bua1GMx2O_7vo9k3CjfO71pncoXiBnO3zjFTdrud6XnQPsWrzofjNK", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "totecx1", "published": "2017-12-06T18:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "So post in here to be copy and pasted into a collage?

Breitbart reports this act makes it illegal for anyone to \u201ccause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another.\u201d\nThirteen police forces refused to provide their data on the issue, and two provided unusable data. This means the overall amount of arrests for \u201coffensive\u201d online comments is likely much higher.\nUnsurprisingly it\u2019s only certain \u201coffensive\u201d speech that is a problem.\nNadia Chan, a self-described Islamist made a number of racist remarks. These remarks include as calling white people \u201cswine\u201d and Jewish people \u201cparasites,\u201d as well as claiming white people are \u201cpasty bland bitches [who] have NO culture, no rich history, you ain\u2019t shit, ur ancestors were cave ppl.\u201d\nDespite this speech clearly falling into the category of \u201coffensive\u201d in the eyes of British law, Chan was not reprimanded, nor mentioned, by the authorities even when thousands of people complained about her remarks.\nIf you are reading this ... that means you left your mind exposed and I have started having telepathic sex with you\nxxDisturbedSavio said: \u2191\nMen suck.
