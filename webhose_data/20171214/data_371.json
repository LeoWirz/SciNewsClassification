While some had completely defaulted, others are owing sizeable balance of the money. \nThe investigation further revealed that 32,305 houses were captured by the Committee on the Sale of Government Properties while 24,345 were eventually sold to beneficiaries. \nHowever, civil servants in some government agencies notably OHSCF and the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) have allegedly turned the policy into a shoddy business with the aim of defrauding the federal government. \nICPC also found out that some public servants and government agencies were concealing government properties and collecting rent on same without the consent of the federal government, which allegedly flouts the intent of the policy that primarily focuses on divesting government\u2019s interest from providing housing for its employees. \nFurther discovery by ICPC has shown that staff in OHSCF allocated some of the houses to undeserving beneficiaries who were not public servants at the time of the exercise and some of the properties are yet to be allocated. \nThe investigation has so far yielded fruitful result with the recovery of N18, 031,000 from some civil servants and a host of companies including Montgomery & Campbell Ltd and SICCONS, which has been paid into the coffers of the government. ICPC assures Nigerians that anyone found guilty of contravening the law would be charged to court upon conclusion of the investigation.

Be warned though that not all applications work perfectly or without glitches. Some applications are even unusable, while others work perfectly (see the Wine Application Database for a good idea of how well various programs work). see How to install and configure Wine? to help you to install this.\nOnce Wine is installed, you can simply double click an .exe or .msi file to run it. If this doesn't work for some reason, right-click the file and select \"Open With Wine Windows Program Loader\". Of course, only run executables from sources you trust to avoid Windows malware.\n\nIf you run into compatibility issues, you may wish to try the latest Wine Beta version from the ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa software source (see What are PPAs and how do I use them? ).\nYou might also consider installing Winetricks , CrossOver or CrossOver Games to install and use software more easily.\nTo see the debug output of Windows software (in case something goes wrong) run it from a terminal using wine msiexec /i file.msi or simply wine file.exe .\n\nSolution:2\nShort answer .exe files are not binary-compatible with Ubuntu. There are, however, compatibility layers for Linux, such as Wine , that are capable of running .exe.\nDetailed answer and solutions The underlying problem: \nUbuntu is a completely different system than MS Windows. Not only it looks differently, but it also uses different mechanisms for its core functions.\nThe problem with .exe files is that they are specific to Windows. No other system is capable of running them, because their contents are designed to work on a Microsoft's system. Linux uses different standards, different concepts, and therefore Ubuntu applications need to be adapted to them to work correctly.\nIf you have just migrated from Windows and are doing your baby steps with Ubuntu, you may be indeed surprised that .exe files fail to run. There may be different symptoms, either an error message may appear, or there may be no effect at all when double-clicking an .exe. This all happens, because Ubuntu has no idea what should it do to run that file. Ubuntu is not knowledgeable about how MS Windows works \"behind the curtain\", and therefore it can't execute the code that's within them. In technical jargon, one says that Windows and Linux executables are not binary-compatible.\nLooking for alternatives \nThe first thing you should do is to realise that most likely you do not want to run that .exe file. Most Windows applications you are used to have their Ubuntu alternatives in Ubuntu Software Center. \nTherefore the very first step when you try to run an .exe file is to check whether there is a Ubuntu version of the same application (like Firefox - it has both a Windows and Ubuntu edition), or a close alternative, which is not the same app, but does 99% the same stuff. For example, if you want to compose a document, instead of MS Office you will want to use LibreOffice.\nHow can I find an alternative? \nHere are some tips.\nSearch Ubuntu Software Center. Launch the Ubuntu Software Center, type in the search box what kind of application you are looking for. For example, typing in \" photoshop \" finds The GIMP , which is a great advanced image editing tool, and is a great substitute for Adobe Photoshop. Many Windows applications are also available for Ubuntu, and have their identical version in Ubuntu Software Center, which is the preferred way of installing software in Ubuntu. Search Ask Ubuntu (this very site). There are many questions here that explain what applications can be used as substitutes. Also, do not forget to ask a question if you need software-recommendation . This Ubuntu Help page contains great tips when seeking for alternatives. http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Alternatives http://alternativeto.net/ Okay, but not all applications have alternatives. There are a number of cases where you will want to run the .exe program anyway. Examples include:\nYou are trying to run an application of which alternative makes no sense. In case of most video games you will want to run them and not an alternative. You may want to run the original application instead of an alternative, because the alternative is not good enough. For example, many people consider Photoshop to be a much better editor than The GIMP. This is a very Windows-specific program, that makes little sense on Linux. Luckily, you can get .exe files to run on Ubuntu. \nRunning .exe files on Ubuntu with WINE What is Wine ? Well, technically it's a compatibility layer. What it means is that it provides an environment similar to Windows to any .exe application you try to run. Therefore, with WINE .exe files will run on Ubuntu.\nWINE is not installed by default. You can get it either by:\nSearching for \"wine\" in Ubuntu Software Center. Running the command: sudo apt-get install wine . Details on installing WINE can be found in this question .\nOkay, so I installed WINE. Now what? \nProceed to launching your .exe file! Double-click it, and with a bit of luck everything will seem like on Windows. Voil\u00e0!\nWARNING: Not all applications will behave correctly when run with WINE. WINE is by no means perfect, and because it pretends to be a Windows environment instead of actually being a real one, some applications may malfunction. Common problems may include incorrectly displayed fields, fullscreen issues with video games, copy-protection problems. Some of them can be solved with litte hassle, make sure to check the WINE application database and use google to find hints in case your .exe does not work correctly.\nRunning Windows applications on Ubuntu with PlayOnLinux There is another tool you may like which aids you in running Windows applications.\nIt's called PlayOnLinux ( website ) and it supports quite a wide range of software ( browse ).\nWhat it does is it runs a specific version of Wine which is known to work best with the application you are willing to run. It also installs additional paths to provide maximum compatibility with Ubuntu. But you don't need to know about that; everything is done automatically.\nBecause of that, PlayOnLinux tends to provide the best results in case of running a widely known piece of software, including many video games.\nInstalling PlayOnLinux: \nFind it in Ubuntu Software Center, or Run sudo apt-get install playonlinux Using PlayOnLinux: \nInstead of double-clicking the .exe (which launches it with WINE), run PlayOnLinux application. Select \"Install\" button on the toolbar, and choose what application you wish to install. PlayOnLinux will guide you through the installation process (of course you will need installation media).\nOnce it's done, your installed application will be displayed in PlayOnLinux main window. Double click to launch it!\nCommercial solutions If you are not satisfied with WINE, there are some commercial softwares that runs Windows applications on Linux. One of the most well-known is CrossOver . In some cases it has significantly better results, yet it is not available for free.\n\nSolution:3\nyes by using wine.\nget it by going to the Ubuntu software center.\nhere is a link to the ppa https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wine/+archive/ppa \nhere is a video on how to install http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZgjgeDQVo4 \nhere is a video on installing basic applications http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLRLWEfdFqY&feature=related \nand here is wine wiki which will provide you with some more information. http://wiki.winehq.org/HowTo \nif you wish to play a game from a CD you can install play on linux which is also available in the Ubuntu software center. hope this helps\n\nSolution:4\nYou'll first need to install the Wine Compatibility Layer, it will allow you to run Windows appliactions on Ubuntu:\nOpen the Ubuntu Software Centre Search for \" Wine \" Install \"Wine Microsoft Windows Compatibility Layer\" Next you need to tell Ubuntu that this is a program. \nRight click the .exe file and select Properties Go to Permissions and check Allow executing file as program Now you can run the program\nRight click the .exe file and select Open with Wine Windows Program Loader That's all, the program should now run fine. I've tested this using various pieces of Windows software, including the Windows version of Mono.\n\nSolution:5\nFor applications that do not work in Wine, you can use Virtualbox by installing a Windows in the virtual machine. 3D acceleration is supported in Virtualbox.\nSee also these questions:\nHow do I install the VirtualBox version from Oracle to install an Extension Pack? How do I install Guest Additions in a VirtualBox VM? Launch an application in Windows from the Ubuntu desktop \nSolution:6\nWine is not a perfect answer, as you will probably many compatibility problems. You might consider first checking up on your application at WineHQ.org . Platinum is the best level, then Gold, Silver, Bronze, and finally Garbage.\n\nIf you want to run games, you can try special versions of Wine like PlayOnLinux (free) or CrossOver (payed). Otherwise, common applications should work well enough with a little configuration.\n\nSolution:7\nFirst of all an .EXE file is a Windows Executable file. In Linux and other *nix based systems we do not use .EXE as file extension for program executables. Rather we set the permission for the program to be executable by using chmod command.\nSecondly your question is too broad. Which '.EXE file' by which I assume you are trying to run a Windows Application are you trying to run? There a program called WINE which has ability to run Windows Programs to a various levels of success.\nHowever you are strongly suggested to use a native alternative app, because it will perform better and better integrate with the desktop.\n\nSolution:8\nYou should be aware that Ubuntu is a totally different OS to Windows. The file structures are incompatible. So .exe files are designed for Windows, not Linux. Therefore they won't work.\nHaving said that, there are some .exe files that work well in Linux (Ubuntu) through a program called wine . The latest stable version should be in the software centre.\nMy strongest recommendation though - before installing wine - is to go to the developers website and familiarise yourself with what it can and can't do, and what windows programs are known to work with it.\nFinally, there are 1000's of apps that are designed for linux that do much the same things that windows apps do. Many are cross-platform, like VLC, Firefox to name a couple.\n\nSolution:9\nWell windows 'exe' file won't run on linux it's different breed of operating system. You could install wine an then try again. Works very well in most of the cases.\nAnd give ubuntu a fair chance, you don't need Windows in most of the cases. You are just under impression that this is necessary part of computer experience.\nHow do I install wine? \nSolution:10\nAside from a WINE implementation, if you've got a copy of windows laying around, you may also want to look into VirtualBox or some other virtualization technology.\nHere is link on getting setup: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/create-and-manage-virtual-machines-using-virtualbox.html \nA con in using a VM(virtual machine) is that they are generally reserved for upper end machines as they are an OS inside of your OS that takes up additional OS resources.\na pro would be that they are easier to backup and re-instate in-case of a catastrophic software failure. \nWikipedia has an article on both VirtualBox and Virtualization. I can only post one link until I get more cool points so I figured the tutorial would be a better link as it has a brief description \n\nSolution:11\nRun:\nsudo apt-get install wine \nThen simply double click on exe \n\nSolution:12\nYou should try wine :\nwine msiexec /i your_msi_file.msi \n\nSolution:13\nThe Wine PPA indicated above is helpful, however I will note that you don't have to use beta packages if you're using the PPA. The wine1.5 package will give you the latest beta package, however the wine1.4 package will keep you at the stable Wine 1.4 release and not expose you to regressions. You can also just install the wine package for the latest stable version.\n\nSolution:14\nAlso, if you want to get updates from the Wine developers so that more and more Windows software is supported, go to System->Software Sources and go to the other Software tab. Click the Add button and copy+paste this into it: ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\n\nSolution:15\nYes, as others have said, you can use wine to run Windows programs.\nOnce wine is installed, you can run a Windows executable by right clicking it and clicking 'open with wine Windows program loader' or using the terminal as explained above.\nYou should check here to see if/how the program can be run in wine. Lots of programs will not work perfectly or will need extra configuration to run. A program called winetricks (see http://wiki.winehq.org/winetricks ) may make things a bit easier.\nAlways try to use native software or free alternatives if possible. You can search for applications in Ubuntu Software Centre - programs from here will work much better and will need little configuration. You can also look on this website: http://www.osalt.com/ for free software alternatives to proprietary products. \n\nSolution:16\nAs others have said, Wine is usually the best option, but in some cases you can see better performance using Mono. However, for the program to run under Mono, the program must be a .NET application, and even that isn't a guarantee that the program will run without some hand holding.\nTo recap, Wine is a safe bet, but Mono is installed by default in Ubuntu and can handle many simple .EXE files that are .NET applications.\n\nSolution:17\nMaybe a proper error message should tell you that .exe files are specifically create to run in a Windows environment. There are plenty exciting ways to handle this situation but they all need a little time and effort to get informed and understand.

Sani Usman, confirmed the development saying that Maj. Gen. Rogers Nicholas has been named as his replacement. \nUsman said, \u201cIt is true that a new commander has been appointed for Operation Lafiya Dole. I can confirm the appointment.\u201d \nUntil his new appointment, Nicholas was the Chief of Logistics at the Army Headquarters, Abuja. \nIbrahim took over from Maj. Gen. Lucky Irabor, who is now the Commander of the Multi-National Joint Task Force in May 2017. Among the perceived shortcomings of the outgoing commander was his inability to capture the Boko Haram terrorists\u2019 leader, Abubakar Shekau. \nIt was reported in August 2017 that the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen Tukur Buratai, issued a 40-day ultimatum to the Operation Lafiya Dole Theatre Command to capture Shekau, but that had not been done since the deadline expired in September.

All C . neoformans experiments were conducted with the clinical isolate H99 strain (serotype A) or C . neoformans acapsular strain (CAP67). The C . neoformans H99 strain was generously provided by John Perfect (Durham, NC) and the CAP67 strain was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Fungal cultures were grown in minimal medium composed of dextrose (15\u2009mM), MgSO 4 (10\u2009mM), KH 2 PO 4 (29.4\u2009mM), glycine (13\u2009mM), and thiamine-HCl (3\u2009M). Fungal cells were cultivated at room temperature (RT) with continuous shaking (150\u2009rpm). To maintain fungal virulence, serial passages in C57BL/6 mice were performed before the isolate H99 was used in experiments.\n\n\nC . neoformans infection and survival analysis \nThe H99 strain was grown in minimal medium until late logarithmic phase, washed and suspended in PBS. The concentration of yeast cells was determined by hemocytometer, and a suspension of 1\u00d710 6 cells/ml was used to infect the mice via intratracheal with 50\u2009\u03bcl of solution. The WT and gal3 \u2212/\u2212 mice were anesthetized with xylazine (125\u2009mg/kg) and ketamine (10\u2009mg/kg) in PBS, and their necks were hyperextended and their trachea was exposed after incision. The infection with C . neoformans used a syringe 26-gauge, and the incision was sutured with 5\u20130 silk. The inocula of 5\u00d710 5 cells were realized to measure the fungal burden, the levels of cytokines, or the relative expression of transcription factors in the brain, lung, spleen, and serum. These measurements were evaluated on days 3, 7, and 14 days after infection. The infection with 1\u00d710 5 yeast cells was performed to survival analysis of WT and gal3 \u2212/\u2212 mice, which were monitored daily for mortality. The concentration of inocula was confirmed by plating on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) and counting the CFU.\n\nOrgan fungal burden \nThe C . neoformans burden was quantified in brain and lung homogenates. Sample of homogenate was diluted in sterile PBS buffer (pH 7.2) and aliquots of 100\u2009\u03bcl were plated in Sabouraud agar medium. After 48\u2009h of incubation at 30\u2009\u00b0C, the CFU were counted and calculated the concentration of yeast cells/ml. These values were related to organ mass and the C . neoformans burden for each organ was expressed as CFU/ml/mg of tissue.\n\nSera and patients \nBlood samples were obtained from patients being seen in the University Hospital, Ribeirao Preto Medical School at the University of Sao Paulo. A total of six patients with diagnosed cryptococcosis were included in this study: three patients with HIV and three patients IC. Serum was obtained and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. Samples were also obtained from three blood donors with a median age of 30 years (range, 25\u201335 years).\n\nGal-3 levels \nThe Gal-3 levels in the brain, lung, and spleen was quantified in the organ homogenates of C . neoformans -infected mice. The homogenate samples (whole organ in 1\u2009ml of PBS) of control mice or from animals infected with C . neoformans , as well as the serum samples from infected animals or from patients with diagnosed cryptococcosis, were stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until assayed. All samples were thawed only once prior to use. Gal-3 levels were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nGrowth in the presence of Gal-3 \nCryptococcus neoformans strains H99 (capsular) and CAP67 (acapsular) cells were grown in Sabouraud medium at 37\u2009\u00b0C with 150\u2009rpm. To verify the Gal-3 effect on the cells, we performed growth curves in Sabouraud liquid medium containing different concentrations of Gal-3 (Gal-3 human recombinant, expressed in E . coli , Sigma-Aldrich) in a 96-well plate (Costar, NY, USA) using an iEMS spectrophotometer (Thermofisher). The optical density at 540\u2009nm (OD540) was measured every hour, and graphs plotted using GraphPad Prism Software version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\n\nTo measure the capsule and body size of the cells, we analyzed H99 strain after 72\u2009h of Gal-3 treatment and compared to the cells treated with PBS. Suspensions of India ink were photographed and measured. Image acquisition was done at differential inference contrast objective in a SP5 confocal inverted microscope equipped with a camera. Images were processed using Leica Microsystems and ImageJ software. Capsule and cell body dimensions were determined using Adobe Photoshop. Capsule radial length was calculated by subtracting the length of the cell body from the diameter of the whole cell, capsule included.\n\nGal-3 binding assay \nThe C . neoformans strains H99 (capsular) and CAP67 (acapsular) cells were incubated with PBS/10% bovine fetal serum for 20\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C to prevent nonspecific antibody binding. After washing, H99 and CAP67 cells at a density suspension of 1\u00d710 6 cells/ml were incubated with native and denatured form of Gal-3 (40\u2009\u03bcg/ml) for 40\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The cells were washed twice with PBS and the anti-Gal-3 antibody (1:50; Sigma-Aldrich) was added; after 45\u2009min of incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-FITC antibody (1:50; Sigma-Aldrich) for 40\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Gal-3 binding to H99 and CAP67 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry (Guava easyCyte, Guava Technologies, Millipore, Hayward, CA, USA) and the histogram represents the percentage of positive cells recognized by Gal-3. The anti-rabbit IgG-FITC antibody associated or not with Gal-3 was used as control, and use of WGA lectin (30\u2009\u03bcg/ml) as control of binding with capsule or cell wall.\n\nConfocal microscopy \nC . neoformans yeast cells (H99 strain) were cultured at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. The cells were incubated with Gal-3 (40\u2009\u03bcg/ml) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009h, followed by washing with PBS and fixation with PBS-buffered 3.7% formaldehyde at 25\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009h. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS and embedded in OCT-Tissue Tek (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA). The samples were frozen and processed as described previously 49 . Slides were rinsed three times with PBS before and after treatment with glycine (0.1\u2009M, 15\u2009min), and blocked with BSA (1% in PBS) for 1\u2009h. Samples were incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C with murine monoclonal antibody 18B7 (IgG1, 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml), which binds cryptococcal glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) from all serotypes 50 . After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with a rabbit anti-Gal-3 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The samples were washed five times with PBS and incubated for 1\u2009h with or FITC-labeled secondary antibodies, which included Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG from Thermo Fisher Scientific and a FITC-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG from Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories. For cell wall detection, samples were incubated with Calcofluor White (50\u2009\u03bcg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 20\u2009min. After five washes with PBS (5\u2009min each), coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Samples were treated with pre-immune serum from mice or rabbit and later treated with secondary antibodies as nonspecific labeling control. The samples were examined with a LSM780 system AxioObserver, 63 X oil immersion (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The images were analyzed offline using the ImageJ software ( http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ ).\n\nCytokine measurements in tissues \nThe homogenates of lung, brain, and spleen were centrifuged at 2000\u00d7 g for 15\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The supernatants were used to quantify the levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-12p40, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-10. The cytokines were measured by capture ELISA with antibody pairs purchased from BD Biosciences (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA). The ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The cytokine concentrations were determined from standard curves, using murine recombinant cytokines as a standard. The absorbance was read at 450\u2009nm in a microplate scanning spectrophotometer (Power Wave-X; BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The cytokine concentrations were determined in \u03c1g/ml and related to organ mass, then expressed in pg/ml/mg.\n\nQuantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR of transcription factors \nTotal RNA was obtained from lungs by TRIzol Reagent, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA was done by the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA) using oligo (dT). The qRT-PCR was performed in 15\u2009\u03bcl reactions with SsoFast TM EvaGreen (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The reactions were read in the Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using the following conditions: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, and 40 cycles of 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009s/60\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009s. Gene expression was quantified using the \u0394\u0394Ct method and normalized to \u03b2-actin expression. The utilized PCR primers were: \u03b2-actin (F: 5\u2032-AGCTGCGTTTTACACCCTTT-3\u2032 / R: 5\u2032-AAGCCATGCCAATGTTGTCT-3\u2032); T-bet (F: CACTAAGCAAGGACGGCGAA / R: CCACCAAGACCACATCCAC); GATA-3 (F: AAGAAAGGCA TGAAGGACGC / R: GTGTGCCCA TTTGGACA TCA); ROR-\u03b3 t (F: TGGAAGATGTGGACTTCGTT / R: TGGTTCCCCAAGTTCAGGAT).\n\nFlow cytometric analysis of pulmonary leukocytes \nPulmonary leukocytes were isolated as described previously 51 with slight modifications. WT and gal3 \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with C . neoformans (H99 strain) were killed on day 3 post-infection and their lungs removed aseptically. The lungs were fragmented and digested with type II collagenase (1\u2009mg/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. The cells were filtered on nylon filters (70\u2009\u03bcm; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and washed with sterile PBS. For erythrocyte elimination, cell suspensions were treated with 500\u2009\u03bcl of NH 4 Cl buffer for 5\u2009min on ice followed by the addition of 10-fold excess PBS. Leukocytes were centrifuged at 800\u00d7 g for 5\u2009min, washed twice with sterile PBS and suspended in sterile PBS containing 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FACS buffer). The cells were counted in a Neubauer\u2019s hematocytometer and adjusted to the density of 10 7 cells/ml. Fifty microlitres of Fc block monoclonal antibody was added to each 100\u2009\u00b5l cell suspension, followed by incubation for 30\u2009min on ice to inhibit non-specific binding. The cells were then incubated with a biotinylated hamster anti-mouse \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell receptor antibody (0.5\u2009mg/ml, BD Biosciences) for 1\u2009h on ice. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated streptavidin (10\u2009\u03bcg/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The frequency of \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes present in the pulmonary leukocytes was obtained by flow cytometry using a BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer.\n\nAnalysis of the stability of extracellular vesicles \nEVs were obtained as previously described 52 , with slight modifications. After fungal cells growth until the stationary phase (1\u00d710 7 to 10 8 cells/ml), culture supernatants were separated by sequential centrifugation at 4000\u00d7 g and 15,000\u00d7 g . Pellets were discarded, and the supernatants concentrated through Amicon ultrafiltration system with a 100-kDa cutoff (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The obtained material was ultracentrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were washed three times with PBS, by using successive steps of resuspension and centrifugation, at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Vesicles detection was based on the sterol presence in their membranes by using a quantitative fluorimetric Amplex Red sterol assay kit (Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The EVs stability was evaluated according to protocols previously described 16 , with slight modifications. Briefly, EVs incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 , for 1\u2009h, with Gal-3 (#G5170, Gal-3 human recombinant, expressed in E . coli , Sigma-Aldrich) at different final concentrations (0\u221210\u2009\u00b5g/ml). The concentrations of all control lectins were normalized according to carbohydrate binding sites. Vesicle size was estimated by dynamic light scattering, for each experimental condition. Data were expressed as the average of three runs. EVs stability was also examined through a radioactive assay through cultivation of C . neoformans in the presence of [1- 14 C] palmitic acid 16 . The suspension of radiolabeled EVs was incubated with Gal-3 under the conditions described above and the suspension was ultracentrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Supernatants and pellets were saved for scintillation counting.\n\nVesicle disruption and uptake by macrophages \nTo study vesicle stability and vesicle uptake by macrophages from WT and gal3 \u2212/\u2212 mice, we used a protocol that was previously described 16 , with slight modifications. Thioglycolate-elicited macrophages were harvested from the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6 WT or gal3 \u2212/\u2212 mice, and grown in DME medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 10% NCTC (Invitrogen), 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin (Invitrogen). Forty-eight-well tissue culture plates were seeded with elicited peritoneal macrophages (4\u00d710 5 cells/well). EVs were obtained from C . neoformans cultures that were pulsed with [1- 14 C] palmitic acid 72\u2009h before EVs harvesting, as previously described 16 . A volume of 200\u2009\u03bcl of vesicle-containing medium was added to each well. Controls included vesicle-containing medium alone. After 1, 2, 6, or 12\u2009h incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 9.5% CO 2 , culture supernatants were collected. The adhered cells were also collected, washed three times with PBS, lysed in 200\u2009\u03bcl of 25\u2009mM deoxycholate and the resultant material was collected for scintillation counting. The harvested material from the culture supernatants was ultracentrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Supernatants (containing components of disrupted EVs) and pellets (containing intact EVs) were saved for scintillation counting. The radioactivity distribution in the three fractions was expressed as percent of the total radioactivity.\n\nRNA sequencing and data analysis \nTotal RNA was obtained from three biological replicates of C . neoformans cells (H99 strain) incubated with minimal medium or Gal-3 (0.1\u2009\u03bcg/ml in minimal medium) for 24\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lysed with the use of mortar and pestle for total RNA isolation. Total RNA was obtained using Trizol (Invitrogen), treated with RNase-free DNA I (Fermentas), and cleaned up using an RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen Biotecnologia Brasil Ltda, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The RNA was quantified using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies), and analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system to assess the RNA integrity, which ranged from 9.5 to 9.9 (integrity number). The barcoded libraries were prepared and sequenced in the Center for Medical Genomics of the Ribeirao Preto Medical School (Ribeirao Preto, Brazil) using the Illumina Truseq mRNA Sample Preparation kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Subsequent clustering and sequencing were performed with the Illumina NextSeq 500 system. Paired-end reads were de-multiplexed and analyzed against C . neoformans reference genes using the Kallisto software (version 0.43.1) 53 , resulting in an average value of 21M reads per sample. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using edgeR 54 . Gene expression changes in the range of >1.0 or <\u22121.0 log fold ( p \u2009<\u20090.05) were classified as biologically and statistically significant.\n\nStatistical analysis \nData are either the means of or representative results from at least three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. All statistical analyses and comparisons were performed using the GraphPad Prism Software version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The log rank test was used to compare the survival rates between the study groups. A p -value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nData availability \nThe RNA sequence data have been deposited in NCBI under BioProject accession number PRJNA415606. All other relevant data supporting the findings of the study are available in this article and its Supplementary Information files, or from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n\n\nSource link ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john perfect", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "f.t. liu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calcofluor white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ribeirao preto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carl zeiss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sabouraud dextrose agar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hayward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hatfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neubauer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "committee of ethics in animal research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of sao paulo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "electron microscopy sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biotek instruments, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thermo fisher scientific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "millipore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bd biosciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "invitrogen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexa fluor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bio-rad laboratories", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leica microsystems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cfu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sigma-aldrich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amicon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illumina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson immuno research laboratories", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "difco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for medical genomics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of s\u00e3o paulo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert einstein college of medicine institutional animal care and use committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ribeirao preto medical school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "research ethics committee of the university hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qiagen biotecnologia brasil ltda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "life technologies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guava technologies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "manassas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fitchburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billerica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "va", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sabouraud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sao paulo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winooski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hercules", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pharmingen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "durham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. louis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:33.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "25428637ee1e9c4db69db9c854ec2022930a8066", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Gl4pMVfIy_NnlmiyLHpA3mB_o47I9v2e7JegDUGa7IDrVD10jojHTjDagq_9hcqU-", "site_full": "www.gistmania.com", "site": "gistmania.com", "site_section": "http://www.gistmania.com/talk/board,14.480/sort,last_post/desc.html", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Naijapals Base (Metro life) (Page 13) -

The company was looking for a Business Intelligence (BI) tool to facilitate faster business decisions, detailed planning, and more meaningful reporting while enabling the simulation of different business scenarios. The company's legacy system had reached the limit of what it could deliver in terms of integrated planning, visualisation and simulation. \nPrevero was selected from a short-list of vendors for its future-oriented development approach and the ability to integrate a separate module for HR management.

Southern California have prompted several colleges to close campuses or cancel classes. \nAll three colleges in the Ventura County Community College District were closed Wednesday, the district said on its website, because of the \"fire, evacuations, power outages, poor air quality and travel restrictions.\" \nWhile its campus remained safe , the University of California, Los Angeles, canceled classes Wednesday due to traffic snarls related to the fires. UCLA briefly lost power Wednesday and had to rely on generators to \"sustain limited operations,\" the university said. UCLA also canceled a men's basketball game. And the Daily Bruin , the student newspaper, reported that UCLA's student health center was distributing masks to help protect students from breathing the smoke. \nCalifornia State University, Channel Islands, shut down Wednesday over concerns about power outages and air quality. \nThe Los Angeles-located Mount Saint Mary's University, citing power outages, evacuated its Chalon campus. The university provided shuttle buses to help faculty, students and staff move to another campus. \nThomas Aquinas College, which is located in Ventura County, closed for the remainder of the week after firefighters helped turned back a nearby fire Monday night. \n\"The flames in the surrounding area -- which, at one point, came up to the very edge of the campus access road -- have subsided,\" the college said on its website . \"Although there has been extensive damage to trees and brush, as well as minor damage to the coffee-shop patio, no major structures have been harmed.\" \nUpdate: California State University, Northridge, closed Thursday. \"High winds and smoke from the fires in and around the San Fernando Valley have affected air quality on campus and traffic conditions,\" the university said. \nLos Angeles Valley College also closed Thursday, citing poor air quality from the fires.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

To that end, hiring the right people is one of the most important aspects of managing a successful company, but that\u2019s not always as easy as it sounds. Recent studies show that the traditional job interview process is notoriously unreliable , and it\u2019s easy for bad candidates to slip through your staffing process. \nJason Dana, an assistant professor of management with the Yale School of Management, told The New York Times earlier this year: \u201cResearch that my colleagues and I have conducted shows that the problem with interviews is worse than irrelevance: They can be harmful, undercutting the impact of other, more valuable information about interviewees.\u201d \nDrug screening can help at least separate the good job candidates from the toxic ones. Your workplace culture cannon thrive if a single employee is using and abusing drugs. It\u2019s your responsibility to invest in reliable drug screening tests such as hair follicle drug tests and urine drug tests to avoid hiring nonproductive employees. \nIn addition to identifying applicants or employees with substance abuse problems, there are plenty of other advantages of implementing and administering a workplace drug screening program. Here are some of the benefits of drug testing in the workplace: Fewer workplace accidents \nWhen workers are using drugs and alcohol, whether they are using at work or not, their ability is impaired. If those same employees are operating heavy machinery, driving, or handling hazardous materials, their risk of hurting themselves or someone else is much higher than sober employees. Not only does this open up your company to huge financial liability, but it puts your workers\u2019 lives at risk. Fewer Disciplinary Actions \nFollowing those workplace incidents and accidents, your time and energy will be wasted on disciplinary actions. If your employees are all sober, however, you won\u2019t have to worry about spending that much time correcting their mistakes and punishing them for incidents on the job. Save Money \nYou will certainly save money by not having to worry about these toxic employees. By having only hardworking and sober employees on staff, you\u2019ll eliminate unnecessary legal costs, disciplinary expense, and you\u2019ll also save a significant amount of money on the productivity gains. Because a single bad hire can cost your company so much money, eliminating these future fires in the staffing process can save a lot of money in the long run. \nAccording to the American Management Association, roughly 62% of U.S. employers implement a drug screening program with the goal of guaranteeing employe safety, complying with state regulations, developing a drug-free environment, and protecting their organization\u2019s reputation. \nIf you want to learn more about the benefits of drug and alcohol testing for your workplace, contact Drug Screen Compliance today and start having a healthier and more productive business.

Generic drugs are governed by the same governing framework as branded drugs. The market for generic drugs is based on the premise that patented drugs come with a lifespan of 20 years, which begins from the phase of clinical trials. Hence, this cuts down the commercial life of patented drugs to approximately 15 years. After patent expiry, manufacturers of branded drugs have to face fierce competition from cheap generic contemporaries. Furthermore, the participants in the industry supply chain network such as wholesalers, retailers, pharmacies, and benefit managers also benefit from the sale of generic drugs, since it significantly increases their profit margin. This has emerged as a key growth driver for the generic drugs market. As competition from generic counterparts poses a significant threat to the branded drug industry, innovator companies have adopted more vigorous defense strategies than ever to guard their market share and profits. This, however, has not deterred leading players in generic drugs market from marching ahead with their market expansion plans. By studying closely the defensive strategies undertaken by branded drug companies, the generic drug industry is not only armed to survive battles over patents, but also adopt licensing and partnering strategies to launch new products successfully and ensure that their market thrives. Such factors are expected to boost the sales of generic drugs in the forthcoming years. To present a detailed analysis of the competitive landscape of the market, the report profiles some of the leading generic drug manufacturers.

That solution takes all audio and pumps it out over the network. Then you can use any-old-Internet-radio client to pick it up.\n\nSolution:2\nI have tried streaming live cricket match to other systems in my dorm using VLC, but that was around 3 years back, you can refer this link for how it is done.\nhttp://www.videolan.org/doc/streaming-howto/en/ch02.html \n\nSolution:3\nI really like Subsonic . It's cross-platform and has an Android app as well as a web interface. That way, you can control the music from the phone, and not have to run back to the server to change songs or whatever.\n\nSolution:4\nYou should probably just use the Google Music or the WinAmp app. I use both of them for the same purpose as yours and I have had no problems.\n\nNote:If u also have question or solution just comment us below or mail us on toontricks1994@gmail.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "any-old-internet-radio", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vlc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winamp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:36.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "96c0d53b7c543adf7113876e26a24ffdbe730ab0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21RDfXtuiaQ42geJNUtKA3jAEljqqSTJW9lxesy8aU5ZogOcaD0xCE7rXDKAQhM5P_MEUz2ezEzbJL8J.jbeUF.CE1nZtczXaJ4-", "site_full": "achengula.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://achengula.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HOT NEWS AND UPDATES", "title": "NFS Payback - HOW TO EARN UNLIMITED SHIPMENTS!!!

Imagine if Nazi Germany had invented the atomic bomb?\nAnyway, the other major flop in the fascist plans was bringing the USA into the conflict. Pearl Harbor wasn\u2019t even a major attack on the US Naval forces as most of them were deployed at the time, so literally the only thing it did was ensue a new power for the Allies and begin the end of the war in the Pacific.

Little did I know how amazing and life changing the next 3 weeks were going to be\u2026 So whereabouts in Tanzania did you go to for your elective placement? My three-week placement was spent at Muhimbili national hospital, which is the main referral hospital in Tanzania. On arrival at the hospital I was given a tour of the department and was pleasantly surprised at the amount of equipment available. There were rooms for general x-ray, CT, MR and ultrasound.\nWhat did you do on your placement? During my placement I spent quite a lot of my time in CT which was very fast paced in order to get through the large number of patients that required a CT scan.\nTwo patients where often brought in at the same time, one would get changed whilst the other was scanned in an attempt to speed up service. It was common for patient\u2019s family members to stay beside them during their scan, it took a lot of willpower for me not to ask them to leave.\nWhen contrast was needed this was injected by hand,which meant that numerous syringes were needed. Again very different to how we practice back in the UK, an injector pump was available but never used. My time in CT was extremely invaluable, I admired the work ethic of the radiographers and the level of patient care delivered to each patient even though resources were low.\nThe importance of strong team dynamics was highlighted and is something I will take back to my own practice. \nWhat about general x-ray? The hospital was still working with x-ray film so I got the opportunity to learn how to process x-ray films in the darkroom. I now fully appreciate the value of CR and DR systems in our hospitals and it has given me a context for the recent developments made in Diagnostic imaging!\nThe technique used by radiographers was similar to that in the UK enabling me to to get hands on straight away once I had orientated myself with my new working environment.\nWhere there any challenges with your placement? The biggest challenge I faced was the language barrier my Swahili was little to be desired, luckily staff at the hospital were more than happy to translate for me and teach me phrases, my garbled Swahili seemed to amuse and put a smile on both staff and patients faces at least.\nDuring my time in the hospital I got to know each of the radiographers that worked there, it was fascinating to hear every person\u2019s story, and it made me realise how lucky I am to live and study in the UK.\nWhat about the commute to and from your placement? The journey to and from placement each day was a world away from my usual commute back home. Each morning we took the local Tanzanian bus \u2013 the dalla-dalla, which was quite a culture shock at first, but once accustomed to the organised chaos and running of the dalla dalla it became a fun and thrilling way of travelling around and the best way to emerge myself into my new environment. The buses were overcrowded and and the rule seemed to be that there is always room for one more person!\nIt was not unusual to be stuck in traffic, with street sellers popping their heads in through the open bus windows selling everything from peanuts to watches, but always with a cheeky smile on their faces.\nOnce on the dalla dalla you get very close to the locals giving you a glimpse into their daily life, its safe to say bus journeys back home do not compare.\nWhat else did you get up to? During my time in Tanzania I was fortunate to be given the opportunity to visit a Maasai Tribe. On arrival we were flooded with smiles and laughter and immediately welcomed by the women of the tribe who dressed us all in their traditional clothes. It was a real eye opener to see how little these people had yet they had everything they needed and didn\u2019t seem to yearn for anything more.\nTheir personalities and outlook on life is completely infectious and made me realise as clich\u00e9d as it sounds the importance of having family and friends around you. I felt privileged to have been made to feel so welcome in their home and to experience the Maasai way of living, learning about their rich culture and of course to partake in the traditional dancing.\nSo why did you chose Tanzania for your elective? The main reasons for picking Tanzania as the destination for my elective placement was that I wanted to challenge myself, do something out of the ordinary and experience radiography in a low resource setting. The placement itself was the most eye opening and heartwarming experience of my life and I don\u2019t think I will ever be able to put it all exactly into words.\nI have met some of the most incredible people that I was able to share this amazing experience with. My time in this beautiful country was filled with non-stop smiles, laughter, banter and the occasional tear. I most defiantly achieved what I set out to and so much more, the smiles and laughter of the local people will stay with me for a lifetime. \n \n \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "natalie nash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "tanzania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dar es salaam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhimbili", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:37.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21f478be4faf675828849b8dd30caa5e80d5b483", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21RDfXtuiaQ42geJNUtKA3jAEljqqSTJW9nMyOQ0RHE4cgi39nDRytTGPGEVSJx9VyxU1nEk.NK8flXKH0trGTTnPmA_j2jc8V0-", "site_full": "achengula.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://achengula.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HOT NEWS AND UPDATES", "title": "Catholic School Forced to Cover Up \u2018Pedophile Priest\u2019", "title_full": "Catholic School Forced to Cover Up \u2018Pedophile Priest\u2019", "published": "2017-12-07T10:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21f478be4faf675828849b8dd30caa5e80d5b483", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21RDfXtuiaQ42geJNUtKA3jAEljqqSTJW9nMyOQ0RHE4cgi39nDRytTGPGEVSJx9VyxU1nEk.NK8flXKH0trGTTnPmA_j2jc8V0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Augustino Chengula (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "Catholic School Forced to Cover Up \u2018Pedophile Priest\u2019", "text": "Catholic School Forced to Cover Up \u2018Pedophile Priest\u2019", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "catholic school forced", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:37.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf8187ef3e3640107ab68cce9dc459a3da29fcd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.dZFla3i_pOSK9y.7u6mG09t7T4obsPZTG0SYVJ1qQMjY8RZoKAkUBculRnpDJPJv1AZcaxsVCXFZsjh946DkshWV0KDsUOq.DNd0oqFlAVJbzgNN579lMOI3X45A1.Os-", "site_full": "www.artemis.bm", "site": "artemis.bm", "site_section": "http://www.artemis.bm/blog", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Artemis.bm \u2013 The Catastrophe Bond, Insurance Linked Securities & Investment, Reinsurance Capital, Alternative Risk Transfer and Weather Risk Management Blog", "title": "Validus sponsoring $325m Tailwind Re 2017 catastrophe bond", "title_full": "Validus sponsoring $325m Tailwind Re 2017 catastrophe bond", "published": "2017-12-07T11:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "BM", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf8187ef3e3640107ab68cce9dc459a3da29fcd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.dZFla3i_pOSK9y.7u6mG09t7T4obsPZTG0SYVJ1qQMjY8RZoKAkUBculRnpDJPJv1AZcaxsVCXFZsjh946DkshWV0KDsUOq.DNd0oqFlAVJbzgNN579lMOI3X45A1.Os-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Artemis", "published": "2017-12-07T11:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "Validus sponsoring $325m Tailwind Re 2017 catastrophe bond", "text": "\nBermudian reinsurance group Validus Holdings is sponsoring its first full catastrophe bond issuance with the launch to the ILS market of a $325 million Tailwind Re Ltd. (Series 2017-1) transaction, as it seeks to add more capital markets backed retrocession to its coverage.\n\nThe fact a major reinsurer is turning to the catastrophe bond market for retro at this time could be a sign that the ILS market and cat bond investors are set to offer keen pricing at a time whan other retro markets are seeking steep price increases on their products.\nCatastrophe bond issuance since the major hurricanes has pointed to just a 5% to 15% risk adjusted price increase, which is below the discussions of 20% to 40% price rises that traditional markets have been slating for retrocessional reinsurance.\nSo it\u2019s encouraging to hear that Validus is choosing this juncture to enter the cat bond market with its first deal and we could see other major players follow suit in time.\nTailwind Re Ltd. is a newly formed Bermuda special purpose insurer (SPI) established to issue series of catastrophe bond notes for the sponsor.\nIn this first issuance, Tailwind Re Ltd. will offer three tranches of Series 2017-1 notes to cat bond investors, proceeds from the sale of which will be used to fully collateralized underlying reinsurance agreements with Validus companies.\nWe\u2019re told that the transaction will provide retrocession and reinsurance to Validus Re, Talbot Underwriting and its syndicate at Lloyd\u2019s of London, Western World and other Validus Holdings subsidiaries.\nThe Tailwind Re 2017-1 cat bond will provide the company with a capital markets backed source of collateralized reinsurance and retro covering the multiple perils of U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands named storms and earthquakes.\nThe reinsurance protection from the Tailwind Re 2017-1 cat bond will run for a four-year period, protecting Validus on an annual aggregate basis and using a weighted PCS industry loss index trigger.\nThree cat bond tranches will be issued by Tailwind Re, all with different levels of risk and return for investors, but covering the same perils and territories on an industry loss basis, we understand.\nA $125 million Class A tranche of notes have an initial attachment point of 3.79%, expected loss of 3.41% and are offered to ILS investors with price guidance of 7.75% to 8.5%.\nA $125 million Class B tranche of notes are a little riskier, having an initial attachment point of 5.11%, expected loss of 4.43% and are offered to cat bond investors with price guidance of 9.5% to 10.25%.\nThe final $75 million Class C tranche are the riskiest, with an initial attachment point of 6.24%, expected loss of 5.64% and are being offered to cat bond investors with coupon price guidance of 11.5% to 12.5%.\nWe are told that each tranche will require an initial franchise deductible to be met before industry losses begin to accumulate to the index. We\u2019re also told that this Tailwind Re cat bond would have faced losses during the Katrina, Rita, Wilma year of 2005, when the riskiest tranche would have paid out in full and the mid-risk tranche would have seen some loss of principal.\nRetro cat bonds like this, that are triggered on an aggregate industry loss basis, provide value reinsurance protection to sponsoring re/insurance groups like Validus. This year they are proving their worth, with a number set to pay out or at risk due to recent catastrophe events.\nWith catastrophe bond market pricing set to remain efficient, it\u2019s possible we could see more major re/insurers turn to the cat bond market in this way.\nWe\u2019ll update you as the Tailwind Re Ltd.

It made headlines twice over for walking away with bountiful harvests from two of its portfolio companies, in what could be termed as \u2018bumper exits\u2019 in the parlance of financial investments.The private equity behemoth made around seven times return on Eris Lifesciences, an Ahmedabad-based pharmaceuticals company that made a debut on the bourses in the middle of the calendar year. ChrysCapital had invested around Rs 200 crore in Eris in 2011 in lieu of a 16.25 per cent stake.\u201cExits have picked up in the industry and a vibrant IPO market has been instrumental in this,\u201d says Gaurav Ahuja, Managing Director of ChrysCapital Advisors LLP. The firm has over $3 billion assets under management. \u201cChrysCapital took Eris public in June. The Eris IPO achieved two landmarks \u2014 it was the largest pharma IPO in India and the largest exit by a single private equity investor through IPO,\u201d adds Ahuja.ChrysCapital also made a partial exit from non-banking financial company AU Small Finance Bank, earlier known as Au Financiers (India), raking in seven times return on the investment it made in the company in 2013. Other investors who made partial exits from the IPO of the Jaipur-based company include Warburg Pincus, IFC (the private-sector arm of the World Bank) and Kedaara Capital. They all had invested in AU Small Finance Bank between 2010 and 2014.These fund managers are not the only ones to be rolling in moolah. More recently, in October, Godrej Industries\u2019 agri-business subsidiary Godrej Agrovet went public, helping Temasek Holdings make a partial exit. The Singapore state investment firm had invested Rs 572 crore in Godrej Agrovet in December 2012. Even as the macro environment remains subdued in the country, an uptick in the primary market has paved the exit route for the entire risk capital industry, giving hope to even those players who have been waiting in the wings to make a strong come back.Take Fairwinds Private Equity (earlier known as Reliance Private Equity) for instance. It is a good example of a private equity firm springing back to life on the back of a good exit environment in the recent months. The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG)-promoted private equity firm started investing in 2010 and had no exits to show until 2016. But in 2016 and 2017, it made four successful exits: Shankara Building Products (via IPO and secondary sale with a 4.86x returns); Amber Enterprises (secondary sale; with 1.53x returns); Khadim India (via IPO; 4.88x returns); and Pathways World School (via buyback by promoters; return data unavailable). According to research firm Venture Intelligence, fund managers have already recorded 213 exits worth $9,978 million so far this calendar year, making 2017 a bumper year for private equity/venture capital exits. Between January and October 2016, the total number of private equity/venture capital exits stood at 198 with the total value amounting to $7,373 million. During the said months in 2015, as many as 240 private equity/venture capital exits took place worth $9,098 million. That\u2019s not all. The industry, this year, has also witnessed the highest number of private equity-backed IPOs, some of which were blockbusters. Sample this: As many as 17 companies launched their IPOs between January and October 2017 worth $1,040 million, recording close to a 25 per cent jump from the corresponding period last year when 14 companies went public. In 2015, a total of 13 companies had raised $435 million. \u201cIPOs are traditionally the best source of exits for private equity investors. A strong revival in the primary market, coupled with a buoyant secondary market, has catalysed a slew of healthy exits through the public market route this year,\u201d says Arun Natarajan, founder of Venture Intelligence. \u201cGiven the large pipeline of PE-VC investments that have matured \u2014 right from 2007-08 \u2014 this positive trend will encourage several more such exits,\u201d he adds. Both primary and capital markets have performed remarkably well in 2017, with capital raised from the primary market at an all-time high (Rs 65,000 crore so far in 2017 as per estimates available with Religare Securities), backed by the record-breaking run witnessed in the Indian stock market (up 26 per cent in 2017 so far). In comparison, the secondary market performance has been a welcome relief for investors after two years of flat performance (-1 per cent from 2015 to 2016). On the primary market front, however, from about Rs 13,500 crore raised in 2015 to approximately Rs 26,000 crore in 2016, \u201cto the all-time high fund raising done in 2017, there has been considerable increase in investor appetite for IPOs,\u201d says Hitesh Agrawal, Executive Vice-President and Head (retail research) at Religare Securities. Echoing the sentiment, Nitish Poddar, partner and national leader of Private Equity at KPMG India, says, \u201cThe IPO activity gained pace this year and emerged as a clear choice of exit route for large investments.\u201d He, however, adds that the initial few months of 2017 saw muted exits as everyone was waiting and watching the impact of demonetisation and GST. \u201cOnce GST was announced and demonetisation interruption was stabilised, general investor confidence increased significantly as is witnessed by the increase in market indices and the number of new IPOs that have been successfully launched.\u201dAccording to another school of thought, there is a growing desperation among fund managers to cash out from their portfolio companies. While established investors and entrepreneurs are well in line as far as their growth trajectory is concerned, there are others who are refusing to wait any longer amidst uncertainty in the deal environment on account of economic reforms including the GST. \u201cFirst, it was demonetisation that left small businesses in a lurch. Then, the GST gave rise to enormous confusion about the new tax regime,\u201d says a Managing Partner of a boutique private equity firm, on condition of anonymity. This, the person says, has made the investor community rather cautious and desperate, scouting for exit routes. Besides, year 2015 that witnessed capital infusion in hordes has been an eye opener for fund managers. While the year saw some great ideas in the burgeoning e-commerce sector with increased investor interest, the shakeout within the industry in no time prompted several entrepreneurs to shut shop. Currently, there is mammoth pressure from the limited partners (the main source of money for private equity and venture capital firms) on investors to exit. Typically, a single private equity/venture capital investment cycle lasts for about three to four years. After which, PE firms normally exit by way of trade sale, public listing, recapitalisation and secondary sale. Trade sale is the most common exit method for private equity investments as trade buyers from the same industry are often more likely to realise synergies with the business and are therefore, the most natural buyers of the business. Typically, public listing takes place during positive market conditions. Venture capital investment cycles generally last five to seven years.In terms of secondary sales, SAIF Partners stole the show when it raked in a 26.5 times return from its high-profile investment in One97 Communications, the parent of digital payments leader Paytm, by selling its existing stake to Japanese Internet and telecom conglomerate Softbank. \u201cGoing forward, strategic sales too will see a systemic upturn over the coming year as the buyout model becomes increasingly more popular in India,\u201d says Yogesh Singh, partner at Trilegal, a law firm with a pan India presence. \u201cStrategic sales continue to be a preferred mode of exit for PE firms holding a majority stake in a portfolio company,\u201d he adds.While exits have started picking up in the country over the past few years, India has always been a difficult market as far as generation of high returns across portfolios is concerned. The reasons behind this are varied, explains Singh. The lack of ability to take leverage to drive returns, currency risk, a complex legal enforcement system are some of the factors that result in fewer exit options for investors. Despite this, some private equity firms have done significantly well by partnering with entrepreneurs they trust, building genuine sector expertise so as to truly partner with the promoters rather than simply being the sources of capital, among others. Road Ahead If the current stage is, in anyway, a precursor to the months to come, the joy ride for fund managers is expected to continue. And it is not restricted to the exit market alone. \u201cWith exits going up, new investments also get a boost,\u201d says Rituraj Sinha, Chief Operating Officer at security services company SIS that went public in August this year. \u201cWe had two options in front of us. We could raise a fresh round of funding from either another investor or the stock market. We chose the latter as the time was just ripe,\u201d he adds. While SIS paved the way for a partial exit for its investor CX Partners through the IPO, it has already seen a full cycle of investment and exit in the past as well. SIS raised its first round of funding from global private equity major DE Shaw way back in 2008 (it was the first private equity funding in the sector), which exited the company in 2013 by selling its entire stake to CX Partners. So far, in the first nine months of the calendar year, private equity firms have hit an all-time high in terms of new investments. They pumped in about $17.6 billion in Indian companies, sailing past the previous high of $17.3 billion recorded in the 2015 calendar year. \u201cGoing forward, considering that the corporate earnings growth and the Indian economic activity are at a trough, the expected revival on both these fronts should keep the primary and capital market upbeat in 2018 as well,\u201d says Agrawal of Religare Securities. After all, investor sentiments are quite bullish, and the flow of funds into equities as an asset class is going strong. This is being driven in part by the government\u2019s clampdown on black money and its efforts towards formalisation of the Indian economy.Besides, the recent upgrade in India\u2019s rating by Moody\u2019s comes as a major boost to market sentiment, especially at a time when all eyes are on India\u2019s growth that has come a long way down to report a 5.7 per cent gross domestic product (GDP) for the quarter ended June 2017 from over nine per cent growth registered for the quarter ended March 2016. \u201cThe sovereign upgrade will enable lower cost of borrowing in international markets for Indian businesses and attract more foreign fund flows into India,\u201d says Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General at the Confederation of Indian Industry.

It's a beautiful place but there are some limitations, the only Internet is available at restaurants and the power is on from 6pm to 6am. This has meant that I haven't been able to spend more than 2.5 hours a day working on my laptop so I've been using my free time to read lots of articles on Medium and Dev.to.\nHere are a list (in no particular order) of some of my favourite reads.\nHow to be an insanely good developer One of the lines in this article is\nGood Programming is a few brief moments of sublime elegance embedded in months of niggling, exacting, precise trivialities. This really struck true for me, thinking back on the work I did at my last job. Most days I would write code and implement features but feel like anyone could write it. Then occasionally I would solve a problem or make a slight change to the existing code that just makes everything that bit better.\nThere are so many great quotable lines that I\u2019ll just list them here.\nYour job is to make it work, make it right and make it fast in that order. Do the simplest thing that could possibly work. It\u2019s hard enough to find an error in your code when you\u2019re looking for it; it\u2019s even harder when you\u2019ve assumed your code is error-free. First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. This list of quotes is a great foundation for the mentality needed to become a great developer and I will aim to follow them for the rest of my career.\nNodeJs Vs Ruby On Rails : Analysis Worth Doing ! I've read a lot of articles recently that say that the differ between a a junior and senior developer is the ability to make decisions about architecture and selecting the optimal stack. The ability to do this often comes from experience with a range of programming languages, so I have been considering learning something apart from JavaScript.\nThis article was great for outlining the pros and cons for both Ruby on Rails and Node.js. I learnt a lot about Ruby on Rails but also learnt a few new things about Node.js.\nHaving read the article, I don't think that I will learn Ruby on Rails as a new backend technology. When I do decide to expand into a new language, I'm currently thinking that it will be Go or another performance based language.\nWant to boost your job prospects? Become an authority on something. Here\u2019s how. This article was really inspiring. The idea of becoming an authority on a given topic whist helping educate others on what you've learnt. The fact that he explicitly states that you don't have to be an expert to create an authority piece, you learn some things and then share that with the world.\nThe last point that Beau covers is that you just have to work at it consistently. Whether its a tutorial series, writing an ebook or article posts, you just need to make progress on it consistently.\nFor me, I realised that I just need to keep making new things, using new technologies and learning every day.\nHow to Permanently Change Any Behavior and Evolve Into the Best Version of Yourself Everyone wants to be better. Better at sport. Better at their hobbies. Better paid. But people don't seem to go for things 100%. That means fully committing yourself to accomplish something great, but fully committing is scary so people go for 98%. Cheat meals on diets, skipping a sports practice, smoking just one cigarette.\nThis article explains that it's harder to do something if you don't give it your all. It goes on to say that changing just one small thing every day compounds upon its self. These little changes Snowball into bigger changes and then into life changing differences.\nIt also explains the theory of expectations. You will never get more than you expect and you will never achieve more than you expect. For me, I had to ask myself whether I was aiming to achieve enough? Could I achieve more in the same time or reach my goals earlier than I planned? What would I have to do today to achieve my goals sooner?\nThis article goes on to talk about your environment and how it affects you. It uses the quote from Darren Hardy:\nYou can\u2019t hang around negative people and expect a positive result. I've been in situations at both ends of the spectrum. I've had times where the people around me are aiming for medeocrity, spending all their time watching TV and never investing in themselves. I saw the consequences as I found myself becoming lazier, putting off things I knew would be good for me. I've also spent time with an amazing group of super psyched people. You feed off their energy and they feed off yours. You push each other, challenge each other and have some amazing conversations.\nI realised that I need to try harder to surround myself with people like that. I need to work on my environment, not just myself.\nThe article ends with the line\nYour best self is only a few slightly better daily choices away. Which I found really inspiring.\nSome of the Best Coding Tools Aren't Coding Tools This article gives you hints and tips for how to make your life as a developer that little bit easier.\nFrom using password managers to store all of your test password, credit cards, emails and more, to using specific apps to allow you to switch between applications (no more alt + tab). It introduces ingenious ways to use snippet tools and text expanders to shorthand common phrases or complex symbols. It also covers note taking apps and todo lists, stating that these should do their best to stay out of your way.\nIn the summary the article says that these tools are \"clearing away organizational and mental clutter so you can focus your attention\u201d. I\u2019m definitely planning to implement a few of these over the next week and see how much of a difference it makes.\nChina\u2019s Citizen Score Could Herald New Global Data Based Caste System This was a very challenging read for me. Having lived in China for 3 months and talking with foreigners and locals about the Chinese citizen score (CSS). Its a system which gives you a score based on a selection of criteria (financial, criminal, social, etc.)\nI started reading this thinking that the CSS was such a horrible abuse of power, especially over how the government use your Wechat conversations to judge how good you are (based on their criteria). This article turns the whole concept on its head.\nWhy are westerners complaining about a system that uses your personal data to change the way you interact with the world? We have Facebook, Google and amazon changing what we see online based on our personal data every day. We change what we post onto Facebook, Instagram and snapchat so that we get the most likes possible, whilst they write the algorithms defining how many people get to see the posts.\nThe Chinese citizen score isn\u2019t as bad as we all think. They\u2019re quite transparent with what they\u2019ll use and how they\u2019ll use it.\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed this post then hit that clap button and subscribe to get more articles like this. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "beau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darren hardy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "css", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "best coding tools", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:38.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4542cb521906e2922a4edce9c871ce91fa28b285", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXuS5hEjW8Bc4wFrrplPuTpNV7UkQg1Gkr8I_QkpWAW86IHWmco5A1NvdJFD1h3PgFCmKYeMCyq4p4CGqadB2qU", "site_full": "niyitabiti.net", "site": "niyitabiti.net", "site_section": "http://www.niyitabiti.net/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Gistmaster", "title": "NBC empowers over 700 youths in Kano", "title_full": "NBC empowers over 700 youths in Kano", "published": "2017-12-07T10:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4542cb521906e2922a4edce9c871ce91fa28b285", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXuS5hEjW8Bc4wFrrplPuTpNV7UkQg1Gkr8I_QkpWAW86IHWmco5A1NvdJFD1h3PgFCmKYeMCyq4p4CGqadB2qU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gistmaster", "published": "2017-12-07T10:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "NBC empowers over 700 youths in Kano", "text": "tweet \nBy Princewill Ekwujuru \nThe Nigerian Bottling Company Limited (NBC) has empowered over 700 youths at the Kano edition of its program, \u2018Youth Empowered\u2019 Workshop. \nThe workshop is part of the Coca-Cola Hellenic global initiative designed to support over 500,000 young unemployed people between the ages of 18-30 by 2020, to build life and business skills and long-lasting networks that would translate to meaningful employment and self-sufficiency. \nSpeaking at the event, Comrade Garba Mohammed, the Commissioner of Information, Youth, Sport and Culture, expressed the government\u2019s appreciation in the company\u2019s drive to help tackle the scourge of unemployment in the country. \nMohammed noted that the state government was ready to collaborate with NBC on initiatives that concern the upliftment and empowerment of youths. \nHe stated: \u201cOver the last two years, the State Government had embarked on a similar initiative to assist 70,000 youths in the state.\u201d \nWhile commending the Company for taking the bold step to assist the youths, he urged other corporate organizations to emulate the gesture from NBC by initiating other highly productive ventures for Nigerian youths, advising the participating youths to make the best use of the programme. \nThe NBC Legal, Public Affairs and Communication Director, Mrs Sade Morgan, explained that the huge turnout for the programme demonstrates the willingness and readiness of the youths to learn new skills as well as desire to tap from the depth of knowledge of mentors present at the training. \nShe stated further that the program is largely informed by the desire of the company to address a disturbing unemployment statistics in Nigeria which seems to be growing at an alarming rate, with recent reports showing that one out of every four Nigerian youth is unemployed. \nOn his part, the NBC Public Affairs Manager, Abuja and North region, Aminu Mohammed, described the program as laudable and would go a long way to boost literacy in the North. \nOne of the NBC Youth Empowered mentors, a lecturer in the Department of Mass Communication, Bayero University, Kano, Dr.Bala Mohammed, stated that the initiative by NBC is highly commendable considering the huge youth population in the North and the consequent rate of unemployment that exist in the region. \nNBC Youth Empowered has taken participants through workshops in Lagos, Port-Harcourt and Kano, to help them discover themselves, understand their strengths and developmental opportunities, as well as provide a platform for meaningful interaction with business leaders and mentors. \nParticipants were taken through a 3-day business skill workshop designed to provide them with essential business skills, such as project and time management, business planning, negotiation, financial literacy, communication and sales skills.

That is my pet peeve. Not the supposed edgelords themselves, rather the people who accuse others of being edgelords.\nIt is a common habit in modern pop culture to turn away from traditional depictions of attributes which may or may not be considered cliche, and to this end people go to extreme lengths. Should someone remark on the number of people killed IC, he is branded an edgelord. Should a person threaten someone in a mundane manner, they're branded an edgelord.\nExample time! In the new Spiderman Homecoming movie, Michael Keaton performs one of the best scenes in modern cinematography - the car scene where he threatens Spiderman for interfering with his business. The execution is chilling.\nNow, imagine a rogue-type person in some tavern finding out that a person has been pestering them over and over, and they find said person in said tavern, sit down next to them with a pistol on the table and say the following:\n\"I'll give you a chance. Forget this, forget all of it, and I'll let you live. Interfere with my business again and I'll kill ya. I'll kill everyone you know.\"\nThere is no doubt in my mind that most would brand this edgy.\nDeath knights doing blood magic and performing general gore is also edgy, apparently. So is brooding and lamenting their state of undeath.\nThis also brings us to the 'non-serious' characters who supposedly achieve humour by being unimpressed with traditionally impressive things. The modern art of Mock RP, I call it. Most visible in goblins, dwarves and worgen for some reason. Their remarks and easy-going attitude drains the seriousness, impressiveness and epicness out of a given scenario. While such characters can be fun, I do like my dramatically heroic moments of facing some horrible demon.\nPersonal peeves, I suppose.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:38.051+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1001c00fc0b0923d7d1683be30b92275a3ecab6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LQMIn3mdI5_9CNxiYczfxNhwp9Hnhe30W5WH8XMrX32kMC8pfw_w4L5VgL74GleXhyyAtcOOGISA--", "site_full": "eu.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/941876/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Argent Dawn - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "Peeves of Fourteen", "title_full": "Peeves of Fourteen - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T04:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "847510da01488f83eaabe89f40380642fa5109b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LQMIn3mdI5_9CNxiYczfxNhwp9Hnhe30W5WH8XMrX32kMC8pfw_w4L5VgL74GleXixjECZhw7s6KvRxt_0eRrQ", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "Kaielah", "published": "2017-12-07T17:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Michael Keaton can be \"edgy\" because he wasn't an endless source of remarks like that.
