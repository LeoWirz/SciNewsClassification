(Photo: Internet). \nThe significance of Fidel Castro in the memory of Juan Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez, father of Eli\u00e1n, recalls today one of the most memorable battles devised by the historical leader of the Revolution: the return of the child to the island. \n\u201cWithout him, without his wise decisions, without his physical presence in every act, in every march, without his leadership I think this would not have been posible\u201d, said Juan Miguel in an interview with Escambray . \nThe cause of the child born in 1993 in C\u00e1rdenas, Cuban province of Matanzas, gave rise to a worldwide campaign demanding his return to the island. The barely six-year-old had been rescued by American fishermen a few days after the shipwreck in which his mother and other people died when trying to reach the United States illegally. \nAccording to Juan Miguel, Fidel followed step by step the legal process he was faced with in the North American country to recover his son who had been kidnapped by his relatives in Miami, Florida. These people counted on the support of the anti-Cuban mafia. The Commander in Chief led an unprecedented battle in this respect that turned into one of the most important political victories of the island against the North American government, he added. \nThe article says that as soon as Juan Miguel caught on the trap being prepared in Miami, he asked the help of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Cuba (Minrex), so that its authorities would handle the return of his son, Eli\u00e1n. However, both Fidel and Juan Miguel knew that in more than 40 years the US government had never agreed to file a legal request of that nature, that\u2019s why they needed the help of the people and the international community to denounce the kidnapping. \nJuan Miguel said to Fidel that he had no interest in going there, all he wanted was to have Eli\u00e1n back. The Cuban leader told him not to worry because starting the next day, the whole country would be involved in the claim for the return of his son. \n\u201cAfter talking for an entire night with Fidel, I felt a great relief. I felt calmer when I saw that the leadership of the country and our lifelong leader, personally met me and gave me their support\u201d, said Gonz\u00e1lez. \nAlmost five months after the kidnapping, on April 22, 2000, Attorney General Janet Reno announced in the CBS that little Elian was traveling by plane to the Andrews Air Base, in Washington DC, where he will meet with his father. \nJuan Miguel said that on the way to the airport, he received a phone called from the marshalls that had rescued his son and he could talk to him. He was crying. He told him to be quiet, that those were his friends, and that they would both meet soon. \n\u201cWhen the plane landed, it entered a hangar. I remember someone lent me an overcoat because Eli\u00e1n had been taken out of the house where he was staying in underware and just convered with a blanket. I went through all that hangar until I got to the plane and to where he was. People said that when we both hugged, if a needle fell, we would feel the noise\u201d, he recalled. \nEli\u00e1n\u2019s classmates and part of the family gave him a memorable welcome in Havana\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed Airport. \u201cHe (Fidel) was not physically present, as he is not today, yet he was the most present, I would say, because he was aware of the least that happened\u201d, Juan Miguel added. \nSince then, the Cuban leader maintained a close friendship with child Eli\u00e1n and his family.

In this week\u2019s edition of Feedback Loop, we talk about the future of Windows Phone, whether it makes sense to build media centers discuss the preferences for metal vs. plastic on smartphones. All that and more past the break the proof of concept. \nJust because you can do something, should you? Samsung thinks so. Its second experimentally screened phone taps into its hardware R&D and production clout to offer something not many other companies can make. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM WINDOWS PHONE? The same high-resolution (2,560 \u2013 1,600) screen \u2014 we\u2019re certain a mere 1080p \u201cPlus\u201d curved display. \nAnd so, following the Galaxy Round, here\u2019s the Galaxy Edge. If you take the basic shape and concept, it\u2019s the spitting image of the curved-screen Youm prototype spied at CES a little less than two years ago. \nNow, though, it\u2019s a for-real smartphone you can buy. I\u2019ve been testing it out in Japan, where it launched instead of the Note 4, although both the Note 4 and the Note Edge will eventually be available in the US. Fortunately. \nGalaxy Note Edge is how much it resembles the Note 4 \nThe ability to shrink the likes of Chrome and Google Maps to a popup window and layer it on top of other apps is also useful; I\u2019d love to see something similar on the iPhone 6 Plus. \nDespite the unusual, curved screen, it still packs all of the good things that made the Note 4 such a strong choice. But bragging rights aside, is there enough of an argument for a curved screen? Should you just get the Note 4 anyway? METAL VS. PLASTIC PHONE BODIES? Galaxy Note 4 because the setup is identical here. Yes running on Android 4.4 KitKat. \nThe exploration of space stands as one of humanity\u2019s greatest achievements. While history has hailed the men and women who reached the cosmos, and those who helped them get there, much of the infrastructure that sent them skyward lies forgotten and dilapidated. \nGalaxy Note 4 running Android 4.4 KitKat. \nAnd how does Apple\u2019s biggest phone compare to the Note Edge? Well, both remain unwieldy to grip, and the Note Edge is wider. However, the edged screen nuzzles into my hand better and those software tweaks mentioned above give it the advantage. However, just like the stylus, there\u2019s a while before you get the knack of all the little provisions Samsung\u2019s made to ease users into this screen size. \nRoland Miller has spent nearly half his life chronicling these landmarks before they are lost forever long been obsessed with space as a child, he dreamed of being an astronaut. HARDWARE \nIts curves are subjective and divisive; my friends and colleagues have offered up reactions ranging from outright bemusement to adoration. The screen looks great, with the punchy contrast and sharpness that\u2019s been a Samsung flagship mainstay for years. We\u2019ll get back to that edge, but it\u2019s the headline part of a 5.6-inch Quad-HD+ display. \nThis means a little chunk of extra screen makes the phone just less than 4mm wider, and around 2mm shorter, than the Note 4. ONE-HANDED USE \nBoth come with software tricks like shrinkable keyboards as well as a new, tiny floating menu that can be stuck to the outer edge of the screen. This duplicates the capacitive button row, which could be a solution of sorts for lefties. \nI can even make this secondary menu transparent, allowing me to maintain all that screen space. The ability to shrink the likes of Chrome and Google Maps to a popup window and layer it on top of other apps is also useful I\u2019d love to see something similar on the iPhone 6 Plus. SOFTWARE \nIf you\u2019re looking to learn more about the stylus\u2019 uses, I\u2019d advise a quick read of Brad\u2019s Galaxy Note 4 review, because the setup is identical here. Yes, there are TouchWiz bits running on Android 4.4 KitKat, but Samsung continues to clear away unnecessary bloat and options. \nIt\u2019s still a work in progress, though, and I feel the settings menus are particularly obtuse compared to other Android phones \u2014 and especially iOS. It takes some getting used to. The Galaxy Note Edge grabs your attention. Its curves are subjective and divisive; my friends and colleagues have offered up reactions ranging from outright bemusement to adoration. \nBut let\u2019s focus on what\u2019s different here: that edge. There are two display modes you can flit between: a slender, unassuming bar that can display a customized message and a more substantial column that attempts to offer extra functionality, notifications or context-dependent menus for certain apps, like the camera. The front-facing camera is also a top-end sensor compared to the competition, 3.7 megapixels with an f/1.9 lens. \nWhile I\u2019m not a huge selfie taker, you\u2019ll have to ask our Senior Selfie Editor , but I do take a whole lot of photos with my smartphone, so I was interested to see how Samsung\u2019s newest smartphone camera handled. The same high-resolution 2,560 \u2013 1,600 screen we\u2019re certain 1080p \u201cPlus\u201d curved display. \nWhen it\u2019s expanded, the UI is a basic row of icons, which you can navigate with a little swipe. This may look a little unusual, but swishing through the various mini-screens is immensely satisfying. \nAnd how does Apple\u2019s biggest phone compare to the Note Edge? Well, both remain unwieldy to grip, and the Note Edge is wider. However, the edged screen nuzzles into my hand better and those software tweaks mentioned above give it the advantage. \nHowever, just like the stylus, there\u2019s a while before you get the knack of all the little provisions Samsung\u2019s made to ease users into this screen size. \nThe screen is marginally smaller than the Note 4, despite the cranked-up pixel count. Like the Note 4, text pops a little more, and pictures you take with the 16MP camera are obviously better replicated on the Note Edge\u2019s screen. \nAll told, it\u2019s an excellent camera. The image stabilizing works well on all the neon lights that pepper Tokyo, while even people were neatly captured. There\u2019s some noise, but it compares favorably against older Galaxy phones. Daylight meant effortless captures and some really nice shots, if I say so myself. \nFocus was swift, and auto white balance seemed to gauge scenes perfectly. If you have a proclivity for HDR, rest assured the Edge does an excellent job there. \nThe shades are still a little overdone, but you can choose from a few custom color palettes if you\u2019re not a fan of high-contrast menus and photos.

Register How cancer could be treated with an old alcoholism drug Published Fact checked by Jasmin Collier Previous studies have demonstrated that the alcohol abuse drug disulfiram has anticancer properties. But until now, researchers had not found the mechanism by which the drug can target cancer. New research sheds light, paving the way for the repurposing of the drug. The drug disulfiram can help to kill off cancer cells. \nA new study \u2014 published in the journal Nature \u2014 uncovers the mechanism and the molecular pathway through which the popular alcohol-aversion drug disulfiram can fight off cancer . \nThis study was conducted by an international team of researchers led by Prof. Jiri Bartek, of the Danish Cancer Society Research Center in Copenhagen. \nDisulfiram \u2014 also known by the brand name Antabuse \u2014 has been used for decades to treat chronic alcohol abuse. While the drug is not a cure for chronic alcoholism , it does discourage those with alcohol abuse issues from drinking. \nPrevious studies have shown that the drug has anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. But as Prof. Bartek and team explain in their paper, the drug has not yet been repurposed for cancer treatment because the mechanism and molecular pathways through which the drug may act against cancer were unknown. \nAs the study's authors explain, given the rising global incidence of cancer and the failure of many medications in the face of tumor resistance, identifying new possibilities for using already existing drugs is key. \nIn fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that in the next two decades, the number of new cancer cases will rise by 70 percent . Cancer is already the second leading cause of death worldwide. \nIn this context, drug repurposing is a safe, cost- and time-effective alternative. Testing new drugs can be expensive and time-consuming, but drug repurposing uses medications for which most of the relevant testing has already been done. An old, safe drug may save lives worldwide \nSo, Prof. Bartek and colleagues set out to unravel the mystery of disulfiram's anticancer properties. \nFirst, they carried out a nationwide epidemiological study of more than 3,000 Danish people, which showed that cancer patients who continued to take disulfiram were much less likely to die from cancer compared with those who stopped taking the treatment. \nPatients with breast cancer , colorectal cancer , and prostate cancer all benefited from disulfiram's effects. \nThen, the researchers carried out in vitro studies of cancer cells and in vivo studies of mice and identified the metabolite of disulfiram that enables the drug to fight off cancer: the so-called ditiocarb-copper complex. \nThe researchers also identified ways to further detect and analyze how this metabolite complex accumulates in tumors. \nFinally, and importantly, the researchers found the molecular pathway through which this ditiocarb-copper complex acts to suppress cancer cells. \n\"Our results help to explain the anticancer activity of the alcohol-abuse drug disulfiram,\" say the researchers. \n\"From a broader perspective, our study illustrates the potential of multifaceted approaches to drug repurposing,\" they add, \"providing novel mechanistic insights, identification of new cancer-relevant targets, and encouragement for further clinical trials.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jiri bartek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jasmin collier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bartek", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danish cancer society research center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "copenhagen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:03.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df8ab6bf0430391c421e791ad8c33db8beaed741", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_58PpHi7bkmfjFm.sD3RwHZEnNHqgiGpJ.0A8PGBSkscw1PhVoj2mvZP1qs.4d_t1i0TiRNAAIgQ--", "site_full": "www.sitcomsonline.com", "site": "sitcomsonline.com", "site_section": "http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/forumdisplay.php?f=366", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Chit Chat - Movies - Sitcoms Online Message Boards - Forums", "title": "Remakes are common today.

Submitted Photo \nSNOW HILL \u2013 The Worcester County Commissioners unanimously selected Diana Purnell to serve as their president this week. \nOn Tuesday the commissioners approved the selection of Purnell, the first African American woman to serve as a commissioner in Worcester County, to take the role of president of the board. Ted Elder was voted vice president. \n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an honor to hand this gavel over to you,\u201d said Commissioner Jim Bunting, who has served as president for the past three years. \nPurnell, who lives in Berlin, was elected as the District 2 commissioner in 2014. She\u2019s the former executive director of the Berlin Community Improvement Association and past president of the Worcester County Commission for Women. \n\u201cI thank you guys for your support,\u201d Purnell said Tuesday. \u201cI thank you for pushing me to take the next step.\u201d \nShe stressed that it would take all of the commissioners to run the county effectively. \n\u201cIt takes seven of us to operate this county correctly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes seven opinions, seven of us to do the job that needs to be done to have a strong county. I intend during my tenure to make sure that we are as tight as anybody can be.\u201d \nPurnell\u2019s election was followed by a unanimous vote for Elder to serve as vice president. \n\u201cI just want to thank my fellow commissioners for their confidence in me,\u201d Elder said. \u201cI look forward to living up to their expectations and doing what\u2019s best for the county and serving the people in the county.\u201d \nCommissioner Chip Bertino took a moment to thank Bunting for his work as president the past three years. Diana Purnell \n\u201cThose of us who do the people\u2019s work often do so without recognition and sometimes overlooked,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for people, for taxpayers, to think of county government as a monolithic entity that is without feeling and is faceless. I think all of us in this room and in this building know that\u2019s not the case.\u201d \nHe said Bunting had accomplished a lot as president and had worked toward what he felt was best for the county. Bertino said that with his fellow commissioners\u2019 support, Bunting had built a good relationship with the board of education and had helped improve the county\u2019s budget. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can question his intent,\u201d Bertino said. \u201cHis intent has always been to do what\u2019s in the best interest of the county taxpayers, the people who work for county government, and everyone who calls Worcester County home. Anyone who\u2019s in a leadership positon strives I believe to leave their charge in better shape than when they found it. To that end I do believe Jim accomplished that.\u201d \nBunting said was proud to hand the gavel to Purnell. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been a good three years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed it. I\u2019ve enjoyed being president but it\u2019s time for somebody else to have the positon.\u201d \nHe thanked county employees for the assistance and support they\u2019d provided him. \n\u201cI found out we have one of the best staffs,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have made the three years be what it was without your help.\u201d \u2190 Previous Next \u2192 About The Author: Charlene Sharpe \nCharlene Sharpe has been with The Dispatch since 2014.

My flat overlooks broken-down shacks that operate as shops during the day. By night the shacks are illuminated with kerosene lamps and smells of cooking fraternize with those of dust and baked earth, licking my nostrils, tantalizingly evocative of closeness and companionship. I scald with longing. \nSome neighbours tether a goat or boar outside before they ceremoniously behead them, the meat sold to supplement family incomes. Each day I see animal carcasses dropped into a cauldron of boiling water then scraped to remove the hair. After, they\u2019re displayed on their backs, legs open to reveal the testicles\u2014only the male of a species is ever killed. \nI ask Santosh why. \n\u2018Females are sacred, Madam, they are givers of life.\u2019 \nI almost laugh, but cultural sensitivity prevents me. I know how women are treated here. \nWe are joined by Vishnu Kharki, who glares at us from the doorway and Santosh scuttles away. Kharki stands, arms folded, sour-faced, trying to project the impression that I\u2019m his secretary; in reality I\u2019m here to train him. I\u2019ve seen him before, looking at me, his eyes brooding darkness. Each time I catch him he quickly looks away, his documents suddenly needing intense scrutiny. \n\u2018The Minister requires a report on the data from the last field trip. I\u2019m going out; have it on his desk in the morning.\u2019 His smile is malignant. \n\u2018The data you wouldn\u2019t let me see? The report that you wanted to write?\u2019 \nHe laughs. \u2018You misunderstood me. It is imperative it is on his desk in the morning.\u2019 \n\u2018Then you have a lot of work to do,\u2019 I say to his retreating back, the buttoned brown jacket straining over his spare tyre, his trousers slightly too short, wafting with each step. He ignores me. I grab my bag and pashmina, leaving the building with fists balled tight. \nAfter a couple of blocks I\u2019m outside the Shangri-la Hotel and beauty parlour. Since I arrived in Kathmandu my hair has grown shaggy. It sticks to my brow in curls and wisps rise in the humidity. My leg, bikini line and armpit hair have also flourished in this new environment. Suddenly I feel indistinct, an undefined, amorphous blob in the shalwar kameeze I wear for \u2018decency\u2019. A sandwich board at the entrance boasts special offers for beauty treatments and, deciding on some pampering to re-connect with my feminine side, I go in. \nI\u2019m taken to a screened-off area at the back of the salon where two other women, wives of American Embassy staff, are lying on beds having foot and leg massages. Pop music is playing as I strip down to bra and pants, acutely aware that my functional underwear is showing signs of repeated hand washing and compares unfavourably with the Americans\u2019 sexy, satin Wonderbras and skimpy briefs. The women look away, treating me with all the courtesy of a slammed car door, as I\u2019m led past and positioned on a table next to them. Then the waxing begins. \nAfter the first strip is wrenched, thousands of tiny red pinpricks appear on the surface of my skin. They sting and itch, and with each application the wax gets hotter and hotter. Afraid my legs will suffer first degree burns before they\u2019re finished, I empathize with the poor beheaded animals in buckets of boiling water. \nWhen it\u2019s finally over I\u2019m massaged and oiled, small fingers rubbing and soothing my most intimate creases. I grow hot, chest tight, and have difficulty controlling breathing. Oh, God, no. On this table, with those movements, my body is responding, speaking to me in ways I\u2019ve forced myself to forget. I check furtively, my cheeks burning; no-one seems to have noticed. Eventually I relax, surrendering to the wash of eroticism. \nAs I\u2019m ushered to a chair positioned beside a window overlooking the exquisite gardens at the rear of the hotel I feel myself floating, my body just a whisper in the draft from overhead fans. Banana trees stand side by side with persimmon, apple and pineapple. Water fountains are being cleared of leaves and the swishing sounds of twig brushes, called besoms back home, hang gauzily in the afternoon sun. Birds and fruit bats wheel in the sky, flirting with the air in their aerial acrobats, rifling fruit on branches. Beguiled by the scene I am only just aware of being asked what hairstyle I want. I reply in Nepali, then drift off, back to the beauty of the garden. \nThe following morning I arrive early, slipping the scarf from my head as I sit down. \n\u2018So sorry, Madam; has family member died?\u2019 \nSantosh has brought some lemon tea and he and the other peons are bunched in the doorway, staring at my head. \n\u2018No. Why?\u2019 \n\u2018Madam... your hair.\u2019 \nStatic between us holds like a web, swaying precariously. \nI start to laugh. Santosh\u2019s worried face only makes me worse. At the Shangri-la I used the Nepali word for \u2018shaved\u2019 instead of \u2018short\u2019 and the hairdresser used a number two razor. Giggles bubble up from my belly and out my mouth, popping in the sterile, male atmosphere where a shaved head is a sign of respect for the dead. \nAt that moment Kharki pushes through to discover the source of hilarity. The sight of his face, simultaneously a picture of horror, disbelief and disgust, sends me off into more gales of laughter. The men in the doorway look at each other with consternation and I border on hysterical. \nThis is my epiphany, the decisive moment when perspective is finally restored. I feel lighter, more alive; a lot more than my hair has been shed. With new-found awareness I appreciate the privilege of living at the top of the world, in a country of beauty and contradictions, having the experience of a lifetime. \nMagic happens in the dark, when you\u2019re not looking.

Hollywood, CA. November 21, 2017 5:45 PM \n\n\"Justice League\", Zack Synder's chaotic and uninspired gathering of DC Comics superheroes, was supposed to be the icing on the cake. After reintroducing Superman to a new generation with \"Man of Steel\", followed by a new Batman in \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" which also brought Wonder Woman (and very briefly, The Flash , Aquaman and Cyborg ) to our attention, this film was destined to be the thrilling adventure fans had been highly anticipating. However, that has not come to pass. While those previous films were hardly great, \"Justice League\" ends up being the worst of them all. Sluggish pacing and a colorless script that features a very generic villain has made finally seeing all these classic heroes together in one film a decidedly disappointing experience.\n\nOur story continues where \"Dawn of Justice\" left off with the world still reeling from the death of Superman when a new evil threat arrives to try and take over the planet. Steppenwolf (a CGI creation voiced by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), a powerful alien, seeks to collect and unify the energies of three Mother Boxes hidden in locations around the world with the aid of his army of Parademons , a kind of extraterrestrial flying monkeys, which will ultimately make him unstoppable.\n\nOne location is on the island of Themyscira, home of the Amazons. Lead by Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), these female warriors fight valiantly against Steppenwolf but he's far too formidable and he takes the first box. The Queen manages to get a message to her daughter, Diana, better known to the world as Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), warning her of the danger. She goes to Bruce Wayne, who secretly is Batman (Ben Affleck), \" the Dark Knight \" and both decide they will need to recruit a few others with some significant muscle to help stop Steppenwolf .\n\nWayne travels to Iceland to persuade the legendary \" Aquaman \", a super-human who can live on land or in the sea. Usually seen as a blond wholesome figure, this Arthur Curry, as played by Jason Momoa, is a long-haired and tatted-up type who's gruff and doesn't play well with others. Meanwhile, Diana locates Victor Stone (Ray Fisher), a former college football star who was severely injured in a car accident and saved by his scientist father (Joe Morton) by merging his damaged body with robotic parts, making him a brooding, super-powered Cyborg . With both declining the offer to join the team, Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) or otherwise known as \" The Flash\", an enthusiastic teenage nerd with the ability to move at lightning speed, is more than willing to help with the fight.\n\nThey both eventually come around after Steppenwolf gets the second Mother Box that was secured in the underwater world of Atlantis despite Aquaman 's attempt to stop him. And Cyborg knows where the final box is; he had hidden it after his father had used it to help save him following his accident. Batman decides they should use the box to revive the Man of Steel  as they desperately need his help to defeat Steppenwolf although some are concerned about his mental state once he's resurrected.\n\nZack Snyder was in the middle of post-production on \"Justice League\" when a horrific family tragedy caused the director to withdraw from completing the film. Joss Whedon, who's had plenty of experience with sci-fi and super-heroes having worked on Marvel 's \"The Avengers\" and the sequel, was brought on board to finish the project. Whedon wrote some additional scenes and assembled the cast back together for some re-shoots. However, Henry Cavill, who reprises his role as Superman in this film, was in the middle of shooting another sequel to \"Mission: Impossible\" and had grown an elaborate beard for his part and couldn't shave. CGI was used to remove the out-of-place facial hair but there are moments in a few scenes that has left Mr. Cavill's handsome jawline noticeably misshapen. It's these little things that add up to making the film feel oddly disjointed and erratic.\n\nIt's written in the DNA of comic book stories that the malevolent villain will ultimately be defeated and our heroes will once again rise to a new challenge. So what makes each story in these films interesting is the witty banter and emotionally charged moments between the characters and the rip-roaring, visually-enhanced battles these heroes engage in. While \"Justice League\" delivers plenty of bold visual stimulation, the camaraderie between the members of this team is lacking, with little more than indifference and petty sniping going on between them. There are some occasional funny bits scattered throughout (most likely thanks to Mr. Whedon) including a particularly hilarious scene involving Aquaman and Wonder Woman 's magic lasso but not nearly enough to lighten the heavy mood.\n\nAlso like the previous films, there is still a serious problem with female characters. With the exception of our favorite Amazon, the significant roles for women featured, which includes Amy Adams and Diane Lane returning as Superman's girlfriend and adoptive mother, are not given much to do but look sad and weepy.\n\nWhile \"Justice League\" may captivate and entertain with high-flying yet routine battles between good versus evil, it's just doesn't offer much more than that. The major flaw is that the film doesn't invest enough time in helping us engage with our heroes or making them characters we actually want to get to know better. The true inspiration seems to be simply manufacturing another cog in the money-making machine of super-hero features, creating a satisfactory yet far from superior product.

Ramirez described feeling heartbroken to no longer be serving the revolution started by the late Hugo Chavez, to whom he was a very close and trusted aide. \nVenezuela's former oil czar resigned as ambassador to the United Nations, on what he said were orders from President Nicolas Maduro, a sign of growing divisions in the ruling socialist party amid a deepening economic crisis. \nRafael Ramirez said on social media that he tendered his resignation a day prior, ending a week of speculation about the diplomatic envoy's political standing after a cousin and several former acolytes were arrested in a highly-publicized purge in the oil industry. \nMaduro has been trying to fortify his mandate by attacking corruption at state-run oil company PDVSA, which Ramirez led for over a decade. But in a post on social media, Ramirez said: \u0093I've been removed for my opinions.\u0094 \nIn a rambling, sometimes supplicant public letter to his former boss, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, Ramirez described feeling heartbroken to no longer be serving the revolution started by the late Hugo Chavez, to whom he was a very close and trusted aide. \nBut as international pressure on Venezuela has increased amid an unprecedented economic crisis, he said he felt the need to speak out on policies he knew a great deal about from his 12-year run atop PDVSA, the source of almost all of Venezuela's foreign currency earnings. \n\u0093I remain committed to insisting at the highest levels of the government for the need for deep reflection so we can retake the successful path laid out by Comandante Chavez for the benefit of our people and homeland,\u0094 he wrote in the four-page letter. \n\u0093I wouldn't want to imagine how the attacks and vilification will increase now for expressing my opinions and stating my position in defense of the revolution,\u0094 he added. \nRamirez is the highest-level official to break with Maduro since chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega criticized the president's attempts to gut the opposition-controlled congress and rewrite the constitution \u2014 actions that garnered international rebuke and triggered months of anti-government protests. \nLike Ortega, who was ousted earlier this year, Ramirez pledged allegiance to Chavez's revolution in his farewell missive and gave no indication that he would turn against his former comrades and assist U.S. authorities seeking to isolate Maduro. \nRamirez, who was never part of Maduro's inner circle, is believed to have been the ultimate target of the housecleaning at PDVSA, which has already resulted in the arrest of two of his successors at the oil company and his cousin, Diego Salazar, who allegedly helped siphon off US$1.6 billion to banks in the European principality of Andorra. \nRamirez in his letter defended his record as PDVSA's president, saying that under his leadership the oil company successfully defeated attempts at \u0093sabotage\u0094 and contributed to Venezuela's economic and social development. \n\u0093I have a name and a career of activity that has been permanently subject to public scrutiny,\u0094 he wrote. \u0093I'm not going to allow people to offend and attack me, affecting the unity of the revolutionary forces.\u0094 \nAmid the ongoing purge, both Maduro and Ramirez have been careful to avoid mentioning each other by name, an indication of the deep fissures that exist within the ruling Chavista movement as triple-digit inflation and widespread shortages have eroded support for the government. \nMany of the accusations against PDVSA officials in Venezuela stem from a U.S. probe into the company and its Houston subsidiary Citgo that has led to the arrest of more than 10 individuals, including two former close aides to Ramirez arrested last month in Spain. With the possibility of arrest looming in Venezuela and in the U.S., it was unclear whether Ramirez remained in New York.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maduro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chavez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comandante chavez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luisa ortega", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ortega", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafael ramirez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramirez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicolas maduro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hugo chavez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jorge arreaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diego salazar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pdv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pdvsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citgo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andorra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:05.168+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "003351034e5d757364f4a719e95ec3994fb7aff8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5eor1lwd49eQvEjPrqB6DTXOqmwAVsm6W7_OGLIxxJ2tNfbxMhLQVhxf4836uz50-", "site_full": "www.e90post.com", "site": "e90post.com", "site_section": "http://www.e90post.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=4", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Off-Topic Discussions Board - E90Post - BMW 3-Series (E90 E92) Forum", "title": "Finland, 100.", "title_full": "Finland, 100.", "published": "2017-12-06T08:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 21, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.054, "main_image": "http://www.bimmerpost.com/bpfb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26808, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "003351034e5d757364f4a719e95ec3994fb7aff8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5eor1lwd49eQvEjPrqB6DTXOqmwAVsm6W7_OGLIxxJ2tNfbxMhLQVhxf4836uz50-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lups", "published": "2017-12-06T08:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "Finland, 100.", "text": "Today is our hundredth independence day.

I\u2019ve discussed the skincare mistakes that I\u2019ve made over the years before. However, some of them I still do regularly and will probably keep doing over time. \nKeep reading to which skincare mistakes I make and why. SKINCARE MISTAKES: Use Bar Soap \nOne of the first \u201cno-no\u201d rules of skincare we learn is to never use bar soap. However, after running out of cleanser one day, I had no other choice. I used the classic gold anti-bacterial Dial soap. Sure, this soap is super drying, but I think it truly helped my skin. At the time, my skin was acne prone and mostly oily. The soap was anti-bacterial, it helped clean out the gross stuff that causes breakouts due to my large pores. Also, anti-bacterial anything is very drying, which made this soap dry up a little of the oiliness. I only used this soap once a week or whenever I had a major breakout. \nMany years have passed since I used this cleansing process and my skin has changed dramatically since. Although my pores are still large and in charge, my breakouts are far and few. Plus, my skin is aging, which also means drying. Therefore, I\u2019ve rarely used Dial to wash my face in the past few years. Thankfully, there are other bar soaps out that are designed for washing your face, including bar soaps for acne and dry skin. SKINCARE MISTAKES: Pick At Skin \nSince I spent the most of my teenage years and early 20s dealing with acne, I was a professional pimple popper. Like I mentioned, I rarely get breakouts now, but I occasionally get small whiteheads that I enjoy gently squeezing. It\u2019s bad, I know, but I try to make sure that my skin is prepped for this. I prep it by placing a clean warm towel on the area first to loosen the pore and then I use an extraction tool to gently glide out the gook. Afterwards, I wash my face with a gentle cleanser and use a gentle toner such as witch hazel to soothe the area. In an ideal world, I would have an aestheticism do this, but I would have to schedule that ahead of time. SKINCARE MISTAKES: Sleep In Makeup \nI don\u2019t do this with a purpose, but on purpose due to laziness. There have been moments when I feel asleep on the sofa before bed and went straight to bed when I woke up even though I still had my makeup on. Also, there\u2019ve been a few times that I got home really late and let the allure of my comfy bed distract me from washing my face. \nI try to keep makeup wipes and micellar water on my bedside table for moments of laziness. However, makeup wipes don\u2019t remove all the makeup and neither does the micellar water.

REUTERS/Baz Ratner/Files Such an inauguration would worsen the rifts opened by an acrimonious election season, when more than 70 people died in political violence. The extended campaigns eventually led to President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s re-election.\nAttorney General Githu Muigai did not name anyone, but opposition leader Raila Odinga said last month that he would be inaugurated by a people\u2019s assembly on Dec. 12 - Kenya\u2019s Independence Day.\nUnless a candidate was declared the victor in an election by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and the swearing-in was conducted by the Kenyan chief justice, Muigai told a news conference, such a inauguration is \u201ca process wholly unanticipated by the constitution and is null and void\u201d.\n\u201cThe criminal law of the Republic of Kenya stipulates that sort of process is high treason,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is high treason of the persons involved, and any other person facilitating that process.\u201d\nUnder Kenyan law, treason is punishable by death.\nMuigai said people\u2019s assemblies proposed by the National Super Alliance, Odinga\u2019s opposition coalition, were illegal as well.\n\u201cThese institutions are unconstitutional they are illegal, they are null and void. The persons involved in their creation are involved in extra-constitutional activity and may be visited by the full force of the law,\u201d he said.\nSo far, 12 Kenyan counties have passed motions supporting the formation of a people\u2019s assembly, most of them counties that had backed the opposition in Kenya\u2019s protracted voting.\nOdinga and Kenyatta faced off in an election in August that Kenyatta won. But the Supreme Court nullified the result, and a repeat election was held on Oct. 26. Odinga boycotted that vote, saying reforms needed to avoid \u201cillegalities and irregularities\u201d had not been made.

The bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee, known as Copom, cut the benchmark Selic rate by 50 basis points to 7.00%, capping a 725 basis-point decline since October 2016. \nIn the policy statement announcing the decision, the bank said it could make another, smaller rate cut at its next meeting in February, reinforcing expectations of a 25 basis-point reduction as the end of the rate-cutting cycle draws near. \nStill, the Copom \u201cviews this guidance as more susceptible to changes in its baseline scenario and balance of risks than in previous meetings,\u201d it said in the statement. \n\u201cGoing forward, the Committee judges that the current stage of the cycle recommends caution in conducting monetary policy.\u201d \nThe remarks highlight the uncertainty surrounding the Brazilian economy as government efforts to curb the growth of public debt hang in the balance and inflation remains stubbornly below the official target. \nThe Committee judges that its baseline inflation scenario has evolved, to a large extent, as expected. Inflation developments remain favorable, with various measures of underlying inflation running at comfortable or low levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy; \n\u0093Inflation expectations for 2017 collected by the Focus survey retreated to around 3.0%. Expectations for 2018, 2019, and 2020 remain around 4.0%, 4.25%, and 4.0%, respectively. \n\u0094The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 2.9% for 2017, 4.2% for 2018, and 4.2% for 2019. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2017 and 2018 at 7.0%, and 2019 at 8.0%. \n\u201dThe Committee emphasizes that its baseline scenario involves risks in both directions. On the one hand, the combination of (i) possible second-round effects of the favorable food price shock and of low current levels of industrial goods inflation, and (ii) the possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of low inflation levels may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, (iii) frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in the case of (iv) a reversal of the current benign global outlook for emerging economies\u201d.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "copom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "focus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:06.150+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "003351034e5d757364f4a719e95ec3994fb7aff8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5eor1lwd49eQvEjPrqB6DTXOqmwAVsm6W7_OGLIxxJ2tNfbxMhLQVhxf4836uz50-", "site_full": "www.e90post.com", "site": "e90post.com", "site_section": "http://www.e90post.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=4", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Off-Topic Discussions Board - E90Post - BMW 3-Series (E90 E92) Forum", "title": "Finland, 100.", "title_full": "Finland, 100.", "published": "2017-12-06T08:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 21, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.054, "main_image": "http://www.bimmerpost.com/bpfb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26808, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2cbf74f608960bda68aac3bd101e67faea9d691", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5eor1lwd49eQvEjPrqB6DTXOqmwAVsm6W7_OGLIxxJ2tNfbxMhLQVsytf.Lj_5O8TEVzih_nVE7rS7ms.sJCN", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "CTinline-six", "published": "2017-12-06T09:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I know it's cold and snows there.\nThey probably have reindeer there.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:06.167+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61295c3b1cf5a0e16343b6b3d04b49a09246b6f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYjqvauo19cM5SufoLaDc.gag3n.nY6Hv5fKU4jupBvuZvFuONBeKX0dQisTjsSopVw--", "site_full": "www.adverts.ie", "site": "adverts.ie", "site_section": "http://www.adverts.ie/for-sale/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Adverts.ie - Recent Ads All 826,599 listings", "title": "Lady shoe bundle", "title_full": "Lady shoe bundle", "published": "2017-12-07T11:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://a1.amlimg.com/MDdmODc5MWEyNTY2YTQ4YzI2MmJjZWU3YmVhNTE2ZWIFa6Rvwr91z-SODaYcxyc0aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmFkc2ltZy5jb20vZTJlZDY1NjM4ZjcxZjdkMDAzMjRmNDY5MzdmYTU2ODlmYTczZGM3MWNjNzgwZjIwZDVlZTAxOWMxMGQwNzJiMy5qcGd8fHx8fHwzOTN4Mjk0fGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuYWR2ZXJ0cy5pZS9zdGF0aWMvaS93YXRlcm1hcmsucG5nfHx8.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61295c3b1cf5a0e16343b6b3d04b49a09246b6f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYjqvauo19cM5SufoLaDc.gag3n.nY6Hv5fKU4jupBvuZvFuONBeKX0dQisTjsSopVw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Lady shoe bundle", "text": "Bundle one;

AFP The US State Department will issue visa restrictions against individuals \u201cinvolved in undermining democracy in Cambodia\u201d, the Trump administration announced yesterday, following the dissolution of the main opposition party last month and the arrest in September of former opposition leader Kem Sokha.\nAccording to a press statement by department spokesperson Heather Nauert, the step is in \u201cdirect response to the Cambodian government\u2019s series of anti-democratic actions\u201d, citing the Cambodia \nNational Rescue Party dissolution, the banning of its officials from politics, Sokha's imprisonment, restrictions on civil society and \"suppression of independent media\". \nSokha was arrested more than three months ago in apparent violation of his parliamentary immunity and charged with \u201ctreason\u201d. A 2013 speech in which he talks about US support in developing his political career has been used by the government to justify the arrest, and in the ensuing months the US has been continually accused by officials of fomenting \"colour revolution\".\nImmediately after the dissolution, the White House announced it would cut funding for the National Election Committee, with more steps to follow. It was unclear yesterday exactly which officials would be targeted by the visa sanctions, but the statement does say they would also apply to family members of affected individuals. \nLifting such sanctions, Nauert wrote, would be linked to reversing recent acts of political suppression. \u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation and take additional steps as necessary, while maintaining our close and enduring ties with the people of Cambodia,\u201d the statement reads.\nMu Sochua, deputy president of now-dissolved CNRP, called the move a \"very significant step\". \n\"The USA has heard the call from the 3 million voters who voted for positive change. High ranking officials and their family members travel regularly to western countries. They will feel the pressure, in particular those with assets and children going to universities in the USA,\" she wrote today in an email. \nMonovithya Kem, Sokha's daughter and a CNRP public affairs official, also welcomed the visa ban. \u201cIf [the Cambodian government] doesn\u2019t reverse course on time, further sanctions are needed,\u201d she wrote on Twitter, calling on Japan and Australia to follow suit. \nSok Eysan, Cambodian People\u2019s Party spokesman, said the move was a \u201cvery strange thing\u201d that showed the US was taking sides with the opposition and did not care about rule of law and democracy in Cambodia. \n\u201cThis is their excuse to take sides with its puppet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are joint businesses to topple the CPP and the legitimate government,\u201d he said.\nAdditional reporting by Mech Dara \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leonie kijewski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kem sokh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kem sokha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nauert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monovithya kem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mu sochua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sok eysan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heather nauert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sokha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mech dara", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cambodian people\u2019s party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cpp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambodia  national rescue party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national election committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambodia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phnom penh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:08.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be71db1503a27724586991c2d573789fca137e25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3L3akr7jCV1ZSNM6WtISi1LFv3oPe4InLJ29pEVhTCEXUTN3fctVgjm8_Eqd90TiZ5e2dnaOKrqsXK7jFQ83ivWzR1D2lT1f_sa4PTWiW7acRSwFQunyoFEMM8SwEZFfkbwya60GoFQAA--", "site_full": "en.mercopress.com", "site": "mercopress.com", "site_section": "http://en.mercopress.com/rss/politics", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "MercoPress", "title": "Russia offering Argentina MIG-29 aircraft, reveals Moscow top official", "title_full": "Russia offering Argentina MIG-29 aircraft, reveals Moscow top official", "published": "2017-12-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://en.mercopress.com/data/cache/noticias/61772/600x315/mig-29.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be71db1503a27724586991c2d573789fca137e25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3L3akr7jCV1ZSNM6WtISi1LFv3oPe4InLJ29pEVhTCEXUTN3fctVgjm8_Eqd90TiZ5e2dnaOKrqsXK7jFQ83ivWzR1D2lT1f_sa4PTWiW7acRSwFQunyoFEMM8SwEZFfkbwya60GoFQAA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Russia offering Argentina MIG-29 aircraft, reveals Moscow top official", "text": "Full article 7 comments Punchuk told TASS Argentina is interested in buying Russian MiG-29 fighters, which are perfectly suitable for solving Argentine Air Force tasks \nRussia has sent Argentina all the necessary materials for taking part in a tender for fighter jets with its Mikoyan MiG-29 aircraft, Deputy Director of the Federal Service for Military and Technical Cooperation Anatoly Punchuk told TASS news agency. \nPunchuk is heading the Russian delegation at the Expodefensa 2017 arms exhibition in Bogota, Colombia, which is taking place this week. \n\u0093Speaking about Argentina\u2019s possible acquisition of Russian MiG-29s, I want to note that the hardware is being selected in compliance with the required parameters and on a tender basis while a final decision on the aircraft purchase is within the competence of the leadership of the Argentine Republic. As of today, the Russian side has said it is ready to take part in the tender and submitted all the required materials. We hope to win in the tender,\u0094 Punchuk said. \nAs Punchuk told TASS earlier, Argentina is interested in buying Russian MiG-29 fighters. These aircraft are perfectly suitable for solving the tasks placed upon the Argentine Air Force and for their operation in local geographical conditions, he added. \nThe MiG-29 multirole frontline fighter is designed to destroy air targets day and night in any weather conditions. The aircraft can effectively carry out air patrols and provide air support for ground forces and troop landings, isolate a combat area, conduct air reconnaissance, intercept air targets, accompany attack and military transport planes and deliver strikes against ground and naval targets.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

It used to be time when shopping for men used to be easy; a tie or tools. However, men\u2019s lifestyles have pleasantly evolved over the years. Now, men have traded in the boring tie and tools for leather goods and skincare and hair care products. Needless to say, I\u2019m here for all of it. If you have a guy on your shopping list that takes value in curating a stylish lifestyle, then this holiday gift guide 2017 might help you find that right item for handsome. \nHOLIDAY GIFT GUIDE 2017: For Handsome Bespoke Post Churchill Box \u2013 One of the new waves for gift giving are subscription boxes. They are easy and there one out there for everyone. Bespoke Post has a selection of individually curated boxes for the various lifestyles of men. The Churchill box is ideal for the person in your life that enjoys a good cigar. It comes with 4 limited edition cigars, a reclaimed wood ashtray/ candle holder, a masculine candle, and cigar cutter. All the essentials for him to relax after a long day. Harry\u2019s Winston Set \u2013 My brother put me on to Harry\u2019s last year and I spread the awesomeness that is Harry\u2019s to everyone I know. The Winston gift set is very chic, because it comes with a metal razor, blades, shaving cream or gel, and travel case for the blades. Harry\u2019s is also a subscription box, but you can also buy it at Target. Tissot Tradition Watch \u2013 You can never go wrong with gifting a classic and well-made watch. The Tissot Tradition watch is the perfect mix of everyday style, but with a touch of sexiness. Jack Black Beard Grooming Kit \u2013 Men love their beards and I bet they would also love to receive a beard grooming kit, like this one from Jack Black. This kit contains all the essentials to perfectly groom and maintain that bountiful or budding beard. Trifold Wrap Leather Wallet \u2013 Another easy gift to give is wallet, but add some thought by buying a nice leather wallet like this one from Saddleback Leather Co. It\u2019s available in a few shades and it\u2019s a timeless piece. Tom Dixon Alloy Candle \u2013 Who says that men don\u2019t love candles? I know a handful of men who do, but prefer more \u201ctougher\u201d smelling one. Tom Dixon Ally Candle looks tough with it\u2019s steel, mechanical shape, but the scent is clean and sharp. I love this candle, myself. UGG Ascot Slippers \u2013 I want a pair of UGG slippers for Christmas, because they super soft and comfy. I\u2019m sure any man would love to get these leather beauts under their tree. The Tie Bar Large Style Box \u2013 Ties might be the oldest gift to give a man, but they are still much appreciated. The Tie Bar created a few style boxes that features ties, socks, and handkerchiefs that you can mix around and style with each other. I love this blue option, but they offer other color and style options. HIMS Complete Hair Kit \u2013 For every man that\u2019s out their embracing their bald heads, there\u2019s another man out there wanting to grow is hair out of back. HIMS offers a selection of different products for men to take to promote hair growth, including the HIMS Complete Hair Kit.
