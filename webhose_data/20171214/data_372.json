My mother was in labour for three days and three nights because the baby was breached and there was no available medical facilities and personnel on time that could have saved both mother and child.\u201d \nAkenroye, who heads BalmGilead Hospital in Lagos, regrets that \u201c50 years after, maternal mortality rates still remain high. \u201cWomen should not die because they are pregnant and people should get enough information necessary to stop the unnecessary deaths. That is why we are raising a foundation in remembrance of my mother. It is wrong that many women still die out of ignorance to access the available medical facilities and to utilize them, he said.\u201d \nParticipants trooped out in their hundreds to the Comprehensive High School, Ilutitun venue of the health outreach as early as 7am to take advantage of the services. About one thousand people came for the free treatment that included check-ups for blood pressure, blood sugar level, BMI, and treatment of various diseases. There were free surgical operations while free medicated eye glasses were handed out as well. There were also counseling services. \nOn the various ailments treated, Akenroye said the \u201cmedical team encountered different cases. \u201cThere are cases needing surgical intervention. We had cases of hernia, infertility, fibroids, dental cases among others. Many malaria and bacteria infection cases were also treated. Some have chronic diseases, like arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, insomnia and geriatric diseases and were assisted. A lot of people with high blood pressure, and other chronic diseases were screened, counseled and treated for the first time. This program has helped them to know their health status,\u201d he stated. \nHe also lamented the ignorance the people live with regarding their health. \u201cThere is a major problem while the people are not aware of what the hospitals have in stock. We had to educate them about medical facilities we have brought. Many in the community had problem with going to hospitals to get information about their health and available health provisions.\u201d \nDr Akenroye recalled how his mother died young because of delay in accessing medical facilities. \u201cShe was in labour for three days and three nights because they could not even transport her to where to get medical assistance. Even when she was eventually transported to the general hospital, the only doctor had travelled. She had to wait for another 24 hours to get the emergency treatment she needed. However, despite a surgical intervention, she lost her life due to post-operative complications.\u201d \n\u201cUnfortunately, even 50 years after, according to the statistics available there are about 5,000 mothers that still died after child birth last year and those were the ones reported.\u201d \nAlso helping out at the health outreach was a retired Chief Medical Consultant at the Ondo State Specialist Hospital Akure, Dr. Manuwa Idowu Akenroye and Dr Ilesami Ogunsuyi, the director of Medical services at the Federal Prisons in Ondo State. \nThe Consultant and uncle to the initiator of the project added that, \u201cDr. Akenroye\u2019s mother died during child birth when he was a little boy. Fortunately I was with him I know the story and when he turned around and told me he wants to do this I said that is a good thought and I wish him well. \n\u201cThe program is about preventing mothers and children from dying. To me if we can dedicate a day every year to remember this woman with this kind of event, it is worth it.\u201d \nMrs. Monisola Akenroye, an accountant and wife of the initiator of the project who was deeply involved in the planning, expressed satisfaction and fulfillment at the success of the outreach. \u201c\u201dI feel fulfilled I know that what we are doing now is exactly what God really wants us to do. This is not the first outreach but this is the first major one because we have had series of outreaches in America where we raised funds for children living with cancer. We have also raised funds for St. Joseph\u2019s home, a motherless babies home, and for abandoned mothers\u2019 homes. We have been doing it in our small ways but this is the first major outing and we are thrilled about the outcome\u2019. She promised that it would henceforth be a regular event. \nOn the NGO\u2019s future plan, she revealed that, \u201cWhat we intend to do is to put up a mother and child health centre. Not really a full-fledged hospital but somewhere they can get them information awareness on what is going on.

I\u2019ve always felt that the true Dartmouth person has or should have a deep attraction to the far North. I have had the great fortune of hiking the glaciers of Iceland and when I did so, I felt that I was proudly carrying the Dartmouth flag within. \nIt\u2019s great to see that the young New Zealand tennis star has chosen Dartmouth, all for the right reasons. No doubt that Hanlon and crew should take note that strongly influencing her decision was Dartmouth\u2019s emphasis on undergraduate education. \nThe recent letter by your esteemed classmate Timothy Prager ( Dartblog 12/1/17 ) rightly underlines the need for Dartmouth to be evolving with the times especially in terms of demographics. He lauded the mid-70\u2019s administration for propelling co-education at Dartmouth, as do I \u2014 thank you President Kemeny. (Ahh-just seeing his name makes me happy!) Had Dartmouth not gone co-ed, Timothy notes that he and many others would have gone elsewhere. \nHere it is critical to remember that the 1972 co-education decision did follow an undergraduate referendum which heavily endorsed bringing in women. (This was most strongly supported by the lower classmen, like me, whose girlfriends were far, far away and less so by upper classmen). \nSo I ask: why doesn\u2019t this administration hold an undergraduate referendum regarding the proposed enlargement? \nThis would require the administration to articulate the plan for all to see; transparency is in everyone\u2019s interest. \nUndergrads\u2019 ears are closest to the ground, and I would likely listen and likely follow their wishes, as they are the ones that would have to live longest with the consequences of the decision, whichever way it goes. \nFor that matter, why not an alumni referendum as well? Best wishes and enjoy the Aurora Borealis , Larry Johnson \u201875 \nA fine idea, to my mind. \nDid you know that there had been a referendum on co-education? I didn\u2019t. \nAddendum : A member of the faculty writes in: The proposal for a student referendum on the issue of the College\u2019s expansion is a terrific idea. Here\u2019s a twist:\nRather than the students waiting (in vain) for the Administration to ask them to vote on this issue, why doesn\u2019t the Student Assembly organize a student referendum on the issue to take place on, say, January 31? \nThe SA could request that the Administration delay any formal decision on the matter until the students have had a chance to deliberate and vote. Of course, the vote would simply be advisory, but it would put the Administration in a tough position. Announcing a decision prior to the student vote would explicitly reject their input and views, which would be awkward. But if the referendum were strongly against, moving forward would also be painful for the Administration. \nAt a minimum, it would force the Administration to do a better job articulating the case for expansion. Smart suggestion by Mr. Johnson. \nAddendum : An alumnus writes in: Upon reflection, I couldn\u2019t help but feel his proposal was a bad idea. The issue is too momentous to be put in the hands of the undergraduate body exclusively. I\u2019m reminded of James O. Freedman\u2019s lament that too many applicants to the College were choosing Harvard or Princeton instead, implicitly granting power over policy to a cadre of 18-year-olds with zero experience of higher education.\nI wasn\u2019t aware of the \u2018co-education referendum\u2019 (if indeed it took place), but I did know of polls of the undergraduate body that showed strong support for the cause. At the time, I was only six years removed from Hanover. My reaction was simply: Of course. Any young, testosterone-driven male forced to spend four years in quarantine from female companionship, and further, in a very remote location, would naturally favor relief from that condition. The outcome was the same as you\u2019d expect from a proposal to replace mystery meat with filet mignon at Thayer hall (perhaps a bad analogy in the current environment). \nThe College, collectively, has four main constituencies (I leave out, perhaps unfairly, the parents shouldering very large tuition burdens): the Trustees and the administration they oversee; the faculty; the alumni; and the student body present in Hanover. All are affected by the issues and their outcomes that must be grappled with; therefore, all should be invested in those outcomes. Dr. Johnson\u2019s contention that \u201cundergrads\u2019 ears are closest to the ground\u201d is a rather thin reed on which to carry a question of this magnitude. As I said, they are the least experienced, and also the least exposed to a long view of the College and its well-being, which only comes with the passage of time. I\u2019m not saying they should be excluded from weighing in, but they are only one of the stakeholders, with decidedly the least gravitas in the collective. \nThe most important task in organizing to oppose this execrable idea is to leverage the power of all three constituencies which are against it. The campaign to have alumni express their opposition in writing and the accompanying drying up of donations are both admirable and effective means to this end. By all means, give the undergrads a say as well, but only as one voice in the chorus. \nIt all comes back to the question: who will oversee the overseers? Pheckless phil would do well to hearken back to Gandhi\u2019s apocryphal admonition: \u201cThere go my people; I must hurry to catch up with them, for I am their leader.\u201d Featured posts", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "larry johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kemeny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanlon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "timothy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "timothy prager", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lawrence johnson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dartmouth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aurora borealis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iceland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:42.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1e021e4b3c841252c1d48a7ac9145f15f1faf1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p10yln1njePUN.H6YlDK6asYL4TpuVMvi", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/m/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/m/ - Mecha - 4chan", "title": "/srwg/ Super Robot Wars General #1363", "title_full": "/m/ - /srwg/ Super Robot Wars General #1363 - Mecha - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T05:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 63, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "92fa884add1414d7fb2389f449c92dd552485d56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p10yln1njePUN.H6YlDK6aua_fHzMOiWfNsrbOl11OTg-", "ord_in_thread": 54, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>16080120\nYou better not be shit talking my bunnies, faggot.

Georgetown has previously recognized a number of other unions on its campus, including a Service Employees International Union-affiliated one for adjuncts, citing its Just Employment Policy . But earlier this week, Provost Robert Groves told graduate students who wish to organize with the American Federation of Teachers that Georgetown believes \u201cthat a graduate student\u2019s relationship with the university is fundamentally an educational one,\u201d not an employer-employee one. \nThat opinion is in conflict with a 2016 decision from the National Labor Relations Board saying that student teaching and research assistants at private institutions are workers under the National Labor Relations Act and therefore entitled to collective bargaining (public campuses are governed by state laws on that issue). But Groves\u2019s statement echoes those by leaders of a growing number of other, private institutions who\u2019ve disagreed with the NLRB\u2019s stance. Institutions may legally challenge the NLRB\u2019s call. But the board itself has flip-flopped on graduate student-versus-employee question historically, and many union advocates fear a coming reversal by a body with more Trump administration appointees.

During all this grinding, they relied on geared teammates to carry them to victory.\nI know you guys think there were bg battles where every single player was running around in full conquest gear, but that wasn't the norm. It was usually a mix of geared, semi-geared, and ungeared toons.\nGeared players weren't happy to see ungeared teammates. They would tell new toons to go elsewhere to gear up. It made for an uncomfortable bg environment. If one team was noticeably less geared than the other team, it usually ended up as a pretty one-sided battle.\nIn Legion, some players have been freaking out over a 1% to 5% power gap in bgs as if it's the end of the world.

Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order. Copyright 2017 NPR.

Some of the issues that will pique students' interest will be obvious, while others will surprise us. No matter the issue or side of the political or philosophical spectrum, it is the commonly understood role of administrators to work with students to support activism in a way that students get their message heard and also optimizes safety and civility. \nAs the year unfolds, I ask fellow administrators to take this role a step further. It is crucial for us to question the roles students are playing in activist movements and broaden the definitions of activism that don\u2019t propagate a sort of \u201cactivism Olympics\u201d that has plagued many of our student leaders. This means we must support students who are doing the vital work, whether they demonstrate what I call \u201cbuilder\u201d or \u201cburner\u201d activism. \n\u201cBurner\u201d activism (figurative in nature, of course) is activism that disrupts existing power structures and norms. It has been a tried and true way for students to draw attention and ignite action from the administration. Taking over the offices of campus leaders, shutting down streets, holding sit-ins -- burner activism seeks to \u201cburn down\u201d oppressive structures and policies. \n\u201cBuilder\u201d activism, in contrast, often done in the aftermath of burner activism, seeks to build new structures that work differently (often more inclusively) for one particular group of students or all students on the campus. Founding a new student group around an emergent campus identity or working with an administrative office to expand their mission to be more equitable are examples of such work. \nFrom over a decade of observation of campus movements, I now believe that both burning and building strategies are essential for forward progress. One seems incomplete without the other, even if they exist at different times, with different groups of students, on entirely different parts of the campus. \nIt is important to note that by building and burning, I do not meet formal versus informal forms of activism. Too often, some administrators privilege particular forms of activism (those students who go through formal channels and play nice) over others (students who use more informal channels or tactics of supposed disruption). These preferences are often tied to identity, as more often than not, students with more privilege have access to formal campus leadership positions -- particularly elected positions like those in student government. In my definitions of activism, a student of privileged identities who filibusters a student government meeting is using a burning strategy, while a queer student of color who starts an affinity space for community healing and support is using a building strategy. \nAgain, I assert each form has value and should be celebrated and supported. Some student activists engage seamlessly with both building and burning strategies. Many of the student groups stemming from the Black Lives Matter movement used burner strategies to march on administrative offices to draw attention to racial unrest, while also following their actions with thoughtful lists of demands. Indeed, many of them laid the foundation for building work. \nWhat I ask of my fellow administrators is to examine their own privileging of particular campus activism and consider if they are consciously or unconsciously narrowing the definition of effective activism on their campuses. I have anecdotally seen students and administrators who specialize in one strategy judge or diminish those who engage in the other strategy or different forms of activism. \nAdministrators may fall into this due to their position on the campus. Upper-level administrators often champion and reward builders who organize coalitions and more quiet ways of pushing change forward, often shunning burners who laid the foundation for such work to take place. In contrast, entry- and midlevel administrators, particularly those from marginalized groups, may fear engaging in burning strategies will have negative consequences for their jobs. Therefore, when oppressive structures stand in the way of creating equitable campus environments, it may be useful to solely encourage burning strategies for students to get the job done. That way, such administrators can be ready to pursue building strategies when the figurative ashes are clear. Admittedly, I have been guilty of this myself in the past. \nIn any case, it is wrong to narrowly reward and uplift activism that makes administration most comfortable or serves solely their needs. Such a narrowing of activism for our students stifles their creativity and inhibits their ability to imagine a campus and indeed a world that is more inclusive and equitable. Students are drawing upon historical movements and infusing their own energy and passions toward creating a more just society. It is our job to encourage this quest for justice, even if it challenges our power and our comfort.

These are from Murray Harris\u2019s New International Greek Testament Commentary (p 332), where he writes: \nWhenever worshiping Christians repeat the church\u2019s confession \u201cJesus is Lord,\u201d they are:\n1. Implying that the Christ of faith was none other than the Jesus of history (Acts 2:34\u201336),\n2. acknowledging the deity of Christ (John 20:28; Phil. 2:6, 9\u201311),\n3. admitting the Lord\u2019s personal rights to absolute supremacy in the universe, the church, and individual lives (Acts 10:36; Rom. 10:12; 14:8; 1 Cor. 8:6; Jas. 4:15),\n4. affirming the triumph of Christ over death and hostile cosmic powers when God raised him from the dead (Rom. 10:9; 14:9; Eph. 1:20\u201322; Col. 2:10, 15) and therefore also the Christian\u2019s hope of resurrection (1 Cor. 6:14; 2 Cor. 4:14),\n5. epitomizing the Christian message (Rom. 10:8\u20139; 2 Cor. 4:5) and defining the basis of Christian teaching ( Col. 2:6\u20137),\n6. declaring everyone\u2019s accountability to the Lord, the righteous judge (1 Cor. 4:5; 2 Tim. 4:1, 8),\n7. making a personal and public declaration of faith (Rom. 10:9), which testifies to their being led by the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3), and\n8. repudiating their former allegiance to many pagan \u201clords\u201d and reaffirming their loyalty to one Lord through and in whom they exist (1 Cor. 8:5\u20136; 1 Tim. 6:15).\nIt is good to be reminded that \u201cLord\u201d is more than a title, and more than a name. It reveals the identity of Jesus, and compels a response from us that is more than simply a phrase we say\u2013ie. there is more at stake here than saying \u201cJesus is Lord.\u201d That phrase implies so much, that when rightly understood it alters our worldview.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murray harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phil", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "corinthians", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holy spirit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:44.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c446b906f1255273a17276a39e08ba88d17e5295", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYjqvauo19cM5SufoLaDc.gZxFXbFon5hzPETupEvx.FihxEIPCfOYOCWc..t28.95Q--", "site_full": "www.adverts.ie", "site": "adverts.ie", "site_section": "http://www.adverts.ie/for-sale/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Adverts.ie - Recent Ads All 827,150 listings", "title": "Christian Dior Heels", "title_full": "Christian Dior Heels", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://a1.amlimg.com/MzM2Mzk2YTIyOWRkZmJiODI2ZjBjNjRkNmQ1ZWI3ODi65mLz92k366OH601RvuX3aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmFkc2ltZy5jb20vMGFhOGE5MmE1MWU4NjY0MWE0NDE3NjQ2ZDI2NzMzNmQwMmNjNDllNTkzZDY0ZGVjODk1ZTg2MjFlNDM2NDdiMS5qcGd8fHx8fHwzOTN4Mjk0fGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuYWR2ZXJ0cy5pZS9zdGF0aWMvaS93YXRlcm1hcmsucG5nfHx8.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c446b906f1255273a17276a39e08ba88d17e5295", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYjqvauo19cM5SufoLaDc.gZxFXbFon5hzPETupEvx.FihxEIPCfOYOCWc..t28.95Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Christian Dior Heels", "text": "Description \nSize: 7 \nIm gonna regret selling these!!

This awesome and quick video will show you ten shortcuts for working with layer masks in Photoshop. \nAt its core, the idea of the layer mask is extremely simple: it allows you to show or hide certain parts of an image or adjustment. Of course, in practice, creating and manipulating layer masks is an intricate and nuanced art all itself and a skill every photographer working in Photoshop should have down pat. And since they\u2019re something you\u2019ll use on the overwhelming majority of images you work with, any shortcuts can help increase both their capabilities and your workflow\u2019s efficiency, which is exactly what this helpful video from the folks at Adobe will show you how to do. Of all the shortcuts, the ability to quickly duplicate a layer mask is probably my favorite. A lot of the time, particularly when I\u2019m retouching a portrait or landscape image, I\u2019ll want to apply three of four adjustments to the exact same area, and rather than trying to paint in each effect, it\u2019s much quicker to just duplicate the layer mask after doing it once. Check out the video above for all the tricks!

take title with first round KO Kay Prosper won his 11th pro fight on Saturday JP Smith Published: 09:28 Thursday 07 December 2017 \nLuton boxer Kay Prosper had no problems in defeating Kristian Patko at York Hall on Saturday night to win the first title of his pro career. \nIn fact, the former Hockwell Ring ABC fighter needed less than two minutes to KO his much fancied opponent, who entered the ring previously unbeaten. \nThe Czech fighter came with a reputation of being a knockout artist, having finished each of his four wins in the first round. \nIronically in the pre-fight rhetoric, it was Patko who had promised to defeat Prosper in the first round and to end his career. \nIn contrast, Prosper announced himself on the big stage as he had his opponent on the canvas in the first 90 seconds. \nPatko did not land a shot in anger as he shipped several left jabs from Prosper, which were used to disguise a crushing right hand that floored the Czech. \nAs his opponent picked himself up, Prosper prowled forward and let go with a combination of left and right body shots, the latter of which sent Patko to his knees. \nWith referee Lee Every adminstering the count, Patko made no attempt to stand and with just 1 minute 37 seconds of the first round gone, the fight was called to a halt. \nThe victory meant that Prosper collected the International Super-Lightweight Challenge belt on the Smith Sports promoted \u2018Summit\u2019 show, as his win also paves the way for a shot at major honours in 2018. \nOn chalking up his 11th pro victory, Prosper said: \u201cI just put it on him, I knew what I could do and I just let my shots go. \n\u201cIt\u2019s great to get the belt, but next year I want to be fighting for English or British titles. \n\u201cMy time has come,

Thursday, prompting cheers and singing from a packed parliament public gallery in a country where some states ruled homosexual acts to be illegal until just 20 years ago. \nLawmakers, who had cast aside a conservative push to allow religious objectors to refuse service to same-sex couples, waved rainbow flags and embraced on the floor of the chamber, after the overwhelming vote in favour of the bill. \nFewer than five of 150 MPs voted against it. \n\u201cWhat a day. What a day for love, for equality, for respect,\u201d said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \u201cIt is time for more marriages.\u201d \nWATCH: Australians celebrate the legalization of same-sex marriage \nThe law, which will also recognize same-sex marriages solemnized in foreign countries, takes effect from Saturday. Because a month\u2019s notice is required for the state to recognize a marriage, the first legal same-sex unions will be in January. \nFive-time Olympic gold-medal winner, the swimmer Ian Thorpe, who came out in 2014, said the law reflected contemporary Australia and would support people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual queer or intersex (LGBTQI). \n\u201cIt will give each of us the sense of what modern Australia is, and is, in fact, the way that most of us see this country as being, and will allow LGBTQI people in our nation to know that fairness is one of our values,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. Story continues below \nAustralia ns had overwhelmingly endorsed legalizing same-sex marriage in a postal survey. \n\u201cWhat a moment for the country,\u201d said Christine Forster, a Sydney councillor and the sister of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, standing among throngs of rainbow-clad campaigners for a \u201cYes\u201d vote, outside parliament with her female partner. \nShe said she planned to go to her brother\u2019s house to celebrate. \nAbbott, who is still a member of parliament, was one of the most prominent \u201cno\u201d campaigners. He left the chamber before the vote. \nThe bill cleared the upper house last month. \nDuring the debate in the lower house on Monday, a politician proposed to his same-sex partner. \nWATCH: Australian MP proposes to partner in parliament during same-sex marriage debate \nBoth Turnbull\u2019s Liberal-National coalition government and the main opposition Labor Party had said they wanted to pass it by Dec. 7. Strong opposition \nBut despite the support of the main parties, religious organizations and conservative lawmakers had voiced strong opposition and proposed dozens of amendments. \nDuring the debate, they pressed for broad protections for religious objectors, among them florists and bankers, to refuse service to same-sex couples. \nBut their efforts were rejected. \n\u201cThese amendments, rather, are a shield for people and organizations that hold to a traditional view of marriage. They are not a sword to be wielded in the service of bigotry,\u201d government MP Andrew Hastie said in parliament. \nAmendments to permit lay celebrants to decline to solemnize same-sex marriages and businesses opposed to the unions to refuse service at wedding receptions were all defeated, one after the other, during three days of debate. \n\u201cLove has won, and it\u2019s time to pop the bubbly,\u201d Greens MP and same-sex marriage supporter Adam Bandt said. \u00a9 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

R-L: Joseph Ogbebor, General Secretary, Nigeria Union of Pretroleum and Natural Gas Workers, NUPENG; Igwe Achese, President, NUPENG; Asuquo Okon Deputy President, NUPENG and Bala Mohammed National Auditor of NUPENG, briefing after the Union\u2019s NEC meeting in Port Harcourt, Photo: Nwankpa Chijioke \nNUPENG in a communique issued by its President and General Secretary, Igwe Achese and Joseph Ogbebor respectively, called for a special intervention machinery to address the causes of the closures and redundancies with a view to saving jobs in the industry. \nAccording to the communique, \u201cThe increasing loss of jobs and high level of union membership depletion in the industry was one of the major issues discussed and deliberated upon at the meeting, with the NEC-in-session attributing the worrisome situation to unprecedented spate of redundancies and closures of oil firms in the country. The house finds the situation baffling and confounding bearing in mind the increases in the prices of crude oil and relative peace in the oil producing communities which ought to translate to increasing oil production activities in the industry. \n\u201cIt was noted, that the causes of these company closures and redundancies with its attendant job losses are much more than poor global oil market. We therefore call on the federal government to quickly set up intervention machinery to address the ugly and undesirable trend with a view of saving jobs and reduce poverty in the land.\u201d \nSimilarly, the communique noted that members of NEC also \u201cdeliberated extensively on the increasing and continuing usage of skilled and competent Nigerians as modern day slaves in their country under the unscrupulous guise of contract staffing. The meeting noted with serious concern, that the adoption of contract staffing as a method of employment engagement with its attendant abuses without any apparent institutional guidelines and control has generally entrenched workers\u2019 rights abuses and inhumane treatment of Nigerian workers by both Multinational oil corporations and indigenous oil companies. \n\u201cThe NEC-in- Session calls on the National Assembly, the Executive arm of Government and other relevant bodies to urgently intervene and rescue oil and gas workers from the exploitative and abuses of the employers in the industry.\u201d \nThe protracted unresolved labour issues in the sector, the communique said, were also looked into, saying \u201cThe NEC-in-session examined long list of unresolved labour issues involving Seawolf Drilling Company, Chevron and their labour Contractors, Tecon Oil Services, Universal Energy Limited, Agip, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Specialty Drilling and Fugro Nigeria, Nigeria Agip Oil Company, Forte oil, Oando, MRS, Conoil, NIPCO and other private depots. \n\u201cThese issues range from non-payment of terminal benefits, short payment of terminal benefits, implementation/ refusal to renew CBA, arbitrary declaration of redundancies, refusal to unionization, victimization of workers due to union activities etc. The Council -in-session called on the Federal Government and all relevant agencies to urgently intervene in order to avoid the brewing industrial relations crisis in the oil and gas industry.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "victor ahiuma-young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph ogbebor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bala mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igwe achese", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asuquo okon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nigeria union of pretroleum and natural gas workers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exxon mobil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national executive council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "specialty drilling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nipco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nwankpa chijioke  nupeng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tecon oil services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fugro nigeria, nigeria agip oil company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seawolf drilling company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria union of petroleum and natural gas workers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nupeng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rivers state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chevron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "universal energy limited", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "port harcourt", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:45.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8b23542eece60c6020d6418ad3960271a34fc01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS1sweNw0kyGessK6k.L.PMFunFCo1dEaWTIlGGGyyR6P.qqYOyxTkYf33fTkek0y4ZqUCWBVFV7HTfSc2SbUjHusfHIlRZ0OdtgYBmrRzrvk-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "For photos that are, you know, mildly interesting.", "title": "Had to get my eyes dilated today.", "title_full": "Had to get my eyes dilated today. : mildlyinteresting", "published": "2017-12-06T20:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 197, "participants_count": 196, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3cad4b97540192b1dff3175e07e9775a2d4e613", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS1sweNw0kyGessK6k.L.PMFunFCo1dEaWTIlGGGyyR6P.qqYOyxTkYf33fTkek0y4ZqUCWBVFV7HTfSc2SbUjHusfHIlRZ0OdwBtsf2qk_WO3yw.TH2Q6V1tOqVnlJsog", "ord_in_thread": 185, "author": "Mr0fficer", "published": "2017-12-07T10:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "How?

It leads to causualisation of workers. This is why we must continue to fight against privatisation of our public institutions. This undeniably calls for the overhauls of our strategies to strengthen us for an integrative perspective in the industrial revolution. We note the need for genuine focus in the direction of the promotion and the effective utilization of our capacity in the entire idea of ensuring a sustainable development of our union model. \nThe right to strike is fundamental human right enshrined in international labour organisation. \nTherefore, we need to strategize on how to influence and deal with government and investors in the power sector. We need to organize a strong collective bargaining and social dialogue with our employers in the power sector. We need to re-organise to expand our membership for sustainable growth. We need to improve in our finance and transparency. \nWe need to fight for our economic security and social justice. \nIn a solidarity message, Mr Didi Adodo, General Secretary, United Labour Congress of Nigeria, ULC, said it was regrettable that even workers still in service were not paid their salaries. \nAdodo advised workers in the states that had not been paid salaries to review their schedule and ensure that if after 30 or 31st of each month their salaries are not paid, they should stop going to work. \nHe urged workers to vote for genuine leaders in the 2019 election and ensure that those who have refused to pay workers are voted out.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "victor ahiuma-young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin uzoegwu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "didi adodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adodo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "power holding company of nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "power", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united labour congress of nigeria, ulc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nuee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national union of electricity employees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national executive council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:46.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8b23542eece60c6020d6418ad3960271a34fc01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS1sweNw0kyGessK6k.L.PMFunFCo1dEaWTIlGGGyyR6P.qqYOyxTkYf33fTkek0y4ZqUCWBVFV7HTfSc2SbUjHusfHIlRZ0OdtgYBmrRzrvk-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "For photos that are, you know, mildly interesting.", "title": "Had to get my eyes dilated today.", "title_full": "Had to get my eyes dilated today. : mildlyinteresting", "published": "2017-12-06T20:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 197, "participants_count": 196, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d7aca5a0c5faaad63e602fae126bb6c91b4cfaeb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS1sweNw0kyGessK6k.L.PMFunFCo1dEaWTIlGGGyyR6P.qqYOyxTkYf33fTkek0y4ZqUCWBVFV7HTfSc2SbUjHusfHIlRZ0OdwBtsf2qk_WO3yw.TH2Q6Vysp8DU_ZOFo", "ord_in_thread": 189, "author": "ted-Zed", "published": "2017-12-07T11:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "i was told the iris was just like a hole in your eyeball, like just a black pitt, and that you could poke a needle into it with no damage - it is just a hole\nso my question is, as this one's massive, could you put something larger like a finger in there?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:46.008+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15116583, "moreResultsAvailable": 15116483, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512639586008&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 564}
