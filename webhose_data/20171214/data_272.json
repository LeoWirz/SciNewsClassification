As the labor market continues to tighten and wages increase it will become increasingly difficult for employers to attract and retain skilled talent.\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said, \u201cThe job market is red hot, with broad-based job gains across industries and company sizes. The only soft spots are in industries being disrupted by technology, brick-and-mortar retailing being the best example.

But, to truly get the most out of wine, you need to do your research. In the following piece, you will be given advice to help ensure you know everything about wine, thus, improving your experience with it.\nDo not spend your money on full cases of wine if you are not sure you like it. It is best to purchase an experimental bottle, or even better, taste the wine before you purchase it. You should consider buying full cases of win if you know you will easily be able to serve it when you have company.\nWine should be stored in a dark, cool location. One of the best places to help your wine remain fresh if you do not have a wine cellar is in a closet in your basement. Store your bottles on their side away from any light sources to help it remain fresh.\n\nWhen buying wine for dinner, take into consideration the food you will be serving. As http://www.mlive.com/dining/index.ssf/2017/11/michigans_best_italian_restaur_3.html , red wines pair well with beef based dishes, while white wines work well with seafood and vegetarian dishes. If you are not sure about which wine to pair with your meal, ask at your local wine store to receive a little help.\n\nIf you drink wine for its health benefits you should stick with red wines. Red wines are full of antioxidants and are believed to promote optimal heart health when you drink it in moderation, ideally one glass a day. Other wines may have the same benefit in varying degrees, but red wine is definitely the best choice.\nWine can be used to make a tasty sauce when serving beef. Just mix a bit of high quality butter with a little red wine. Simmer, reduce and allow it to thicken. Next, take your beef dish and spoon some of the sauce over it.\nRead everything you can get your hands-on with respect to wine. Not only are there books available, but the Internet is a great resource as well. Check out blogs and reviews. New ones are coming out all the time, and they can be very valuable in helping you select wine that you might enjoy.\nIf recommended site can\u2019t stand the taste of a certain wine, don\u2019t drink it! Certain restaurants and bars, especially if they are associated with a celebrity, may promote a particular brand of wine. They often mark these options up. More expensive prices don\u2019t mean higher quality wines. Figure out what you enjoy and stick to it.\nDo not write a certain wine off just because a wine tester does not like it. Just like with many other beverages, certain wines require an acquired taste. Even if he or she does not like it, you may find it to be to your liking. See if you can get a sample of it before buying a bottle.\nRead up on wine during your free time. The more that you learn about wine, the better you will be at picking new wines to add to your collection. There is a lot to know, so spend time learning when you can if you want to become a true wine connoisseur.\nIf you wish to get a wine that\u2019s lighter, don\u2019t pay attention to color. There is as much alcohol in a red wine as a white. But, white wine is known to be somewhat easier for many to drink. Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc are lightest; these may be best as table wines.\nVisit a winery if you are a wine lover. You\u2019ll see wine in an entirely new light, and it is a great experience. An added benefit is that you get to learn a great deal about how your wine is made while you are there. This type of outing is both educational and fun.\nYou can read as much as you like about wine, but ultimately, you have to decide for yourself if you like it or not. Price often doesn\u2019t matter. You may like an inexpensive bottle of red wine much more than a costlier version. Don\u2019t apologize for your tastes. Drink what you enjoy.\nYou can easily become comfortable in the ages and flavors of wines you love, but don\u2019t forget to experiment and try some new ones. You may not have experienced a flavor that you love, so try all of them. The store clerk can be a wonderful resource for finding new and tasty wines.\nWine tasting events are not only for the grown ups, so do some research to find family friendly tastings. At family-friendly wineries, beverages and activities geared toward children are provided.\nLots of people like a drink after dinner; a robust dessert wine makes the best choice. Some possibilities are French Champagne or Italian Moscato. Your guests will enjoy relaxed conversation as they drink a glass of delicious wine, warmed by the glow of a crackling fire.\nIf you\u2019re going wine tasting, be sure to call ahead to see if you need reservations. Sometimes people reserve a hotel only to learn they should have reserved a spot at the tasting as well. The last thing that you want is to be rejected from entering in front of friends or family.\nIf possible, buy your wine from small vineyards run by the same family from generation to generation. Larger vineyards usually care about earning high profits and selling to a large public while smaller vineyards will put the authenticity and the unique flavor of their wine first. You will often get better prices too.\nMake sure that you store your wines in a place where the temperature is not much too high or much too low. When wine is exposed to warmth, it starts to deteriorate rather quickly, and keeping it for too long in the refrigerator can do the same. It is best to store it in a place that has a moderate temperature.\nIf you wish to impress others, you should now have some things that you\u2019re able to use to achieve that. Purchase great wines, use wine in cooking and become an active participant in wine culture. Now that you have read the article, you are ready to enjoy your wine.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sauvignon blanc", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:16.203+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18d7b6cf19ac17dd4143652d1985f07b6838880f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pkSOsKXlzarsALIPw6ATon30Z9PIdkNPu", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/o/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/o/ - Auto - 4chan", "title": "What oil and filter is in your car RIGHT NOW?

Nigeria is my target and I will remain focused to move the country forward,\u201d Buhari said at a dinner to welcome him on Wednesday night. Buhari said he would remain focused in order to restore the lost glory of the country. The dinner was organised in his honour by Kano State Government. The 75-year-old charismatic leader said he would continue to do his best to ensure that the country attained greater heights. He said the administration would continue to accord priority attention to education so as to empower the youth, to enable them contribute their quota toward the development of the country. \u201cIf you educate people, you empower them. So we have to make sacrifice to prepare the youth for the future,\u201d Buhari said. He expressed happiness over the wonderful reception accorded him and his entourage by the people of the state on their arrival in the state capital. \u201cI am overwhelmed by the massive turnout of people who left what they were doing to welcome me. This should be a clear message to the opposition. \u201cThe support has been consistent, so I don\u2019t have words to express my appreciation to the people of Kano state.\u201d He congratulated Governor Abdullahi Ganduje for working very hard to improve the living standard of the people of the state through execution of projects that had direct bearing on them. The President described Ganduje as a good politician who worked closely with everyone, particularly representatives of the state, at the state and National Assemblies. Ganduje had earlier said Kano state government had been able to execute a number of projects, in addition to initiating various empowerment programmes for the women and youths.

They often carry family or cultural significance and add a sense of comfort to the home.\nThese rugs can be quite difficult to maintain, however, especially during winter months. The cleanliness and crispness is often compromised by regular footpaths and children and pets running around in and out the house. The rugs are the perfect places for dirt, snow and mud to land and accumulate.\nFollow these simple preparations before winter arrives and throughout the season to ensure your rugs remain in good condition.\nUSE WELCOME MATS IN FRONT OF DOORS\nThis is a very simple, inexpensive and instant way to decrease the dirt that enters your home. Quality mats are not merely for decoration. They are the first defense for maintaining your carpets, hardwood floors and rugs from tracked-in messes. All kinds of particles, including coal tar, pesticides, deicers, fleas, pollens, bacteria and snow melt can find their way into your home on the bottoms of shoes, but a quality mat absorbs most of the moisture and soil even before someone steps through the door.\nADD A BOOT TRAY BY THE ENTRYWAYS\nA better way to keep your rugs clean is to remove shoes upon entering the house. In many places around the world, this is customary practice. Providing a boot tray outside or just inside the entryway encourages your guests to remove their shoes and reminds forgetful family members. The tray keeps footwear in a designated space, rather than spread throughout the hallway, and captures any dirt and snowmelt in one easy-to-clean area. As for your flooring and rugs, they are kept unscathed from the winter elements.\nVACUUM REGULARLY\nThe aforementioned tips are great ways to prevent most of the moisture and dirt from accumulating on your floors and oriental rugs. However, it is almost impossible to eliminate all particles from entering the home-especially for those with regular visitors, children and pets. To prevent fiber damages and maintain cleanliness, vacuum rugs regularly. It is not only a good idea for cleanliness and aesthetics, but also for your family\u2019s health.\nBefore hosting a holiday party and after the winter season is through are ideal times of the year to consider having your rug professionally cleaned.

[1] These new post-hoc analyses from the SWITCH 1 and 2 trials were presented at the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Annual Congress in Abu Dhabi today. [2],[3]\n\"Achieving target blood sugar levels can be a constant challenge for people with diabetes treated with insulin, and this is made even more complex by the risk of hypoglycaemia,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen , executive vice president and chief science officer at Novo Nordisk. \"Tresiba \u00ae has consistently been shown to provide stable blood sugar control while at the same time reducing hypoglycaemia compared with insulin glargine U100; it is very encouraging to see that treatment with Tresiba \u00ae helps people to achieve blood sugar control with fewer episodes of hypoglycaemia regardless of their blood sugar levels in this analysis.\"\nThe findings of these analyses are consistent with the results of the main SWITCH trials which demonstrated significantly lower rates of overall symptomatic hypoglycaemia versus insulin glargine U100 in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. [ 2],[ 3]\nAbout hypoglycaemia\nHypoglycaemia occurs when blood sugar levels are too low and cannot provide the body's organs with the energy they need. Hypoglycaemia can cause a range of symptoms including confusion, trembling, sweating, increased heart rate, difficulty with concentration and/or speech and in severe cases can lead to a seizure or coma. [4]-[6] Severe hypoglycaemia can cause extensive damage to the body and is significantly associated with cardiovascular death. [7] Every month, 46.5% of people with type 2 diabetes and 83.0% of people with type 1 diabetes experience a hypoglycaemic episode. [8]\nAbout the new analys e s\nThe analyses, based on the recent SWITCH trials, separated people into two groups depending on whether they had achieved target blood sugar levels (defined as HbA 1c of 7.0% or less) during the maintenance period of the trial. [1] Target blood sugar levels are those recommended by the joint guidelines of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. [9]\nAbout SWITCH 1 and 2\nSWITCH 1 and SWITCH 2 were two phase 3b , 64-week, double-blind, randomised, treat-to-target, 2-period crossover trials that investigated the hypoglycaemia profile of Tresiba \u00ae compared with insulin glargine U100 in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The trial design included a titration period in which the doses of study treatments (Tresiba \u00ae or insulin degludec U100) were gradually increased over a 16 week period, followed by a 16 week maintenance period during which a constant dose of study treatment was maintained. [2] ,[ 3] The primary endpoint was the number of severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes observed in participants during the maintenance period. [2] ,[ 3]\nAbout Tresiba \u00ae\nTresiba \u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides a duration of action beyond 42 hours with a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect. [10] ,[ 11] It has been shown to provide a lower risk of overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia, and low variability in blood glucose levels versus insulin glargine U100. [11] ,[ 12] Tresiba \u00ae received its first regulatory approval in September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally. It is now commercially available in more than 50 countries.\nAbout Novo Nordisk\nNovo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with more than 90 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes care.

years, Sean Christopher has worked in the business analysis field. With a passion for data models, strategy and business architecture, Sean has produced quite a number of solutions for the Standards Council of Canada in the capacity as business analyst in the information technology / information management division. Another passion of his is teaching. It was a matter of time before teaching and his desire for BA work came together to create his small business, Smoothcube\u2122 Business Analytics Corporation. \nWe spent time with Sean at his home in Ottawa, Ontario. \nHow did you come to be a business analyst? \n\u201cThe story goes back a little ways. I wanted to be a sports journalist out of high school. So I went to Carleton University to pursue that dream. Well, along the way I ended up getting an Honours degree in Economics from Carleton. And when I started my career at the City of Ottawa and the Standards Council, I delved in web development, HTML and content creation for the SCC web site. We moved to the US in 1998 where I honed my skills as an IT consultant at Duke University, working with Keane Incorporated. When we came back home in 2003, I got into consulting where I developed a security policy for the Council and I really like the business analysis aspect of strategy, tactics, business frameworks and the like. The rest is history.\u201d \nWhat has been your best accomplishment as a business analyst? \n\u201cWell, there are many small victories that when added up make a big one. But if there was one significant accomplishment, it has to be the development of an e-procurement solution for the Finance team. Another is the deployment of the national standards of Canada application for the Standards team. Both have been in production for over ten years.\u201d \nHow was the name \u201cSmoothcube\u201d derived? It\u2019s catchy, but what does it mean? \n\u201cFunny you ask. It\u2019s rooted partially in the data model domain and in the culture domain actually. In business intelligence and data reporting, there is a concept called the information cube, which is a term I like to use a lot. And one day my friend at work showed me this picture of a monkey who took a selfie of itself and I laughed. It came to be a well-known, well documented controversial picture, but I thought, how smooth is that for a monkey to take a camera, smile like a human being, and create something special. So the term \u201csmooth\u201d and \u201ccube\u201d were married. Brought together, it means to innovate, implement and inspire, much like that monkey did in the picture. That\u2019s the branding I want to evoke for the company.\u201d \nAre you calling yourself a monkey? \n\u201cI have called myself worse. I am humble. No, but it reminds me that life offers up a ton of opportunities and events where all we need to do is take a look at it once in a while and we can get some good stuff from it.\u201d \nWhat is Smoothcube\u2019s core business? \n\u201cEducation. But not just educating for the sake of educating. I am tired of the old school model of education, where students sit, listen, memorize and regurgitate just to pass a course. I mean, come on. Jeez. Our core business is education of business analysts, or professionals in similar types of positions. Through our motto \u201cInnovate, Implement, Inspire\u201d I want to not just teach but create better business analysts through innovative teaching methods, implementation of highly interactive, collaborative and adaptive courses and inspire business analysts to do great things with the knowledge they acquire from us. It\u2019s about them, not us. We want to hear about our students\u2019 business challenges, and we want to work with them, not just insult their intelligence by reading stuff from a Powerpoint presentation only for them to try to remember details later on. No, it is about true teaching High value courses and low-cost is our model. And we support the students even after they are done.\u201d \nHow so? \n\u201cWe stay in touch with them to make sure they still understand things. If there are areas in which they have problems still, we will work with them to resolve things long after they left the classroom. It is about Smoothcube\u2019s student knowledge life cycle support. Think of it like enhancing smooth skills.\u201d \nDid you just make up that acronym up, \u201cskills\u201d, because that is almost what \u201cstudent knowledge life cycle support\u201d stands for? \n\u201cMaybe. I think fast on my toes.\u201d \nYou should trademark it. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \nWhy should students take your courses? \n\u201cWhen you sign up for a Smoothcube course, I want students to understand that what they think they will get is not what they will get in its entirety. Let me use an example. When you review and select a course, there is a perception from the student of what the content will be, yes, but also they already have formed in their mind how the course will go, what they will learn, how they will learn and where the course content will go. That\u2019s a bit defeatist for the provider. At Smoothcube, we want to turn that philosophy around and be the educator of choice because we innovate in the way we partner with students, we implement different tactics and we inspire. We want students to remember not just the content, but the course and the 2 or 3 days they invested with us for a long time.\u201d \nSo you are kind of like the Southwest Airlines of the BA world? \n\u201cYou could say it like that. Southwest provided value with low-cost to their paying customers, the passengers who needed to get from A to B. They did not have to pay an arm and a leg to fly in an airplane. We model the same concept for our business. High value business analysis education at low cost. Our different is that we might throw in a few perks during the journey.\u201d \nFor more information about Smoothcube\u2019s courses, please visit the Business Analysis Learning page.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sean david christopher date", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smoothcube", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "scc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standards council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duke university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standards council of canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smoothcube\u2122 business analytics corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carleton university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keane incorporated", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ba", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "smoothcube", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:18.076+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66fae8ac351bd8f660420ef7effee4592dbb6e9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSWFaiEBMuBf4McZ5C5QXW5DFAMPzBW9XxWeP4_IWORjq2n5WUu391QDTDmijFYzJmBVSO_ttvoNDxb3xFiuEVuxgYJuSnAJdC", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Starbucks", "title": "This milk is indicative of my day", "title_full": "This milk is indicative of my day : starbucks", "published": "2017-12-07T06:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.701, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "840c83a83dc93f23e0536b1284dbc609362d494e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSWFaiEBMuBf4McZ5C5QXW5DFAMPzBW9XxWeP4_IWORjq2n5WUu391QDTDmijFYzJmBVSO_ttvoNDxb3xFiuEVu5rol5U0WzbIUkaTtnckK49_65ffc.0qWg--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "thatdudeonthemic", "published": "2017-12-07T08:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "When someone asks me to make an iced cappuccino for them, this is the look my face is making on the inside that they just don't see.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:18.081+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7a5ca64b560e65eff637897080742740cee16dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UeW0EssJiJMwhpxq3DdNBDrmbbgoEiykn1TNzeJayICSuxZbXa6gxi2Z.Ke.ZzFcqz3trNwj3Svyj0l1vT87FDMjYfv_uBVsdU-", "site_full": "dejavux.com", "site": "dejavux.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "", "title": "Mofos - Stranded Teens - Busty Perv Flashes h ~ DejavuX", "title_full": "Mofos - Stranded Teens - Busty Perv Flashes h ~ DejavuX", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.76, "main_image": "http://dejavux.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2d9784df-e546-4015-86af-eeef56b55afa.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d7a5ca64b560e65eff637897080742740cee16dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UeW0EssJiJMwhpxq3DdNBDrmbbgoEiykn1TNzeJayICSuxZbXa6gxi2Z.Ke.ZzFcqz3trNwj3Svyj0l1vT87FDMjYfv_uBVsdU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mofos - Stranded Teens - Busty Perv Flashes h ~ DejavuX", "text": "Lost Password?

Some use this outdoor cooking retreat daily. The right bbq accessories can make your backyard cooking time easier and all the more fun. These items come in many different forms and you could easily stock up on barbeque accessories for you space.\nThere are three bbq accessories that really stand out. They go above and beyond the typical gear that you would come across in a grilling kit. Many outdoor chefs like the idea of having their tools in one kit with some bbq accessories on the side. This approach saves room and helps to keep things organized for Columbia South Carolina Grilling .\nOne of the most important West Columbia South Carolina grill tools that you can find is the grill grate handle. One of these innovative bbq accessories is the Grill Grabber. Anyone who has used an outdoor cooking space knows how difficult it can be to lift and carry the grill grate from place to place. The Grill Grabber is a useful tool that makes the whole grilling process easier.\nThe traditional basting brush is among the bbq accessories that typically come with your grilling kit. These brushes are just the right size for getting sauce into the crevices in the meat that you are grilling. Some cooks like to have a few of these on hand and since they are so inexpensive, why not?\nThe basting mop is a variation of the brush that really stands out as a winner. I don\u2019t know about you but I prefer to have an item that is very easy to clean and one that stands the test of time. The basting mop is among the bbq accessories that offers great uses as well as easy clean up in the process. This item is great because it doesn\u2019t brush the sauce off as it is baked into the meat.\nTools aside, there are other bbq accessories that can make your Columbia South Carolinaoutdoor grilling meals taste great. One of these barbeque equipment products is the wooden plank. Cooking on planks is an ancient approach to preparing food that has been gaining popularity among certain cooking circles.\nPlank cooking is ideal for salmon, steaks and vegetables because it adds amazing flavor to the food.

From the standpoint of business analysis, business architecture consists of the elicitation of requirements in order to understand how people, processes, capabilities and information in the current state fit together and support one another. Without this understanding, business analysis will struggle to recommend changes that will be effective for the future. \nEDUCATION STANDARDS \nThe following IIBA BABOK knowledge areas are addressed through this instructor-led course: \nBusiness Analysis Key Concepts: the course will show students how to identify key stakeholders within a business architecture project and how to structure stated requirements using initial conceptual designs. \nBusiness Analysis Planning and Monitoring: the course will show students how to develop an elicitation approach to working and engaging with specific stakeholders on a business architecture project and the best method to collect the resulting outputs from this exercise. \nElicitation and Collaboration: the course will show students the specific technical methods for gathering business architecture requirements and develop proper documentation for communicating outputs from this exercise. \nRequirements Life Cycle Management: the course will show students how to trace specific requirements to key strategic objectives. \nBusiness Capability Analysis 10.6, specifically using Capability Maps \nPerspective 11.4, The Business Architecture Perspective \nStrategy Analysis, specifically 6.1, Analyze Current State and 6.2, Define Future State which contributes to competency 9.3, Business Knowledge \nCompetency 10.34, Process Analysis \nDecision Modelling 11.7, specifically for making choices about which option to use to ensure alignment of people, processes, tools and information. \nRequirements Analysis and Design Definition, specifically 7.1, Specify and Model Requirements, and Competency 9.1, Analytical Thinking and Problem Solving \nSolution Evaluation, specifically 8.4, Assess Enterprise Limitations and 10.30, Non-Functional Requirements Analysis \nGOALS \nThere are five (5) objectives that the curriculum is designed to achieve, including: Understand the 5 key views of looking at an organization: strategy, business capabilities, value chain, business knowledge and organization. Learn how business process assessments can yield insights into the how business carries out their core operations. Develop a lexicon about business architecture, including summary knowledge of key business architecture frameworks. Model a business architecture using capability maps, service-oriented analysis, process modelling and organizational modelling Develop key transition requirements using organizational readiness assessments \nVERIFICATION \nAt the end of each course, a quiz will be offered to students to gauge their knowledge of the material. \nACTIVITY \nTo augment the instructor-led course, students will be engaged to provide their experiences, challenges, interpretations and insights during the 2-day event. Upon completion of the course, students will have acquired and be able to immediately apply a knowledge base about business architecture concepts, methods, techniques and terms that lend to the development of a logical path to help an organization align people, processes, technology and information to help them achieve their key strategic goals and objectives. \nFor returning students, please use the MySmoothCube\u2122 login.

The airport was renamed Velana International Airport in January and is currently undergoing an expansion that will see the opening of a new 2 400m-long runway that will accommodate the Airbus A380. The airport will aim to cater for seven million passengers a year. A new passenger terminal is also being built and is expected to open in 2019-20. The China-Maldives Friendship Bridge will connect Mal\u00e9 with the island of Hulhul\u00e9. The 1,39km-long bridge will give a more reliable land connection between Mal\u00e9 and HulHul\u00e9. Huhulmal\u00e9 is a pre-planned city that will be built on an artificial island eight kilometres from Mal\u00e9. The city will offer an international cruise terminal, a yacht marina, Olympic-size swimming pool, a water theme park, sports arena, a soccer and cricket stadium, and a music and arts institute.

Photo: Thai PBS \nBagnato, a frequent visitor to Schneider's home, retrieved him from inside but did not wear a face covering. He was recognised by a security guard as he held onto Schneider's leg and shoved him onto the floor of the ute. \nOn Thursday, Detective Sergeant Paul Roe from the NSW Police Gangs Squad told the inquest he travelled to Thailand to investigate the circumstances of Schneider's death with local police. \nPolice told him Schneider was most likely bashed to death, with Bagnato being the instigator. \n\"It looked like he coordinated and organised the whole thing, as far as we can see,\" Detective Sergeant Roe said. \nHe said Schneider was likely alive when he was taken to the rented home, because he had ligature marks on his leg consistent with being tied, and there was blood found in the same room as the metal wheelchair. \n\"He was left for a period of time \u2013 I don't know how long \u2013 in that room by himself,\" Detective Sergeant Roe said. \"Allegedly when they returned to that room, Schneider had passed away. My understanding was they stripped his body there, removed his clothes, and that's when they took him to that roadside grave.\" \nBagnato was convicted for his role in the murder and sentenced to death. He is currently on death row at Bangkwang Prison, known as the Bangkok Hilton, and has appealed his sentence. \nGerard was due to be released from prison on December 3, after he told Thai police everything he knew and led them through the crime scenes. However, prosecutors have since appealed his sentence and are seeking the death penalty. \nWhen Australian detectives travelled to Thailand to speak to Bagnato about about the murders of Schneider and Dillon, he refused to speak without his lawyer present. \nThe detectives talked to him before the formal interview, and he allegedly said about Schneider's murder: \"Yeah it's a long prison term for an accident.\" \nAccording to police documents tendered to the Coroner's Court, the Royal Thai Police have identified \"a number of other suspects involved in the murder of Schneider who may be Australian citizens and may have returned to Australia\". \nMr Shoebridge told police he was contacted on Facebook after Schneider's murder by a man who claimed to be associated with the Saint Michael Fight Club. \nThe man threatened to kill Mr Shoebridge and his family if he spoke to authorities about the fight club or the murder of Schneider. \nActing state coroner Teresa O'Sullivan found Schneider died by homicide at the house where he was detained, from a blunt-force injury to his head. \nHis body was returned to Sydney in December 2015, where it was cremated following a funeral.

Competitions take place online and in stadiums. They are watched by millions around the world. \nIndividual players and teams have amassed huge online followings and struck enormous sponsorship deals. Australia's eports industry is not yet as lucrative as the industry in the US, Europe and Asia. \nFairfax Media has previously reported that the GWS Giants have been interested in owning an esports team and that the AFL is keen to host an esports tournament at Etihad Stadium. \nEssendon, Adelaide and the AFL believe clubs owning esports teams is no different to AFL clubs with AFLW teams or netball teams. \nThe esports audience is skewed extremely young and they see esports as a way of putting AFL brands in front of these audiences in places that they spend a lot of time. A group of Australia's leading esports figures presented to AFL CEOs during the 2017 season. \n\"This is an opportunity for brands to reach a younger audience.,\" Rodski told SEN on Friday morning. \"That millennial younger fan is typically very difficult to reach, very difficult to talk to so this gives them a platform and an opportunity to do that so that's where we see initially, the incremental consumer revenues.\" \nEssendon recently announced a bumper $5.1 million profit for the 2017 season.

Uasin Gishu MCAs pass law forcing supermarkets to offer shoppers free carrier bags   12:01 By DENNIS LUBANGA A hawker sells biodegradable shopping bags at the Nyeri matatu terminus, August 28, 2017. Uasin Gishu MCAs have passed a law to force supermarkets to give free alternative carrier bags after the plastics ban. PHOTO | JOSEPH KANYI | NMG \nUasin Gishu MCAs have passed a motion to force supermarkets in the county to provide alternative free carrier bags following the ban on plastic bags. \nWhile moving the motion on Wednesday, nominated Member of County Assembly Catherine Barmao said that after the ban three months ago, supermarkets had forced customers to buy alternative carriers instead of providing them. \n\"Following the ban on plastic bags, supermarket attendants have made a habit of mixing all manner of goods into one bag unlike the past where foodstuff and detergents were separated. This is unhygienic and unacceptable,\" said Dr Barmao. \nThe ban on plastic carrier bags came into force on August 28. \nWhile seconding the motion, Ng'enyilel MCA David Sing'oei said that the ban on plastic bags should not be used by supermarkets as an excuse to mistreat customers. \n\u201cYou all remember so well that plastic bags were costly even before this ban yet our supermarkets could generously afford them and even branded them. \n\"Right now those supermarket attendants boldly throw in everything into one bag. This is unacceptable,\u201d said Mr Sing\u2019oei. \nREAD: Uhuru urges other countries to also ban plastic bags \nBuy bags \nWhen the floor was opened for debate, the majority of the MCA's supported the motion while questioning the reason behind supermarkets forcing customers to buy their own bags. \n\"Some of the plastic bags that were given for free to customers were even more expensive compared to the current bags which customers are now forced to carry or buy and this is why we need to stop this culture before it gets out of hand,\" said Tembelio MCA Pius Kigen. \nMajority Leader Josphat Lowoi accused the supermarkets of putting lives of Kenyans at risk by stuffing different goods in one carrier bag. \n\"Supermarkets should not take advantage of ban on plastic bags and punish locals. Our people should not continue suffering and being subjected to unhygienic and dangerous health risks. \n\"The implementation committee need to follow up on this motion and ensure that our county executive arm implements it fully as soon as possible,\" said Mr Lowoi, the Karuna/ Meibeki representative. \nREAD: Uhuru urges other countries to also ban plastic bags \nOpposed motion \nHowever, two MCAs Sarah Malel (Kimumu) and David Keitany (Sergoit) opposed the motion saying it was meant to hurt the supermarket business in the county. \n\"All we need to do first is carry out a comprehensive market survey with a view of determining the real facts before victimising supermarkets for not giving free bags. \n\"They must be having a reason why they ask customers to buy carrier bags or have their own,\" said Mr Malel. \n\"It is my humble request to this House that you give us ample time to look at the facts and see how we can assist both the locals and businesses over this issue,\" said Mr Keitany who is also the Assembly's Trade committee chairman. \nWhen the question was put before the MCA's, the majority supported the motion which will now be forwarded to the executive arm of county government for implementation.

Bob\u2019s Beer & Soda | 120 Eisenhower Drive, Hanover Valley Green Beverage | 20 Newberry Commons, Goldsboro DAY 1 | Rusty Rail Brewing Company \u2013 Fools Gold Imperial Peanut Butter Hefeweizen 8% alcohol with a Hazy gold and unfiltered color. This Hefeweizen uses Pilsen and Red Wheat Malts with Peanut Butter flavoring Day 2: Mispillion River Brewing \u2013 Holy Crap! Imperial Red Ale This Imperial Red Ale leads with a strong malt body and finishes with the dry bitterness of a 65-million year extinction. Hold on to your butts!!! Day 3: Uinta Brewing COmpany \u2013 Grapefruit Hop Nosh IPA Tangy, juicy and slightly sweet, this IPA features an aromatic burst of fresh squeezed white grapefruit, complementing the bold, hop-forward character of the Hop Nosh line. Day 4: Saugatuck Brewing Company \u2013 Oak Wizard An Oak Aged Imperial Brown Ale with tons of oaky, woody flavors. The base brown malt profile provides a huge caramel, coffee and chocolate body with minimal hop bitterness matched perfectly with the complex flavor profile of the oak chips. Day 5: Wyndridge Farm Unfiltered Pale Ale A moderate, refreshing ale with noticeable hop aroma balanced by supporting malt flavors. Day 6: Flying Fish \u2013 Jersey Juice Packed with newly developed cryogenic hops that are twice as intense in flavor and aroma over regular hops. The result is a huge citrus, mango and tropical fruit hop party in a complex, unfiltered beer. Day 7: Atwater Brewery \u2013 Decadent Dark Chocolate Ale Holding true to the Northern English tradition, the Decadent Dark Chocolate Ale at its foundation has a nutty profile with a round mouth feel. Added is a Chocolate Extract consisting of three blended chocolates of varied depth. Day 8: Spring House Brewing Company \u2013 Satan\u2019s Bake Sale Mint Choclate Chip Stout This stout is smooth, dark, full-bodied, and satisfyingly rich. This brew is aged on fresh peppermint leaves and dark Wilbur Chocolate, giving this stout a powerful aroma and pronounced mint chocolate chip flavor. Day 9: Platform Beer Company \u2013 Lalessness Porter This robust porter is dark, with a cappuccino like tan head. It carries an earthy taste with a slight lingering of roasted coffee/cocoa flavors and a slight hop bitterness. Day 10: Devil\u2019s Backbone Brewing Company \u2013 Cran-Gose Based on the traditional Gose brewing style, we added heaps of pureed cranberry to brew our refreshing Cran-Gose. Light and Fruity, Cran-Gose is pink hued with a cranberry aroma and a naturally tart finish. Light, Tart, Fruity. Day 11: Victory Brewing Company \u2013 Mighty Things Double IPA Pours a hazy dark yellow. Huge dank aromatics. Piney and orange rinds. Mango. Tropical. All over the place. Body is lucious with a minor amount of biscuit malt that backs an otherwise huge hop-load. Alcohol is very well hidden, not a touch of booze. A minor bitterness in the finish. One fine Double IPA. Day 12: Free Will Brewing \u2013 Speical Cookie Imperial Brown Ale Imperial spiced brown ale with cardamom, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and vanilla.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "piney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cran-gose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earl david reed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "valley green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bake sale mint choclate chip stout", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imperial red ale this imperial red ale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "backbone brewing company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fools gold imperial peanut butter hefeweizen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "speical cookie imperial brown ale  imperial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saugatuck brewing company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beer & soda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newberry commons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rusty rail brewing company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uinta brewing", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eisenhower drive", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldsboro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanover valley green beverage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valley green beverage", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:25.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15f97282f5c50bab269980c675185d3a35e78d66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4UEkjK18.G3fXvo4aOxQtcla75Rh91sclcq2PmuHBad_fKYZGAH6V4QBPJN_iF4hYogrZjg3kuVARzEaqcyWjOeHaWVNsi_c-", "site_full": "amarillo.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://amarillo.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist amarillo | personals search", "title": "White for Black - m4m (Ama)", "title_full": "White for Black - m4m (Ama)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "15f97282f5c50bab269980c675185d3a35e78d66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4UEkjK18.G3fXvo4aOxQtcla75Rh91sclcq2PmuHBad_fKYZGAH6V4QBPJN_iF4hYogrZjg3kuVARzEaqcyWjOeHaWVNsi_c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "White for Black - m4m (Ama)", "text": "age: 42   Want to service black dick.I'm vers.swm.love oral.cum.kissing.rim .assplay.dirty talk.want to be submissive.laid back .chill guy.can host.super horny. do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 6415785527", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:25.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae8963978df2e65cb0f8e193c6dc965242e0fd5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6aoitnkY7ap6zywIT8tCnWue5rmYlbJSPyVSdMpAPlfxqsHh4btRcGmwszmjdVqEe0J25Mfl5VVhxB.s.aiNGLzwItEmf79k-", "site_full": "www.revitforum.org", "site": "revitforum.org", "site_section": "https://www.revitforum.org/dynamo-bim/", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "painting", "sports", "home_video_dvd", "tech", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "scuba_diving", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Dynamo BIM", "title": "Element.Space with Conduit Fittings", "title_full": "Element.Space with Conduit Fittings", "published": "2017-11-27T20:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce42c01efdffa789a32fdbf3a042c623ca4fdbc2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6aoitnkY7ap6zywIT8tCnWue5rmYlbJSPyVSdMpAPlfxqsHh4btRcGmwszmjdVqEe0J25Mfl5VVhxB.s.aiNG037.tXj85l_F1aFXnsjTj2c9WyB_QYEp", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "engineer", "published": "2017-11-27T20:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thank you!
