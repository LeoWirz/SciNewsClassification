Nigeria, Guinea, Gambia, Mali and Senegal have seen the highest numbers of returns. \nMigrant flows through Libya surged from 2014. More than 600,000 crossing the central Mediterranean to Italy over the past three years, but departures from Libya's coast dropped sharply in July when armed groups in Sabratha began preventing boats from leaving. \nREAD: SA calls for immediate end to slave trade in Libya \nAfter clashes in the western city in September, thousands of migrants who had been held near the coast surfaced and were transferred to detention centres under the nominal control of the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli. \nNumbers in about 16 centres rose to nearly 20,000, from 5,000-7,000 previously, leading to a worsening of already poor conditions. \n\"We are seeing an increasing number of migrants wishing to return home especially after what happened in Sabratha, it's all linked to Sabratha,\" said Ashraf Hassan, head of the IOM returns programme. \nIn the aftermath of the CNN report and an African Union visit to Libya, some countries of origin have begun accepting charter flights returning migrants from Libya for the first time. \nThe IOM has shortened procedures for screening migrants Libya, collecting less statistical data and focussing on trying to ensure that migrants will not be put at risk by returning, Hassan said. \nThe agency hopes to have three charter flights leaving per day by December 11, increasing that to five flights by December 15. \nOn Tuesday nearly 400 migrants were flown back to Nigeria on two flights from Tripoli, the capital, and from the western city of Misrata.

The plane touched down at an early 7am and I think the sudden humidity was a bit of a shock. I did get a good nap after unpacking so I'm all good, got a ballet class tonight and I'm excited to be back in the studio~ \nI didn't vlog or take too many photos during the last two days in Osaka, I just wanted to enjoy my last two days there too. Plus, we did go back to places that we've visited before, I guessed there wasn't much point to blog for it. \nDay 9 We had originally planned to go to the instant ramen museum on that day, but we realised that they were closed on Tuesdays, so we had to improvise~ \nWe ended up at the Umeda Sky Building! \nThe shops below weren't even open yet~ \n\nUp the escalator, we go~ \n\n\n\n\nLook at the view~ \nWhite Trees!! You can write wishes on the little stars and hang em up! \n\n\n\n\nWe went up to the roof! I was feeling too cold to function. \nAlso, the love locks were under maintenance >: \nGot me a little random toy~ \n\n\nThen we went for some lunch!! \nYummmm  \nThen we headed to Dotonburi again~  \nJ and I did quite a lot of tax free shopping too! We did queue for a very long time to pay for our stuff and to get the tax stuff done as well, but so many things were on sale for such a good price, we just HAD to!  \n\nHad some Ippudo for dinner too~ \nEnded the day with a melonpan ice cream!!! IT WAS AMAZING.  \nDay 10 Since we didn't get to go to the museum the day before, we made our way over just after breakfast!\n\n\n BOWLS!! \nOF RAMEN \n\n\n\nLOOK AT THE TUNNEL! \n\n\n\n\nThey had 'interactive' exhibits~ \n\n\n\n\n\nTunnel of ramen~ \n\nThe making of my own cup noodles! \n\n\n\nHUHU! Yes, I will do the giveaway~ Stay tuned to find out how to win it! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHad to get W to help me hahha \n\n\nSo after pumping in the air, we realised we weren't supposed to do so.. \n\n  LUNCH! \nNOMNOMNOM \nThere were so many types to choose from! I decided to go for the udon kind with the Inari, which was really cool, I didn't expect an actual piece of inari to be in there~\n\n\nAnd then we drove to the airport~ \nAnd~ we're here \nHad a McFlurry~ \nAND MY BELOVED ODEN! \nGot my hands on some of these ball-toy-thingies \n\n\nPasta for dinner~~ \nI missed having these types of pasta, the so called Japanese style pasta. I can't find a place in Singapore that does them now it's so sad! We did get onto the plane from Osaka to Tokyo after this, a pretty short trip, thank goodness!\n\n\nAnd off to sit our butts down in the lounge at the Tokyo Airport~ \n\nDinner/Supper \nI know I'd probably stay away from Japanese food for a while, but I would probably still crave for soba and inari! That's my favourite for sure! The plane ride home was alright, I did have a bit of problem falling asleep but hey, what's new? \nAnyway, I'll be ending the blogpost here, I hope you guys enjoyed this post, do look forward to the giveaway soon!

Then, the Tigers showed their offensive balance. \nCedar Falls trailed by as many as seven points early Tuesday in a metro rivalry game against Waterloo West, but the Tigers, despite getting just two points from star guard A.J. Green through three quarters, pulled away for a 78-50 victory over the Wahawks. \nThe offensive balance was something Tiger head coach Ryan Schultz said needs to continue to happen. \n\u201cThat is what we were just talking about,\u201d Schultz said of his team\u2019s offensive balance. \u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve been talking about for a long time. We think we are a much more multi-faceted team this year and we think we are harder to defend because of that. \n\u201cThat showed tonight. A.J. struggled shooting the ball, but he did all the little things correctly that he always does, and we had a lot of guys step up.\u201d \nGreen finished with 12 points, scoring 10 in the fourth quarter, but Logan Wolf (17), Ben Gerdes (13) and Reese Gardner\u2019s 10 off the bench, provided Cedar Falls plenty of offensive weapons. \nEarly on, however, the Tigers (2-0) missed a few good looks, while the Wahawks (1-2) saw Isaiah Johnson and Nicholas Pepin hit 3-pointers that helped West go on an 8-0 run early. The Wahawks eventually saw their lead grow to 11-4. \n\u201cWe had to dig ourselves out of a hole early, but I thought our guys played with composure,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cWe got down, but we didn\u2019t panic and got back to the type of basketball we needed to play.\u201d \nWest\u2019s shooting cooled off as the Wahawks shot just 6 of 26 in the first half, and they did not match the Tigers physically. \n\u201cBad coaching,\u201d West coach Cliff Berinobis said. \u201cI have not prepared our kids, coached our kids to be more physical. Cedar Falls played harder than us. \n\u201cOur kids know how to play basketball. But we need more mental toughness and be more physical ... be better at the game within the game.\u201d \nCarondis Harris-Anderson led West with 17 points, including 12 in the third quarter and Pepin chipped in 10, but the Wahawk point guard was in foul trouble all night, sitting out most of the second quarter with three fouls as Cedar Falls surged.. \nThe Tigers travel to Iowa City High Friday, while West hosts crosstown rival Waterloo East. \nCedar Falls 78, West 50 \nWATERLOO WEST (1-2) \u2014 Nicholas Pepin 2-5 5-6 10, Jaquon O\u2019Neal 1-5 0-0 2, Isaiah Johnson 3-5 0-0 7, CaRondis Harris-Anderson 7-17 3-5 17, Jaden Keller 1-2 0-1 2, Antonio Alexander 1-4 5-7 7, ShauRome Taylor 0-0 0-0 0, Caleb Haag 1-3 3-5 5, Cade Dodd 0-0 0-0 0, Brian Sapa 0-1 0-0 0, Todd Keller 0-0 0-0 0.

The multibillion-dollar global industry is experiencing strong growth, though the newness of the market and variance in regulation across geographies creates major barriers to entry. The industry includes medical marijuana dispensaries and stores that sell marijuana for recreational use.COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPEDemand is driven by demographics, public awareness of the marijuana plant's medicinal properties, and the desire for natural health treatments. Following decades of prohibition in the US, marijuana has gained greater public acceptance. Baby boomers with health conditions are driving medical marijuana sales, while recreational users include younger generations seeking a substitute to alcohol or other euphoric substances. Marijuana faces ongoing opposition due to health and addiction concerns, and the pros and cons of marijuana use remain widely debated.PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS & TECHNOLOGYRetail marijuana stores sell cannabis products to adults primarily for medical use (about 75% of industry revenue in North America), though recreational shops are increasing in number, according to ArcView Group. Products include different grades of dried plants and a variety of edibles, beverages, oils, tinctures, sublingual sprays, and topical products, as well as smoking or vaporization paraphernalia. Companies in this cash industry buy from marijuana growers and wholesalers, edible product manufacturers, and providers of real estate, security systems, and other support services.

He promises to legalize bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if elected. Titov is friends with President Vladimir Putin and heads up his efforts to fight corruption. He has also repeatedly advocated for the legalization of bitcoin in Russia, suggesting the country should follow Japan\u2019s lead. Bitcoin Advocate Running for President of Russia Boris Titov. \nPresidential Commissioner for Entrepreneurs\u2019 Rights and business ombudsman Boris Titov is running for Russian president in the 2018 election. The 56-year old is representing the business-oriented Party of Growth, the party announced this week. \n\u201cTitov is part of the Kremlin establishment and friends with president Vladimir Putin,\u201d the Moscow Times described, adding that \u201che is also an economic liberal and heads up the president\u2019s efforts to fight corruption.\u201d \nHe told publication Mail.ru that \u201cWe will legalize bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Russia\u201d and further elaborated: \nPopular cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum, will be legalized. People will have the opportunity to store them in banks and crypto exchanges and use as a means of payment, however, only for external transactions. \nTitov explained, \u201cin the domestic Russian market, say, for a sandwich, you cannot pay [with] cryptocurrency.\u201d He added that \u201cit is necessary to change the Russian economy. There is a need for change in society,\u201d noting that \u201cwe are talking about the digital economy \u2013 development of the blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and IT-sphere.\u201d Titov Will Not Create National Cryptocurrency \nCurrently, the Russian government is working on developing the country\u2019s national cryptocurrency, the cryptoruble , under the order of President Vladimir Putin in October. The first proposal for the cryptoruble has already been submitted by the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media. \nTitov told the news outlet that his team was working on a similar idea: \nThree months ago we thought about creating a national currency. But everything changes quickly, and we abandoned this idea. After all, the task of cryptocurrency is to reduce costs. And we realized that this [national cryptocurrency] is not necessary, it is more important to regulate what is. Titov is Pro-Bitcoin \nTitov has long been an advocate of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In July, news.Bitcoin.com reported on him asking the central bank to follow Japan\u2019s example and legalize bitcoin. Titov Meeting with Putin. \nIn February, Klops.ru reported him suggesting that a region of Russia, Kaliningrad, be chosen as the pilot site for bitcoin to be used as a currency. \u201cFor example, you can pay for gasoline with bitcoins,\u201d the publication quoted him. \nHowever, Titov will face competition from Putin, who announced on Wednesday that he will run for re-election. Putin himself also faces challenges, as described by the Moscow Times , \u201cthe greatest other threat to his re-election is perhaps public apathy or indecisiveness, with recent polls showing that over 40 percent of Russian don\u2019t know who to vote for, or whether they would vote at all.\u201d \nWhat do you think of Boris Titov\u2019s policies on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?

(REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein) WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday again raised the possibility of a U.S. government shutdown \u2014 blaming Democrats for that possible outcome \u2014 one day before he is due to host Republican and Democratic congressional leaders for talks on spending bills.Trump and Congress are facing a deadline of Friday at midnight to pass fresh spending legislation. If they cannot agree on the terms, parts of the federal government could shut down.Late on Wednesday, a bill advanced in the House of Representatives to extend current federal funding through Dec. 22, with the chamber expected to take up the bill on Thursday.If that measure clears the House and Senate, as expected, major fights are in the offing over the next funding bill, which could fund the government until sometime in January.Trump\u2019s warning about a shutdown came as conservative House members pushed for increases in military spending along with either a freeze or reduction in domestic programs.Their bid is likely to be rejected by Democrats, who make up a minority in Congress, and could further complicate months of behind-the-scenes negotiations by congressional leaders aimed at figuring out government spending through the end of this fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2018.While the House potentially could pass upcoming spending bills without any Democratic support, that tactic would not work in the Senate where procedural rules give Democrats bargaining power.As a condition of backing new spending, many Democrats have demanded legislative protections for the nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought into the United States as children. Trump pushed back, saying it could set the stage for impasse.\u201cThe Democrats are really looking at something that is very dangerous for our country,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cThey are looking at shutting down.\u201dHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi countered in a tweet: \u201cPresident Trump is the only person talking about a government shutdown. Democrats are hopeful the President will be open to an agreement to address the urgent needs of the American people and keep government open.\u201dThe infighting came as Republican congressional leaders labored to demonstrate that they can govern and spare the country the chaos of a government shutdown at Christmas time that likely would not sit well with voters.A partial government shutdown would leave \u201cessential\u201d services operating, but could disrupt programs ranging from the operation of national parks to educational programs and scientific research.A Politico/Morning Consult opinion poll found that 63 percent of voters want Congress to avoid any shutdown, with 18 percent in favor if it helps lawmakers achieve policy goals.In October 2013, conservative Republicans used the need to pass a funding bill to try to force repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. They failed but in the process forced a 17-day disruption of many federal agency activities.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "russell senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/aaron p. bernstein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house democratic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office building", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "capitol building", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:01.043+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "caab6d6c016ad5153abfe00eb10a2d8acd055570", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvweZYLCw7twaEhsYyzMcP6oYabxQL0tnjLhxSonThdABgbAabmBLkXiojUjGy8IKdQ-", "site_full": "forums.warframe.com", "site": "warframe.com", "site_section": "https://forums.warframe.com/?/forum/34-warframes-abilities/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Warframes &amp; Abilities - Warframe Forums", "title": "Equinox' theme isn't fully exploited", "title_full": "Equinox' theme isn't fully exploited - Warframes & Abilities - Warframe Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T02:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://content.invisioncic.com/Mwarframe/monthly_2017_07/warframe_share.png.bec3c989c4517e865df9b45a300e63e0.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7793, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9603d5efb73df5687b287fd82377f487110cd639", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvweZYLCw7twaEhsYyzMcP6oYabxQL0tnjLhxSonThdABgbAabmBLkXiprwrbKth5UQLgcpXuWNtow--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Hypernaut1", "published": "2017-12-07T13:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "11 hours ago, tnccs215 said: Ah, one of the topics I like.\nYes, she is wasted potential.

Turner in a Memphis courtroom. Judge Lee Coffee told her he would not allow another such interruption, but he did not charge her with contempt of court. \nTurner was indicted Tuesday on a first-degree murder charge. His bail is set at $1 million. Turner told the judge that he was planning to hire an attorney and Coffee set a hearing for Tuesday. \nWright\u2019s body was found in a swampy field in suburban Memphis on July 28, 2010, 10 days after the 34-year-old was reported missing. He was shot multiple times. The seven-year investigation into his death has been one of the Memphis Police Department\u2019s most high-profile unsolved cases. \nProsecutors and police have declined to say much about the case. Police said last month that they had found a gun used in the killing in a lake near the small town of Walnut, Mississippi, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Memphis. \nAfter Marion\u2019s statement, Turner was led out of the courtroom in the custody of court officers.

He promises to legalize bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if elected. Titov is friends with President Vladimir Putin and heads up his efforts to fight corruption. He has also repeatedly advocated for the legalization of bitcoin in Russia, suggesting the country should follow Japan\u2019s lead. Bitcoin Advocate Running for President of Russia Boris Titov. \nPresidential Commissioner for Entrepreneurs\u2019 Rights and business ombudsman Boris Titov is running for Russian president in the 2018 election. The 56-year old is representing the business-oriented Party of Growth, the party announced this week. \n\u201cTitov is part of the Kremlin establishment and friends with president Vladimir Putin,\u201d the Moscow Times described, adding that \u201che is also an economic liberal and heads up the president\u2019s efforts to fight corruption.\u201d \nHe told publication Mail.ru that \u201cWe will legalize bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Russia\u201d and further elaborated: \nPopular cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum, will be legalized. People will have the opportunity to store them in banks and crypto exchanges and use as a means of payment, however, only for external transactions. \nTitov explained, \u201cin the domestic Russian market, say, for a sandwich, you cannot pay [with] cryptocurrency.\u201d He added that \u201cit is necessary to change the Russian economy. There is a need for change in society,\u201d noting that \u201cwe are talking about the digital economy \u2013 development of the blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and IT-sphere.\u201d Titov Will Not Create National Cryptocurrency \nCurrently, the Russian government is working on developing the country\u2019s national cryptocurrency, the cryptoruble , under the order of President Vladimir Putin in October. The first proposal for the cryptoruble has already been submitted by the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media. \nTitov told the news outlet that his team was working on a similar idea: \nThree months ago we thought about creating a national currency. But everything changes quickly, and we abandoned this idea. After all, the task of cryptocurrency is to reduce costs. And we realized that this [national cryptocurrency] is not necessary, it is more important to regulate what is. Titov is Pro-Bitcoin \nTitov has long been an advocate of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In July, news.Bitcoin.com reported on him asking the central bank to follow Japan\u2019s example and legalize bitcoin. Titov Meeting with Putin. \nIn February, Klops.ru reported him suggesting that a region of Russia, Kaliningrad, be chosen as the pilot site for bitcoin to be used as a currency. \u201cFor example, you can pay for gasoline with bitcoins,\u201d the publication quoted him. \nHowever, Titov will face competition from Putin, who announced on Wednesday that he will run for re-election. Putin himself also faces challenges, as described by the Moscow Times , \u201cthe greatest other threat to his re-election is perhaps public apathy or indecisiveness, with recent polls showing that over 40 percent of Russian don\u2019t know who to vote for, or whether they would vote at all.\u201d \nWhat do you think of Boris Titov\u2019s policies on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?

It\u2019s enough to drown any business which tries to fight it or ignore it, and it\u2019s an opportunity to ride higher and faster than even the successes of Google and Facebook, for those startups that use it as their driving force. Per the latest study by networking giant Cisco , the world\u2019s yearly mobile data traffic has grown 18-fold over the past 5 years, reaching 7.2 exabytes per month at the end of 2016, of which half was video. According to the classic book \u201c Data Crush ,\u201d by Christopher Surdak, data in all formats will soon be the largest source of new opportunities for startups, or death. According to what I see, as outlined by Surdak, this data surge is being driven by the following six technological and social trends: Mobility: smartphones, tablets, and the \u201cInternet of things.\u201d Smartphone penetration in the U.S. exceeds 80 percent , and these generate far more data from their non-phone functions than voice. In addition, more people in the world now own cell phones than tooth-brushes. All devices are becoming self-aware, user-aware, and Internet connected. Virtual living: the rise and growing dominance of social media. Facebook has created an environment where millions of people can hold billions of conversations with people and companies, transforming how people expect to interact with each other and the world. For startups, this is an engagement opportunity worth billions of dollars. Digital commerce: infinite options for buying goods and services online. Data-enabled shopping has completely changed our purchasing experience, has undermined some of the greatest brand names, and has created some new brands, like Amazon, that now dominate. There is still infinite room for new startup sales modes and models. Online entertainment: millions of channels, billions of actors. With the adoption of the Internet, digital entertainment has rocketed across the world, changing how people entertain themselves. YouTube is now the 800-pound gorilla of entertainment. Online gaming has moved from the geeks to the mainstream. The audience is now the actors. Cloud computing: the death of dedicated infrastructure. More and more company and personal services are being virtualized to the Cloud. Many companies are already seeing their computing costs drop by thirty percent as they move in this direction, providing new startup opportunities with the Everything as a Service (EaaS) trend. \u201cBig data:\u201d learning from the flood. Big data is mining the storage for knowledge. This gives rise to the personalization and customization that we all want. Analytics will soon drive nearly all business decisions for any company that wants to remain relevant to its customers. Startups are in the best position to provide the analytics, and use them first. As an entrepreneur, what steps can you take to help your business not only survive the data hurricane, but to thrive under these new and challenging conditions? Surdak emphasizes that the goal is to either mitigate some of the pressure caused by data growth or to put that pressure to work for you in growing your startup and remaining competitive: Focus: play to your strengths. Determine your core business strategy and resolve to remain true to it. Make strategic versus opportunistic decisions. Accelerate: speed is life in this new world. Look for and reward quantum changes, like cutting cycle time in half, in your processes, products, and services. Data enable: use metrics and measurements. Extend data metrics into non-traditional channels, such as email, internal social media, and customer collaboration platforms. Quantification: big data, bigger results, and controls. Startups should seek to continually improve performance through statistical analysis and predictive monitoring. Gamify: engagement to get what you pay for. Use internal collaboration platforms, then extend to online customers through your website, blogs, and social media. Crowdsource: putting your audience to work beyond customers. Look beyond today\u2019s requirements for entire new market opportunities. You need to start now to understand the trends and specifics of the information tidal wave that is building up in front of us. Use the steps outlined here to stay ahead of it, and use its power to propel your startup into the future, ahead of your competition. The possibilities are endless, but the downside will be painful.

Two small children, 10 mons & 3 yrs were rescued from a burning apt by a homeless man who jumped a locked gate, then pulled a dead-bolt locked security door open to safety. Both kids will be okay. The man is a TRUE HERO. pic.twitter.com/jImwAklmcB \n\u2014 Las Vegas FireRescue (@LasVegasFD) December 1, 2017 \nThe two children, who are 10 months old and 3 years old, were taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation. It is not believed that their lives are in danger. \nDamage to the apartment is estimated at $50,000. \nReports at the scene indicate that the children were dropped off by their mother to their grandfather\u2019s residence. The stove burst into flames while he was cooking fries and chicken, so he used a window to get outside. \nThe grandfather was apparently in the back of the apartment and couldn\u2019t get to the front, which is where the children were. \nWritten by Bryce Riley for KTNV .

Disclaimer: this kit was sent to me from eleaf\nIntroduction:\nThe Eleaf invoke kit is the latest dual battery kit form eleaf. It features the smallest dual 18650 mod i\u2019ve personally seen and the ello t sub ohm tank which is a newer version of the ello tank that takes the same coils. It\u2019s available in 4 colors green with black trim, SS with black trim, all black, and white with rose gold trim. The mod has all the modes you\u2019d expect from eleaf including temp control for ni200, ss and ti, TCR, preheat function and reverse charging with an adapter sold separate.\nManufacturer's Specs\nSize:45mm 27mm 118mm Weight: 114g Output wattage: 220W E-liquid capacity: 2ml (Extendable to 4ml) Maximum charging current: 2A Maximum output current: 50A Thread type: 510 thread Battery type: high-rate 18650 battery Output mode: VW/TC(Ni,Ti,SS,TCR-M1,M2,M3) Resistance range: 0.05-1.5ohm (TC modes) Resistance range: 0.1-3.5ohm (VW mode) Temperature range: 100\uff0d315\u2103/200\uff0d600\u2109(TC modes) Included in box:\n1 \u00d7 Eleaf Invoke (without batteries) 1 \u00d7 ELLO T Atomizer 1 \u00d7 HW3 Triple-Cylinder 0.2ohm Head 1 \u00d7 HW4 Quad-Cylinder 0.3ohm Head 1 \u00d7 QC USB Cable 2 \u00d7 User Manuals Spare Parts Pictures and test results\nSpreadsheet:\nStock Shot Colors:\nStock Shot tank:\nSize comparison 1:\nSize Comparison 2:\nSize Comparison 3:\nHand Check:\nBox:\nWeight mod only:\nInitial Impressions and features\nWhen I first got this Mod, I was pretty impressed with the size and weight of it. It\u2019s the smallest dual 18650 mod i\u2019ve ever seen personally and it\u2019s extremely light. The screen is big and bright which was my only complaint about the ikonn 220 personally the dim screen so nice to see that addressed. The Ello T that comes with kit is a nice little tank. I\u2019ve used the ello before and the only difference in the 2 really is the fill method. The Ello T uses a more standard 2 large hole top fill that you unscrew the cap to access over the slide back 1 hole top fill of the original ello.\nWatt Mode Performance\nLet\u2019s get into some data. Before testing as i save that for last usually, i noticed in my vaping that the output of the mod was inconsistent. My puffs would sometimes feel weaker or stronger despite not changing the settings. So due to that it would be hard to actually test it\u2019s accuracy so instead i decided to test for consistency. I used 4 builds like usual a .1, a .14 a .2 and a .46 ohm. I fired the mod at 220 watts 4 times and 100 watts 4 times on all the builds except the .46 where the mod due to it\u2019s volt limit only lets me go as high as 139.1 so i tested that 4 times at 139 and 4 times at 70.\nAt .1 and 220 setting i got values of 205 watts twice, 186 watts once, and 169 watts once. So 3 different values in 4 attempts spanning a range of 36 watts. At 100 watts i got 93 3 times and 87 once so one out of 4 hit 6 watts weaker. For the .14 test at 220 i got 214 watts 3 times and 206 once so 1 out of 4 hit 8 watts weaker. At the 100 test it did 97 watts all 4 times. For the .2 test at 220 it fired 193 all 4 times. At the 100 setting it fired 89 twice, 84 once and 80 once so 2 out of 4 were different in a span of 9 watts. For the .46 test at 139 it fired 105 all 4 times. For the 70 test it fired 73 3 times and 70 once so 1 out of 4 was 3 watts lower than the rest.\nThe max outputs i got were 45 amps which is good for a dual battery mod (anything above 40 is good, 40 is the average at this point) but a little short of the 50 listed but no complaints there. Max watts i got were 214 so only 6 low of the listed 220 so no complaints there either. Max volts i got were 6.943 which is short of the 8 listed but still average for dual battery mods as most hit around 7 in my .5ish tests. So overall it\u2019s pretty accurately rated and on par specwise with most dual mods.\nNow what does all this mean? In short i fired the mod a total of 32 times for this testing 7 times the mod output a different amount than it\u2019s \u201cbaseline\u201d using the output most common as the baseline. In other words roughly 1 out of every 5 times i fired the mod it\u2019s output was different despite not changing anything on the mod. Worse case the difference was 36 watts best case it was only a 3 watt difference. Out of the 8 tests performed only 3 times did all 4 puffs in the test group output the same. So more than half the time it couldn\u2019t output 4 consistent puffs in a row\nTemperature Control\nUsing SS316 wire with the default SS mode as well as TCR mode. I tested 6 builds ranging from single round spaced single and dual coils, to fancy single coil and Fancy dual coil builds . With all builds the mod wouldn\u2019t stay in temp control for a full day without kicking me out. The best i had was the simple round which lasted a few hours before the kick out. I also used one single coil SS430 clapton build in TCR mode that was able to last a few hours before kicked out. The temp control vape wasn\u2019t bad but since it can\u2019t stay in temp control mode, it\u2019s an easy fail for me.\nOther Usage Notes\nThe mod is the smallest dual 18650 I've seen. Very pocketable and light. It has a centered 510 pin and can accommodate up to a 27mm atomizer without any overhang. The menu system is great and easy to use it\u2019s a 3 click system to get into the menu and each has it\u2019s sub menu\u2019s it\u2019s very straightforward. The battery door is easy to open and close and has no gaps. The fire button is solid but the plus and minus have some rattle. I wanted to disassemble this device because it performed more like a joyetech/wismec mod of late and not the typical great performance I\u2019ve gotten from the other eleaf mods i reviewed being the ikonn 220 and the pico 25. Sadly i couldn\u2019t get it apart. So i thought I\u2019d cheat a little and see if if DJL did a review, which he did but sadly he couldn\u2019t get it apart either. The entire battery tray appears to be glued to the body of the mod. So sadly i can't see how it\u2019s wired up that could be causing these performance issues.\nEllo T Tank\nThe included Ello T Tank is cross compatible with the Ello coils. It uses the same HW coils. Since it\u2019s a dual battery mod it comes with the 2 high watt coils the HW3 and HW4. I\u2019ve reviewed these before but it\u2019s nice to get a 2nd chance due to quality control and all. This time around the HW3 coil was very good. Above average flavor at around 75 watts but pushing 80 was close to burnt so i\u2019d say best range 70-80 watts and was able to get a week out of it so average life. The HW4 coil however never gave me any good flavor and burned out after a few days usage. I think their low watt HW1 and HW2 coils are the best options for this tank personally but the HW3 has some potential if you get a good one.\nThe Ello T itself it\u2019s a standard subohm tank that\u2019s nearly identical to the original ello with the exception of the tip fill. Instead of the slide back, it has a more standard unscrew the cap with 2 large fill holes. It\u2019s bottom air and comes with a 2ml glass and 4ml glass and adapter so you can use either capacity but for me, i opt for the 4ml. It\u2019s a good tank with plenty of cross compatible coils. It\u2019s 25mm in diameter and comes in a matching color to the mod\nPros:\nBig bright screen Looks and size (smallest dual 18650 mod) Included Ello T tank is good Easy menu system comfortable shape lightweight pretty accurately rated centered 510 accommodates up to 27mm atomizers Cons:\nWatt mode performance (inconsistent) Temp Mode Performance (won\u2019t stay in temp mode) Conclusion\nSo with all that said, do I recommend this kit or not? I don\u2019t like to do a hard yes or no but this one has to go to the no for it\u2019s inconsistent power output and kicking out of temp control as i lean heavy on performance. I\u2019m sure some people won\u2019t care or notice and will like it for it\u2019s size, but for me it didn\u2019t meet my standards so i can't put my name on it. It was disappointing because the pico 25 was really good in power mode and the ikonn was really good in power and temp modes with a minor con of the dim screen. I was hoping the invoke would perform more like the ikonn 220 but with a nicer screen and smaller size and it would have been perfect.\nThis is Anthony Vapes just keeping it honest, hopefully you all can say the same and i\u2019ll catch you on my next review.\nFor good recommendations feel free to check out my google sheet of recommendations located here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c4MZ2xYBE-1-0A6rLYY46OHtzHCM-roJINpxghmhzXM/edit?usp=sharing this sheet will be updated regularly so feel free to bookmark it.\nAgain I want to thank Eleaf for sending me this\nLink to the invoke is here https://www.eleafus.com/e-cigarette/invoke-series.html", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://i.imgur.com/NpIIKH8.png", "https://i.imgur.com/L1qyPsB.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/0rGTQRN.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/YC0UlOq.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/0zki6rg.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/isbPBPB.jpg", "https://www.eleafus.com/e-cigarette/invoke-series.html", "https://www.eleafus.com/teamimages/e-cigarette/Invoke/invoke-with-ello-t1_04-3.jpg", "https://www.eleafus.com/teamimages/e-cigarette/Invoke/invoke-with-ello-t_12.png", "https://i.imgur.com/EQExBDW.jpg", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c4MZ2xYBE-1-0A6rLYY46OHtzHCM-roJINpxghmhzXM/edit?usp=sharing"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:02.038+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3cc0b8972c361f12cba515fbc11ca7f1bb12e8d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMuarVrhAhMnz95MyOLRiZ0nz48fiMFbkQOSKQ5ssFs4OEAOjBr8XpRNS00S0QzorTwyyP9Ur84ALVjoKgSy93TEC1H2muPtA5cg7uQFG6x53g--", "site_full": "vapingunderground.com", "site": "vapingunderground.com", "site_section": "http://vapingunderground.com/forums/mods-pvs.77/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Mods &amp; PVs | Vaping Underground Forums - An Ecig and Vaping Forum", "title": "Anthony Vapes: Eleaf Invoke Kit Tech Review", "title_full": "Anthony Vapes: Eleaf Invoke Kit Tech Review | Vaping Underground Forums - An Ecig and Vaping Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T15:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://vapingunderground.com/data/avatars/m/53/53172.jpg?1484268521", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33506, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b23260a4dc01a55626d3d9282d5d1aeb0166b55a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMuarVrhAhMnz95MyOLRiZ0nz48fiMFbkQOSKQ5ssFs4OEAOjBr8XpRNS00S0QzorTwyyP9Ur84ALVjoKgSy93TEC1H2muPtA5cPYOyn8K6LqgVbrCnQ8mXc", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "PaulS", "published": "2017-12-06T19:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "No doubt the mod has issues.

It\u2019s important to know your limits and what you can learn to do vs what will end up being too much for you. You don\u2019t want to end up with half a project completed and having to call someone in to rip it out and start over. Other than being deeply embarrassing, it will also end up costing you more money too. \nHere are a few renovations that should be within your grasp. Cleaning Gutters \nWhen gutters overflow, they damage any siding on the home, exterior paintwork and potentially cause water to seep into the foundation too. A flooded garden is the last thing you need if you want to have a happy home life too. \nGutters should be cleaned once a year, but more often if you have trees with branches that overhang and come the fall will block up the gutters with leaves. You can clean the gutters quite easily by donning long sleeves, some rubber gloves, and a scoop to extract the malted mess that has built up. Layer some plastic down below or have a plastic bag ready to scoop out the mess into. \nAnother option is gutter covers/guards . They prevent leaves and other debris from getting inside the gutters. However, they need occasional maintenance too and it\u2019s a tossup whether the cost of time or money to clean the gutters periodically is more than outfitting the gutter covers in the first place. Painting the Outside of the House Safely \nPainting the exterior of your home doesn\u2019t look too difficult at first. The issue comes in when you have a two-story home where it gets tricky to safely access the top part of each wall. While an extended ladder may certainly reach, it doesn\u2019t take much unintentional movement on the ladder to cause it to wobble and become unsteady. Even when someone is holding the ladder at the bottom, the longer it is extended, the more effect that small movements will have on its stability when leaning it up against a wall. \nFor homes that have an accessible roof where a secure rope and pulley system can be setup, then a protective iron worker harness , like the ones workers use on building sites that have three D-rings sewn into the back and on both sides to secure the worker, is ideal. The trick is to have a way of providing a safe mechanism to secure it to as a harness as it\u2019s only as good as what it\u2019s hooked onto. Maintaining the Deck \nThe deck at the back of the house needs taking care of in the spring, the summer and at the start of fall. In the spring, it should be cleaned and be sure to use a suitable cleanser for the type of decking it is. In the summer, check for any issues like boards out of place or screws missing and repair anything that\u2019s necessary. By early fall, keep the deck clear of falling branches and leaves, and move lawn furniture around periodically to prevent the deck discoloring in that spot. \nNot every home renovation is something you can do yourself. However, it\u2019s also true that you don\u2019t need to run out to hire someone for every minor thing that must be done. The more you can learn to do things yourself, the less costly the home will be to maintain in the long run.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:03.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b926a73e99df0083c42060c4c2ca99b523610718", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_GbzPSD3e8vS.s8ZsXJjqE.9fV0gwUSy_O1LsjUyeuxhrTq5ZQMxrKEYax.hLOTg5y686IOy2qbcG1987PwEw0tFKIxXC1wLlK.Q_ZXD5pcMq29zDwm6Hn", "site_full": "www.unionleader.com", "site": "unionleader.com", "site_section": "http://www.unionleader.com/section/?template=RSS?nocache=1?omniture=0", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "All Stories", "title": "California wildfires: Homes burn in Bel-Air, 405 Freeway closed", "title_full": "California wildfires: Homes burn in Bel-Air, 405 Freeway closed", "published": "2017-12-07T04:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/storyimage/UL/20171206/NEWS07/171209428/AR/0/AR-171209428.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=70", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 41865, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b926a73e99df0083c42060c4c2ca99b523610718", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_GbzPSD3e8vS.s8ZsXJjqE.9fV0gwUSy_O1LsjUyeuxhrTq5ZQMxrKEYax.hLOTg5y686IOy2qbcG1987PwEw0tFKIxXC1wLlK.Q_ZXD5pcMq29zDwm6Hn", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T04:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "California wildfires: Homes burn in Bel-Air, 405 Freeway closed", "text": "California wildfires: Homes burn in Bel-Air, 405 Freeway closed Los Angeles Times December 06. 2017 9:55PM Firefighters try and save a home along Linda Flora Dr. in Bel Air, where the Skirball fire prompted a full closure of the 405 Freeway as well as mandatory evacuations in an area of multimillion-dollar homes Wednesday morning, Dec. 6, 2017. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times/TNS) Homes were burning in Los Angeles\u2019 Bel-Air neighborhood Wednesday morning as a wind-driven wildfire prompted closure of the 405 Freeway and triggered mandatory evacuations in an area of multimillion-dollar residences.By 11 a.m., the Skirball fire had scorched 150 acres and destroyed four to six homes on Casiano Road and Moraga Drive, authorities said. Los Angeles fire officials said the fire was being driven by 25 mph winds and likely would grow.As of 9 a.m., the southbound 405 Freeway was open, but the northbound 405 remained closed between the 10 and 101 freeways.More than 350 firefighters, 52 engines and six fixed-wing aircraft were battling the blaze from the north, west and east. Weather forecasters predicted relatively cool temperatures, in the 50s and 60s, on Wednesday but with continued low humidity and winds above 25 mph.\u201cIt\u2019s been years since anything here has burned at all,\u201d said Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Cody Weireter. \u201cYou\u2019ve got heavy, heavy brush, you\u2019ve got the dryness \u2014 obviously, we haven\u2019t had any rain at all. A lot of the fire is topography-driven, which already becomes dangerous. The wind is going to increase that twofold.\u201dBlack smoke began billowing from the fire area just after 9 a.m., apparently when flames reached a canyon area thick with brush 50 to 60 feet deep, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The area did not burn in the historic devastating Bel-Air fire, meaning vegetation hadbuilt up there for decades.The city will declare a local state of emergency Wednesday, Garcetti said.\u201cThese are days that break your heart,\u201d Garcetti said. \u201cThese are also days that show the resilience of our city.\u201dAuthorities have ordered the evacuation of all homes between Mulholland Drive on the north, Sunset Boulevard on the south, Roscomare Road on the east and the 405 Freeway on the west.

While the holidays never seem to get old, your decor may feel dated or overdone. Thankfully, there are some easy ways to spruce up your decorations and make this holiday season feel brand new. The classics are great, but here are some ideas for when you want a more unique look for your home. Try New Colors \nIf you celebrate Christmas, you\u2019ve probably seen enough green and red decorations to last a lifetime, so don\u2019t be scared of switching it up. If you\u2019re hesitant to go the beaten track, try something simple like switching to lime green instead of the traditional forest green. If you\u2019re ready for a real change, you can make any color combination work for the holidays. If you love pink and gold, go for it. Magenta and blue? Even better. With the internet at your fingertips, it\u2019s possible to find Christmas decorations in almost any color. Search Pinterest for \u201cChristmas color palettes\u201d and let your imagination run wild. Find Fun Ornaments \nSimple baubles are beautiful, but you can also decorate your tree with unique ornaments that will really fit your personality. They can go along with your color scheme, or you can throw it to the wind and just go crazy. Start by deciding on a theme for the tree, such as animals. With a quick search you can find anything from a hummingbird ornament to a dolphin. Or let your kids decide on a theme \u2014 the beach, Dr. Seuss, a sports team. There\u2019s no wrong way to decorate to your tree and make it distinctively yours. Get Hands-On \nThere\u2019s no better way to get one-of-a-kind items than to make them yourself. After all, no one can replicate your magic touch. If you\u2019re able to sew, pull out the needle and thread and get to work on some interesting stockings, wall hangings, ornaments and more. Like to paint? Create custom ornaments, wrapping paper or even draw some winter scenes on your mirrors. Don\u2019t stress if you\u2019re not crafty, there are plenty of DIY ideas that don\u2019t involve a particular skill. For example, you can create a piece of art with all the holiday cards you receive, arrange a beautiful wreath or centerpiece, or even make an advent calendar. Look through some ideas and choose a few that inspire you. Follow the instructions, or do them your own way. Either way you\u2019ll be left with some gorgeous and unique decor. \nDecorating for the holidays doesn\u2019t have to follow tradition or be boring. Put your creativity to the test and vow to make your holiday decorations special this year. Whether you switch up the colors, make your own stockings or add a couple quirky ornaments to your tree, don\u2019t be afraid to let your personality shine through your Christmas adornments.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "seuss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:03.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be88db7b27be51e552d8593ea6f804c000d8b72b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.EHWNFEl1JAt9QjITY_TeuGATjTaFs5Rv0LHX_pKIm7CGzc3JNC7Ki9B1JYBRO1jAg13ijd2nq0dpbAznq5wUy74WKiWEsQTJoivjTkaBGctU8G01wajoaXt.1eg8Ta_Mus8xCT.HxZCcnPPRmmTtBuN0ymZSXmKIishwtAvxwhE.mGCavNoiR", "site_full": "www.lancastereaglegazette.com", "site": "lancastereaglegazette.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.lancastereaglegazette.com/lancaster/home", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "GANNETT Syndication Service", "title": "New Anchor Hocking glasses go on sale to benefit public art project", "title_full": "New Anchor Hocking glasses go on sale to benefit public art project", "published": "2017-12-06T22:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/63634df84f2f6599407ebfb5ccf420f19736ada7/c=0-274-5805-3554&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/12/06/OHGroup/Lancaster/636481674731645019-01-LAN-Lancaster-Glasses.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be88db7b27be51e552d8593ea6f804c000d8b72b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.EHWNFEl1JAt9QjITY_TeuGATjTaFs5Rv0LHX_pKIm7CGzc3JNC7Ki9B1JYBRO1jAg13ijd2nq0dpbAznq5wUy74WKiWEsQTJoivjTkaBGctU8G01wajoaXt.1eg8Ta_Mus8xCT.HxZCcnPPRmmTtBuN0ymZSXmKIishwtAvxwhE.mGCavNoiR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reporter", "published": "2017-12-06T22:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "New Anchor Hocking glasses go on sale to benefit public art project", "text": "New Anchor Hocking glasses go on sale to benefit public art project Jeff Barron , Reporter Published 3:05 p.m. ET Dec. 6, 2017 Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

The market house will host a preview of the glasses from 5 to 9 p.m. on Friday. The evening will include music, food from food trucks and beverages. The glasses will be sold in sets of five for $35 and were donated by Anchor Hocking. Local corrugated cardboard company WestRock made the gift boxes. The sets will be available for purchase Friday at the Keller Market House and at various locations through the Christmas shopping season. All proceeds will fund a public art project that honors the glass industry and its local significance. Details of the project have not yet been finalized. Lohcal's Nathan Downour said he approached Anchor Hocking with the idea for the glasses and said the company will donate 10,000 glasses to the cause. \"When the book, \"Glass House\" was published, I was deeply saddened and angry that my hometown was being portrayed in this negative way,\" he said in a statement. \"I am incredibly proud of my community and I was inspired to design something that could contribute to our community pride and the pride we have in our rich glass history.\" More: New book 'Glass House' looks at city's problems Downour was referring to \"Glass House: The 1% Economy and the Shattering of the All-American Town,\" a book written by city native Brian Alexander that looks at the city's downtown and uses the ups and downs of Anchor Hocking as the storyline. \"This is truly a perfect storm of community pride,\" Destination Downtown Lancaster/Special Improvement District Executive Director Amanda Everitt said in a statement. \"A book that took aim at the glass industry and how it negatively impacted Lancaster has now inspired a counter movement that will produce a public art project that salutes the importance of glass in this town and how it helped us become a thriving community.\" The Keller Market House is located at 134 S.

Photo: AFP / Issouf Sanogo \nABUJA - Nigerian migrants expressed relief as they arrived home on Tuesday from Libya, describing the \"hell\" of harsh conditions in detention camps where they had been held. \nAfrican heads of state have condemned the treatment of undocumented migrants in Libya, including widespread violence and apparent slave trading. The 144 returnees who touched down late Tuesday, and another planeload expected to land shortly after, are part of a repatriation programme that Nigeria has stepped up in recent months. \nOne man who gave his name as Franklin told AFP that he was \"very, very happy\" to return. \n\"It's good to be home, because I've been in hell in the land of Libya. I'll start a new life in my country,\" he said as he waited to be given food. \nREAD: Ghana's president slams Libya over slave auctions \nThe UN has urged Libya to agree to shut down 30 centres holding 15,000 migrants, whose detention has become a pressing issue after video footage showing African men sold in Libyan slave auctions sparked global outrage. \n\"Thank God, thank God, thank God,\" said one young man as he stood in an orderly line at the airport to be registered first by immigration officers and then by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). \nNigerians make up the majority of undocumented migrants trying to make the treacherous crossing via the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. Their repatriation began nearly a year ago but numbers have increased recently, with nearly 1,300 brought home in November, according to NEMA. 2,778 Nigerians in detention camps in Libya https://t.co/ihMpDbzBQV via @todayng pic.twitter.com/iaMzMCTL1c \u2014 Nigeria Newsdesk (@NigeriaNewsdesk) December 5, 2017 \nAnother returnee, Omoburo, said he had been held in a Libyan detention camp for nearly nine months before he could return home. \n\"They used us to do all sort of things, to carry bombs, to carry ammunition, even to 'pack' dead bodies,\" he said as he stood in front of a large poster of Nigeria's first lady Aisha Buhari extending a warm \"welcome\" to the group. \nThe Nigerian ambassador in Libya has visited the camps for illegal migrants on their way to Europe, said Tiwatope Adeleye Elias-Fatile, spokeperson for Abuja's ministry of foreign affairs. The visits, made in partnership with the International Organisation for Migration, aim to identify detained Nigerians and issue them with emergency travel documents, he said on Monday. \nREAD: Libya allows emergency migrant 'evacuations' amid slave scandal \n\"The embassy has a record of 2,778 registered Nigerians in accessible detention camps and they are ready for repatriation,\" the spokesperson said, adding that 250 Nigerian migrants were being flown back to Lagos each week. \nOnce they have landed, they are taken back to their home towns or villages or given a small sum of money to make the journey on their own. Libya's UN-backed government has hit back at growing criticism, saying that it was being overwhelmed by illegal immigration.

Light is what makes a room look bigger or smaller, brighter or darker and so on. Therefore we need to be very careful when selecting lighting fixtures. Let\u2019s talk about the most popular types of indoor lighting and select the most suitable option for your home. Recessed lighting This kind of lighting looks laconic, strict and stylish. The main thing here is to make sure you have provided the lamps with proper insulation. Another important factor is clearance above the ceiling \u2013 it should not be less than 5 inches. Recessed lighting fixtures look fine in a kitchen, hallway or bathroom. Chandeliers Chandeliers are a classic kind of lighting. Speaking about Regenbogen chandeliers we should note that these look especially luxurious and stylish. This is a great solution for a living room or for a bedroom. Ceiling lamps In addition to recessed lighting fixtures there are also Regenbogen ceiling Lamps mounted on the ceiling, but not inside of it. There is a great variety of such lamps in our online store. Ceiling lamps are so popular due to versatility \u2013 one may mount them in an office, kitchen, living room and even bedroom. Wall sconces Such lighting is a must-have for houses and apartments with old-style interior. Wall sconces look tremendous side by side with antique mirrors and beautiful paintings, but putting these into a modern interior will just ruin everything. Pendants Undoubtedly, pendants are the best options for kitchen if you want to make this room look cosy and traditional. Variety of pendants nowadays is really impressive \u2013 everyone can easily find something spectacular. Another room where pendants would look fine is a kid\u2019s room since a pendant provides good light focus \u2013 for example, on a table where your children do their homework. Some things remain classic, some things appear for the first time. It concerns everything including lighting. Choosing suitable lighting fixtures will let you turn your interior into the design masterpiece, while selecting something that does not fit the style at all will bring all your efforts to nought.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "different types of lighting", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:03.049+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7902cfa9a6e1c3f731a4f3f96ae8e1be521c0315", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.87ohzHzuPF5JUjseHnBTJLp0fEy7O9.ouqCW91yh._KcjpmO135o.wLGVj7iIQ9Q-", "site_full": "www.marketwired.com", "site": "marketwired.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.mwnewsroom.com/fb/MW-South-Carolina/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "business", "marketing"], "section_title": "MW-South Carolina", "title": "Integrated Biometrics Announces New Equity Round", "title_full": "Integrated Biometrics Announces New Equity Round", "published": "2017-12-05T14:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://media.marketwire.com/attachments/201710/94176_Logoblue.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21499, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7902cfa9a6e1c3f731a4f3f96ae8e1be521c0315", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.87ohzHzuPF5JUjseHnBTJLp0fEy7O9.ouqCW91yh._KcjpmO135o.wLGVj7iIQ9Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-05T14:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Integrated Biometrics Announces New Equity Round", "text": "December 05, 2017 07:00 ET Integrated Biometrics Announces New Equity Round \nAdditional $2 million to accelerate increased production capacity \nSPARTANBURG, SC--(Marketwired - Dec 5, 2017) - Integrated Biometrics today announced that the company recently closed on a $2 million equity financing round.

(REUTERS/Carlo Allegri) Roger Goodell signed a five-year contract extension to remain the commissioner of the NFL, according to a memo sent to league owners from the compensation committee on Wednesday.ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported, citing a source, that Goodell\u2019s contract is expected to pay him about $40 million per year and includes incentives. Darren Rovell, also of ESPN, reported the five-year deal could be worth twice as much annually as the first 10 years that Goodell was commissioner, during which he made $212.5 million.Goodell, 58, has earned more than $200 million since he was elected NFL commissioner in 2006, succeeding Paul Tagliabue. Goodell first joined the league as an intern back in 1982.\u201cOur committee unanimously supports the contract and believes that it is fully consistent with \u2018market\u2019 compensation and the financial and other parameters outlined to the owners at our May 2017 meeting, as well as in the best interests of ownership,\u201d the memo said. \u201c... We are pleased to report that there is a nearly unanimous consensus among the ownership in favor of signing the contract extension now.\u201dGoodell\u2019s new deal, which runs through 2024, had been a contentious issue throughout the 2017 season. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones recently threatened to sue the NFL if the extension is approved before rescinding that threat.The six-member compensation committee, headed by Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, was granted permission to negotiate the extension on behalf of the league\u2019s 32 owners. Jones was removed as a non-voting seventh member of the committee after his threat of a lawsuit.Blank said that he spoke with Jones recently and that the Cowboys owner \u201cunderstands the contract and how we got here.\u201dGoodell\u2019s extension would keep him in place through the league\u2019s negotiations for its next collective bargaining agreement with the players\u2019 union and its next

magazine named the #MeToo movement or the \"Silence Breakers\" as the \"Person of the Year,\" a nod to the millions of people who came forward with their stories of sexual harassment, assault and rape. (Time Magazine) WASHINGTON \u2014 Time magazine has named the social movement aimed at raising awareness about sexual harassment and assault, epitomized by the #MeToo social media hashtag, as the most influential \u201cperson\u201d in 2017, the publication announced on Wednesday.\u201cThis is the fastest moving social change we\u2019ve seen in decades and it began with individual acts of courage by hundreds of women \u2014 and some men, too \u2014 who came forward to tell their own stories,\u201d Time Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal told NBC News, referring to them as \u201cthe silence breakers.\u201dThe recognition comes amid a wave of public allegations of sexual misconduct that have targeted some of the most prominent men in politics, media and entertainment, leading to multiple firings and investigations.As more people made their accusations public, other individuals also shared their own stories of assault and harassment, often with posts on social media platforms using the hashtag #MeToo.\u201cI could never had envisioned something that would change the world. I was trying to change my community,\u201d Tarana Burke, the hashtag\u2019s creator, told NBC. \u201cThis is just the start. It\u2019s not just a moment, it\u2019s a movement. Now the work really begins.\u201d President Donald Trump, who was Time\u2019s person of the year in 2016, was the first runner-up this year, followed by Chinese President Xi Jinping, Felsenthal said.Other finalists included North Korean President Kim Jong-un, \u201cWonder Woman\u201d director Patty Jenkins and football player-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick, among others.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xi jinping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "felsenthal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong-un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin kaepernick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward felsenthal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tarana burke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "time", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nbc news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:04.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ed63c66d01da5f9d826d52edfc28a8e6953a533d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTaedbu9AIfNuhhogjVRfp_w--", "site_full": "forums.moneysavingexpert.com", "site": "moneysavingexpert.com", "site_section": "http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.php?f=167", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Work &amp; Benefits - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "title": "Switching water supplier", "title_full": "Switching water supplier - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "published": "2017-06-01T14:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2270, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0fbd076352e980fcbb05f488942358823e116db6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTaedbu9AIfNsQel_kSuL_ZTdKzsxBsO146YkOcN8QXyQ-", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "AbbieCadabra", "published": "2017-12-07T11:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\u201c If it doesn't actually cost to switch, is it not worth switching to a different company, even for no cost savings?

An Open Letter to the SQL Community: Regarding Speakers (Part 1 of 2 -about and for Speakers.) The SQL Server community stands out as one of the most open, sharing, and giving technology communities. Around the world, there are active and robust User Groups, free all day SQL Saturdays, and regional events, all with the singular focus that all who use SQL Server and the Microsoft data platform can quickly and easily gain the knowledge and skills to enhance their, and their organization's productivity. There is a very special sub-group within the global SQL Server community, and it is comprised of those that passionately, time after time, step forward to offer their knowledge and experience as volunteer Speakers at SQLSaturdays, User Groups, and many other free community events. These Speakers tirelessly inform, explain, educate, answer questions, and serve as ambassadors of the community, to the community. They often travel great distances, at substantial costs, both to their budget and family. They spend considerable amounts of time preparing their presentations, perfecting their demos, pondering the questions they might, and do, encounter. They invest time and energy communicating with those that have attended their sessions. As a bonus, they often learn from the attendees asking questions that hadn't been previously considered. It's important to keep in mind that Speakers, like all of us, are only human. In spite of all their preparation, things go awry. Demos don't always work as expected, equipment fails, connections don't connect, and sometimes things just don't go right. Maybe they misspoke and offered a piece of information that caused confusion, or weren't completely up to speed on some nuance or edge case feature, and sometimes they may have responded in a manner that seemed a bit less than desired. But you know what? Audiences are for the most part, very supportive, accommodating, and forgiving; they usually realize that the presentation, like any labor of love, may have a few rough edges. They realize that the Speaker is doing the best she/he can at the moment, under the circumstances, in that particular situation. Our audiences are excellent. Except for that guy . You know him. We've all been in sessions with him; we've been annoyed by his distractions, rambling questions that seem to be more about showing his knowledge or experience, or his attempts to discredit the Speaker. It's all about him. We find ourselves wishing that he would just STFU! If you are reading this, most likely, you're not that guy . You obviously care about enough the Speakers that you want to know more. If you encounter that guy in a session, politely remind him that you're there to hear from the Speaker, about the session topic, and that the diversions are distracting. I guarantee you that the Speaker will appreciate everyone's effort to keep the session on topic. This community of Speakers deserves our appreciation, our heartfelt thanks, our acknowledgement that the SQL Server Community is robust and thriving because of THEM! Having such a high quality community of folks willing to freely share their expertise and knowledge in virtually unparalleled in most professional fields. We all benefit from this great community of SQL Server Speakers. Please join me in saying THANK YOU Speakers!

We wish to forget the wounds of the past and move ahead towards peace,\u201d said Bishop Hiiboro Kussala. \nSpeaking during the end of Interstate Governors\u2019 Strategic Intervention Conference for Peace, entitled Peace within and across the borders at Yambio November 27 to 30, Bishop Hiiboro Kussala said that despite the bad history that country has gone through there is still hope for growth and peace. \n\u201cSouth Sudan is a blessed land. It is resourcefully rich above the ground and below the ground. God and nature have given us enough to make all of us rich and prosperous. But despite all these blessings we have a wounded history and we must move on,\u201d Fides News Agency quoted the prelate as saying. \nSouth Sudan achieved her independence in 2011 after decades of civil war against the Sudanese regime. \nAfter the separation from Khartoum, in December 2013 civil conflict broke out between President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and millions of internally displaced persons and refugees abroad. \nBishop Kussala further called on the government to focus on young people, by giving them better education and quality professional formation. \n\u201cIt is also necessary that the States of the South Sudanese Federation create common economic projects and cross-border peace initiatives. Invest in Young people through good education, Invest in hope, invest in peace. Peace is possible because it is the only way,\u201d he said. \nThe Conference was organized by the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (JMEC), in collaboration with the Interfaith Council for Peace Initiative, the body the Catholic Church belongs to, in order to promote peace. \nJMEC is responsible for monitoring and supervising the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, ARCSS, signed in 2015, under the auspices of the IGAD (economic and political community formed by Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda).

and President Donald Trump at the Pentagon following a meeting of the National Security Council in Washington, D.C., July 20, 2017. (DOD/U.S. Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Dominique A. Pineiro) Military.com   6 Dec 2017   By Richard Sisk President Donald Trump  declared U.S. recognition of Jerusalem  as Israel's political capital Wednesday and pledged to move the U.S. Embassy there eventually despite the concerns of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that the move could trigger violence in the region and put U.S. troops at risk. Both Mattis and Secretary State Rex Tillerson laid out their views to Trump at a White House meeting last week, Defense and State Department officials said. As he returned to Washington from a five-day trip to the Mideast and South Asia Tuesday, Mattis told reporters that the discussions on Jerusalem \"went on for some time.\" He declined to characterize what he told Trump. \"As always, my advice to the president I keep confidential.\" However, Mattis said, \"I gave to the president what I thought. You have to look at the world in different parts and pieces too. So, as you do that, you have to have a lot of information. I collected the information. I made my recommendation, and I'll just leave it at that.\" In his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Mattis firmly declared that Tel Aviv was the capital of Israel. He also said he backed a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \"The capital of Israel that I go to, sir, is Tel Aviv, sir, because that's where all their government people are,\" Mattis said in response to questions on whether Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital by the movement of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem was a matter for the Secretary of State, Mattis said at the time. Ahead of Trump's announcement Wednesday, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip burned U.S. flags and photos of Trump. In Amman, members of the Jordanian parliament protested at the U.S. Embassy. At the Pentagon,  Army  Col. Rob Manning, a spokesman, said that the Defense Department was working with the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security to guard against threats to U.S. Embassies worldwide. \"We are protecting our embassies\" with bolstered Marine guard security and Marine FAST teams [Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Teams) on alert, he said. Without giving specifics, Manning also said the department was taking additional \"steps to mitigate\" the potential risk. \"We're always postured for a range of threats,\" he said. Manning added he was \"not aware of any specific order\" to U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan to take precautions in the event of repercussions from Trump's declaration, which has drawn widespread condemnation in the region as an affront to Muslims. In response to questions on the FAST teams, Lt. Col. Mike Andrews, a Pentagon spokesman, said, \"Due to operational security, I won't get into specifics, but the Department of Defense takes necessary steps to mitigate threats to U.S. personnel and interests around the world.\" In his White House address, Trump said recognizing Jerusalem as the capital was \"the right thing to do,\" and he criticized his predecessors -- Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama -- for failing to make the move previously. \"Some say they lacked courage,\" Trump said, \"but they made their best judgments based on the facts as they understood them at the time.\" \"Today, we finally acknowledge the obvious -- that Jerusalem is Israel's capital,\" the president said. \"This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do.\" Trump stressed \"this decision is not intended in any way to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement.\" He made no mention of Palestinian hopes to have their capital in East Jerusalem. In his own address following Trump's, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas warned the Jerusalem declaration could encourage \"extremist organizations to wage a religious war that would harm the entire region, which is going through critical moments and would lead us into wars that will never end, which we have warned about and always urged to fight against.\" Trump's action drew a mixed response on Capitol Hill. Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the move \"another diplomatic blunder and unforced error by President Trump.\" He said that Trump\u2019s Jerusalem statements \"could trigger a backlash against Israel and American interests and personnel overseas.\" Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, a SASC member, said Trump was only \"following through on a promise made by many U.S. presidents in the past.\" Later Wednesday, the White House issued a presidential proclamation on Trump's earlier action: \"The foreign policy of the United States is grounded in principled realism, which begins with an honest acknowledgement of plain facts.\" \"With respect to the state of Israel, that requires officially recognizing Jerusalem as its capital and relocating the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem as soon as practicable.\" In a background briefing Tuesday night, White House officials, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said that arrangements to move the embassy to Jerusalem could take several year s. -- Richard Sisk can be reached at  Richard.Sisk@Military.com . https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/12/06/mattis-warned-recognition-jerusalem-capital-could-spur-unrest.html ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim mattis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike andrews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob manning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mattis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joni ernst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george w. bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard sisk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominique a. pineiro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mattis warned recognition of jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate armed services committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense and state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of defense", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sasc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bureau of diplomatic security", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "r-iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-rhode island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:05.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "069e58973eaa7523856a557be734af8999ccba44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxaSOncmrE4j_A--", "site_full": "forums.moneysavingexpert.com", "site": "moneysavingexpert.com", "site_section": "http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.php?f=167", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Work &amp; Benefits - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "title": "Thoughts on Boom25?", "title_full": "Thoughts on Boom25?
