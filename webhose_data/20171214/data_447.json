This means that both Sizwe and Klipriver taxi associations will not operate during the said period.\" \nThe suspension comes into effect from Thursday. \nALSO READ: KZN community up in arms after taxi conductor beaten to death \nKaunda said the decision had not been an easy one to make as the department recognised the fact that it would negatively affect the \"mostly innocent, working class commuters, who rely on taxis for their daily travel to school, to clinics, to work, and to town\". \nHe said commuters did not deserve to go through their days uncertain whether their loved ones would make it back home alive. He condemned the disregard for human life displayed by taxi operators \"who should be valuing the lives of their customers in the first instance, because it is from them that they as operators owe their livelihoods\". \nHe said the decision to suspend the taxi associations could only be reviewed once there was a tangible, workable plan between the two associations, which would assure government that the conflict would come to an end and commuters would feel safe again.

But if you are wearing a hijab and express your religious identity, you get a different reaction,\" she told Al Jazeera.\n\"My family members had such a good reaction to my decision though that I didn't pay much attention to the outsiders.\"\nHurie was overwhelmed by her family's support for her decision on wearing the headscarf [Courtesy of Beso Gvenetadze] With a nervous giggle, she said typical behaviour from strangers ranged from surprise and judgemental looks to swearing by men and cursing by women.\nHurie gets less of this treatment in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, than in Batumi, the administrative capital of her native Adjara.\n\"That's probably because there are more Muslims in Batumi. They seem to think that we are stripping away their national identity. It is associated with losing the Georgian identity,\" she said.\n\"Generally Christianity is always equated with the Georgian identity so the more Muslims there are, the more risk of losing the Georgian identity, according to them.\"\nHurie thinks the only way to confront this is by Muslims becoming more visible in society, and she called on her fellow headscarf-wearing citizens to be active.\nTo influence positive change, she recently participated in public discussions on the topic and cooperated with the Tolerance and Diversity Institute (TDI) - a non-governmental organisation based in Tbilisi.\nTDI commissioned a short video about Hurie's life as part of a project, implemented in the framework of United States Agency for International Development (USAID), to promote tolerance through stories of people with different ethnic and religious backgrounds.\nEka Chitanava, TDI's director, told Al Jazeera that a lack of knowledge created space for myths about other faiths.\n\"TDI's research has shown that the religious diversity is portrayed negatively in Georgia's school textbooks. For example, Muslims are equated to invaders without following up by explanations of the [historical] context,\" she said.\n\"The contributions to the Georgian culture by other religious groups or their representatives are often not mentioned. Also, the fact that religious officials of Orthodox Christian and other faiths used to have strong cooperation and good relations between each other is often missed.\"\nThat cooperation and tolerance was broken by the totalitarian system of the Soviet Union and then continued by inertia, she said.\n\"We still haven't found a way out of the Soviet influence. Step by step, we must come out of it by providing more information to especially the young generation so that the ethnical and religious diversity is seen in a positive light and not as a risk of losing our national identity.\"\n'I returned to my ancestors' religion' Despite their parents' objections, some young ethnic Georgian Muslims who were born or grew up after independence, are choosing Orthodox Christianity over Islam.\nThey see it as a correction of a historical wrong, referring to Adjara's population adopting Islam during the Ottoman Empire's rule over the region.\n\"I decided to get baptised when I became a university student, when I looked deeper into our history,\" Mikheil Nakashidze, a 35-year-old lawyer from Adjara, told Al Jazeera.\n\"Georgia was one of the first countries where Christianity was spread and it happened exactly through Adjara, so I decided to return to my ancestors' religion.\"\nHe also said he converted because he could not read Arabic, so was praying in a language he could not understand.\nHis mother, a practising Muslim, was hurt and did not speak to him for three days.\n\"But later she made up with me and told me that there was only one God and it did not matter in which way I believed in Him or served Him,\" said Nakashidze\nThe Jumah mosque is Tbilisi's only Muslim house of worship [David Mdzinarishvili/Reuters] Tariel Nakaidze, the head of Georgian Muslims Union, told Al Jazeera that there are currently between 300,000 and 350,000 Muslims in the country.\nBut out of all big cities, there was only one mosque in Tbilisi and one more in Batumi.\nTbilisi's Jumah mosque is shared by Sunnis and Shia because Soviets destroyed the Shia's house of worship decades ago - it was never rebuilt.\nBatumi's Orta Jami is not big enough to accommodate the Friday congregation; some worshippers offer prayers outside in the rain and snow, according to Nakaidze.\nTalk of a new mosque in the city started more than 20 years ago, he said.\nIn 2015, a group set up by the Georgian Muslims Union aimed to secure a government permit to build a new mosque.\nAfter receiving a verbal green light from the mayor's office, the Union bought a plot of 3,000 square metres with contributions from the Muslim community, according to Nakaidze.\nBut the permit never came. A rejection letter arrived with an excuse that the location was not suitable for the mosque, prompting a legal case by the Union.\nThe new mosque opened without a building [Courtesy of Tariel Nakaidze] \"To protest the decision, we opened the mosque in open air on May 26, Georgia's independence day, and we have not stopped performing prayers there since then.\n\"We built a little hut-like structure to protect people from the rain and the authorities issued a penalty for it but we are not going to pay anything,\" he said.\n\"The authorities don't say it out loud of course, but in closed-door discussions they mention that they don't want to upset the Christian community and that's why they are not ready to give the permit. But we are still hopeful that we will reach our goal through court.\n\"We see this struggle as the struggle for real democracy. Neither a Christian, nor a Muslim has the right to stay in the way of the democratic development of Georgia, so in this case we have a civil obligation to see it through that this mosque, which now became a symbol of democracy, is built,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Hurie remains hopeful.\n\"I took a university coursemate with me to the presentation of the film [about me],\" she said.\n\"She was surprised to learn that there were people out there who reacted to me in such a negative way.

We were going swimming.  In can still sense the excitement, the \u201ccan hardly wait\u201d anticipation. These were the days of owning the world, of simply being. \nAnd we arrived at the Y.  Out of the bus, running through the cold, keeping up with the speed of each other, and into the sounds and wet warmth of the building.  I can smell the pool.  I hear it echo to us as we tore off our parkas and boots \u2013 shirts and pants flying.  We were naked as the day we were born.  No suits for us today, not when we were about to plunge into the waters of the \u201cBoys Only\u201d pool. \nI can still feel it.  The event we had been waiting for since it was announced by our teacher 5 weeks before.  All there was to do now was run.  And run we did, flying into the water.  I guess we never heard the commands to slow down, to wait for the person in charge, or to walk around to the other end of the pool where the depth was a reasonable three feet. \nI couldn\u2019t swim and was instantly under the heaviness of water at the deep end of the pool.  I knew I was drowning.  I had heard that one would surface three times.  After the third gasp above water, down I would go , never to surface again. \nBoy, was I scared!  I surfaced for the first time.  It was bright and noisy.  I thought of yelling for help, but could not.  Something inside stopped me.  I sank again and resurfaced.  Once more I thought it wise to yell \u201cHELP\u201d but could not.  They also say that on the third time under you will see your life pass before your eyes.  And, indeed, mine did.  This short life, only 10 years, did not take long to pass. It didn\u2019t have much to say.  I committed to yell for help on this, the third rising. \nJust then, I felt a curved hooking devise around my belly, lifting me clear out of the water and placing me gently on the side of the pool.  On that memorable day, I never had a chance to face my resolve to finally ask for help.  Yet still, in these last 45 years of life, I have needed the help of others so often and asked for it so seldom.  But I have always felt the hand of God curves gently around me and holding me securely, placing me on the side, out of harms way. \nIf you need help, never be ashamed or afraid to ask for it.  But know that GOD is always there, and surely He\u2019s got your back! \nSisters and brothers, be continually blessed , and please (above all else) MAKE SURE YOU ARE READY TO MEET OUR SOON COMING KING.

As more people shoot pictures and videos from consumer drones, researchers in Singapore have found a way round the frustrating task of framing and taking photos while manually piloting the craft. More than 2.8 million consumer drones are expected to be sold this year, up from 2 million last year, says research firm Gartner. Most carry some kind of camera. \u201cWe want to enable more intuitive and natural interaction with the flying drone to take photos autonomously \u2014 even for the novice user who has not used drones before,\u201d said Ziquan Lan, one of four researchers behind the project. Their innovation, called XPose, works in several stages. The user tells the drone to take photographs from different angles of the subject, such as a statue. Next, the shot is composed by moving objects on photos from a sample gallery. Then the drone finds the best position to take the commissioned photo. No manual piloting of the drone is needed. The researchers from the National University of Singapore said their prototype, based on a Parrot Bebop quadcopter, relies mainly on a single monocular camera and works reliably even when there is no GPS signal. Some remotely controlled drones take their cue from global positioning system satellites, or GPS, which requires the drone pilot to know where the image is in respect to the drone, adding another layer of complexity to the process. But XPose does away with that. The researchers said it had a higher success rate in photo-taking tasks than the usual touchscreen joystick interface. \u201cDrones will be even smaller (than they are now) so we can carry them around as a smartphone camera, throw it in the air and take photos for us,\u201d Lan said, as he outlined his vision of the future. But the problem is a thorny one, he said, adding that he and fellow researchers Mohit Shridhar, David Hsu and Shengdong Zhao went through dozens of methods and environments to evolve a working prototype. Several companies are working to simplify how users take airborne pictures and videos. A US-based startup, Skydio, which aims for \u201cflying cameras without the complexity,\u201d is working on a drone that follows its operator using onboard cameras to capture a 360-degree view of its environs. Another firm, Squadrone System, offers an \u201cautonomous flying camera\u201d called HexoPlus for $1,000. A user can program it via a smartphone app with simple instructions, such as \u201cfollow\u201d or \u201chover close.\u201d For $700, the Mota Group offers the Lily Next-Gen camera drone that flies itself and hovers above the user, taking photos and video.

Academic Editors: Gou-Jen Wang and Liang Luo Received: 23 September 2017 / Revised: 16 November 2017 / Accepted: 28 November 2017 / Published: 7 December 2017 No Abstract Hinge-based Ankle Foot Orthosis (HAFO) is one of the most common non-surgical solutions for the foot drop. In conventional HAFOs, the ankle joint is almost locked, and plantar flexion is restricted due to the high stiffness of the hinge mechanism. This often leads to a rigid walking gate cycle, poor muscle activity, and muscle atrophy. Since the ankle torque-angle loop has a non-linear profile, the use of a superelastic NiTi spring within the hinge, due to its nonlinear behavior, could recreate a close-to-normal stiffness of the normal ankle joint, which, in turn, could create a more natural walk. The focus of this study is to evaluate the performance of a superelastic NiTi spring versus a conventional Stainless Steel spring in a hinge mechanism of a custom-fit HAFO. To this aim, a custom-fit HAFO was fabricated via the fast casting technique. Then, motion analysis was performed for two healthy subjects (Case I and Case II): (i) subjects with bare foot; (ii) subjects wearing a conventional HAFO with no spring; (iii) subjects wearing a conventional Stainless Steel-based HAFO; and (iv) subjects wearing a NiTi spring-based HAFO. The data related to the ankle angle and the amount of moment applied to the ankle during walking were recorded using Cortex software and used for the evaluations. Finally, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was performed to evaluate the safety of the designed HAFO. The NiTi spring offers a higher range of motion (7.9 versus 4.14 degree) and an increased level of moment (0.55 versus 0.36 N\u00b7m/kg). Furthermore, a NiTi spring offers an ankle torque-angle loop closer to that of the healthy subjects.

By Lee Hellwing. Published: 09:45 Thursday 07 December 2017 \nSoldiers completed one the \u2018toughest challenges they have ever done\u2019 at Rutland Water yesterday (December 6). \nThirty-six troops from the Princess of Wales\u2019s Royal Regiment, which moved to Kendrew Barracks from Cyprus in the summer, ran and walked almost 19 miles around the reservoir - carrying 15kg of kit. \nThe brave soldiers decided to complete the \u2018loaded march\u2019 in teams to engage with the community and raise cash for SSAFA - the Armed Forces Charity, which supports serving troops and veterans of the Army. \nAlthough troops, who completed the arduous slog proudly wearing red SSAFA t-shirts under their uniforms, had completed loaded marches in the past - most had most had not done one longer than 8 miles. \nCorporal Sarah Hamer, of the regiment, said:\u201cThis is the toughest thing some of them have ever done. \n\u201cSome of them have come straight from training or straight from Cyprus. \n\u201cThis challenge is out of their comfort zone, for them to train in this weather is strange.\u201d \nTroops treated the challenge as a competition with the winning team completing it in four hours and seven minutes. \nLance Corporal Oliver Whiteman, who was part of the team which emerged victorious, said afterwards: \u201cThey can hold their heads high within the company - they have come in with a decent time. \n\u201cMy legs are cramping and aching. We did the first eight miles in an hour-and-a-half - we flew a little bit. From 12 miles to the finish line is when the cramp started to set in. \n\u201cSome of these blokes have never seen the water before. We have seen some local people on the way around. \n\u201cIt is good to get out and about and do something for charity.\u201d \nAlthough the troops were being pushed to the limit, many completed the Army\u2019s annual fitness test recently - which is an eight-mile loaded march carrying 20kg of kit - which helped them prepare. \nThe arduous challenge was completed at Rutland Water as the troops, who are part of the Regiment\u2019s C Company, wanted to engage with the local community having just completed their move from abroad. \nSSAFA is also a charity which is very dear to their heart as it allows them to support their fellow servicemen and women. \n\u201cIt is a good charity to raise money for and it is quite relative to the job,\u201d Corporal Hamer said. \n\u201cIt is a great way for them to work together and in extreme conditions. It also acted as a training exercise designed to get them used to the British weather. \n\u201cSSAFA is a good charity to raise money for and it is quite relative to the job. \n\u201cIt gives them a bit of a feel for where they live and work and lets people know in the area we are there.\u201d \nThe troops completed the challenge in six teams made up of six soldiers. \nThe start and finish point of the loaded march was Normanton car park. \nTroops are aiming to raise \u00a32,500 for the charity.. \nIf you would like to make a donation visit www.justgiving.com/fundraising/chris-boult1   Soldiers complete tough challenge Star Wars spacecraft on display in Burghley Park Consultation on ward boundary changes in Rutland starts today Motorist injured in two vehicle crash Follow Us On", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sarah hamer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee hellwing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lance corporal oliver white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corby glen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "armed forces charity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rutland times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kendrew barracks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ssafa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal regiment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "c company", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cyprus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rutland water", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "normanton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burghley park police", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:27.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a751a0144395a1c662da86214bae37fd115e51bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6aoitnkY7ao1AllybxsJqTKh9OUC.ZHy.0Vgeaf0Clg4gKKYboVq9_J51T07JuDHBywgyQDM_cpyvZN.vkS6A9MMaVAc3bM.tLRA.Yr36K4JK22x2Oje5W5qH0rJt0lM-", "site_full": "www.reviewcentre.com", "site": "reviewcentre.com", "site_section": "https://www.reviewcentre.com/Dentists/Dental-Departures-www-dentaldepartures-com-reviews_1413026", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "computer_reviews", "tech"], "section_title": "Dental Departures Reviews - www.dentaldepartures.com | Dentists | Review Centre", "title": "dental clinics", "title_full": "Dental Departures - www.dentaldepartures.com Review | dental clinics", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.reviewcentre.com/cms//images/184/068/2/Dental-Departures-jpg-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 37825, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a751a0144395a1c662da86214bae37fd115e51bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6aoitnkY7ao1AllybxsJqTKh9OUC.ZHy.0Vgeaf0Clg4gKKYboVq9_J51T07JuDHBywgyQDM_cpyvZN.vkS6A9MMaVAc3bM.tLRA.Yr36K4JK22x2Oje5W5qH0rJt0lM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "January", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "dental clinics", "text": "The person I dealt with was great at keeping me informed and I am still waiting to hear from the clinic in Mexico City.

There are nearly 50 million Americans currently living in poverty and struggling to provide a warm coat for themselves or their families. One Warm Coat\u2019s program helps us keep all of the coats we collect in this community, which will make a big difference for our neighbors who need warmth this winter,\u201d said Coat Drive Ambassador and Marketing Manager, Alexandra Lazarou.\nHave a coat you want to donate? Visit https://www.onewarmcoat.org/deliver/ to find a drop-off location near you. If you want $50 off driver\u2019s education, simply snap a selfie with the coat you\u2019re donating while you\u2019re at the coat drop-off, share it on social media with All Star Driver Education using hashtag #IGaveAllStarWarmth or through direct message.\nThose who do not have a coat to donate can still get involved:\n\u00b7 Donate to the drive on this page: https://www.onewarmcoat.org/coat-drive-details/?e=a0Z34 AUCJW\n\u00b7 Or text \u201cWARM\u201d to 80100 to donate $10 to One Warm Coat\nAll All Star Driver Education customers who donate coats or dollars will receive a $50 coupon off driver\u2019s education courses $299 or above. This can be redeemed by taking a selfie with your coat donation (mentioned above) or emailing alex@allstarde.com with your donation receipt.\nEach year, hundreds of thousands of gently worn coats are distributed across North America to children, women and men in need through One Warm Coat\u2019s Coat Drive program. \u201cWe are so grateful for our partners like All Star Driver Education! It is because of our incredible volunteers that we have been around for 25 years, helping get coats to our neighbors who need them. Thanks to All Star\u2019s efforts, many people in this community will have a much warmer winter,\u201d commented Jennifer Stockard, President and Chief Executive Officer of One Warm Coat.\nOne Warm Coat is a national non-profit organization that works to provide a free, warm coat to any person in need and raises awareness of the vital need for warm coats. One Warm Coat supports individuals, groups, companies and organizations across the country by providing the tools and resources needed to hold a successful coat drive. Coats are distributed in the communities where they were collected, to any person in need, without charge, discrimination or obligation. Over the past 25 years, One Warm Coat has worked with its volunteers to give away nearly 5 million coats.\nwww.onewarmcoat.org\nwww.allstarde.com\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/allstarde\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/allstarde", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.onewarmcoat.org/coat-drive-details/?e=a0Z3400000AUCJW", "https://www.onewarmcoat.org/deliver/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ann arbor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer stockard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandra lazarou", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "star driver education seeks coat donations all star driver education seeks coat donations all star driver education", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "all star", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "all star driver education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "one warm coat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "one warm coat all all star driver education", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:27.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a93e8fdb042c793ea40f25c7f821bfadf5f1217", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCp6nL9Cvsko_oFOrdDwiLVrQp89lKzHEpq0a_cNkIeXgmSo6lggP1p4ZIYnHQsrCEMbZRfUEFqH1lCqbXaIA2rdMDMZw_Nr3t8-", "site_full": "bmt7.vn", "site": "bmt7.vn", "site_section": "http://bmt7.vn/forum/forumdisplay.php/13-\u0110i\u1ec7n-tho\u1ea1i-Mobile?s=e77fe1b77c257ac36850c03550156b7e", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "\u0110i\u1ec7n tho\u1ea1i/Mobile", "title": "Nhi\u1ec1u lo\u1ea1i \u0110T c\u1ea7n mua ip 5 + 5c lock v\u00e0 oppo f1", "title_full": "Nhi\u1ec1u lo\u1ea1i \u0110T c\u1ea7n mua ip 5 + 5c lock v\u00e0 oppo f1", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://bmt7.vn/forum/bmt7face.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a93e8fdb042c793ea40f25c7f821bfadf5f1217", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCp6nL9Cvsko_oFOrdDwiLVrQp89lKzHEpq0a_cNkIeXgmSo6lggP1p4ZIYnHQsrCEMbZRfUEFqH1lCqbXaIA2rdMDMZw_Nr3t8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "phuctai1510", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "Nhi\u1ec1u lo\u1ea1i \u0110T c\u1ea7n mua ip 5 + 5c lock v\u00e0 oppo f1", "text": "c\u1ea7n mua ip 5 + 5c lock v\u00e0 oppo f1\nLh : 0901903459\nzalo : 01869052686\nFB : https://www.facebook.com/phuctairm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/phuctairm"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:27.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6772085a84c3d0855662d845d3228377c7e6597d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeFJj5RZ7biGEFK7vLBhdBc5S6t8eWWRmrwNQ4XaaoTn4tdDWzUCqxWzYDbTcrRze6xQLZDhEscMBllxiRZi7RDNCjzMS15FPfcihtEtA7QXYOeq2e_qG_LrCWzrTDL6M-", "site_full": "www.deseretnews.com", "site": "deseretnews.com", "site_section": "http://deseretnews.com/utah/index.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Utah News | Deseret News", "title": "Utah governor calls Steve Bannon a 'Mormon bigot'", "title_full": "Utah governor calls Steve Bannon a 'Mormon bigot' | Deseret News", "published": "2017-12-06T16:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 102, "participants_count": 86, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/7b76bc9846.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2973, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9ce8116dfbdaa1ac3d5a0ef47c084631e5f177bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeFJj5RZ7biGEFK7vLBhdBc5S6t8eWWRmrwNQ4XaaoTn4tdDWzUCqxWzYDbTcrRze6xQLZDhEscMBllxiRZi7RDNCjzMS15FPfcihtEtA7QXYOeq2e_qG_YZv6jjC0q.Jj0ihIHBA0mA--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "ToddWorley", "published": "2017-12-06T17:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "A vote for Trump is a vote for Bannon.

Received: 13 October 2017 / Revised: 26 November 2017 / Accepted: 30 November 2017 / Published: 7 December 2017 No Abstract Ecosystem deterioration has been and is still a serious threat to human survival and regional economic development. Theoretical and methodological challenges exist in assessing ecological risk of watershed ecosystem that is imposed by natural changes or human activities. To fill this research gap, this research proposes an interdisciplinary and quantitative methodology based on some techniques such as the Procedure for Ecological Tiered Assessment of Risk (PETAR), the Entropy, and the Celluar Automata Markov (CA-Markov). We focused on six vulnerable environmental variables, namely land-use change, water quantity, water quality, gross domestic product (GDP), environmental pollutants, and soil erosion in the Huai River watershed in the Henan Province in order to build multi-dimensional quantitative method. Further, the Coupling Coordination Degree Model is constructed, and the \u201cthreshold index\u201d is also addressed to reflect the limitation of ecological risk. Our results show that the spatio-temperal distribution of the eco-environmental quality has greatly varied across this study area during different time spans. Natural eco-environmental quality has moderately degraded in 70% of this study area (mainly agricultural region), at a prefectural level from 2000 to 2010, and has slightly improved over the agricultural region (<170 m above sea level) during 2010\u20132015. However, when considering negative stressors from human social system on the natural ecosystem, the extent and distribution of the ecological risk varied across the whole area during 2000\u20132015. The results show that there was almost 90.40% of this region under the ecological risk, with varying extents over the study time, e.g., Kaifeng, Shangqiu, Xuchang, and Xinyang, with a moderate deterioration in the eco-environmental quality, and Zhengzhou with a slight deterioration in the eco-environmental quality. This paper provides a valuable perspective for governments at all levels to manage watershed environment resources.

Among the more than 60 indicators which go into making up the index you\u2019ll find \u201cagricultural diversification\u201d (the share of total agricultural production represented by the top 3 crops) and something called \u201cenvironmental biodiversity.\u201d This last turns out to be the \u201cProportion of local breeds classified as being at risk of extinction\u201d which of course is SDG Indicator 2.5.2 , as we saw yesterday .

This study aimed to determine if form of this supplementary diet (pelleted vs. extruded) or composition (muesli) had an effect on the diets total tract digestibility and cecal fermentation patterns. Rabbits had slightly higher intake when fed extruded and pelleted diets compared to muesli. Digestibility results were inconsistent between estimation methods. The extruded diet was more digestible than pelleted according to the total collection digestibility method, but according to internal marker acid insoluble ash the pelleted diet was the most digestible. Both the extruded and pelleted diet had similar fermentation patterns,with lower cecal pHand greater proportions of butyrate. Our findings suggest that diet composition, rather than form, may have a greater impact on nutrient utilization by rabbits. Abstract Fifteen New Zealand rabbits were randomly assigned to one of 3 dietary treatment groups of 5 animals each and fed pelleted, extruded, or muesli diets in a completely randomized design experiment. Rabbits were placed in individual cages with ad libitum access to water and food for 45 days acclimation followed by 30 days experimental period. Feed intake of rabbits fed pelleted and extruded diets was greater ( p < 0.05) than rabbits fed the muesli diet (125.6 and 130.4 vs. 91.9 g/d), but weight change and feed efficiency were not affected by treatment. Diet digestibility among the treatments was inconsistent when comparing results obtained from total fecal collection and AIA (please define) as an internal marker. Rabbits fed extruded and pelleted diets had lower ( p < 0.05) cecal pH (6.42 and 6.38 vs. 7.02, respectively), and higher ( p < 0.05) production of SCFA (18.5 and 19.0 vs. 11.7 mM, respectively) than those fed muesli. The fermentation products from rabbits fed pelleted and extruded diets had a greater proportion of butyrate and less propionate than rabbits fed muesli. The results of this study indicate that the basal dietary composition had a greater impact on diet utilization and cecal fermentation than food form.

The male lions are exceptional amongst other feline family due to their thick and intimidating manes which surround their necks. \nAccording to the National Geographic, the roar of a mature-adult lion which can be horrifying and frightening can be heard 8 kilometers away. \nLions are found in major natural parks in Eastern Africa and parts of Central Africa and India. The notable parks are the magnificent Serengeti National Park and Krugar National Park. Likewise, in Nigeria, the Kainji Lake National Park and Yankari Games Reserve are the two reserves with few of the remaining lions in West Africa. \nSome of the several facts about Lions are listed below. Lions live in groups called prides, which comprise of related lionesses and their dependent offspring along with two or three unrelated males. As soon as the dependent young lion becomes independent, he may decide to form its own pride. A male lion weighs about 226 kilograms, which is about the weight of 4 adult humans. Lions live in grasslands and plains and not the jungle or rain forest as usually depicted. Lionesses are in charge of hunting while the male lions stay home and watch over the pride. A baby lion is called a cub or a lionet. If a lion misses its target on the first run, it usually abandons the chase. Lions can survive for long periods without water, getting much of what they need from the moisture content of their prey. Lionesses with their female cubs live together for life while the male cubs must venture out on their own once they reach maturity. Lions are the only member of the feline family with manes which makes them appear larger and more intimidating. Some countries make use of the lion symbol in their emblem. Countries like Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, England, Ethiopia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Singapore all regard the lion as their national symbol. Brands like Peugeot, Lions club, MGM Studios, Lonsdale, Premier League also make use of the Lion emblem. Lions are regarded as vulnerable in the conservation status of the International Union of Conservation of Nature. There are lists of lion movies as well. Movies like: Lion King, the Ghost and the Darkness, the last lions, prey and African cats.

The M2 ion channel activity is not only essential for virus replication, but also involved in modulation of cellular homeostasis in a variety of ways. It is also the target for ion channel inhibitors, i.e., anti-influenza drugs. Thus far, several studies have been conducted to elucidate its biophysical characteristics, structure-function relationships of the ion channel, and the M2-host interactome. In this review, we discuss M2 protein synthesis and assembly into an ion channel, its roles in IAV replication, and the pathophysiological impact on the host cell.
