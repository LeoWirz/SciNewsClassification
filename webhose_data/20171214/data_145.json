of atezolizumab (Tecentriq), bevacizumab (Avastin), carboplatin, and paclitaxel delayed progression or death by 38% compared with bevacizumab and chemotherapy alone for patients with advanced non-squamous non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), according to findings from the phase III IMpower150 trial presented at the ESMO Immuno Oncology Congress.In the study, the atezolizumab regimen demonstrated a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 8.3 months compared with 6.8 months with bevacizumab and chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52-0.74; P <.0001). The 12-month PFS rate was 37% with the atezolizumab-containing regimen and 18% with the bevacizumab/chemotherapy regimen.In a preliminary examination of overall survival (OS), there was a 22.5% reduction in the risk of death with the atezolizumab combination compared with bevacizumab and chemotherapy alone. After a minimum follow-up of 9.5 months, the median OS was 14.4 (95% CI, 12.8-17.1) versus 19.2 months (95% CI, 16.8-26.1), in favor of the atezolizumab group (HR, 0.775; 95% CI, 0.619-0.970; P = .0262). The next OS analysis will take place in the first half of 2018. \u201cThis is the first phase III trial to report on the combination of chemotherapy, antiangiogenic treatment and immunotherapy as first line treatment for advanced non-squamous NSCLC,\u201d said lead author Martin Reck, MD, chief oncology physician, Department of Thoracic Oncology, Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf, Germany. \u201cThe trial met its co-primary endpoint of PFS and the preliminary results of the co-primary endpoint of overall survival, although immature, look encouraging.\u201dThe IMpower150 study enrolled 1202 patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC. Patients were randomized evenly to receive atezolizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (arm A), atezolizumab with bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (arm B), or bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (arm C). Those with known EGFR or ALK alterations were excluded from the study. Patients were also tested for a tumor T-effector gene expression signature.In the investigational arms, atezolizumab was administered at 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks and bevacizumab was given at 15 mg/kg. In each arm, carboplatin and paclitaxel were given on day 1 of each cycle for 4 to 6 cycles. In arm A, maintenance therapy was given with atezolizumab alone and in arm B patients received maintenance therapy with the combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab. In arm C, maintenance was given with bevacizumab alone.The median age of patients in the trial was 63 years and 60% were previous smokers. Overall, most patients were male and the ECOG performance status was 0 for 39% of patients in arm B and for 43% in arm C. The minimum follow-up at the time of the analysis was 9.5 months. For the interim analysis, the study was only designed to compare arms B and C.The objective response rate (ORR) in the atezolizumab arm was 64% compared with 48% in the bevacizumab/chemotherapy alone group. PD-L1 expression on immune and tumor cells did not appear to impact efficacy, as those testing negative for the marker still experienced an improvement in PFS with atezolizumab (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.99). However, there was a 50% reduction in the risk of progression or death with atezolizumab in those testing positive for PD-L1 on immune and tumor cells (IHC1/2/3; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39-0.64).\u201cThere was a significant and clinically relevant improvement in progression-free survival favoring the addition of atezolizumab to bevacizumab and chemotherapy,\" said Reck. \"The results show that there is a way to improve the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC.\"In the T-effector signature wild-type population, the addition of atezolizumab reduced the risk of progression or death by 49%. The median PFS was 11.3 months with the PD-L1 inhibitor versus 6.8 months with bevacizumab/chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38-0.68; P <.0001). The ORR in this group was 69% with atezolizumab compared with 54% without the PD-L1 inhibitor. The 12-month PFS rate was 18% with bevacizumab/chemotherapy and 46% with the addition of atezolizumab. Each of the agents showed similar toxicity profiles as in previous trials. Serious treatment-related adverse events were observed in 25.4% of patients treated with the atezolizumab regimen compared with 19.3% of those in the control arm. \"There were no new safety signals or toxicity issues with this combination so it appears to be a feasible approach for this group of patients,\" Reck noted. Preliminary findings were also presented for the comparison of arm A (atezolizumab plus chemotherapy without bevacizumab) with the control arm of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (arm C). In this analysis, there was not a benefit seen in PFS for atezolizumab (HR, 0.936; 95% CI, 0.787-1.112). Additionally, ORR was similar between the two groups (49% vs 48%). Data for this comparison continue to mature for OS.\u201cThis Tecentriq study is the first positive Phase III combination trial that showed a cancer immunotherapy reduced the risk of the disease getting worse when used as an initial treatment in a broad group of people with advanced non-squamous NSCLC,\u201d Sandra Horning, MD, chief medical officer and Head of Global Product Development at Roche, the company developing the drugs. \u201cThe IMpower150 study represents an important advance in lung cancer treatment, and we will submit these results to regulatory authorities around the world to potentially bring a new standard of care to people living with this disease as soon as possible.\u201d Atezolizumab is currently approved as a treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC following progression on a platinum-containing regimen. For lung cancer, bevacizumab is approved for patients with non-squamous NSCLC in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Several studies continue to assess atezolizumab as a treatment for patients with lung cancer as part of various combinations or as monotherapy. The PD-L1 inhibitor is being looked at with nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) and in combinations with pemetrexed and other chemotherapy agents. The combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab is being assessed in several solid tumors, with promising findings presented in renal cell carcinoma. Trial looking at this combination are currently ongoing. Reck M.

away this year. I know Donald Trump claims to have reinstated Christmas bigger and better than ever before. But this just outraged Marston Moretaine, who wanted to know when the US President will be bringing back Advent.\n\nSince Advent is a time of sober, reflective self-examination, the answer is clearly \"never\". But that's not stopping Marston from going to all places Christmassy and threatening them with terrible judgement from on high.\n\nThough he's not managed to explain to me how, if all Christmassy activities are banned before sunset on the 24th, he is planning to do his own Christmas shopping. But still, he's been out all night in Milton Keynes at some nightclub, shouting that they should be repenting, not dancing. Ironically it sounds like it was just him and the staff. Well, it's Wednesday. They're probably just glad he had to buy bottled water for his throat now and then.\n\nSo he's back now. He'll grab a couple of hours sleep and then he'll be off to denounce people in the \" Mall, Luton \". Like coming from Luton ain't bad enough already.\n\nBut we've left him some food on a plate in the fridge. Cold turkey, roasties and sprouts. Well, it was the Druids' Christmas Dinner last night. Wouldn't want him to miss out.\n\n\nWant a good laugh? Want to laugh at the church? Want to be secretly suspicious that the author has been sitting in your church committee meetings taking notes?

(If you prefer something handcrafted and more traditional, also check out our Omotenashi Selection Christmas gift guide .) Leather Jacket by Helmut Lang \nFilled with sharp-lined silhouettes and quiet color schemes, Helmut Lang debuted in the mid-1980s as one of fashion\u2019s first minimalist labels. Now, for the first time in Japan, the GINZA SIX branch combines both women\u2019s and men\u2019s fashion for a convenient one-stop shopping spree. We love their sleek leather jacket (\u00a595,000), which embodies the minimalistic vibe of the label, and comes with a hood for extra warmth. (If you\u2019re shopping for the man in your life, note that their menswear range is only available at the GINZA SIX and Aoyama branches.) Cashmere Coat by Ebure \nJapanese brand ebure offers high quality clothing, designed to make women feel they are blessed to be born a woman, and make life feel more fun \u2013 in the brand\u2019s own words. Their elegant pieces are aimed at sophisticated women who appreciate the finer things in life. When it started in 2016, the label launched a collection of 10 winter coats, which became their mainstay. For this coming winter, ebure has added a herringbone-patterned 100% cashmere luxury coat (\u00a5330,000), featuring a black lining that peeks in bursts as you move. Belt the high waist to create a beautifully feminine line, while all you\u2019ll feel is a warm and soft blanket wrapped around you. Messenger Bag by BELSTAFF \nEstablished in England in 1924, BELSTAFF is still rooted in the label\u2019s motorsports heritage. The collections are all about rugged elegance, with high-quality designs and structured cuts. Their waxed cotton jacket is a good example of their offerings, presenting a vintage-inspired design with a fabric that regulates according to the body and outside temperatures. Although BELSTAFF is mostly known for its leather jackets, we also recommend their Colonial messenger bag, the perfect daily companion thanks to its practical front pockets, available in sturdy cotton canvas (\u00a579,500 ) or luxurious leather (\u00a5112,500). Silk Scarf with Reindeer Motif by Okano \nIf you\u2019re in the market for a Japan-made, high-quality fashion item, OKANO is the place to visit at GINZA SIX.

While OKANO mostly produces kimono garments in partnership with craftspeople from various regions, the brand is also notable for its gorgeous silk scarves. For Christmas, OKANO has created a scarf (\u00a557,000) featuring a small reindeer pulling the label\u2019s ship logo like a sleigh. The scarf is adorned with snowflakes, making it a festive and seasonal must-have item. Tote Bag from By Malene Birger \nDanish brand By Malene Birger creates clothes that are modern and effortless to wear. Beautiful fabrics and intricate handcrafted details define each collection. The relaxed silhouettes are a good representation of the label\u2019s philosophy, which is to help women have the courage to live their own lives. The Arabian Flower motif became the brand\u2019s signature print after the brand\u2019s founder traveled around Morocco and was inspired by the patterned tiles and mats. The Gretah mini tote bag (\u00a527,000) featuring the flower motif comes in an array of colors that will suit every style. Apple-shaped Clock by UNDERCOVER \nFounded in 1990 by Jun Takahashi, UNDERCOVER is a Japanese fashion label known for its punk-infused streetwear styles.

If you\u2019re looking for a playful yet practical present this holiday season, the brand\u2019s apple-shaped clock (\u00a515,800), made by Medicom Toy, is undoubtedly the most stylish way to keep track of time. Bucket Bag by Converse Tokyo \nPretty much everyone at some point in their lives has owned a pair of Converse shoes: they\u2019re practical, popular, and never go out of style. The brand with the recognizable star logo has been around for over a century, and is still thriving today. For the upcoming holidays, Converse Tokyo has released a bucket-shaped bag (\u00a513,000) \u2013 FYI, the must-have bag style this season. It comes in black and features a playful fringe that sways as you sashay, shiny studs, and the signature star logo. You can safely fit all your daily belongings in there as it closes with a drawstring, and you can wear it as a shoulder bag or as a handbag.

Customers are invited to customize it, and we think it makes a unique present for your favorite fashionista.

The focus of this collection is luxury accessories such as high-quality bags and scarves featuring unique prints. Coveted items include the Geta sandals, inspired by traditional footwear worn by geisha, and the teardrop-shaped Y-Backpack (\u00a5108,000).

(MCC photo by Fidele Kyanza) \nDisplaced people who recently received food and shelter supplies distributed by Mennonite churches in the Kasai region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) have seen unimaginable horrors. \nInnoncente Ngandu Tshalu\u2019s husband was murdered by the local militia. Majilu Mulembo\u2019s house was burned down by another armed group. Monique Meta was forced to leave behind everything she owns, to run with nine children. \nAbout 1.4 million people from the Kasai region in south-central DR Congo fled ethnic and political violence that erupted in August 2016 between a local militia group, Kamuina Nsapu, and national security forces. An estimated 5,000 Mennonites are among those forced from their homes. \nTshalu, Mulembo, Meta and many other displaced people found safety near the town of Tshikapa, Kasai Province. They have been staying with strangers, in churches and anywhere else they can. \nOn Wednesday, Nov. 29, the Mennonite Church of Congo (Communaut\u00e9 Mennonite au Congo or CMCo) distributed one month\u2019s supply of flour, beans, oil, salt and sugar to 280 displaced households staying in Tshikapa. The church\u2019s local relief committee also provided soap and tarps, which serve as shelter from the rain or privacy within cramped, temporary living conditions. \n\u201cMany people don\u2019t have shelter, and some of them lost their fields. There are real dire situations, and many have lost everything they own,\u201d says Fidele Kyanza who, on behalf of Mennonite Central Committee (MCC), helped coordinate the distribution. \nThe week before, on Nov. 20, Kyanza also worked with Mennonite Brethren Church of Congo (Communaut\u00e9 des \u00c9glises de Fr\u00e8res Mennonites au Congo or CEFMC) to distribute the same supplies to 180 displaced families in the city of Kikwit in Kwilu Province. Food quantities were based on an average seven-member family. \nBoth distributions were coordinated in partnership with MCC and supported by numerous Mennonite organizations around the world. \nZacharie Mputu Lukadi, a CMCo elder and member of the local relief committee, says the distribution not only helps save lives, it gives people hope. \u201cNow people trust the church to help them.\u201d MCC and the Congolese Mennonite churches have been working on a response plan for several months. Security and logistical challenges along the way delayed the response until now. \nNevertheless, MCC\u2019s representative in DR Congo, Mulanda Jimmy Juma, says the assistance came at a crucial time and met needs that weren\u2019t being addressed by other organizations. \u201cMost displaced people are in very dire situations,\u201d he says. \u201cVery few organizations are providing assistance, despite the high level of need. In the name of Christ, MCC with other Anabaptist groups want to help meet the needs of these vulnerable people who are suffering because of the crisis in Kasai.\u201d \nKyanza says emergency food assistance also promotes peace between displaced people and host communities because there\u2019s less competition for limited resources. Displaced families can share with their hosts. \n\u201cMany times, a very poor family is receiving another very poor family into their home. When you give support and aid to those families, you give harmony and peace,\u201d he says. \nMajilu Mulembo says she will share the food that she and her seven children received with their host family. The distribution means that her children will have porridge and she will be able to eat three times a day instead of having a little food once or twice a day, says Mulembo, who is pregnant. \nOrganizations supporting this distribution include Africa Inter-Mennonite Mission; Caisse de Secours, the development arm of the French Mennonite Church; International Community of Mennonite Brethren; MB Mission; Mennonite Church Canada Witness; Mennonite Mission Network; Mennonite World Conference; and Swiss Mennonite Conference. \nThe urgent needs will continue, so MCC encourages ongoing donations.

Donations also can be given by phone at 888-563-4676. \nFor background, see: Congo crisis grinds on Photos: \nThese displaced families, who are staying in the Kikwit District of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, wait to receive a month\u2019s supply of food and non-food emergency assistance, including flour, beans, oil, sugar, salt, tarps and soap.

The report provides granular market segmentation analysis and forecasts for over 100 microbiology tests; profiles leading suppliers and recent market entrants with innovative technologies and products; reviews current instrumentation; evaluates emerging technologies; and offers specific opportunities and strategies for suppliers. Rationale This comprehensive report will assist diagnostics industry executives, as well as companies planning to diversify into the dynamic and rapidly expanding infectious disease testing market, in evaluating emerging opportunities and developing effective business strategies. The infectious disease testing is one of the most rapidly growing segments of the in vitro diagnostics industry, and the greatest challenge facing suppliers during this decade. Among the main driving forces is continuing spread of AIDS, which remains the world\u2019s major health threat and a key factor contributing to the rise of opportunistic infections; threat of bioterrorism; advances in molecular diagnostic technologies; and a wider availability of immunosuppressive drugs. Although for some infections the etiology is still a mystery, while for others the causative microorganisms are present in minute concentrations long before the occurrence of first clinical symptoms, recent advances in genetic engineering and detection technologies are creating exciting opportunities for highly sensitive, specific and cost-effective products.

Sciences doi: 10.3390/ijms18122644 \nAuthors: Yi-Huang Hsueh Kai-Yao Huang Sikhumbuzo Kunene Tzong-Yi Lee\nPoly-\u03b3-glutamic acid (\u03b3-PGA) is a biodegradable biopolymer produced by several bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis and other Bacillus species; it has good biocompatibility, is non-toxic, and has various potential biological applications in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and other industries. In this review, we have described the mechanisms of \u03b3-PGA synthesis and gene regulation, its role in fermentation, and the phylogenetic relationships among various pgsBCAE, a biosynthesis gene cluster of \u03b3-PGA, and pgdS, a degradation gene of \u03b3-PGA. We also discuss potential applications of \u03b3-PGA and highlight the established genetic recombinant bacterial strains that produce high levels of \u03b3-PGA, which can be useful for large-scale \u03b3-PGA production.\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2j2tC3s\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "phylogenetic relationshi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yi-huang hsueh kai-yao huang sikhumbuzo kunene", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fermentation  international journal of molecular sciences", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:26.043+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a8d8e346e801350829319a9bb293259b9fd0e13c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6aoitnkY7ap6zywIT8tCnYbT9V5HOkkfbfUbsfJTUQWwbaob_lrjVgcu56hjf7tnNf3GiGsbkTkUKu6dtAaH22T_6Rnfv9NXboiuq4uFXicBBAQHijVV_2C6NaPZ6JKE-", "site_full": "www.revitforum.org", "site": "revitforum.org", "site_section": "https://www.revitforum.org/architecture-general-revit-questions/", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "painting", "sports", "home_video_dvd", "tech", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "scuba_diving", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Architecture and General Revit Questions", "title": "Stacking walls & storey lines", "title_full": "Stacking walls & storey lines", "published": "2017-12-05T15:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a8d8e346e801350829319a9bb293259b9fd0e13c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6aoitnkY7ap6zywIT8tCnYbT9V5HOkkfbfUbsfJTUQWwbaob_lrjVgcu56hjf7tnNf3GiGsbkTkUKu6dtAaH22T_6Rnfv9NXboiuq4uFXicBBAQHijVV_2C6NaPZ6JKE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BLothian", "published": "2017-12-05T15:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Stacking walls & storey lines", "text": "I'm doing a bit of site massing modeling and for each building I am copying a single outline wall up using paste aligned to selected levels yet sometimes I get a solid horizontal line between, other times I don't.

The HTC U12 has been spotted online for the first time revealing few important specifications of the phone. According to Gizmochina , the 2018-flagship is rumored to keep up with the industry trend and flaunt a wide-screen display with bezel-less design and dual-camera setup at the rear. \nThe report further hints that the display is likely to feature a 4K resolution. To recap, the dual-camera setup will see a return to HTC after it was last seen on the HTC One M8 flagship smartphone that was launched in 2014. Apart from that, the HTC U12 is likely to flaunt an all-glass body. The smartphone is also expected to ditch the 3.5mm jack. \nHowever, we suggest you take this information with a pinch of salt as these are the initial rumors and nothing has been confirmed. \nTo recap, the HTC U11 comes with a 5.5-inch QHD display. The smartphone is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, under the hood paired with 6GB of RAM with 128GB of onboard storage. For photography, the HTC U11 sports a 12-megapixel rear camera with UltraPixel technology, 5-axis OIS, EIS and f/1.7 aperture. It supports 4K video recording with 360-degree sound recording. Up front, the HTC U11 comes with a 16-megapixel front-facing camera with 150-degree wide-angle lens. Also Read Google Pixel 2, Sony Xperia XZ1 to HTC U11+: 10 smartphones running on Android Oreo \nOn the software front, it runs on HTC Sense 9 based on Android Nougat 7.1 out-of-the-box, although the update to Android Oreo has already rolled out. It is powered by a 3,000mAh battery. The smartphone comes with IP57 certification for water and dust resistance.

Share     \nAn East Kilbride driving instructor has dubbed the Whirlies roundabout \u2018an accident waiting to happen.\u2019 \nBobby Russell of the Freedom School of Motoring has called for action as white lines on the busy roundabout fade away. \nHaving spotted a crash on the route recently, Bobby fears for public safety. \nAnd alongside several other instructors, concerns have been raised with route managers Scotland Transerv who have confirmed action will be taken in the coming weeks. \nBobby told the East Kilbride News : \u201cWith the amount of people that use the Whirlies, it\u2019s just an accident waiting to happen. \n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of politicians, the council and Transerv and nobody seems to want to take responsibility.

People cutting in and out of lanes because they don\u2019t know what one to stay in. I worry that it will take a bad accident for someone to take it as a serious issue.\u201d \nA Scotland Transerv spokesman told the News they were reviewing the situation. \nHe said: \u201cScotland Transerv is aware of the issue and has already planned a short programme of work that will take place in December, weather permitting.\u201d Like us on Facebook", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bobby russell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bobby", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "freedom school of motoring", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east kilbride news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "east kilbride", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland transerv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strathaven", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:27.059+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a4d2e5b5c03a465937d643712f3eda8a7fff67a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkceKC6105nW6t0AXZ.HeLtQrGq8BrUMnSsk9tVxlgUgwzYM4Gc6wk6cSZRspcCXqliTG7q8yqhe_xTJ7NhJewbKdSSRVSm_CCHd", "site_full": "www.expedia.com", "site": "expedia.com", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com/Corrales-Hotels.d10338.Travel-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Top 10 Hotels in Corrales, New Mexico $40 | Hotel Deals on Expedia", "title": "Motel 6 Albuquerque North:", "title_full": "Motel 6 Albuquerque North: 2017 Room Prices, Deals & Reviews | Expedia", "published": "2017-08-18T00:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 416, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1690e40bb73674f5ee03fd5287d4aeb0e910357e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkceKC6105nW6t0AXZ.HeLtQrGq8BrUMnSsk9tVxlgUgwzYM4Gc6wk6cSZRspcCXqliTG7q8yqhe_xTJ7NhJewbKdQb49EtpktEXqFktRzCNhIDH3vRJbNjG3ZrzbfNlDupZ", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-05T04:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "But very loud from other guest and cat in hallway meowing towels for one person instead of two for two guest", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 3.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:28.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0fb034b5359057eb52e3138c8af67eb4f1e03240", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCq4z4SmJq8yhQAZUTGhv_aY2XR97N5WGfoSBmEA0CUviM0u4WrTJ7ZAm3Jv6xHqXGPNDGY_EkXri4eL2HUzFp7E.kmoZpPTW9_fFiJXd8ZfP91V9zlqGXxu", "site_full": "beritaterhangat212.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://beritaterhangat212.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Beaking news", "title": "Video Hanna Anissa Yang Viral Beberapa Saat Yang Lalu", "title_full": "Video Hanna Anissa Yang Viral Beberapa Saat Yang Lalu", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ID", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0fb034b5359057eb52e3138c8af67eb4f1e03240", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCq4z4SmJq8yhQAZUTGhv_aY2XR97N5WGfoSBmEA0CUviM0u4WrTJ7ZAm3Jv6xHqXGPNDGY_EkXri4eL2HUzFp7E.kmoZpPTW9_fFiJXd8ZfP91V9zlqGXxu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Indah putria (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "Video Hanna Anissa Yang Viral Beberapa Saat Yang Lalu", "text": "\n5 Menit!

UBS ETF MSCI Canada GBPH A acc   1,680 shares   12.26 and high of 1322.6. What It Means To Invest In The UK \nOne of the fastest growing economies in Europe and in the world is that of the UK. It is swelling with extensive capacities to grow as a nation and contribute to the growth of the global economy. It is without a doubt that the UK provides domestic and international investors alike with countless opportunities to successfully trade and strengthen their financial positions at a crucial time. Equity Market in the UK \nIn the UK, the primary stock exchange is the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Meanwhile, the benchmark blue-chip index in the UK is the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 Index. \nThe LSE is the world\u2019s third largest stock exchange as it is Europe\u2019s largest stock exchange. Almost 2,300 stocks are presently listed on the LSE, bringing its overall market valuation to more than \u20186 trillion. It also boasts itself as one of the world\u2019s first stock exchanges, having been created in 1801. \nThe LSE operates under the supervision of the LSE Group, which had been created in October 2007 from the combination of the LSE and the Borsa Italiana. \nOn the other hand, the FTSE 100 weighs the 100 most actively traded stocks on the LSE as a free-float, market-capitalization-weighted index. It had been created on January 3, 1984 using 1,000 points as its base value. \nThe FTSE 100 operates under the supervision of an LSEG subsidiary, the FTSE Group. It represents roughly   valuation on the LSE. The FTSE 100 has an overall market valuation of roughly $1.70 trillion as of September. UBS ETF MSCI Canada GBPH A acc is a stock traded on the U.K\u2019s stock exchange. \nReviewing of the components of the FTSE 100 occurs four times a year. To be specific, it occurs on the first Wednesday after the first Friday of March and every succeeding three months thereafter. The components are regularly reviewed to make sure that they meet all conditions for inclusion in the FTSE 100. UBS ETF MSCI Canada GBPH A acc has relatively good liquidity. \nThe FTSE 100 is a competent indicator of the LSE. However, it is a weaker indicator of the UK economy than the FTSE 250, which weighs the 250 most actively traded stocks on the LSE. Such is the case for three reasons: 1) most of the components of the FTSE 100 are international stocks; 2) the FTSE 250 is more extensive than the FTSE 100 in terms of the number of components; and 3) most of the components of the FTSE 250 are domestic stocks. \nThe FTSE 100 had posted its all-time low of 427.50 points in February 1978. Upon recovery, the FTSE 100 had posted its all-time high of 7,103.98 points in April 2015. Meanwhile, in October, it had posted its best intraday high of 7,129 points. Trading in the UK \nThe regular session on the LSE starts at 8:00 a.m. and ends at 4:00 p.m. \nThe UK is consistently materializing its growth prospects. It boasts with meaningful potentials that can truly leverage growth opportunities\u2019 thanks to a healthy corporate environment that is viable for all kinds of investors. Because of this, many investors are flocking European equity markets, particularly that of the UK. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect UBS ETF MSCI Canada GBPH A acc.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

CMG2 promotes endothelial cell proliferation and exhibits angiogenic properties. Its downregulation is associated with a worsened survival of breast carcinoma patients. Aim of this study was to analyze the CMG2 mRNA and protein expression in soft tissue sarcoma and their association with patient outcome. CMG2 mRNA was measured in 121 tumor samples of soft tissue sarcoma patients using quantitative real-time PCR. CMG2 protein was evaluated in 52 tumor samples by ELISA. CMG2 mRNA was significantly correlated with the corresponding CMG2 protein expression (rs = 0.31; p = 0.027). CMG2 mRNA expression was associated with the mRNA expressions of several ECM and tissue remodeling enzymes, among them CD26 and components of the uPA system. Low CMG2 mRNA expression was correlated with a worsened patients' disease-specific survival in Kaplan-Meier analyses (mean patient survival was 25 vs. 96 months; p = 0.013), especially in high-stage tumors. A decreased CMG2 expression is a negative prognostic factor for soft tissue sarcoma patients. CMG2 may be an interesting candidate gene for the further exploration of soft tissue sarcoma genesis and progression.\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2kso1Ud\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas greither alice wedler swetlana rot jacqueline ke\u00dfler astrid kehlen hans-j\u00fcrgen holzhausen matthias bache peter w\u00fcrl helge taubert matthias kappler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elisa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "patients  international journal of molecular sciences", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:29.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ca302cc64c4d1e03a3a78804dfe7b5f9cff69947", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog60D4cOXotpoMFqlfvzVt4ssbhU59Vnpjfrh73CNbmhCxP16W6A8V5YU82jiqPE1EtOyay9xnHIrBwKFDEbK3T44-", "site_full": "community.sky.com", "site": "sky.com", "site_section": "http://community.sky.com/t5/Sky-VIP/bd-p/skyvip", "site_categories": ["science", "space_astronomy"], "section_title": "Sky VIP - Sky Community", "title": "Answered: Cancellation and VIP status", "title_full": "Answered: Cancellation and VIP status - Sky Community", "published": "2017-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 849, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5651fa243bcd3e1353611ec1640c7ede754f8d4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog60D4cOXotpoMFqlfvzVt4ssbhU59Vnpjfrh73CNbmhCxP16W6A8V5YU82jiqPE1EtOyay9xnHIrBOYGKMUzwlwK.LL50VqJpaA--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "caesarome", "published": "2017-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi @adamsh\nI would have thought that as long as you don't actually cancel your service then your VIP servoce will continue but if it runs out, even if for one day before you return to Sky then it will be reset.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:29.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d27c541b2f75edbeca5912c4595e5e140115eb19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRT8psTKd2vjtNRGLPnL8Qm8zdgb8Xw_XFz0jua59HsjyGl0Yxip_dkWbZ.MqaInkgDYqeA6vQvHuInSBZggGz4m1jowU3ehSEcnD61Uw7uND5099n2WeIXuTTrEXL3FqsSCUViZ6mHfPGdVQdvWx9g", "site_full": "www.clipper28.com", "site": "clipper28.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Awaiting death certificate, Peru woman kept dead child in family refrigerator; heres more", "title_full": "Awaiting death certificate, Peru woman kept dead child in family refrigerator; heres more", "published": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.194, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d27c541b2f75edbeca5912c4595e5e140115eb19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRT8psTKd2vjtNRGLPnL8Qm8zdgb8Xw_XFz0jua59HsjyGl0Yxip_dkWbZ.MqaInkgDYqeA6vQvHuInSBZggGz4m1jowU3ehSEcnD61Uw7uND5099n2WeIXuTTrEXL3FqsSCUViZ6mHfPGdVQdvWx9g", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "Awaiting death certificate, Peru woman kept dead child in family refrigerator; heres more", "text": "Awaiting death certificate, Peru woman kept dead child in family refrigerator; heres more Durgesh 1 min ago 0 2 Less than a minute Share Google+ Print Awaiting death certificate, Peru woman kept dead child in family refrigerator; heres more \nAwaiting death certificate, a woman in Peru was left with no option but to keep the body of her dead baby in a home based freezer. \nThis after the hospital told her to keep the body until she had a death certificate. \nWoman identified as Monica Palomino said her baby was born prematurely last Saturday after a gestation of only 25 weeks and died on Monday. \nBut under pressure from security personnel at Lima\u2019s Sergio Bernales hospital, she had to take the body home until she could begin the process of getting a death certificate. \nMeanwhile, the child\u2019s body remained in the freezer of the family refrigerator.

Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. \nI've had my fair share of beauty fails, including bad hair colours and dodgy piercings (think: accidental pumpkin orange hair and belly piercing at 16). Although it seems that my hair has reached adulthood , my spontaneous piercings still have a long way to go. \nThere weren't many intelligent thoughts going through my mind when I stepped into the piercing studio, particularly not the hassle that followed a nose piercing. I originally wanted to get my belly piercing redone (sorry mum), but they couldn't go through the scar tissue. So, I thought my nose was a great idea. If this was a movie, the narrator would follow by saying \"this was a very bad idea, indeed.\" \nAs it turns out, I recently had to remove my stud because it all went horribly wrong, and I can't even blame it on the piercer, because the studio I went to was the best in the area. No, this one is on me, myself, and I. So here are the things you need to know before getting that cute little stud in your nostril. And yes, you may read this and wonder why I was so stupid, but I know for a fact that I'm not alone. ADVERTISEMENT Choose the jewellery wisely \nDon't change the stud less than a week after getting it pierced like I did. It needs time (three months) to heal with the original stud, so choose your jewellery wisely. Consider size and colour carefully. I disliked the stud I'd chosen and changed it almost immediately, which caused a lot of irritation. Don't get it done far from home \nI got mine done when I was in the US (I live in London), and when everything went wrong, I had to visit other studios (that didn't care), and had to voice my concerns over email. Not ideal. Don't overclean it \nI'm a clean freak. I went overboard on salt water and ended up aggravating the entire area. Make sure the area is clean, but don't go crazy with random cleaning tips. Stick to the saline solution from a studio. Don't use cheap jewellery \nWhy didn't I learn this from my belly piercing? Don't go into Claire's Accessories and get excited about the three-for-two deal like I did. And stick to the type of jewellery the piercer suggests to you, whether that be hook, bar, hoop, or L-shaped. It isn't very painful \nEveryone has a different pain threshold, and mine is pretty high (I have a rib tattoo), but the piercing hurt a lot less than I expected. It was a short, sharp pain that lasted only 10 minutes. I had no pain the entire healing process, despite mine never healing. It will probably be unavoidably ripped out \nNot to be dramatic, but you're bound to rip it out more than once, and it'll probably happen by accident when you remove your towel turban postshower. This will cause the dreaded bump, along with a good dose of irritation. Pay extra attention to aftercare if this does happen. This happened to my clumsy ass about once a week. Don't take the piercing in and out \nIt should be obvious that taking it out and then putting it back in a day later wouldn't have the best conclusion, but alas, I continued. As Coach Carr from Mean Girls would say \"Just don't do it, promise?\" If it's infected, don't remove it \nThe worst thing you can do when the piercing is infected is remove it. This can cause further infection and therefore increase the healing time. Visit your piercer for advice on the next step to take. Forget trying to blow your nose \nWhen your piercing is healing, blowing your nose can be a struggle. TMI, but it's going to be pretty difficult to get boogers out of your nose too, particularly if you're partial to a false nail like me. The dreaded nose bump \nYou will probably have to endure the dreaded nose bump, which is caused by irritation. Most people only have this for a week or two before it settles. This is the reason I eventually took my stud out, because it really isn't a cute long-term look. Make sure the area is clean by using saline solution, and avoid any injury to the area. \nI did enjoy the brief time my nose stud and I spent together, but we just didn't work out. So please don't make the same mistakes I did. For me, it's time to begin the process of healing and getting out my scar oils.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "claire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tmi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "popsugar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:29.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ff347d5e16df366967e0da5cc7dc925f256a588b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMsnimtca2NXOGGnSoOuNsWHMq75BgCtgaMyq8Jg4gGJdteMXpGyic1s", "site_full": "video.foxnews.com", "site": "foxnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/most-popular", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "The Ingraham Angle - Wednesday, December 6", "title_full": "The Ingraham Angle - Wednesday, December 6", "published": "2017-12-07T10:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/secure.media.foxnews.com/BrightCove/990505083001/990505083001/2017/12/07/640/360/990505083001_5670775694001_5670770182001-vs.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 185, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 9, "comments": 0, "shares": 9}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ff347d5e16df366967e0da5cc7dc925f256a588b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMsnimtca2NXOGGnSoOuNsWHMq75BgCtgaMyq8Jg4gGJdteMXpGyic1s", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Ingraham Angle - Wednesday, December 6", "text": "The Ingraham Angle - Wednesday, December 6 powered by \nFor video troubleshooting and help click here .
