I found trying to hit the upper buttons I always accidentally hit the lower buttons because of the weird angles. I also would never play a console game with an arcade stick, only arcade games but that's just me.\nStreet fightert is one of the very few games to support more than 2 buttons (arcade),\nAnd in any case it plays very well.\nOn the contrary, I do not understand how you can play console titles, with the configuration of the keys that most use on Bartop", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s8.postimg.org/b9u6h6885/24232204_1545533725482286_7601020979420324393_n.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:34.137+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6fe7f60db65a0ecea2d275b90777e555b2acdeae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS1yVLxE8x1Qe5SbnplRWG7XbBy9blcOfHfYfzyyaV2Msu8bF6ypq4lQusv.fPPFwS4wuPi05GngOBPgqqrkjGQwXRXsb30B7FYEh_4xr.cWb7UrFB6t2Ur", "site_full": "forums.launchbox-app.com", "site": "launchbox-app.com", "site_section": "https://forums.launchbox-app.com/forum/75-emulation/", "site_categories": ["video_and_computer_games", "hobbies_and_interests", "tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Emulation - LaunchBox Community Forums", "title": "Best configuron button -Arcade-console-Windows", "title_full": "Best configuron button -Arcade-console-Windows - Emulation - LaunchBox Community Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T15:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.launchbox-app.com/uploads/monthly_2016_08/57ad3c77072fb_logo(1).png.3815c7074bb2c682083804014fc5d856.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af8323fb5ee2bea9fe037c86a47d2f49405b1057", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS1yVLxE8x1Qe5SbnplRWG7XbBy9blcOfHfYfzyyaV2Msu8bF6ypq4lQusv.fPPFwS4wuPi05GngOBPgqqrkjGQwXRXsb30B7FYEh_4xr.cWb16b2DnoUBMwbemqNOuT2s-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Lordmonkus", "published": "2017-12-07T16:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If that works for you that's great, it's personal preference but that is one weird button layout.

Tumi Tladi is not a stranger to the limelight. He grew up around a father who is recognised as one of the most well-known and respected music industry experts, Peter Tladi. \nIt was only a matter of time before the handsome young man would eventually venture to create his own path in music. \nHe recently released his debut album, Written In The Stars - a testament to his passion and spirit. \nTladi, has ventured away from jazz and decided to keep it up tempo with a blend of hip hop beats fused with New Age rap. He is one of the supporting acts at the Ekurhuleni Comes Alive jazz evening. His first single off the album is Dirty Dancing. The 13-track album also has songs titled Like That, Chemistry and Fade and features the likes of Thiwe, Cuebur, Phantom Steeze, DJ Smokes and Christie. \nThe 25-year-old singer plans to hold his own at the event tomorrow. \nThe entertainment business is always something he has been involved with, starting off as a dancer and performing alongside the likes of Somizi Mhlongo, Lalla Hirayama, Cassper Nyovest and Khuli Chana. \nThe rising star has travelled the world performing as a dancer and now he wants to show the audience at the Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg tomorrow just what his pipes are made of. \nThe rapper/singer had this to say about his upcoming performance: \nThe Star (TS): Is this your first performance at the Ekurhuleni Comes Alive jazz evening? \nTumi Tladi (TT): Yes, it\u2019s my first time and I\u2019m so excited. \nTS: What can people expect from your performance? \nTT: They can expect a more musical side from me, more than turn-up music. I want people to appreciate me as a versatile artist. \nTS: What are your plans for December? \nTT: Performing at The Nubian Fest in Hartbeespoort Dam on December 16 and New Year\u2019s Eve in Pretoria on December 31. \nTS: Are you planning a tour for your album? \nTT: Yes, we\u2019ve actually been on tour - I just completed my Cape Town tour but we are going to go out more in the country as much as possible. \nTS: How has the reception been so far? \nTT: I\u2019m so happy that the people who actually take the time to listen to the album love it, so they are spreading the word and I\u2019m gaining new loyal fans every day. \nTS: Are there any surprises in store for the audience at the Ekurhuleni Comes Alive jazz evening finale? \nTT: Yes,there\u2019s one thing I do that no South African artist can do, so I\u2019m excited to see their reaction. \nResident MC Hector Motivator will host the December Ekurhuleni Comes Alive jazz evening that will see a hip hop, house, jazz and gospel line-up. \nMiCasa and Stimela will headline the event, while Tladi and Mmatema Moremi will be in the line-up as supporting stars. It\u2019s also a great event to treat your staff to for the year-end function. \nMmatema ready to wow audience at jazz evening \nWith purses tightening, the world-class event is sure to calm you through the unpredictable economy. \nEnjoy a three-course meal, full bar available, and a fun-filled evening tomorrow at the Birchwood Hotel & OR Tambo Conference Centre. \nTickets are R450 a person and R4500 for a table of 10. \nFor details or to book, contact Portia Rathebe at 011 897 0024, e-mail [email protected] or visit www.birchwoodhotel.co.za", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mpiletso motumi loo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tumi tladi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "somizi mhlongo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khuli chana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter tladi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "micasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mc hector motivator", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lalla hirayama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stimela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cassper nyovest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phantom steeze", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portia rathebe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tladi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mmatema moremi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "thiwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birchwood hotel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cape town", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boksburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nubian fest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cuebur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pretoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tladi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hartbeespoort dam", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:35.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10a1301028cca796d3374a2d0abca1012cd01f21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pwDDbLyVoa7GmpGbCtdzTmL0BZYwt1uHZ", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/hr/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/hr/ -

In 2016, when there were 21 rounds, the sport racked up 866 moves. \nThat worked out at an average of 21.8 per race in 2017, compared to 41.2 last year. \nAzerbaijan Grand Prix winner Ricciardo made 43 overtakes, including 13 at Silverstone where he went from 19th on the British GP starting grid to finish fifth. \nVerstappen, who topped last year\u2019s Pirelli statistics with 78 passes in a season that also brought him a first victory, managed only 22 this time around. \nOn the plus side, the 20-year-old Dutch driver tied with Mercedes\u2019 four times world champion Lewis Hamilton as the drivers who were overtaken least (twice in total). \nThe likely lack of overtaking had been flagged up before the season as a consequence of Formula One\u2019s new-look cars which were faster through corners but harder to get past on slower circuits like Monaco. \nThe worst race for passing was the Russian Grand Prix, with just one overtake registered, while the liveliest was Azerbaijan\u2019s chaotic race with 42. \nRed Bull were the team with the most overtakes and, along with championship runners-up Ferrari, the ones who were passed the least. \nAn overtaking manoeuvre was deemed to be one that occurred during a complete fast lap, but not the first of any race. Any position changes due to major mechanical problems or drivers being lapped were not included. \nPirelli said pole position in 2017 was on average 2.450 seconds faster than in 2016, and the fastest race lap was on average 2.968 seconds quicker. \nThe highest speed recorded was 362.4 kph by Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel in Mexico. \nNext season will see an even faster tyre introduced, with softer compounds generally.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ricciardo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ferrari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max verstappen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sebastian vettel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewis hamilton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "verstappen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel ricciardo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters news service", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ferrari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pirelli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red bull", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "azerbaijan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monaco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silverstone", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:35.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae9f3b34695cc7fbc8a344b80ad38fa40a676c81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWUmNxxBmRR6LJX_muB2cXYoaDmYBGUOD5lg_aUPYpLSMEQkEwtsdl5ITKKNTh.cOPl7lINLKLPBm.awAv076PJ2uI8IvlXsnp", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-party-supplies\u00a0/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Party Supplies - Buy Party Supplies at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Thomas & friends Sticker", "title_full": "Thomas & friends Sticker | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-12-05T15:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae9f3b34695cc7fbc8a344b80ad38fa40a676c81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWUmNxxBmRR6LJX_muB2cXYoaDmYBGUOD5lg_aUPYpLSMEQkEwtsdl5ITKKNTh.cOPl7lINLKLPBm.awAv076PJ2uI8IvlXsnp", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mei L.", "published": "2017-12-05T15:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Incomplete Set", "text": "I am very happy with the fast delivery (ordered Saturday, 2th and received on Monday, 5th December) but disappointed that I didn't receive a complete set.

Businesses had successfully used this social media giant to boost the public's engagement with their brand. Unfortunately, that all changed around two years ago when Facebook changed its algorithm so that only content relevant to the user will appear in their News Feed. User engagement is one of the factors that determine whether your brand or content will show up in a user's News Feed. This means that the more likes, comments, and shares a post gets, the more likely it will be seen by a larger audience. The trick now is to know how to get your audience engaged . Luckily, there are some tips and tricks you can do to increase Facebook engagement. Here are 7 of them: Post When the Timing is Right The enormous amount of posts being published on Facebook means there's a lot of competition. The trick is to know the right time to post. Surprisingly, this doesn't mean the time when most people are logged in to the site. Studies have shown that it's more effective to post content sometime between 10pm and midnight (local time) as this receives the most engagement. Posting at 11 am is also a good, but engagement during this time is minimal, as people are just skimming through their News Feed. This is in direct contrast to night time, when fewer posts are made but users have more time to really go through each post. Share Content Your Audience Wants, Not What You Want To get people engaged with your post, share content that they want. Most of the time, businesses think that since they're in a certain niche, that all their content should be related to that field. For example, an online book shop might post content about their book prices, company news, and best sellers. But that's not what audiences want to keep reading about daily. To keep things interesting, expand the type of content that you share. In our example, the bookshop could post recipes on how to recreate dishes that were mentioned in a popular book series or share a beloved writer's top 10 favorite characters. Some tips on writing or reading would also be appreciated. The trick is to post something different, but not so different that it would seem out of place. Use Real and Personal Photos Pictures are undoubtedly one of the most engaging content that a business can share, especially when they're real and not just some generic photo. Users would rather see original and personal photos than stock images. This is why we keep looking at photos of what our friends ate than those sleek images a famous burger brand might put out. Reply to Your Audience and Build Relationships Since you're making a lot of effort to get people engaged with your post, it makes sense that you should also take the time to reply to their comments. Don't just post content and forget. Check the comments and reply as soon as you can. Engage your audience in a conversation. Yes, you need to deal with the usual troll but remember that people who leave comments did so because the post connected with them. Reply and make them feel appreciated. They will be more inclined to engage with your other posts as well. Make Blog Posts That Fits Facebook Perfectly Links will go a long way to keep your audience engaged on Facebook. To ensure this happens, create a company blog and start making content that's tailored specifically to Facebook. List posts and content that tickles people's curiosity are the ones that perform well on the social media site. You can even look at content that you previously shared and create similar content or search for keywords that are engaging and interesting. Make Your Posts Sweet and Short Blog posts are well and good, but remember that your Facebook page is not the company blog. People on Facebook are not there to read long content. Posts that are between 1 to 50 characters long garnered the most engagement. The more characters or words used in the post, the less engaged the audience is. So take out the unnecessary details and just treat your posts like headlines that will pull people in and get them to click on your link. Ask the Audience to Get Engaged If you want your audience to be engaged , then give them clear instructions on what you want them to do. A Call to Action is something that a lot of businesses or marketers forget but it's what consumers respond to. Do you want your audience to share your post or to comment? Give them instructions on what they should do next. After all, if they took the time to read the whole post, they're already interested in the content and are willing to take the next step.

When women share stories about these experiences, the speculation that follows often points a finger at their complicity: Was she dressed provocatively? Did she flirt with him or bait him? Did she send mixed messages? Why did she go to his room? Why did she continue to work with him? \nAs we celebrate women coming forward and sharing their stories during this #MeToo moment, we cannot lose sight of the long-entrenched cultural norms that have both allowed and protected the men who harass, exploit and assault them. While we are seeing some accused men resigning or being fired as of late, in other arenas we are seeing them double-down\u2014blaming the victims, insisting on their innocence and declaring war against women. It is a less visible fallout that stems from the backlash against women that\u2019s already begun in the wake of these powerful men\u2019s fall from grace. \nWe need to keep our eye on the backlash in a continued effort to support the women who are telling their stories. Fibonacci Blue / Creative Commons \nAccusing a violator doesn\u2019t end once a woman posts her story on social media, or outs him in some other way\u2014that\u2019s just the beginning of the unraveling. After women share their #MeToo stories, they may have to contend with whether or not their family and friends believe them, with having to return back to work with the very person they\u2019ve accused, with finding the support they\u2019ll inevitably need (especially if it\u2019s the first time they\u2019re speaking out about such abuse). \nRight now, we\u2019re focused on high-profile accusations. But what about those girls who live with their abusers? Or women who don\u2019t have the financial means or education to extricate themselves from much-needed jobs and continue to put up with sexual harassment and abuse every day because they feel they have no other choice? For these women, the national fallout is not playing out the same way as it is in Hollywood or Capitol Hill. \nAs psychotherapist who\u2019s worked closely with incest and sex abuse survivors for the past three decades, I hear harrowing tales of what happens when people don\u2019t want to believe them, even when all signs point to the obvious fact that the violator is guilty of his crimes. I\u2019ve worked with daughters whose mothers throw them out for disclosing abuse at the hands of their father. I\u2019ve worked with teen girls going to court to accuse their rapist only to watch him go free. Girls are slut-shamed, blamed for dressing too provocatively and told they deserved what they had coming to them. Sometimes the woman is already an incest survivor and she has been taught to keep her abuse a secret. \nEvery time a girl or woman blames herself, she\u2019s re-traumatized. Her actions perpetuates this subordinate culture in which we find ourselves\u2014a culture that does not honor women and children, but instead blames women for men\u2019s weaknesses, digressions and failings. But as we enter into groundbreaking territory amidst the swath of women speaking truth to powerful men, journalists and talking heads\u2014even the most well-intentioned\u2014are missing the point. \nIn a recent op-ed for the New York Times, David Brooks refers to \u201cthe very few\u201d men who abuse, lamenting that \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been enough research into what goes on in the minds of harassers.\u201d But what about the countless studies and books about date rape, rape culture, pimp culture, frat culture, sports culture? What about the countless memoirs of abuse survivors? \nHere is what the research has taught us, David: One in four girls will be sexually abused by her 16th birthday. 91 percent of rape and sexual assault victims are female. 96 percent of perpetrators are male. And while rape and sexual assault are the most unreported crimes, much ado has been made about the specter of the life-ruining \u201cfalse rape accusation.\u201d \nI don\u2019t think we should be having a national conversation about the \u201cvery few\u201d male perpetrators. The experiences we are hearing about at this time\u2014and those we have yet to shine a light on\u2014are part of the everyday experience of being a girl and woman in this country. The focus needs to be on the women\u2019s experiences. \nWe have spent too long trying to decide why men abuse. We know why: a misogynistic culture that does not protect women and children allows them to, and occasionally even rewards them for doing so. Already complaints are mounting that \u201cmen have to be so careful\u201d at work, perhaps even putting\u2014imagine this\u2014an end to their hugging practices. We must push back, and swiftly. We must womansplain this moment. We must insist that this is a time, the time, to confront misogyny and patriarchy. \nMen should want to be allies in the fight to end sexual violence, and they play a pivotal role in changing social norms within their communities. But it is women and girls who must give voice to this issue and tell their stories on their terms. And it is on us to honor those who come forward. \nWe can no longer be bystanders to the abuse that\u2019s being perpetrated in every corner of our society\u2014in homes, in schools, in sports, in the workplace, in our institutions. When you hear someone victim-blaming, say something. If a friend or coworker shares their own story, give them your support. When you witness the backlash, speak out. Speak out on social media, in one-on-one conversations, in conversations with family and friends. Let us all speak out\u2014scream out if you have to. \nSex abuse is wrong, and the survivors are never at fault. Cut the \u201cboys will be boys\u201d mindset. Let\u2019s stop blaming society, culture and pornography for men\u2019s behavior. Let\u2019s stop dismissing their misdeeds as \u201clocker room talk,\u201d as an inevitability of our times. Instead, let\u2019s spend our energy continuing to uncover the truth and supporting survivors with passion and strength. Let\u2019s do all we can to ensure that our daughters, our colleagues and our friends never have a #MeToo story.

On Jan. 1, the state's recreational pot market comes online.\nHere's an overview of what you need to know about weed in California, for Jan. 1 and beyond.\nWhat are the highlights of the new law?\n\u25e6You have to be 21 or older to buy recreational marijuana. 18 and older for medical.\n\u25e6You can grow up to six plants.\n\u25e6You can possess 28.5 grams of flower, or 8 grams of cannabis concentrate.\n\u25e6It's illegal to drive high.\n\u25e6You can smoke in your own home or backyard. If your lease prohibits it, you can't smoke in your rental unit. You can't smoke in public, in a restaurant or a bar.\nWhat are the big changes happening after Jan. 1?\nThat's when the state is expected to start handing out operating licenses to shops throughout the state, but those shops will have to have gotten approval from their local governments prior to opening. If they have both, and products from licensed vendors, they should be good to go.\nWhen and where will I be able to buy recreational pot?\nSince the state's handing out licenses on Jan. 1, retail outlets could theoretically open on New Year's Day. But they won't be in every city in Southern California; a lot of local governments are behind on issuing licensing regulations, and a number of others have decided not to allow pot businesses. (The L.A. City Council is set to approve marijuana regulations on Wednesday.)\nFor people with no retail stores in their town, they can buy their pot in another city or order home delivery.\nIn towns that allow recreational sales, shops can't operate within 600 feet of schools, parks, daycare centers and other sensitive locations. They can only be open between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., they can only sell limited amounts to customers, and when they do they have to place the product in opaque packages.\nHow will the legal recreational market affect the price of marijuana?\nCalifornia customers could see as much as a 70 percent jump in prices compared with what they currently pay in medical marijuana shops. A state tax of 15 percent on all marijuana products goes into effect Jan. 1 and additional local taxes will follow.\nThere could also be an issue of demand exceeding supply. Colorado and Washington initially struggled to meet demand, as it took a while to bring enough shops online and to keep the open ones fully stocked. That drove up prices. As supplies became more reliable and additional shops opened, prices declined.\nAre the authorities prepared to crack down on black market pot operations?\nIn Los Angeles, there has been a proliferation of unlicensed medical marijuana shops, and law enforcement has struggled to put them out of business. When the LAPD has managed to shut down a shop, sometimes the owners just pick up and move to another location, creating a whack-a-mole situation.\nThe LAPD and the L.A. Department of Cannabis Regulations say that they're working with the L.A. City Attorney's office to develop a plan to move against illicit shops. One thing that might help with enforcement: Proposition M made it possible for the city to shut off water and power to illegal operations.\nThe state's Bureau of Cannabis Control says it has its own enforcement task force.\nWhat are the penalties for breaking marijuana-related laws?\nOperations that run afoul of the law can get fined and even lose their licenses.\nSomeone arrested for breaking the law will likely see a $500 fine or be charged with a misdemeanor. For those who have also sold to a minor, been convicted of a violent felony or are sex offenders, the charges and penalties would increase in severity.\nIs the federal government going to look the other way?\nThe drug is illegal under federal law, and is listed as a Schedule I substance, putting it on a par with heroin in Washington's eyes. Attorney General Jeff Sessions hates pot. He once said, \"Good people don't smoke marijuana.\" On Nov. 29, 2017, Sessions said during a news conference that the Department of Justice is looking \"very hard right now\" at a directive carried over from the Obama administration that essentially urges federal prosecutors to defer to state laws that legalize pot.\nStill, it's not clear that a federal crackdown is imminent. \"We'll be working our way through to a rational policy,\" Sessions said, while noting that \"our priorities will have to be focused on all the things and challenges we face.\"\n Here's what January 1 means for marijuana in California | 89.3 KPCC\nAuthor: Jacob Margolis\nContact: Contact | 89.3 KPCC\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock\nWebsite: 89.3 KPCC -

I know one personally. \nA few years back, a student at the school I attended, and now work for, raped another student, who I am also related to, and stalked me and my young daughters. \nI didn\u2019t hesitate to speak up. I detailed my experiences in police reports. I attempted to get a restraining order\u2014twice\u2014on behalf of my daughters and myself. I talked to my colleagues, the security department, the president of the school and pretty much anyone who would listen about the concerns I had for the safety for my family as well as for the students and faculty at his new school. I even wrote about them for Ms. \nBut while he was expelled for the sexual assault, that same student continued to come back to campus until the police got involved; eventually, he easily transferred to another school close by, where his parents are alum and his father teaches. I was denied both of those restraining orders. And it wasn\u2019t until after he was arrested for indecent assault of a minor and banned from yet another campus that victims from the student\u2019s second school started to come forward to publicly tell their stories. Anubisbyss / Creative Commons \nThese women\u2019s stories were the same: The same student had raped them. They had reported it to campus police. The administration had done nothing. They had been speaking out for years\u2014but it was not enough to keep them or their peers safe. A rapist was thus allowed to remain on campus, growing his list of victims year after year. \nHis arrest was a turning point, an incredible #MeToo moment of relief and grief, the formation of a group none of us wants to be a part of. Just like when we are growing up and told not to go out alone, women still find safety and strength in numbers. We find ourselves a bit braver, our voice a little louder and our hearts a little stronger because we are able to see that the fight is no longer just about ourselves. \nHaving seen campus rapists like Brock Turner walk out of jail after just a few months, I can\u2019t say I had ever put much faith in the criminal justice system to handle this case. Unfortunately, the system proved me right. The accused student was out on bail but monitored with an ankle bracelet, and the case never even made it to trial\u2014dismissed due to \u201clack of prosecution.\u201d The arc of justice rested solely on the shoulders of a child. \nWhat comes next for that student and for his victims remains to be seen. I have asked the same question over and over: not if but when will be the next time. Will this young man in his mid-twenties attempt to go back to college for the third time to finish his degree? Will he choose another underage victim? Am I and my daughters still at risk? How many women will be hurt before he is held accountable? I have no answers, but I refuse to be silent in the meantime. \nSome women do not speak out because they are not yet ready. Some choose not to. Some are threatened by their perpetrators. Shame is strong, and typically those who are being accused have more power than their accusers. In many ways, our culture discourages truth-telling and accountability\u2014after all, no one wants to known that the producer who makes their favorite movies, or, in my case, the successful pastor and family counselor\u2019s son they once trusted, is capable of heinous things. Unconsciously, and perhaps consciously at times, we would rather reject victims because they threaten our sense of safety and security\u2014we would rather not believe them, and go on believing we are safe instead. \nIt is a false sense of security that sexual assault and harassment \u201ccouldn\u2019t happen here,\u201d perpetrated by people we know and might even like. In rejecting the narratives of victims, we reject the truth\u2014and put ourselves and those we love further at risk. \nWomen speak out anyway, against all odds. Women report sexual harassment and assault even when their job may be on the line. Women go to the police even when they know they may not be believed. Women go through the grueling process of investigations and trials, reliving their pain and trauma, even though they know the system might fail them. Women speak out against powerful men only to have their reputation questioned and their character maligned. Women have spoken when no one is listening and women have spoken when the whole world is listening. \nA narrative persists that women who come forward about sexual harassment or assault years after the crimes are doing so out of malice\u2014perhaps for financial or political motivations. If the #MeToo moment we\u2019re experiencing has taught us anything, it\u2019s how badly we must scrub that narrative from our canon. If we scrutinized the accused as thoroughly as we do the accuser, we might actually get somewhere in changing the culture and systems that have allowed this conduct to go on for far too long. \nHarvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby have over 80 accusers each, with allegations spanning decades. These men, and other men like them, do not just come from nowhere. Rather, the constant failure to hold them accountable leaves a wide and long path of destruction in their wake. \nTheir victims, along with many other survivors, are speaking out right now. Listen to them, and let them know that you believe them. It just may be the push we need to make this moment a tipping point.

Another 37 million African children will learn so little in school that attending may not be as advantageous as saving money or putting the children to work. However, education is paramount for improving the economic status of individuals and improving the social and economic standing of communities. \nIn general, the cost of attending public schools in developing nations is the responsibility of students, families and faculty. Books, supplies and teachers\u2019 salaries are usually the responsibility of students\u2019 families. Cost is only one reason for low school attendance . \nOf the children not enrolled in schools, 53 percent are girls. In many cases, girls are denied schooling as a result of the misconceptions about gender in education which place less value on educating girls as opposed to educating boys. The belief centers on traditional gender roles which place more value on women in the home. \nSome of the top barriers to education around the world include lack of funding, teachers, classrooms and materials as well as the exclusion of girls and children with disabilities. The reasons for these barriers differ across borders but there are explanations that blame the inequality on misconceptions about gender in education in terms of future success, wages and family planning. \nThe following facts have been determined to debunk common misconceptions about gender in education in developing nations: Educated women and girls are less vulnerable to HIV as well as various forms of exploitation. Each additional year of education mothers receive reduces child mortality by two percent. Each additional year of schooling for women is associated with a 10 to 20 percent wage increase. Women re-invest 90 percent of their income into their families \nStudies have also shown successes in longer school weeks in countries like Colombia. Longer school weeks keep students occupied and prevent exposure to commonly risky situations. Improving access to education for girls has a vast economic impact which increases families\u2019 ability to afford to send more children to school and allows parents to work longer. \nThis information has spurred initiatives to improve education worldwide specifically for young girls. One initiative is the Global Partnership for Education ( GPE ) whose top priority is ensuring access to complete and quality education for girls with the aim to increase the percentage of girls completing primary school from 74 percent to 84 percent by 2018. \nThere are several pieces of legislation that have been introduced that aim to improve education and economic status for women. These include the Protecting Girls\u2019 Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act and the Reach Every Mother and Child Act . \nThe most recent success for legislative activism is the passing of the Reinforcing Education Accountability in Development Act that promotes universal access to basic education for children across the globe especially girls. These acts are reliant upon constituent action so it is important to contact congressional leaders to support them. \n\u2013 Rebekah Korn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "\u2013 rebekah korn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global partnership for education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gpe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colombia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:38.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e69498b882d6c912af83a97599016fe76047b3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP03fsXeni2Q0lWm5GpB6yx_1gIQcX.evOGV2X3lLXGXh3lZ7RToVKSeb9vgsX6dsMEA.40hpj9kzQ_dl.pPr6p6jl2VoImxQTOXrQCmLBOoteP82eKS6rDo8-", "site_full": "www.lazada.sg", "site": "lazada.sg", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.sg/shop-fragrances/express-delivery/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Express Delivery Store | Get Daily Needs Fast | Lazada.sg", "title": "CK One 200ml |", "title_full": "CK One 200ml | Lazada Singapore", "published": "2016-03-21T09:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 76, "participants_count": 62, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.024, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8973, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d5dd64eca0da67d8da1838c898f18fd68124c4d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP03fsXeni2Q0lWm5GpB6yx_1gIQcX.evOGV2X3lLXGXh3lZ7RToVKSeb9vgsX6dsMEA.40hpj9kzQ_dl.pPr6p6jl2VoImxQTOXrQCmLBOoteqdT40xyR8hOj6usFNvXEdg--", "ord_in_thread": 70, "author": "Devin L.", "published": "2017-11-26T08:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "Fast on delivery", "text": "Still acceptable for normal use i think is good for it purpose.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:38.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e69498b882d6c912af83a97599016fe76047b3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP03fsXeni2Q0lWm5GpB6yx_1gIQcX.evOGV2X3lLXGXh3lZ7RToVKSeb9vgsX6dsMEA.40hpj9kzQ_dl.pPr6p6jl2VoImxQTOXrQCmLBOoteP82eKS6rDo8-", "site_full": "www.lazada.sg", "site": "lazada.sg", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.sg/shop-fragrances/express-delivery/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Express Delivery Store | Get Daily Needs Fast | Lazada.sg", "title": "CK One 200ml |", "title_full": "CK One 200ml | Lazada Singapore", "published": "2016-03-21T09:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 76, "participants_count": 62, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.024, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8973, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "04f939f8d5c5722e5e968fab6a75162dd57aa543", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP03fsXeni2Q0lWm5GpB6yx_1gIQcX.evOGV2X3lLXGXh3lZ7RToVKSeb9vgsX6dsMEA.40hpj9kzQ_dl.pPr6p6jl2VoImxQTOXrQCmLBOoteqdT40xyR8hONs9WRItQiEw--", "ord_in_thread": 71, "author": "Termsak C.", "published": "2017-11-27T10:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "Great deal", "text": "Ordered last Friday, the ckOne 200 came in bubble-wrapper via Singpost this Monday afternoon.

In recent years, the increasing climate change in Colombia has inflicted substantial turmoil through flooding and drought. \n\u201cColombia is very vulnerable to phenomena of extreme climate variability and climate change,\u201d stated the Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development, Luis Gilberto Murillo . To build their resilience, the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) has collaborated with national partners by designing a South-South exchange with Senegalese organizations. The exchange\u2019s objective is for Colombian partners to acquire knowledge from the experiences of farmers in Senegal. \nCIAT was founded on October 17, 1967 and functions in collaboration with numerous partners to assist developing countries in crafting more competitive, profitable and durable farming through its efficient and sustainable natural resource management. With this principle, the organization aims to help policymakers, scientists and farmers in understanding the key adversities of our world which include food insecurity, malnutrition, climate change and environmental ruin. \nThe global research contributes to several of the U.N.\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals , such as good health and well-being, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic goals, sustainable cities and communities, climate action and partnerships for the goals. The international partnerships work cost-effectively and realistically together. Diversity is regarded as a key asset, for adjusting easily to the existing climate change in Colombia and striving to improve progress through continuous education. \nFrom acclimatizing to rigorous climate changes for millennia, the Senegalese partners have established an abundance of indigenous knowledge on techniques for monthly droughts. In the framework of this phenomenal international collaboration, these partners have acquired fresh new proficiency and expertise on incorporating site-specific communication towards the climate change in Colombia. This has resulted in Senegalese partners providing agro climatic forecasts to Colombian farmers, including instructions that match their specific contexts. There are 154,059 Colombian farmers who are now receiving agro climatic orders and an additional 6,000 have implemented climate-smart practices. In the medium-term, the project is expected to reach 1,588,640 farmers. \nWith climate change affecting the world in various ways, it\u2019s a relief to know that Colombia is fostering these programs. Agricultural research is an essential tool in producing new technologies, methods and knowledge that enhance farmers\u2019 preparations and make production more eco-efficient, especially for low-income smallholders. \nThanks to CIAT, more than 5,000 Colombians have enhanced their knowledge of agriculture and their aptitude through the abundant training opportunities offered. Furthermore, CIAT and its partnerships have designed an advanced biosciences platform that provides ready access to cutting-edge technologies with the aim of having agriculture be more competitive. There are always opportunities to improve agriculture and Colombia has worked with its Senegalese partners for training and education on new techniques. It\u2019s all part of the global collaboration to help nourish their people during these difficult climate changes. \n\u2013 Nicole Su\u00e1rez", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicole su\u00e1rez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luis gilberto murillo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ciat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international center for tropical agriculture", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colombia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senegal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:38.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "52e0642349b3b78c6d03b5038487587935aae95a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFTYhNWHVqlgIbbuTBVRa.mr6p5Y.4N8gDKWyQzR7JOdkP7xUp5PI48A--", "site_full": "community.babycentre.co.uk", "site": "babycentre.co.uk", "site_section": "http://community.babycentre.co.uk/groups/a3894581/september_2017_birth_club", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "September 2017 Birth Club - BabyCentre", "title": "Teething?", "title_full": "Teething? - BabyCentre", "published": "2017-12-07T14:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://community.babycentre.co.uk/img/bclub/birthclub_logo_baby_9.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8006, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "52e0642349b3b78c6d03b5038487587935aae95a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFTYhNWHVqlgIbbuTBVRa.mr6p5Y.4N8gDKWyQzR7JOdkP7xUp5PI48A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lauradeebee", "published": "2017-12-07T14:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Teething?", "text": "So our LG is 12 weeks this Sunday.

The small Caribbean nation faces frequent natural disasters. In 2010, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake killed more than 300,000 Haitians and left 1.5 million people without homes. \nThe Saint Rock Haiti Foundation was founded in 2002 in Milton, Massachusetts. Since then, the foundation has brought much-needed aid to people living in less developed regions of rural Haiti. The main focus of the Saint Rock Haiti Foundation is to ensure access to high-quality healthcare for Haitians in need. To accomplish this goal, the Saint Rock Haiti Foundation Clinic was constructed and staffed by a team of qualified Haitian medical professionals. The clinic has since seen over 37,000 registered patients and delivered quality healthcare to people in dire need. \nAfter the earthquake in 2010, the Saint Rock Haiti Foundation took the initiative to help rebuild homes and healthcare in Haiti. Their focus extends past healthcare and strives to promote community development to improve the quality of life for those in need. Primary and secondary education in Haiti is not free, and the Saint Rock Haiti Foundation has stepped up to help provide tuition costs for families who cannot afford the cost of their children\u2019s education. Additionally, families in need can receive a stipend to ensure they can provide their children with proper nutrition. \nOne of the biggest hardships faced by Haitians after the earthquake was and continues to be access to clean water. The Saint Rock Haiti Foundation undertook the task of pumping fresh spring water from the highlands of the country to citizens living in places where it is inaccessible. \nThe Saint Rock Haiti Foundation depends on the help of donations and volunteers to help provide homes and healthcare in Haiti. The health clinic is regularly staffed with American doctors who travel to Haiti on missions to lend a hand. The Saint Rock Haiti Foundation also supports projects where people interested in lending a hand on the ground in Haiti can fundraise and build homes for those in need. With the help of groups like The Saint Rock Haiti Foundation, Haitians in the most desperate need have been given much-needed aid. \n\u2013 Tyler Troped", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "\u2013 tyler troped", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "healthcare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "providing homes and healthcare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saint rock haiti foundation clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saint rock haiti foundation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "haiti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haiti  haiti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milton", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:38.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa7e364f956eb65c5a64b5979dad8eeb03ec5251", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOS_5hBLgIvVGUdhaGBxc0W6VjRNBEeGGxhAQda2pcae.NhMCXV1zpsjrT88jnl5FmvbxF5GUDaleJ5mq.zyUPtFNlUSzdqV5X.KVQqBS2DKg--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g1-i10702-Air_Travel.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Air Travel Forum - TripAdvisor", "title": "Tunisia - Visa exemption for Indians - Air Travel", "title_full": "Tunisia - Visa exemption for Indians - Air Travel Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-06T17:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "48c829cebf7995512ae9ecd2a77788391c020d7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOS_5hBLgIvVGUdhaGBxc0W6VjRNBEeGGxhAQda2pcae.NhMCXV1zpsjrT88jnl5FmvbxF5GUDaleJ5mq.zyUPtFNlUSzdqV5WI4cg21_wx7wRcrjmNiGHQ", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "shareefblogger", "published": "2017-12-07T12:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thanks Guys for the responses.

What will this mean for film critics, who are still players in the success or failure of an actor\u2019s career? The most influential among them have helped create a popular film consciousness and language. pxhere / Creative Commons \nSome of the same writers I\u2019ve read and loved for decades in mainstream publications have indulged in semantic leering and the feitishizing of female bodies. They\u2019ve made the blunt appraisal of women\u2019s beauty and desirability a part of film critique, extending to the arts pages a strain of the degradation we now know many women endure behind the scenes. \nIn a 1993 New York Times review of Guncrazy, Vincent Canby describes Drew Barrymore\u2019s pubescent character as \u201castonishingly pretty with her short blond hair and her cherry-red lipstick. She\u2019s 16 and has no idea of the power her beauty might giver her.\u201d Canby insists that Guncrazy \u201cis beguiled by the looks of Ms. Barrymore\u2019s Anita,\u201d rather than the actor\u2019s interpretation of the role\u2014\u201dan important part of the way the movie works.\u201d It\u2019s a prophecy borne of a middle-aged man\u2019s titillation at the sight of an adolescent girl, and describes the oldest falsehood around about the rewards of male sexual attention for girls and women. \nNo man ever made such a statement about me as a kid or later, though this is exactly the prophecy I would have wanted. A man once did stop me on the sidewalk while I was riding my red bike with streamers on the handles near my home in Caracas, Venezuela, and pulled out his penis. I was nine. He walked right up to me and stroked it and asked in a kind voice if I knew what it was and did I want to touch it. Technically I knew what it was but had imagined it to be smooth and tubular. What he showed me looked like some sort of moldering evisceration. Also, I felt the man attached to this thing might kill me, though he made no such threat. I threw my bike down and ran for my life back to my house. \nIn a 1993 review of Body of Evidence , starring Madonna and Willem Defoe, Canby dispenses with the mock-avuncular sweetness reserved for Barrymore. The film is a dud, and if Madonna had been more \u201cdemanding,\u201d then \u201cperhaps the camera would have been more kind to her. Perhaps not.\u201d It seems the movie\u2019s erotic implausibility is no fault of Defoe, who\u2019s simply too smart for the role. (\u201cHe\u2019s an intellectual performer even at the peak of pleasure.\u201d) Little is said of Madonna\u2019s intellect; instead, Canby insists, \u201c Body of Evidence is the kind of dopey movie that might work only with someone as stunning to look at as Sharon Stone, whose beautiful face in repose is sullen and sexy and not simply blank.\u201d My face in repose showed its slack, even back then. \nCanby asks, \u201cWhat to do about poor Madonna?\u201d with her \u201cengagingly naked ambition.\u201d His final blow? That for his taste, she is physically ill-suited to cinema. \u201cThe terrible truth: Madonna doesn\u2019t look great in Body of Evidence ,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe sometime sex symbol is only evident in one quick scene in which she is lying naked on her stomach\u2026 Spread out this way, the torso is gorgeous. When she stands up, the torso seems to collapse into itself. The camera makes her appear dwarfish.\u201d \nDwarfish. I had an a-ha moment upon reading this: Dwarfish is how I appear in most photographs. Dwarfish is how I probably appear walking on the sidewalks of New York to the one man who calls me Ugly Cunt, the other who says I Want To Eat Your Fish Pie and the other\u2014dressed in a suit and so tall I have to strain my neck to look up at him, who orders me to Step Aside, though I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m in his way. Dwarfish is exactly the word for my own torso. \nI read this review over and over. I wanted to feel Canby\u2019s contempt for the star who redefined pop fame, made female sexual expression a centerpiece of it\u2014yet, as an actor, failed to satisfy his voyeuristic appetites. I wanted to remember that any woman whose appearance doesn\u2019t sate a man has no raison d\u2019etre. It was an early lesson in my own life, though one I couldn\u2019t quite swallow. I admired female actors who barely registered on the dick radar and who bucked norms. This means I watched every Amanda Plummer flick I could find. \nDespite the death knells for film criticism in the digital age, with aggregate sites like Rotten Tomatoes, reviews and critics\u2019 circle prizes remain a vital part of the machinery of film promotion. But like much of the media and film industry, it\u2019s a male-dominant gig, with women making up fewer than a quarter of the membership in groups like The National Society of Film Critics, The Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the New York Film Critics Circle. According to research from the Center for the Study of Women in Television & Film, women wrote under 30 percent of \u201ctop critic\u201d reviews on Rotten Tomatoes in the spring of 2016. \nIn his book The Complete History of Film Criticism, Jerry Roberts writes that, in its early days, film criticism was once considered a \u201csoft\u201d subject suited to women writers. This helped usher in the age of Pauline Kael, whose verdicts on films were feared by the top movie moguls making them. More recently, film criticism was also conjoined with feminist thought. But digitalization, layoffs and the growing prestige of films as a playground for high-brow observers of culture\u2014like Leslie Fiedler, who wrote that only women are capable of writing Fabulous Books (read that piece several time to make sure I understood it, and until his disdain sunk in)\u2014led to the genre\u2019s consolidation around male bylines, despite important exceptions like Manohla Dargis, Stephanie Zacharek and other critics tracked by sites like Screen Queens. Male protagonists are written about far more frequently than female ones, and old sexual tropes remain. \nEven with growing awareness of women\u2019s objectification in pop culture, it\u2019s hard to find more expansive views of actresses and their corporeality. In The Body and The Screen: Female Subjectivities in Contemporary Women\u2019s Cinema , Kate Ince writes of British director\u2019s Andrea Arnold\u2019s film Fish Tank : \nTo anyone on the lookout for innovative filming of the active, mobile female body, the opening shot of Fish Tank is electrifying. Mia, the fifteen-year-old girl at the centre of the film\u2019s story line, is leaning over to get her breath after an evidently heavy exercise session. The shot is frontal, and although Mia\u2019s body \u2026\u2026 fills only the bottom half of the frame, the heaving of her shoulders and torso and the sound of her breathing instantly grab and keep our attention\u2026.the only image of her face viewable in this opening scene is riveted to her breathing, exercising body. This opening scene of Fish Tank could serve as a model to both women directors and theorist-critics of how to approach the screening of embodied female subjectivity \u2013 head-on, with attention to activity, effort and movement, and without fetishistic fragmentation of the female body. \nHow many girls might be spared a life of self-loathing at their own unfuckable image if Ince\u2019s broad framework\u2014we are human bodies moving on a life continuum\u2014were to prevail one day? \nIt\u2019s revealing (and depressing) to read and re-read reviews in light of Kate Ince\u2019s vision. In a 2007 New York Times review of Things We Lost In The Fire\u2014 with Halle Berry as Audrey Burke, a new widow coming to terms with her husband\u2019s murder, and Benicio del Toro\u2014Stephen Holden wrote: \u201cMs. Berry essentially reprises the kind of hysterical meltdown she performed in Monster\u2019s Ball, which won her an Oscar as much for her nerve in becoming unstrung during sex as for her acting.\u201d \nMs. Berry, in 2002, was the first black woman to receive an Oscar for Best Actress. \nThe fraught, cathartic scenes of intimacy in Monster\u2019s Ball form part of the characters\u2019 transformation, but Holden only sees a black woman having unhinged sex\u2014the right black woman, and one whose success in the role he attributes to this \u201cmeltdown\u201d eroticism, something he tells us is quite separate from the craft of acting. \nIn Things We Lost In The Fire , Audrey Burke and del Toro\u2019s character\u2014Brian, a recovering heroin addict\u2014navigate the implications of her husband\u2019s death. There\u2019s a pained attraction between them that remains just that. But Holden writes with the bitter disappointment of a certain kind of massage client denied his happy ending. \u201cMs. Berry\u2019s beauty is at odds with her character\u2019s seeming asexuality,\u201d he explains, \u201cwhich is why Audrey\u2019s lovey-dovey moments with Brian feel perfunctory.\u201d If only Ms. Berry had just taken her clothes off and done her thing! Perhaps then he\u2019d have given the film a better review. \nFew critics seem to have as much fun sizing women up than The New Yorker \u2018s Anthony Lane. (If you grumble about him, you\u2019re not nuanced enough in your thinking, we\u2019re told. He\u2019s an Oxford-educated badass with an Englishman\u2019s love of women and a scorched-earth wit.) \nLane\u2019s gems are many: Out of Sight, he said in 1998, \u201cconfirms Jennifer Lopez\u2019 status as a qualified voluptuary,\u201d though Lopez\u2014one of the few Latinas ever to become a major celebrity\u2014is not \u201cplausible\u201d in her role as a U.S. marshall. Julia Roberts was \u201cnot sexy\u201d and \u201cmore lovable than desirable\u201d as of 2001\u2014and will she \u201cget married again and raise a little Bratt pack?\u201d Whatever the case, she\u2019s one \u201cstoned foal\u201d whose mouth Lane wants to \u201cclimb into.\u201d \nIn Baby Mama, Tiny Fey, Lane noticed in 2008, wears a skirt so short \u201cthat Christy Turlington would struggle to carry off.\u201d In the late 80s, my college roommate and I had pictures of the brat-pack supermodels on our dorm wall. As a child, I ripped out pictures from a Playboy I\u2019d found stashed somewhere and taped them to the outside of my bedroom door for all to see. It was a matrix of eyes, hair, breasts and legs. Why did I do this at six years old? I don\u2019t know. The bodies fascinated me. It was the 70\u2019s. My parents decided the best thing to do was allow it, so they did, showing all visitors to our home my exhibit. Apparently, though, Fey \u201cisn\u2019t big enough to make a joke of her ripeness\u201d but \u201cshe\u2019s no Lily Tomlin.\u201d She\u2019s in between! Like Lucille Ball\u2014and unlike \u201cpoor pokey Gwyneth\u201d Paltrow, no match for a \u201cbronzed, strolling\u201d Jude Law in 1999\u2019s The Talented Mr. Ripley. \nIn the Sex & City movie from 2008, Kim Cattrall just won\u2019t conform to acceptable norms of female sexuality and behavior\u2014she does too much \u201cslurping\u201d and (gasp) \u201cswallowing\u201d with caricatured gusto and in close-up shots Lane found grotesque, as he did the film\u2019s \u201cblunt-clawed cattiness\u201d and \u201cbitch\u201d sensibility, something he also refers to as \u201chormonal hobbits\u2026all obsessed with a ring.\u201d A male colleague of mine looked on in horror once as I wolfed down a sandwich, then expressed his disgust; another man accused me of \u201cgobbling\u201d with my \u201chead in the plate\u201d then broke off our date. \nThen there\u2019s the infamous treatment of Scarlett Johansson\u2014who, in 2014, Lane remembered for her \u201cbackside barely veiled in peach-colored underwear,\u201d\u201cthe honey of her voice,\u201d for being one who \u201clooks tellingly radiant in the flesh\u201d as though \u201cmade from champagne.\u201d It drew a sharp reaction from women in media, but Lane is apparently worth the website traffic and liquid brilliance. Even in woke times, feminist complaint is considered the stuff of censoring vulgarians\u2014so Lane keeps ogling, as in his recent \u201ctop 10\u201d reasons to see Wonder Woman. Seventh on this list is Gal Gadot\u2019s beauty. \u201cIt may be skin-deep, but so is a reel of film.\u201d This apparently is her weapon, one that hints at human depth and mystery, Lane says, trying for gravitas. Wonder Woman\u2019s looks \u201cflusters\u201d men and leaves them \u201cunmanned.\u201d \nLane is also moved by the beauty-contestant roots of actresses. In the Wonder Woman list, he gives a litany of celebs to emerge from that world: Gadot, Michelle Pfeiffer, Lucia Bose and Sophia Loren\u2014\u201dwho made the finals but failed to win, which makes you wonder what the other contestants were like.\u201d In the piece on \u201cQueen Bee\u201d Julia Roberts: \u201cshe had already been voted one of twelve finalists in her high-school beauty pageant, which makes you wonder what the other eleven girls looked like.\u201d Lane attempts to pass this off as a scholarly interest in the origin story of celebrities, but his writing suggests he\u2019d rather have been a fly on the wall in those pageant dressing rooms, where body charts hang on the walls and distorted beauty standards are cemented. \nAd executives came regularly to my school in Caracas when I was in junior high. The teachers would line us up in the hallway, and the executives would walk around looking up and down our faces and bodies, up and down, up and down. They picked out blonde, sun-tanned and light-eyed children for their ads. No indigenous-looking Venezuelan kids, and no kid deemed Jewish-looking either. Then the rest of us were dismissed, and weeks later we\u2019d see our schoolmates smiling over the Heinz ketchup or the Kool-Aid on Venevision TV. We were painfully envious, though we pretended not to care. \nSome of Lane\u2019s descriptions speak to a quaint aesthetic of women\u2019s beauty and little more. Either way they give scant insight into the film in question, or the character, or woman. More cultural blood sport than serious criticism. As Manohla Dargis wrote recently in the Times : \u201cCinema has long served as a vehicle for male onanism, a space in which male fantasies about sexual power over women are expressed on screen and enacted behind the camera.\u201d (And published in film reviews, I\u2019d add.) \nIt\u2019s seriously no wonder so many actresses who manage to make a career in this system are aged out by 40. \nIt\u2019s too bad more male critics don\u2019t follow the lead of The New Yorker \u2018s Richard Brody, who seems to treat screen performers as fully-dimensional human beings. He appears to understand, in a recent observation about Mother! that now seems tepid, given recent news revealing far worse, the grim purpose women often serve for filmmakers and other artists. Mother!, Brody argues, is \u201ca report from the realm of art, of male artists\u201d and how many of them \u201cdraw their artistic and personal sustenance from the blood of young women,\u201d in acts of \u201cvirtual vampirizing.\u201d \nCritics could resist such vampirizing themselves. But plenty want their actresses babe-fresh and dewy, as in a much-rebuked Vulture review by David Edelstein that insists \u201cthe only grace note in the generally clunky Wonder Woman is its star, the five-foot-ten-inch Israeli actress and model Gal Gadot, who is somehow the perfect blend of superbabe-in-the woods innocence and mouthiness.\u201d Like Edelstein, I, too, was mystified by the accolades this film received. Unlike him, Gadot\u2019s measurements were not a redeeming feature for me. \nThere\u2019s a place for thinking about how bodies take up space on the screen, as Kate Ince argues. It\u2019s especially relevant in physical comedy. But the locker-room dissections here, with their supermodel potshots, are not that. One can only imagine the possibilities that would open up if women, like men, were viewed holistically on screen, and their physicality\u2014their movement and expression, and the camera angles used to show these\u2014were judged for how effectively a character\u2019s experience is embodied, rather than whether or not they turn men on. \nOne last remembrance of reading the great Anthony Lane: In his review of Showgirls , echoing the titty-bar laureates who made this film, he observed that Elizabeth Berkley\u2019s \u201cbreasts are more expressive than her face.\u201d He adds: \u201cI saw to my surprise that even her lipstick was wearing lipstick.\u201d \nI supposed we can tell ourselves it\u2019s the very gimmick of objectification in this crap film that\u2019s being mocked. But it brings me to another unsubtle moment of my own: A man on the street was once turned on by my own mildly expressive breasts and shouted it out as though he were talking directly to them. I responded with an expletive and walked on by. He turned around, chased me, kicked me viciously in the abdomen and back, and threatened to smash against my face the beer bottle he held. I was suddenly visible, to him and to the universe. A friend he\u2019d been walking with stood by and laughed. People on the street watched. Apologize, bitch! the man kept screaming as I cowered and he kicked. It was on the same block where I worked. A colleague finally called the police, but by that time the man had run off and they could do nothing. He didn\u2019t leave me broken or bleeding, they said. \nBy nighttime, the red welts on my body had turned a dark blue. I crossed paths with my attacker many times after that. I never again looked directly at him or said anything, and he didn\u2019t seem to remember me. \nI was young when I became a devotee of the male reviewers excerpted here. Back then, I wanted to think like them, write like them and be them in some way. That never happened. But their words are stored in my memory like shards of glass in skin. Having said as much, I still read the champagne-and-honey drenched reviews of certain man-critics now and then, when theirs is the only opinion of a film I want to watch. I just hope for the best\u2014brace myself for the creepiness, for the body memories, for the triggers\u2014and read on. \nTal Abbady \u2018s work has appeared in The Atlantic, The New York Times, The LA Times, Literary Hub and other publications.

Today I want to talk about movies\u2026Christmas movies to be exact. I love to eat cookies, drink cacao and watch Christmas movies in December before Christmas, and I want to share with you all some of my favorites, So let\u2019s start!\n \n\nChristmas with the Kranks \nFinally alone for the holidays, Luther (Tim Allen) and Nora Krank (Jamie Lee Curtis) plan to eschew the Christmas traditions and take a cruise in the Caribbean instead. This doesn\u2019t sit well with their Christmas-obsessed neighbors Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd) and Walt Scheel (M. Emmet Walsh), who are determined to win the annual \u201cbest-decorated street\u201d competition, and the Kranks soon find themselves social outcasts because of their lack of Christmas spirit.\nWhy I love it: It\u2019s a very funny, light and nice Christmas comedy. We love to watch it together with all the family.Recommend for a little \u201cslice of life\u201d Christmas comedy!\n \n \n\nHome Alone \nWhen bratty 8-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) acts out the night before a family trip to Paris, his mother (Catherine O\u2019Hara) makes him sleep in the attic. After the McCallisters mistakenly leave for the airport without Kevin, he awakens to an empty house and assumes his wish to have no family has come true. But his excitement sours when he realizes that two con men (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) plan to rob the McCallister residence and that he alone must protect the family home. \nWhy I love it: Cmon this is a classic. I have so many good childhood memories of this movie, we always watched it on the Christmas day.If you haven\u2019t watch it then I definitely recommend you to see it!!!\n \n\nThe Santa Clause \nDivorced dad Scott (Tim Allen) has custody of his son (Eric Lloyd) on Christmas Eve. After he accidentally kills a man in a Santa suit, they are magically transported to the North Pole, where an elf explains that Scott must take Santa\u2019s place before the next Christmas arrives. Scott thinks he\u2019s drea ming, but over the next several months he gains weight and grows an inexplicably white beard. Maybe that night at the North Pole wasn\u2019t a dream after all \u2014 and maybe Scott has a lot of work to do. \nWhy I love it: It\u2019s such a magical and cute movie, definitely for the whole family.I just love the storyline and the actors \u2026Definitely, a great movie to watch before Christmas or on the Christmas day.\n \nTaxi 3 \nA gang of thieves calling themselves the Santa Claus Gang are wreaking havoc, and the police can\u2019t keep up.
