Andre loved animals and was thrilled when we worked my hand raised bobcat, Fluffy, into his persona as a giant stuck with his niece and his cat in a land of little people (think Gulliver's Travels). The bonus was since I drove a motorhome on the tour (office on wheels), this gave Andre a place to actually stretch out while on the road. He would lay down and Fluffy would curl up with him. Their snoring easily drowned out my tape player.\nWelp, it is over folks.

I once admired Gillibrand. No longer. Even if she thinks she is doing this to help enact legislation to help victims and that is her justifications for throwing an innocent man under the bus, she and the others who are telling Franken to resign without an investigation are WRONG.\nI would not be surprised if they were all secretly Russian traitors too at this point. I really wouldn't. I wouldn't ever vote for Gillibrand if I lived in her district now, and I know what she did to try and get the MJIA passed, but today shows that she doesn't believe in JUSTICE at all. Just POLITICS.\nfark her.\nOn mobile, so hard to Quote: all properly and stuff...\nI agree with the part of defending one's self against allegations of inappropriate conduct. There has to be some kind of middle ground between \"swept under rug\" and \"public execution\". This is why I would like to see All Franken step back (hear me out) and run for his seat again in the eventual special election / general election. Let him step back, pay his penance (or fight to clear his name) and ask the primary voters or the voters if MN if he has their trust and faith again. When he runs again, anyone who brings up the old allegations can be painted as living in the past, or being un-Christian, or whatever response fits.\nThe Dems, and the liberal spectrum have got to understand that humans are flawed. They make mistakes, and that not everything must be perfect, and those who fall short must be cast out forever. There has to be standards, but they can't be so inflexible that a small infraction (say, a dumb blonde joke) gets you an eternal label of \"sexist garbage\" unworthy of support (exaggeration sure, but it feels like it's coming sometimes)\nYes, the D's have to keep the high ground, but the high ground doesn't automatically guarantee victory. You can stand on your mountain of superiority and be so sure that you alone are best, but the bottom crawlers and mudslingers below can still bring you down with numbers if you're all alone up there. And then what?\nThere must be standards, but also understanding the imperfection of all of us.\nAnd honestly, I think Gillebrand is keeping this loud and obvious to shore up support for 2020. Prep for a run as the real New England champion of women, without the same baggage as HRC. But someone needs to sit her down and explain that sacrificing the party for her own power is a path to obstruction at best, and ruin at worst.\n\"All must fall, and those who stand themselves highest, fall hardest\"\nThe coastal liberals are their own worst enemy, and they demand instant gratification of social justice as if everything should suddenly turn on a dime.\nThere is a middle ground, and just because the Right dragged the Overton Window down to the 10 yard line, that doesn't mean the best response is to demand a big yardage play downfield.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:34.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad775861757e8d5a8a3323ed07116d00b35c99c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb.8wlIH94ZGNIXH1xP0WG4eWyb_g9dr.9.o6WHzOQsgKGkhEAKiwJV0APuGu5s2dyOF5zoyLpK_3j4_CXgTNpbF_zyqwAdFjZ9.VhJ6DqGBfRwlvl2GjquakH58PQBJEGDwxAARSUhlRWVVsT7XR4jjyzYV2hjEXk2N8DuYjjMjGu3669E7JBIS2MnWklwNw07Rbs5gAdpz75kfwe3i09kMwcfD4c2Lh7vvSkwQFOV9GvPYvLkeNxbC0E8xFP698dSkEjxZYIvUx4JfGqqtZ0JHncmGy0STQ_s-", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/entertainment/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Entertainment links", "title": "(9830008) Trumpy and Bibi are trying to kick off armageddon, the Tax Fraud bill is stalled out, the Silence Breakers are the people of the year and WHAT THE %^&$ DO YOU MEAN IT'S ONLY WED??

Even if you don\u2019t drink a lot, learning what you can about wine is useful. Learning about wine allows you to use it more effectively for cooking, entertaining and even showing off every now and then.\nSimply because a bottle of wine is more expensive than another does not mean that it is necessarily better. You don\u2019t have to buy the most expensive bottles of wine that you find. Try wine at all different price levels. You may like something better that is less expensive than what you usually buy.\n\nA good tip if you\u2019re interested in learning more about wine is to go to as many wine tastings as you can. Wine tastings are great because they allow you to try out all kinds of wine which will help you figure out what you like and what you don\u2019t like.\nAvoid over chilling white wines. Many wine drinkers will buy a bottle of their favorite white and return home to pop it in the fridge. While chilling whites is important, too much cold will diminish flavors in the wine; sometimes the most important ones. Target a temperature around 60 degrees up to 68 degrees to achieve the prime flavor.\nUse the right stemware when serving wine. Your guests can be impressed by your wine more easily if it is served in a flawless glass. It\u2019s time to buy some new pieces when you notice chips or when the stemware becomes outdated.\nSparkling wines and champagnes should be poured very cold. If you drink these beverages at room temperature, the flavor will be compromised. Before you drink your champagne, be sure to chill it in the refrigerator for at least an hour.\nDo not limit yourself to countries that are known for exporting wines such as Spain or France. In https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/18/best-of-barbera-wine-piedmont-italy-david-williams , some of the best wines on the market are from Argentina or from New Zealand. You should not form your opinion of a country after tasting only a couple different wines.\nYou can read as much as you like about wine, but ultimately, you have to decide for yourself if you like it or not. Price often doesn\u2019t matter. You may like an inexpensive bottle of red wine much more than a costlier version. Don\u2019t apologize for your tastes. Drink what you enjoy.\nWhen it comes to the differences between red and white wine, one major element is how they wines are fermented and aged. Red grapes are pressed twice, releasing more tannins and brightening the color of the wine. This is what makes the color so beautiful and the flavor so bold.\nBuying wine online can be rewarding. Traveling can become expensive, which means visiting local vineyards and wineries in other states is not possible. By researching online, you can find not only great wineries, but also great deals as well. Buying online also gives you the ability to buy in bulk at better savings.\nTake notes on any wine that you try out. You aren\u2019t going to really know what you are doing at first. However, over time, you will start noticing specific trends in your notes and reactions. You might even see that your reaction to particular wine\u2019s changes as you drink more of them.\nIf you plan on pairing a wine with lasagna, try going with red wine. The higher acidity in these types of wines pair quite well with the tomato sauce that is usually in lasagna. Many lasagnas have ingredients like green peppers, and the flavor of a red wine can accentuate them.\nConsider keeping a journal to record the kinds of wines you enjoy and distaste. This helps you keep track of all the wines that you love and the ones that you don\u2019t, which will help you prepare your palette. Carry around a pad and pencil at all times just to be safe.\nIf you need to save wine for another day, cork it and stick it in your refrigerator. The coolness in your fridge will help slow down all of the chemical changes happening in your wine. It\u2019s best if you can finish that wine off within a day, otherwise you may find it tastes quite different than when you uncorked it.\n\nLook for bottles of wine that have a screwcap rather than a cork. Since cork has imperfections in it, it may affect the taste of the wine. While http://www.foodandwine.com/travel/restaurants/los-angeles-chef-perfected-mozzarella-sticks doesn\u2019t happen often, it is a possibility. Screwcaps are becoming more popular and are less likely to affect the wine in any way.\nLook for bottles of wine that have a screwcap rather than a cork. Since cork has imperfections in it, it may affect the taste of the wine. While this doesn\u2019t happen often, it is a possibility. Screwcaps are becoming more popular and are less likely to affect the wine in any way.\nWhen choosing a wine glass, select one that is large (around 20 to 22 ounces). With this size, you can swirl the wine around more freely. Furthermore, select a glass wine that is clear and thin with a long stem. Make sure the glass curves slightly inward at the top.\nHistory has shown how enjoyable a good wine can be and when selected wisely. Any meal can be highlighted by a delicious red, white or sparkling bubbly!

Methods This is a retrospective cross-sectional analysis using birth certificate data from 2004 to 2015 retrieved from the Finger Lakes Regional Perinatal Data System. Primiparous women with singleton pregnancies were analyzed in the study. Two multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to assess potential paternal risk factors including age, race/ethnicity, and education on four birth outcomes, including preterm birth (PTB), low birthweight (LBW), high birthweight (HBW), and small for gestational age (SGA). Results A total of 36,731 singleton births were included in the analysis. Less paternal education was significantly related to an elevated risk of PTB, LBW, and SGA, even after adjustment for maternal demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). Paternal race/ethnicity was also significantly associated with all four birth outcomes ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) while controlling for maternal factors. Older paternal age was associated with increased odds (OR 1.012, 95% CI 1.003\u20131.022) of LBW. Maternal race/ethnicity partially mediated the association of paternal race/ethnicity with HBW and SGA. Maternal education partially mediated the relationship between paternal education and SGA. Conclusion Paternal factors were important predictors of adverse birth outcomes. Our results support the inclusion of fathers in future studies and clinical programs aimed at reducing adverse birth outcomes.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2jmPFhZ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:35.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a0f850c73bd0ed9836a1ee45f42b32cfd77ac2a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIjPxVeQLC_96W7YzADB0B_OMLbFY6DuAoa6gaReijaxrfBVzp_YoprNeTVHMqNWaETnRxqxYdbIi", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=180", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.

He is talking to a Southern, evangelical audience, firm in their belief that they are right and everyone outside their group, wrong and perhaps sinful and evil, standard complaint about their \"enemy\". In fact, to them, Democrats represent everything they are against. Democrats are slandered as \"anti-moral\", \"anti-religion\", and \"anti-American\". Having been spoon-fed this ideology for decades, they have come to believe it a basic element in their religion.\n\nAlso, the appeal of Bannon's words goes far beyond mere politics. It extends to the basic view that Mormons are \"the other\" and should be condemned as not like them. Evangelicals consider Mormons not be Christian because of the peculiarities of the Mormon faith in their eyes. Just like Muslims, Mormons are outside their world. This is similar to the attitude toward Catholics except where Catholics support some of their world view.\n\nThis religious bigotry is central to Bannon's appeal.

The MUT last week declared an industrial dispute and issued directives, including a one-day strike to be held on 15 December over \u201clack of adherence to agreed deadlines in which the college had to provide counter proposal for the financials of the Collective Agreement being negotiated.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT Students have expressed concerns over a number of directives which could potentially affect them specifically - such as no communication with students beyond time-tabled lectures and contact hours, the non-use of Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), and the non-monitoring of apprenticeships. Some students have told this newspaper that they were unable to access any of the material that has been published on the VLE since the start of the scholastic year ever since the directives were implemented on 4 December. Asked about this, Bonnici insisted that students are still allowed to access the service and have the relative material made available to them given that the scholastic semester is almost over. But some students think otherwise, as the service is no longer available. Other students did say that their required material remained available to them, but raised other concerns over a dense assignment and exam schedule, as many teachers sent their students their assignments early, rather than stagger them, due to the industrial action. Bonnici told the newsroom that he was looking into the issue, but is yet to provide further information. The trade dispute began over the new collective agreements between the union and the educational establishment, after the old agreements expired over a year ago. The industrial action, which will culminate with a one-day strike on 15 December, was declared due to the lack of adherence to agreed deadlines in which MCAST had to provide counter proposal for the financials of the collective Agreement being negotiated. Bonnici noted that it is clear that whilst the union is taking the agreements seriously, with all the necessary commitment towards its members, MCAST is instead dragging its feet and finding excuses to refrain from adhering to commitments to the detriment of educators and ultimately students. Bonnici revealed that there has been no communication with the Ministry of Education itself over the trade dispute ever since industrial action was initiated, but said there has been some correspondence with the Permanent Secretary. <a href='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a1549226&cb=264'  //ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=21&cb=264&n=a1549226'  //ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/ck.php?n=afd78ad2&cb=60'  //ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=92&cb=60&n=afd78ad2'  //ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a900f44e&cb=29'  //ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=20&cb=29&n=a900f44e'  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marco bonnici", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonnici", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the malta independent", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:35.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6772085a84c3d0855662d845d3228377c7e6597d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeFJj5RZ7biGEFK7vLBhdBc5S6t8eWWRmrwNQ4XaaoTn4tdDWzUCqxWzYDbTcrRze6xQLZDhEscMBllxiRZi7RDNCjzMS15FPfcihtEtA7QXYOeq2e_qG_LrCWzrTDL6M-", "site_full": "www.deseretnews.com", "site": "deseretnews.com", "site_section": "http://deseretnews.com/utah/index.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Utah News | Deseret News", "title": "Utah governor calls Steve Bannon a 'Mormon bigot'", "title_full": "Utah governor calls Steve Bannon a 'Mormon bigot' | Deseret News", "published": "2017-12-06T16:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 102, "participants_count": 86, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/7b76bc9846.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2973, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f51d780e39a1122baf029c340b632e6888c7e514", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeFJj5RZ7biGEFK7vLBhdBc5S6t8eWWRmrwNQ4XaaoTn4tdDWzUCqxWzYDbTcrRze6xQLZDhEscMBllxiRZi7RDNCjzMS15FPfcihtEtA7QXYOeq2e_qG_YZv6jjC0q.L2pTAnCMUzlg--", "ord_in_thread": 56, "author": "Diego De La Vega", "published": "2017-12-06T20:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I was a teenager and in my twenties during the Vietnam War era.

It had long well-boned forelegs and the head was narrow, long, and broad between the ears. The jaws looked powerful and long, but deceptively weak. I had never seen that breed of dog before and I guess many people including few dog lovers have also not seen that dog.\nOut of curiosity, I asked the owner, about that dog. Rashmi Ravi informed me that, \u201cThis is an Indian dog breed with many different names like Mudhol Hound in the south, it was called Caravan hound by the British and Karwaani by the local villagers who owned the dog. It is most common in the southern part of the country mainly for guarding and hunting.\u201d I never knew about Mudhol Hound. Although the dog is not as fancy as the foreign breed but are disease-resistant and can survive in harsh-tropical conditions.\n\u201cThis dog variety was initially bred by Ghorpade kings of the erstwhile Kingdom of Mudhol (now in Bagalkot, North Karnataka) back in the 1920s, by crossing Persian and Turkish varieties with local dogs,\u201d says Kartik Davey who volunteers at Society for Indian Breeds of Dogs and owns Dhole\u2019s Den Bandipur. He also added that these breeds are very intelligent and a keen hunter. They are not very attractive and might look scary to some people but Mudhol\u2019s are very courageous, reserved and loyal.\nMost of the German Breeds & British Breeds have coloured fur and attractive physical features. The breed characteristics are well advertised and communicated but there are amazing Indian breeds. They are getting extinct due to lack of care and ignorance. It is high time that we must actively promote Indian breeds which are no less than any international breed in its characteristics.\nKartik also mentioned that unfortunately, not a lot of people are aware of this. Also, this breed is not typically found in cities, those are mixes. They are native to the rural plains or outskirts of cities.\nAccording to times report, the Army\u2019s Remount and Veterinary Corps (RVC) center in Meerut have trained six dogs of the desi breed Mudhol hounds and they are likely to be inducted by the end of this year and will be posted in Jammu & Kashmir. Earlier even the Army used foreign breeds like German Shepherds, Labradors, and Great Swiss Mountain. Mudhol hound has a strong lineage. With its speed and swiftness as well as size it would be good as a guard dog.\nDr. B.C. Ramakrishna, President, society for Indian Breeds of Dogs, Bangalore says, \u201d Mudhol hounds have a lifespan of 10 to 15 years. They are the happiest when they are outside. They require daily walks and exercise to remain healthy and physically well. They are low maintenance dog breeds when it comes to grooming. Don\u2019t wash them regularly otherwise it can remove its protective oils from skin and coat\u201d This breed will not respond to harsh treatment and also this breed of dogs has to be trained to socialize with other animals, especially smaller animals.\nHe also told me that, \u201cWith varied interests and different choices and even to show a social status sometimes people tend to import dogs from other countries.

Methods This is a retrospective cross-sectional analysis using birth certificate data from 2004 to 2015 retrieved from the Finger Lakes Regional Perinatal Data System. Primiparous women with singleton pregnancies were analyzed in the study. Two multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to assess potential paternal risk factors including age, race/ethnicity, and education on four birth outcomes, including preterm birth (PTB), low birthweight (LBW), high birthweight (HBW), and small for gestational age (SGA). Results A total of 36,731 singleton births were included in the analysis. Less paternal education was significantly related to an elevated risk of PTB, LBW, and SGA, even after adjustment for maternal demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). Paternal race/ethnicity was also significantly associated with all four birth outcomes ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) while controlling for maternal factors. Older paternal age was associated with increased odds (OR 1.012, 95% CI 1.003\u20131.022) of LBW. Maternal race/ethnicity partially mediated the association of paternal race/ethnicity with HBW and SGA. Maternal education partially mediated the relationship between paternal education and SGA. Conclusion Paternal factors were important predictors of adverse birth outcomes. Our results support the inclusion of fathers in future studies and clinical programs aimed at reducing adverse birth outcomes.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2jmPFhZ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:36.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6772085a84c3d0855662d845d3228377c7e6597d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeFJj5RZ7biGEFK7vLBhdBc5S6t8eWWRmrwNQ4XaaoTn4tdDWzUCqxWzYDbTcrRze6xQLZDhEscMBllxiRZi7RDNCjzMS15FPfcihtEtA7QXYOeq2e_qG_LrCWzrTDL6M-", "site_full": "www.deseretnews.com", "site": "deseretnews.com", "site_section": "http://deseretnews.com/utah/index.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Utah News | Deseret News", "title": "Utah governor calls Steve Bannon a 'Mormon bigot'", "title_full": "Utah governor calls Steve Bannon a 'Mormon bigot' | Deseret News", "published": "2017-12-06T16:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 102, "participants_count": 86, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/7b76bc9846.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2973, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "924f4a7111431771c9e2961b8a53f2790c278d49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeFJj5RZ7biGEFK7vLBhdBc5S6t8eWWRmrwNQ4XaaoTn4tdDWzUCqxWzYDbTcrRze6xQLZDhEscMBllxiRZi7RDNCjzMS15FPfcihtEtA7QXYOeq2e_qG_YZv6jjC0q.KL217AVMt2EA--", "ord_in_thread": 68, "author": "Liberal On Planet Zion", "published": "2017-12-06T21:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Imsmarterthanyou?\n\n\u201cWould like to know exactly what court has convicted Judge Roy Moore of sexually assaulting anyone?

The Redmi 5 succeeds the much popular Redmi 4 smartphone, and it might launch in the Indian market in early 2018. Xiaomi has been teasing both the smartphones for quite some time. Here\u2019s everything you need to about the Xiaomi Redmi 5 and the Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus smartphones. Xiaomi Redmi 5 \nXiaomi touts the Redmi 5 as the cheapest smartphone with an 18:9 display. It packs a 5.7-inch HD+ 18:9 display, and is powered by the power-efficient Snapdragon 450 chipset. The device comes in two variants- one with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, and the other one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Both the variant has support for microSD card for storage expansion. \nThe Redmi 5 runs MIUI 9 out of the box with several features such as game booster mode, split screen mode, etc. This entire package is backed by a 3300mAh battery. Sadly, this a downgrade when compared to the 4100mAh battery seen on the Redmi 4. However, Xiaomi is packing a much efficient Snapdragon 450 SoC, that might deliver better battery life as compared to the Redmi 4. Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus \nNext up, Xiaomi launched the Redmi 5 Plus smartphone, a bigger variant of the Redmi 5. The Redmi 5 Plus has a 5.99-inch Full HD+ display, compared to the 5.7-inch HD+ display on the Redmi 5. Xiaomi\u2019s love with the Snapdragon 625 SoC continues with the Redmi 5 Plus as it uses the same SoC. So far, Xiaomi has launched as many as five smartphones with Snapdragon 625 SoC. Nevertheless, it\u2019s one of the best chipsets from Qualcomm\u2019s house. \nThe Redmi 5 Plus comes in two different variants- a 3GB and 32GB model along with a 4GB RAM and 64GB storage model. Storage can be expanded with a microSD card. \nIt comes with a 12MP rear camera with larger 1.25?m pixel size and f/2.2 aperture. Up front, there\u2019s a 5MP front-facing camera with soft LED flash. The Redmi 5 Plus also boots MIUI 9 out of the box, and the smartphone is backed by a 4000mAh battery. Xiaomi did not mention any fast charging support for both the smartphones. Xiaomi Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus Pricing and Availability \nAs stated earlier, Xiaomi is touting both the smartphones as cheapest ones with 18:9 displays . In fact, the company went ahead and compared both the phones with devices such as Honor 7X, Huawei Mate 10, Oppo R11S, etc. \nTalking about the pricing, the Redmi 5 starts at Yuan 799 (approx. Rs 7,800) for the 2GB+16GB model and Yuan 899 (approx. Rs 8750) for the 3GB+32GB model. \nThe Redmi 5 Plus, on the other hand, is priced at Yuan 999 (approx Rs 9,700 for the 3GB+32GB model, and Yuan 1299 (approx. Rs 12,700) for the premium 4GB+64GB model. Xiaomi is yet to announce the Indian launch date of both the phones.

Our previous paper showed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) played a crucial role in L-selectin- and PSGL-1-mediated F-actin redistribution and assembly during neutrophil rolling on E-selectin. However, it is not clear whether L-selectin and PSGL-1 induce other similar physiology events by PI3K. Here, we investigated the possibility of PI3K linking the signaling pathways of L-selectin and PSGL-1 to IL-18 transcription. We first demonstrated that L-selectin and PSGL-1 stimulation upregulated IL-18 transcription level in Jurkat cells. Then we found that PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced L-selectin- and PSGL-1-induced mRNA upregulation of IL-18 in Jurkat cells. Transfection of phosphatase and tensin homolog expressing plasmid inhibited the transcription level of IL-18. Therefore, PI3K is a signal linker between L-selectin and PSGL-1 in IL-18 transcriptional activation at the promoter level. To our knowledge, this is the first time to directly link PI3K to L-selectin- and PSGL-1-mediated IL-18 transcription, providing a foundation for intervention of PI3K-related inflammation.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2iys6lu", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "jurkat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:37.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6772085a84c3d0855662d845d3228377c7e6597d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeFJj5RZ7biGEFK7vLBhdBc5S6t8eWWRmrwNQ4XaaoTn4tdDWzUCqxWzYDbTcrRze6xQLZDhEscMBllxiRZi7RDNCjzMS15FPfcihtEtA7QXYOeq2e_qG_LrCWzrTDL6M-", "site_full": "www.deseretnews.com", "site": "deseretnews.com", "site_section": "http://deseretnews.com/utah/index.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Utah News | Deseret News", "title": "Utah governor calls Steve Bannon a 'Mormon bigot'", "title_full": "Utah governor calls Steve Bannon a 'Mormon bigot' | Deseret News", "published": "2017-12-06T16:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 102, "participants_count": 86, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/7b76bc9846.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2973, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6345191e8eefdec3b5ac958be7e383e3e50c5fa1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeFJj5RZ7biGEFK7vLBhdBc5S6t8eWWRmrwNQ4XaaoTn4tdDWzUCqxWzYDbTcrRze6xQLZDhEscMBllxiRZi7RDNCjzMS15FPfcihtEtA7QXYOeq2e_qG_YZv6jjC0q.KoKHEbRQhfdw--", "ord_in_thread": 78, "author": "Red Smith", "published": "2017-12-06T23:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "@Patriot\nBoth Democrats and Republicans president's were involved in keeping us in Vietnam, so you can't just blame the Dems.

Dr. Katsuya Takasu tells The Associated Press in Tokyo that \u201cit feels like it\u2019s finally coming home.\u201d He says he\u2019s trying to figure out how to give it to the only grandson of current Emperor Akihito, because there\u2019s a limit on gifts to the imperial family.

Sara Gelser\u2019s efforts in the battle against sexual harassment in the workplace have been honored by Time magazine. \nGelser, whose Senate District 8 includes Albany and Corvallis, and dozens of other women were honored as Persons of the Year by Time for \u201cbreaking the silence\u201d on the issue. Time annually devotes a year-end issue to featuring and profiling a person, a group, an idea, or an object that \"for better or for worse ... has done the most to influence the events of the year.\" \nIn the Time story by Stephanie Zacharek, Eliana Dockterman and Haley Sweetland Edwards, the writers note that \u201cwomen have had it with bosses and co-workers who not only cross boundaries but don't even seem to know that boundaries exist. They've had it with the fear of retaliation, of being blackballed, of being fired from a job they can't afford to lose. They've had it with the code of going along to get along. They've had it with men who use their power to take what they want from women. These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced. In some cases, criminal charges have been brought.\u201d \nHarvey Weinstein. Al Franken. Matt Lauer. Garrison Keillor. And Jeff Kruse. \nKruse, a state senator from Roseburg, has been accused of inappropriate touching by Gelser, who twice filed informal complaints before filing a formal one Nov. 15. Gelser alleges that Kruse touched her inappropriately multiple times from 2011 to 2017. \nGelser\u2019s charges include multiple occasions of unwanted touching, including twice on the Senate floor in which other senators intervened on Gelser\u2019s behalf. Gelser also requested seating assignments away from Kruse and instructed staffers not to meet with him or to send interns to his office. \nKruse has denied inappropriately touching her. The complaint process, which could led to Kruse\u2019s expulsion, is likely to conclude in the spring. \nGelser previously filed informal complaints in 2016 and this year, but said she was frustrated that the conduct continued. Gelser said that as many as 15 other women also have accused Kruse of unwanted touching. \nGelser traveled to San Francisco to be interviewed and photographed and praised the Time staff. \u201cIt was such a thoughtful, creative group of people,\u201d she said. \nAt the time of the session she did not know that the story was in the running for Person of the Year. A list of potential subjects came out last weekend and Gelser made sure to check for the story Wednesday morning while she was getting her kids ready for school. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it is such an important conversation.\u201d \nGelser stressed, however, that the problem is not a new one. \n\u201cThe discussion is at a heightened level, but the problem has been around for decades, since Anita Hill,\u201d said Gelser, referring to the university law professor who in 1991 accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment during Thomas\u2019 confirmation process for the United State Supreme Court. \n\u201cWe need to believe women,\u201d Gelser said, \u201cand hold offenders accountable. The change isn\u2019t going to come from hearing from people who\u2019ve experienced it. The change has to come from the attitude in which nobody thinks that they have a right to put their hand on you in the first place.\u201d \nGelser remains concerned that many women who experience harassment can\u2019t come forward because of concerns about retaliation. \n\u201cThat is where I will remain focused, doing what I can,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I can play some small part in it that\u2019s a great thing. It\u2019s not about the women in the Time story. It\u2019s about the experiences of women all across the country. We need to keep telling that bigger story.\u201d \nContact reporter James Day at or 541-758-9542. Follow at Twitter.com/jameshday or gazettetimes.com/blogs/jim-day .

Trump\u2019s move to recognize the divided city of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital may have triggered a worldwide chorus of critics but the president had his ears closely tuned to his supporters at home. For Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \u201cWhile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\u201d the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \u201cToday, I am delivering.\u201d Those were words to savor for a president who\u2019s been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed \u2013 sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns. Repealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump\u2019s frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. The president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. On Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel\u2019s claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He\u2019s now checked that box \u2013 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. Steve Bannon, the president\u2019s former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. Observers were divided on how to score the president\u2019s action. \u201cIf I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\u201d said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cAny move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\u201d But Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump\u2019s words about the embassy as \u201cjust a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\u201d A host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. But after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. An email from Trump\u2019s campaign operation trumpeted: \u201cJerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\u201d And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \u201ccontinues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\u201d Critics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \u201cMy hope is it doesn\u2019t change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\u201d said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. Aaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \u201ctriumph of domestic politics and personal ego\u201d over \u201csound foreign policy.\u201d Trump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem\u2019s borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \u201can agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\u201d The president hasn\u2019t hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. During a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \u201cI will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\u201d Trump\u2019s critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \u201cWhat he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\u201d said Brinkley. \u201cIt\u2019s making people feel there\u2019s activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:39.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6772085a84c3d0855662d845d3228377c7e6597d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeFJj5RZ7biGEFK7vLBhdBc5S6t8eWWRmrwNQ4XaaoTn4tdDWzUCqxWzYDbTcrRze6xQLZDhEscMBllxiRZi7RDNCjzMS15FPfcihtEtA7QXYOeq2e_qG_LrCWzrTDL6M-", "site_full": "www.deseretnews.com", "site": "deseretnews.com", "site_section": "http://deseretnews.com/utah/index.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Utah News | Deseret News", "title": "Utah governor calls Steve Bannon a 'Mormon bigot'", "title_full": "Utah governor calls Steve Bannon a 'Mormon bigot' | Deseret News", "published": "2017-12-06T16:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 102, "participants_count": 86, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/7b76bc9846.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2973, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2f0e192a837bbbf5024af520e2c1b4075e237a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeFJj5RZ7biGEFK7vLBhdBc5S6t8eWWRmrwNQ4XaaoTn4tdDWzUCqxWzYDbTcrRze6xQLZDhEscMBllxiRZi7RDNCjzMS15FPfcihtEtA7QXYOeq2e_qG_YZv6jjC0q.LUc8Ld2AEHag--", "ord_in_thread": 80, "author": "Steve C.

AFP/The Local The real thing. Photo: Tiziana Fabi/AFP AFP/The Local 7 December 2017 10:31 CET+01:00 Unesco has declared Naples' trademark technique of pizza making part of the world's \"intangible heritage\". Chefs and historians explain just what makes it so special. READ ALSO: Unesco declares Naples' pizza spinning 'intangible heritage' \n\"After 250 years waiting, the pizza is a Unesco heritage! Congratulations Naples!\" cried pizza maker Enzo Coccia, as crowds in the street outside the Sorbillo pizzeria erupted into cheers. \nDozens more chefs were expected to hand out free pizza to locals and tourists in the southern city after the decision, which paid homage to pizza's key social as well as cultural role. \n\"Down the centuries, the Neapolitan art of pizza making has been based on a few key elements: water, flour, salt and yeast \u2013 and the excellent produce from the Campania countryside,\" Coccia said. \n\"But it is also the hands, heart and soul of the pizzaiolo which allow us to make magic,\" he added, describing the stretching and turning of the dough as \"a love and passion that we transmit to others\". \nThe pizza's humble ancestor, a plain affair usually tarted up with a bit of lard, was born less as an act of love than as a cheap, easy and fast way to feed the city's army of poor in the 18th century. \n\"In around 1750 the first pizza appeared in the taverns, after which people began to specialise as 'pizzaioli' [pizza chefs],\" said historian Antonio Mattozzi. \n\"By the end of the 18th century, the first pizzerias were born\". \nBut despite being an immediate hit with the locals, pizza failed to take off outside the city at first, he told AFP. READ ALSO: This map shows where to find the very best pizza in Italy \nIt took Queen Margherita's love of the classic tomato, mozzarella and basil version to fire up the imagination and taste buds of diners far and wide \u2013 at least, that is how the story goes. \nHoping to win the hearts of the commoners, the queen asked in 1889 to try their favourite dish. And while she was unconvinced by anchovy and Parmesan-topped versions, the basil delight won her over. \nLegend has it the winning combination was put together by pizza maker Raffaele Esposito, who baked it in the royal pizza oven in the grounds of the stunning hill-top Capodimonte Palace. \nPhoto: Tiziana Fabi/AFP \nThe Margherita offered to the queen was recreated on Tuesday in the 300-year old oven by pizzaioli who hold no truck with modern toppings like pineapple and are on a mission to defend the real thing. \n\"We are honoured to pass on secrets and tips,\" Gino Sorbillo told AFP. \n\"Each one of us might have a small detail that makes a difference, but we share them so that across the world those who want to make good Neapolitan pizza can do so\". \nHe said there were \"youngsters from every culture who get in touch with us asking to learn, even sending us photographs of their pizza attempts online saying 'what did I do wrong?'\" READ ALSO: Ten bizarre but tempting non-Italian pizzas \nBut fellow pizza maker Antonio Starita was not convinced that tips were enough, insisting that \"to learn the art, you need to do long apprenticeships in pizzerias\". \nCulture Minister Dario Franceschini, digging into a hot slice straight off the royal peel, said that while \"pizza has become a universal patrimony, many around the world don't even know it is Italian\". \n\"This Unesco decision will establish the truth once and for all: that pizza is a global food \u2013 but it was born in Naples, and in this very oven\". \nPhoto: Tiziana Fabi/AFP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "antonio starita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dario franceschini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margherita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raffaele esposito", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queen margherita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio mattozzi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coccia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gino sorbillo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enzo coccia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "capodimonte palace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "campania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naples", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:39.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6772085a84c3d0855662d845d3228377c7e6597d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeFJj5RZ7biGEFK7vLBhdBc5S6t8eWWRmrwNQ4XaaoTn4tdDWzUCqxWzYDbTcrRze6xQLZDhEscMBllxiRZi7RDNCjzMS15FPfcihtEtA7QXYOeq2e_qG_LrCWzrTDL6M-", "site_full": "www.deseretnews.com", "site": "deseretnews.com", "site_section": "http://deseretnews.com/utah/index.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Utah News | Deseret News", "title": "Utah governor calls Steve Bannon a 'Mormon bigot'", "title_full": "Utah governor calls Steve Bannon a 'Mormon bigot' | Deseret News", "published": "2017-12-06T16:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 102, "participants_count": 86, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/7b76bc9846.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2973, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "84851ba2dfea6949d3ed3904c3c5dd49ef53ea70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeFJj5RZ7biGEFK7vLBhdBc5S6t8eWWRmrwNQ4XaaoTn4tdDWzUCqxWzYDbTcrRze6xQLZDhEscMBllxiRZi7RDNCjzMS15FPfcihtEtA7QXYOeq2e_qG_YZv6jjC0q.I5Taay18z1mQ--", "ord_in_thread": 84, "author": "JohnInSLC", "published": "2017-12-06T23:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Bannon was playing the Mormon card to get support from evangelicals.
