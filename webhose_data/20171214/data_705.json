GBOB I was following one on GB last week that sounds a lot like that.\nLooked like it had never been handled.\nOut of Pennsylvania IIRC.... That must be the one... Not a mark on it anywhere - not on wood/not on blue.. Rifling's untouched.\nCustomer wants me to do a few things to it, but IMHO it would not help the value. Since it's a .375 I'm going to gently suggest only 'adjusting' that trigger down from the customary 5+ pounds down to maybe 3 or so.. If it was a varmint rifle I'd not hesitate to do some work on it..\nNRA Benefactor member.\nEx- USN (SS) '66-'69\nAlpha\n#12446296 - 12/06/17 Re: Lucky dog [ Re: Redneck ] Joined: Apr 2013\nPosts: 2,736 tmitch\nCampfire Guide tmitch\nCampfire Guide\nJoined: Apr 2013\nPosts: 2,736 Nice rifle! http:/ / www.gunbroker.com/ item/ 716649718\nThat seller knows how to get the most out of his sales with all the good photos.\nI have a Super Express (but with the bolt on the left side) set up with the same Leupold mounts.

We'll soon find out. The Democratic Senator from Minnesota is set to make an announcement Thursday where he is expected to address his future. Senate leaders and Democrats have united in calling for Franken to resign amid a slew of accusations of sexual harassment and groping. Franken is one of the latest high-profile politicians to be accused of sexual misconduct, a list that includes Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the longest-serving member of the House, announced his resignation Tuesday in the wake of multiple sexual harassment claims against him. Southern California fires: Evacuations ongoing as wildfires intensify \nThe wind-driven wildfires hitting Southern California will intensify Thursday after another blaze grew into a force of destruction. On Wednesday, a new wildfire in west Los Angeles, the Skirball fire , set several homes ablaze near Bel-Air and other exclusive neighborhoods. Nearly 200,000 people have been told to evacuate as a result of the five separate blazes. The Thomas fire, which started in Ventura County northwest of downtown Los Angeles, is considered the largest wildfire and has grown to 140 square miles, according to The Associated Press. Experts say that Santa Ana winds , one of the nation's most notorious wind events, have fueled the destructive wildfires and are expected to whip through the region for the remainder of the week. Net neutrality protests hit Verizon stores \nNet neutrality supporters will hold protests at Verizon stores on Thursday to show their opposition to the Federal Communications Commission's plans to roll back current net neutrality regulations . Net neutrality, or open Internet, is the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) should give consumers access to all legal content and applications on an equal basis, without favoring some sources or blocking others . The Republican-controlled FCC plans to vote Dec. 14 to overturn the Obama-era rules. Protesters chose Verizon stores because FCC Chairman Ajit Pai formerly was an attorney there. Verizon and other ISPs oppose net neutrality. Ex-USA Gymnastics team doctor faces sentencing \nFormer USA Gymnastics and Michigan State doctor Larry Nassar, who has been accused by more than 100 women of using his position of authority to sexually abuse them, is set to be sentenced Thursday on federal child pornography charges. A sentencing guideline calls for Nassar to receive 22-27 years in prison. In a separate case, Nassar, 54, pleaded guilty last month in state court to seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in connection with seven victims. Nassar's accusers include U.S. Olympians McKayla Maroney , Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas . Want to make changes to your Medicare coverage? Time's almost up \nMedicare's fall open enrollment period ends Thursday. The annual seven-week period, which began Oct. 15, is the time for adding or changing coverage related to Medicare Part C (known as an Advantage Plan) and Part D (prescription drug coverage). This is generally the only time of year you can make changes (If you want to sign up for Medicare for the first time, you have a window that starts three months before the month in which you turn 65 and ends three months after).

It strikes me that it reads 2:32 a.m. He is exactly 24 hours old and I am in the hospital. I am trying to teach him how to nurse, but know I have nothing to teach yet; I\u2019ve never done this before either. We\u2019re both novices and we\u2019ll learn together. I feel like I had him a moment ago, but have known him for a lifetime. He hangs in there, I hang in there, and eventually we find our way. \nThen I am sitting in my living room and suddenly he is walking around, throwing toys out of his toy bin. He\u2019s gotten more demanding lately, always wanting something. I love it and can\u2019t stand it all at the same time. I am exhausted, and need a break more than I ever thought I would. Taking care of him, and growing his sister inside of me, is tiring and I never get enough sleep. I daydream about when he\u2019s older and won\u2019t need me for every little thing. In the short time he has been with us, he has already taught me that it\u2019s possible to be really frustrated with someone while still loving them so damn much it almost hurts. I can\u2019t explain this to him, of course. \nThen I am leaning over him, his shoes are on the wrong feet. His younger brother is on my hip, while I try to teach him to tie his shoes. He is frustrated because he can\u2019t do it himself, and he doesn\u2019t want my help. I have a baby and two toddlers on top of me now, and his crying sends me over the edge. So I do ties his shoes for him, because we need to get the hell out of the house. I need different air. I need my kids strapped down. I want to see trees and get some caffeine and, dammit, I hope to find some relief. Just a little bit to recharge, then I can handle the weight of motherhood again. \nThen he is in the fourth grade. He wants Angry Bird cupcakes brought into school to celebrate his birthday, and I stay up late into the night making them. We\u2019ve reached a point where I can put my kids to bed, and they all stay there all night, not waking me until the morning. I no longer feel so depleted, so I have the energy to make cupcakes while they sleep. He wakes up the next morning and is over the moon about the cupcakes, but he asks me to carry them into his classroom. \u201cIt\u2019s so embarrassing,\u201d he tells me. So I take them in, knowing it will probably be the last year he wants to bring something into school to celebrate his birthday. \nThen he is 11, riding his old bike. He starts working with his grandfather in the summer to earn enough money to buy a new mountain bike. He saves, and saves some more. Finally, in September, he has enough and he proudly buys it himself. He talks to the salesman about bikes, and I see a glimpse of an older boy. A gentleman. Someone who is so knowledgeable about bikes and how they are put together and, for some reason, he looks different to me from that day forward. \nNow he is almost 14-years-old, getting ready for his first semi-formal dance on the last day of Junior High school. \u201cDo you need to bring a corsage or flowers?\u201d I ask him. \u201cNo,\u201d he says immediately. \u201cPeople don\u2019t do that , Mom. How dumb.\u201d And so I trust him and we show up without one. I drop him and his friend off at the curb and they beg me to leave, so I park up the road a bit to watch them wait for their dates. \nHow did we get here? Where did that little boy go? One day we are teaching our kids how to tie their shoes, then suddenly we are watching them get ready for their first semiformal dance, and we realize they teach us just as much as we teach them. \nOne day, we catch a glimpse of our child, doing something simple like fixing their hair or making a sandwich. They know we are watching them, but they have no idea we are thinking about the first time we held them. They don\u2019t know we feel a pang of guilt for all the times we needed to be away from them. They don\u2019t have a clue as to how much we actually love them. They aren\u2019t aware we are seeing them as a baby, a toddler, a small child, as the man or woman they are becoming, all at the same time. \nThey have no idea they are taking our breath away.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "smith", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "katie bingham-smith", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "katie bingham", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:46.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "abf8a9b955fdfa84339035171b41e3eca3586b0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPTD_v5emWZsM656wGwPzwI60NDuyERRH3fNywc6q4qqE3aHY5P_DKIybc0GyhG0GLmvNpm.OjRzyEcazQ_XvoViXwXpZ8kl.jQ--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g294225-i7219-o20-Indonesia.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Indonesia Forum, Travel Discussion for Indonesia - TripAdvisor", "title": "karma royal group promo prize - Bali", "title_full": "karma royal group promo prize - Bali Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2016-03-20T15:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "785060acb290f9f573ec76177294e5d4bfc5e749", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPTD_v5emWZsM656wGwPzwI60NDuyERRH3fNywc6q4qqE3aHY5P_DKIybc0GyhG0GLmvNpm.OjRzyEcazQ_XvoVit7ee8t1MQEA--", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T20:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "-:- Message from TripAdvisor staff -:- TripAdvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet TripAdvisor's forum guidelines with regards to the participation of business representatives.

Poundstretcher store \nPoundstretcher has taken a ten-year lease on the site and the opening is part of its ongoing expansion in the UK. \nThe deal was negotiated by property consultancy Harris Lamb, which has been tasked with identifying sites to aid the chain\u2019s growth plan. \nDavid Walton, head of retail at Harris Lamb, said that the team was particularly pleased with the latest store location. \n\u201cThis is a first-class location and we couldn\u2019t have chosen a better time to launch,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThis is a two-storey property offering just under 12,000 sq ft of sales and storage space, perfectly located on the corner of All Saints Square and Market Place at the heart of Bedworth town centre. \n\u201cWith neighbouring occupiers including Boots, Thorntons, Greggs and high street banks, there are high levels of footfall in the square, not to mention excellent transport links courtesy of Bedworth railway station and central bus stops.\u201d \nMr Walton said the run-up to Christmas was the perfect time to open. \nHe added: \u201cLaunching just two weekends before Christmas guarantees particularly high numbers of shoppers in the town, and we anticipate excellent visitor statistics on its opening weekend. \n\u201cWe are delighted to have secured such a well-appointed site on Poundstretcher\u2019s behalf within Warwickshire, and we will continue to identify suitable sites around the UK and negotiate terms on the chain\u2019s behalf as the retailer continues its expansion.\u201d Read More Download our all-new mobile app to get the latest news, sport and what's on.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nPeople interested in luxurious city living in Coventry will be given the chance to snap-up one of the new upmarket apartments being created in the former Co-op building early in the New Year. \nThe company behind The Co-Operative building in Corporation Street has announced the appointment of its agent to sell the luxury apartments. \nAnd it has also revealed details of a special preview event early in the New Year where a select few will be released for sale prior to full launch. \nEDG Property has instructed Knight Frank to market what are being described as the highest-specification one and two-bedroom apartments seen in Coventry yet.

I sigh. I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t pick up and hear what I know she is going to say. I can\u2019t, but I do. Every time. Because I can\u2019t ignore my mom. \n\u201cHi, Mom.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t know what your problem is.\u201d She spits at me. \n\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem.\u201d I say, grinding my teeth. \n\u201cYou and your dad are assholes. Do you think I\u2019m a child?\u201d Says the preacher\u2019s wife who rarely uses profanity. Sick Mom has no filter. Sick Mom uses words Well Mom would never, ever say. \nShe heard a conversation that took place between my dad and me, one where we were trying to decide what to do with her. She\u2019s abused my dad to the point where he can\u2019t stand it anymore. She hates him, hates the way he smells, the way he looks, the way he breathes, the way he walks, the way he sleeps, and she tells him this. Every minute of every day. I fear for him. I know that she would never hurt him, the well she, but the sick she hates him, and the sick she often references things like butcher knives and frying pans, so I speak to my father every morning when I first wake up to make sure that he\u2019s still alive. \nThat\u2019s what sickness does to a family. It makes it doubt the legs on which it stands. It makes it doubt the heart that makes it beat. It makes us doubt our mom. And it\u2019s terrible. \n\u201cNo, Mom. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a child.\u201d Even though we sort of treat her like one. My dad unplugged the stove to keep her from catching their house on fire. He disconnected her car battery so that she can\u2019t drive away when he isn\u2019t watching. We whisper behind her back and tiptoe around her, not wanting to strike her ever ready match. We make plans for her without her approval. But we don\u2019t think she is a child. \n\u201cMom. Please stop being mad at me.\u201d \n\u201cYou know what?\u201d \n\u201cWhat, Mom?\u201d \n\u201cYour husband should leave you. He should take your kids and leave and never look back. Those kids deserve better than you. And so does your husband. You don\u2019t appreciate him at all.\u201d \n\u201cI know, Mom.\u201d Because agreeing makes the conversation shorter, and I\u2019ve heard this at least four times today. She\u2019s also told me that I\u2019m a whore and a piece of shit and the worst mother on the planet. \nShe\u2019s angry with me because last time this happened, I made the decision to put her in the hospital, the one she calls \u201cthe loony bin,\u201d the one she refuses to go back to, the one that did nothing but make her worse. I hate myself for making that decision, but we didn\u2019t have a lot of choices. My brothers weren\u2019t brave enough to do it, and she became too much for my elderly father to control, and frankly, I didn\u2019t want her to kill him in his sleep, but that I don\u2019t tell anyone. \nShe also does not understand why I cannot visit her, why I won\u2019t allow my children to see her this way. She can\u2019t understand. They need to remember the well Nana. The Nana who always kept candy in her pocket and secretly handed them a piece each time I turned my back, the Nana who sang \u201cThe Itsy Bitsy Spider\u201d off key but with joy and giggled every time the song ended, the Nana who would sit and hold them on her lap, rocking in her chair, reading them books, content to have the chatter of children all around her, who played hide and go seek, who threw the baseball in the back yard. The Nana whose laugh was contagious and the best sound on earth. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re mad at me, Mom.\u201d \n\u201cSure you are. You don\u2019t care about me.\u201d And with that, she abruptly ends the call. I put down my phone. And I cry. Because my mom is sick, and nobody can answer the question: \u201cWhy?\u201d \nShe\u2019ll call me at least twenty more times that day, and I\u2019ll answer every time. And I\u2019ll listen to her assault of words because she\u2019s my mom, and I know she doesn\u2019t mean it. \nI know she doesn\u2019t mean it. \nI know she doesn\u2019t mean it. \nAnd I brace myself for the next stage. The worst stage of all. \nThe lights are on but nobody\u2019s home \n\u201cMom\u201d hasn\u2019t flashed on my phone screen in days. Yesterday, on her birthday, I called her, and we spoke. A simple, \u201chappy birthday, mom,\u201d conversation. I said, \u201cI love you,\u201d and she said, \u201cI love you, too,\u201d and we ended the call. That was yesterday. \nToday is my birthday. On normal birthdays, my mom calls me and recounts my birth. She tells me for at least the 35 th time that she went into labor with me at her birthday dinner, two days late. They rushed to the hospital where she continued to labor with me over night. \n\u201cEveryone from the church was there, and all I wanted was to be left alone,\u201d I hear her voice in my imagination, her normal well voice, tell me. \u201cMy room was full of people.\u201d She goes on to tell me who was there. She labored all night and then finally, with no aid of medication, she delivered me at 9:35 the next morning. The doctor announced, \u201cIt\u2019s a girl,\u201d and the room fell silent. A girl after four boys. \u201cIf you would have been another boy, I think I would have told them to put you back in,\u201d her normal well voice tells me with a chuckle, normally. \nNormally, on my birthday, my mom and I talk about her going into labor on her birthday with me, \u201cthe best birthday gift she ever got.\u201d Normally, but not this year. And not last year. Because my mother forgot my birthday. Again. It\u2019s not her fault. It\u2019s because of the illness. It\u2019s because of the sickness in her brain that we cannot explain. \nBut it doesn\u2019t hurt any less. Because it\u2019s our thing. Our birthdays \u2026 our birthdays are \u2026 special. I\u2019m the best birthday gift she ever got. Remember, Mom? \nRemember? \nRemember? \nBut she doesn\u2019t. Her brain has checked out. And she doesn\u2019t remember. She doesn\u2019t even know if she brushed her teeth this morning. She stands at the sink and pours herself a glass of water, forgetting to turn off the faucet as water pours over the side of her glass and splashes her hand \u2026and she doesn\u2019t know it. \nI\u2019ll check my phone a thousand times today, and her name won\u2019t appear. She forgot. It\u2019s okay, I tell myself. \nIt\u2019s okay. \nIt\u2019s okay. \nShe\u2019ll get better. She\u2019ll come back. She always does. \nUntil then, I\u2019ll ferociously go through my card box and try to find one from my mom. A card with her voice, where I can hear her, the real her, the well her. And I\u2019ll read every card she\u2019s ever given me.

My biggest complaint with Boaphiles and why i went with AP over them is for the bang for the back, AP wins hands down. The only downside i see to AP is you have to seal them but for the price, it's a small thing to have to do. And i have heard they do leak after a few years. I am beginning to doubt it as i tried to reseal my older AP cages and trying to get the Lexel to break seal was like trying to tear down a concrete wall with your hands. That stuff is epic lol. You almost have to use Goof Off or mineral spirits to remove it haha.\nI do like that you can bolt other cages to them to make bigger cages which almost had me sold. But after i priced an equivalent size and height Boaphile with shelf, black coated locks (as i heard the uncoated ones rust) and lighting, it was almost double the cost. Plus after having Constrictor NW cages, i have learned acrylic doors are a bad idea as they fog, warp and scratch over time from use and humidity and heat. I also love how AP routes channels into the bottom of the cage to fit t-stat probes. Makes stacking them easy.\nBut hey, everyone has their favorites. Like i said, the stack looks nice. Also keep us updated on how they are after about a year. i was told by multiple people that Jeff uses a more porous PVC which soaks up snake piss and stains the floor and smells after a year or so. i would be curious if he has changed the PVC at all as this was a few years ago when i was shopping between AP, Boaphile and Constrictor NW.\nHaha and thats A LOT of spaghetti to deal with.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:47.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db6612ac8ffed4eb6efbd1acfb78fb904028b896", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWeka7F9XHBBkBSubCxv1H.etg_udGub.Gpi_vnEKqUmkgToS.AJFX5NiVRiYriVU-", "site_full": "ball-pythons.net", "site": "ball-pythons.net", "site_section": "https://ball-pythons.net/forums/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Ball-Pythons.net ", "title": "My New Boaphile Setup - With Review", "title_full": "My New Boaphile Setup - With Review", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db6612ac8ffed4eb6efbd1acfb78fb904028b896", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWeka7F9XHBBkBSubCxv1H.etg_udGub.Gpi_vnEKqUmkgToS.AJFX5NiVRiYriVU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Angruin", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "My New Boaphile Setup - With Review", "text": "I am not a good DIY guy, so re-sealing tanks does not sound fun to me!

The cabin crew in-charged of our section, Damian, was pushing the food cart ready to serve normal meals to the remaining passengers. He stopped to chit-chat while doing so, with passenger whom should be known to him.\nIt is unfortunate that my husband and I could get into bad gastric when hungry, we sought Damian's consideration if he could please serve us the food first. Immediately hearing our request, he showed a black face, raised his voice and sarcastically asked \"oh, so you have gastric? and BOTH of you have gastric?\". We were stunned by his reaction, but tried to explain to him that hunger would trigger gastric. He raised his voice further with an obvious intention to humiliate us in front of the rest of the passengers by asking \"you are hungry, everybody is hungry, who is not hungry here?\"\nWe just kept quiet as we did not want to speak to a crew of such standard. He sensed our silence and asked whether we wanted lamb or chicken rice. Both of us chose chicken rice but were served lamb instead. Hahaha... was that done on purpose? I leave it to you to judge.\nThe drama did not stop there. He continued to humiliate us by sarcastically asking in his high=pitched voice \"You must be very thirsty too, so what can I serve for your thirst?\". we thanked him for the 2 cups of water served.\nOh my, we were utterly speechless and disappointed with this type of behaviour and standard displayed by a MH cabin crew. He totally did not know how to show empathy and be sensitive to passengers' medical condition. In return, passengers were being humiliated for seeking his assistance.\nI hope that Malaysian Airlines will seriously look into this so that other passengers will not go through the same bad experience.

Bush passed his sweeping tax cut in 2001, he won support from 12 Democrats in the Senate and 28 in the House.\nBut when President Trump and Republican leadership muscled their respective tax-cut plans through Congress this fall, not a single Democrat in either chamber voted yes. That shutout came even though 12 House Democrats represent districts Trump carried last year, and Democrats in 2018 are defending 10 Senate seats in states the president won.\nMany factors contributed to the change. Across all issues, it\u2019s become less common for legislators to vote across party lines than in the Reagan, and even Bush, era. And Trump has less leverage over Democratic legislators than his predecessors did because he has a much lower job-approval rating than either of them, especially among Democratic voters.\nBut there is a more straightforward reason why not a single Democrat backed the legislation: The GOP not only entirely excluded Democrats from the process of drafting the bills, but the party punished Democratic constituencies\u2014from residents of high-tax states to graduate students\u2014in the bills\u2019 substance. The tax plans represent a political closed circle: bills written solely by Republicans and passed solely by Republican votes that shower their greatest benefits on Republican constituencies. Meanwhile, the biggest losers in the plans are the constituencies of the Democrats who universally opposed them. It\u2019s not just redistribution: The tax bills are also grounded in retribution.\nIn that way, the tax debate offers the clearest measure of how powerfully the Republican Party in the Trump era is folding inward. Neither Trump nor GOP congressional leaders are even pretending to represent the entire country\u2014or to consider perspectives beyond those of their core coalition. Instead the party has shown that as long as it can maintain internal unity over its direction, it will ignore objections from virtually any outside source\u2014not just Democrats, but also independent experts, affected interest groups, and traditional allies abroad.\nIn a best-selling book published during the Reagan years, neoconservative cultural critic Allan Bloom lamented The Closing of the American Mind . The Trump era is crystallizing the closing of the Republican mind.\nIn several distinct ways, the party is now governing solely of, by, and for Red America. Key among them:\nDistorting the legislative process : On the tax and especially the recent health-care bills, the GOP Congress short-circuited the legislative process to minimize public input. Leadership negotiated all the key decisions behind closed doors. That dampened public debate and ultimately forced legislators to vote on massive (and at times handwritten ) packages with little time to consider consequences or mobilize opposition. More important, the negotiations took place only among Republicans, denying meaningful input to Democrats or skeptical groups.\nCongress has long been growing more partisan, but this still represented a quantum leap in exclusion. Former President Barack Obama made significant changes to his stimulus plan in 2009 to win support from three GOP senators. He also allowed the Senate Finance Committee to delay consideration of the Affordable Care Act for over three months to conduct extended negotiations with Republicans. (No Republicans ultimately backed the ACA on the floor, but that didn\u2019t erase the effort.)\nPunishing Democratic strongholds : The tax bills, as I\u2019ve noted before , are not unusual in benefitting GOP constituencies. But they are unusual in consciously punishing so many Democratic-leaning groups, especially in the House bill. Among others, these groups include families in blue, high-tax states, who\u2019d be hurt by restrictions on state- and local-tax deductibility; homeowners in large, mostly Democratic metro areas, who\u2019d face limits on mortgage deductions; and students, who\u2019d face higher taxes on college debt or graduate tuition waivers.\nThis confrontational instinct extends beyond taxes. Violating conservatives\u2019 usual fondness for federalism, the House passed legislation Wednesday that would force every state to recognize a concealed-weapon permit granted in any state. The administration is seeking to withhold federal grants to pressure so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that limit local cooperation with federal immigration authorities. And Trump is trying to undermine blue-state regulatory standards by allowing the interstate sale of health insurance.\nRejecting independent information : From top to bottom, the party is now routinely dismissing objective information it considers inconvenient. Examples range from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan blithely discounting the array of independent analyses on their tax plans, which show they\u2019d massively increase the federal deficit and primarily benefit the wealthy; to Trump\u2019s rejection of climate science; to nearly three-fourths of Alabama Republicans saying they don\u2019t believe detailed allegations of sexual misconduct and child molestation against Senate candidate Roy Moore. Similarly, on the ACA repeal, the GOP ignored the unprecedented, unified warnings from every pillar of the medical community\u2014from doctors to patients to insurers\u2014that their plan would degrade care. Trump has pushed this to the extreme, labeling as \u201cfake news\u201d any fact he finds threatening and confining his television interviews almost solely to Fox News .\nDisregarding international allies: The widespread international condemnation of Trump\u2019s decision to relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel deepens the isolation from traditional allies already evident in his moves against the Trans-Pacific Partnership and NAFTA trade deals, the Iranian nuclear agreement, and the Paris climate accord. Only a handful of congressional Republicans have questioned any of these breaks with the world.\nIn all these ways, the Trump-era GOP has grown impervious to virtually any opinion that resists its own internal consensus. Next November\u2019s midterm elections will begin answering whether the party has drawn that closed circle too narrowly to preserve its upper hand in Washington.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ronald reagan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george w. bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allan bloom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate finance committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama republicans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nafta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red america", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:48.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eecd3f945eb5b8589b5d15c3b523fcb9f8da0d18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPEjypjVhrV6kjAiEatzkQwwFWJJGIIqtJsTFAEeQwZHt4YM7hs5jhut7UYCcoPBrFai23J6mp3cvJGCitjSXNr9V5vnCXKPtLBqb5GW2o5QwaKknVtb18lecaljdDMe4xAirsFMo5A3wfPB_TH5FIYw--", "site_full": "www.military-technologies.net", "site": "military-technologies.net", "site_section": "http://www.military-technologies.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["table_tennis_ping_pong", "financial_news", "finance", "sports"], "section_title": "MilTech", "title": "Global Collaborative Robot Software Market 2016 Industry Trends, Sales, Supply, Demand, Analysis & Forecast to 2021", "title_full": "Global Collaborative Robot Software Market 2016 Industry Trends, Sales, Supply, Demand, Analysis & Forecast to 2021", "published": "2017-12-07T10:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eecd3f945eb5b8589b5d15c3b523fcb9f8da0d18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPEjypjVhrV6kjAiEatzkQwwFWJJGIIqtJsTFAEeQwZHt4YM7hs5jhut7UYCcoPBrFai23J6mp3cvJGCitjSXNr9V5vnCXKPtLBqb5GW2o5QwaKknVtb18lecaljdDMe4xAirsFMo5A3wfPB_TH5FIYw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sambit Kumar", "published": "2017-12-07T10:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Global Collaborative Robot Software Market 2016 Industry Trends, Sales, Supply, Demand, Analysis & Forecast to 2021", "text": "Source: imported from this press release . \nA comprehensive analysis of the global Collaborative Robot Software Market is been done in this intelligence report.

According to him, it is insulting not only to the Nigerian constitution but the office of the GGM for him to disregard the Senate invitation on issues relating to how Nigerians are being shortchanged by foreign companies and their local collaborators.\nMeanwhile, the House of Representatives Committee on Customs has invited the Comptroller General, Hammed Ali, Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) over alleged abuse of waivers and bond on import duties.\nAlso invited are bank executives, importers, inspection agents, SGS, Cotecna, Global Scan and Web Fountain Nig Ltd. to defend the roles they played in the sector from 2010 till date with regard to the waivers. They are to appear before the committee next week Wednesday.\nIn a letter to the invited stakeholders dated 13 November, the committee chairman, Abiodun Faleke (APC, Lagos)\nSaid:\u201d In view of the timeline set for the assignment, kindly ensure that the information and documents required of you are sent to the committee\u2019s secretariat before November 29.\u201d\nThe lawmakers requested for schedules of all beneficiaries with respect to all duty waivers, exemptions and concessions processed by the invited stakeholders from 2010 till date.\nThey also requested for \u201cschedules of all beneficiaries with respect to all bonds indemnity upon which imports were processed by the Nigeria Customs Service from 2010 to date.\u201d\nThe House had on November 8 collapsed three motions all calling for the probe of issuance of waivers and revenue leakages in the declaration of customs duties.\nThe motions are: \u201cNeed to investigate the handling of import duty revenues, waivers and bonds on import duties collected by the Customs Service from 2010 to date\u2019, \u2018Need to Audit the Customs Duties Remitted by commercial banks to the CBN from January 2014 till date and proof of such remittances\u2019 and \u2018Need to investigate the operational activities of Web Services, Fountain Nigeria Ltd in the Nigeria Customs Service Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure between 2013 and 2017, the violation of its Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) timeline agreement, rules of engagement and the delay in the handover of its services to the Nigeria Customs Service.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hammed ali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abiodun faleke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samuel adeola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed idris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roland ewubare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "godswill akpabio", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "customs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fountain nig ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria customs service information and communication technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "napims", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egina deep sea oil project", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives committee on customs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central bank of nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cotecna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "customs service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "customs data", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fountain nigeria ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asycuda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accountant general of the federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "production nigeria ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "group general manager of national petroleum investment and management service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria customs service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nnpc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sgs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national petroleum corporation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c9d1af5721fa05a1910e4bf363b73a0bbcb666d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlm_yVkwQjBbY4HBFyCGbJo", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "Say something nice about the EU. 1.

This is widely considered the worst type of temporary accommodation. In the unique investigation: Every family lived in a single room which significantly disrupts the children\u2019s ability to play, do homework and carry out any kind of daily routine A quarter of families had no access to a kitchen at all, and the rest had to make do with shared facilities. Struggling to cook meals, more than half of parents said they rely on expensive and unhealthy takeaways. And two-thirds had to eat family meals on the bed or floor of their room Half of families had to share toilet and bathroom facilities with other households, often with filthy conditions and unlockable doors, meaning strangers could walk in at any moment More than a third of parents had to share a bed with their children. Three-quarters say bedtimes have become difficult and half say their children are more tired \nIn England, where the highest number of families are placed into B&Bs, 45 per cent stay beyond the six-week legal limit. The charity\u2019s findings lay bare the psychological turmoil experienced by families living in these cramped conditions for often long periods of time, including: Three-quarters of parents felt their children\u2019s mental health had been badly affected. One parent said her daughter had become suicidal since living in the hostel Half of parents reported that their children\u2019s physical health had also worsened, with incidents of bed bug infestations, and broken heating causing children to fall ill Children spoke about feeling anxious, afraid and ashamed. Several children described school as a respite. For one it was the only place he felt happy, another felt stressed at the thought of returning to her accommodation at the end of the school day Children also talked about their school work suffering because of long journeys to school each day, poor and broken sleep, and having no space or quiet-time to do their homework \nPolly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said, \" It\u2019s a national scandal that this year the number of homeless children in Britain has risen every year since 2011. No child should have to spend Christmas without a home \u2013 let alone 128,000 children. \n\"Many of us will spend Christmas day enjoying all of the festive traditions we cherish, but sadly it\u2019ll be a different story for the children hidden away in cramped B&Bs or hostel rooms. Imagine living in a noisy strange place full of people you don\u2019t know, and waking up exhausted from having no choice but to share a bed with your siblings or parents. \n\"That\u2019s why our frontline advisers will continue to work tirelessly, including on Christmas day, to help more families fighting homelessness. But we can\u2019t do this alone. We\u2019re asking people to help a homeless family and make giving to Shelter their new Christmas tradition.' \nTwins Ellie and Amy, aged 15, are currently homeless and living in temporary accommodation. Until a few weeks ago, they were living in a tiny hotel room which they shared with the rest of their family. They had no access to a kitchen and only shared bathroom facilities; the twins also had to share a bed. \nAmy said: 'We\u2019re living in a B&B. It\u2019s a small room with five people living in it. It\u2019s got one double bed and one single bed. It\u2019s not even a proper bed\u2026 it\u2019s a camp bed. Three people sleep in the double bed with one person at the bottom and two people at the top. And two in the single bed. I sleep next to my brother, he kicks. My mum talks in her sleep. \n'There\u2019s a tiny toilet with a shower but my brother doesn\u2019t like showers because he\u2019s autistic, so he has to bathe in a bucket. He stands in it and mum tips a cup over him. He screams if you try and put him in the shower.' \nEllie said: 'It\u2019s hard to concentrate at school because there\u2019s the worry about coming home. It\u2019s just stressful. There\u2019s nowhere we can relax or get any privacy. Before it was much better. We had our own home right near school and right near our friends. We all had our own rooms and a cooker and a fridge. We could eat proper meals.
