The allegations have targeted prominent men in politics, media, and entertainment. Many journalists have investigated these stories, including New York Times investigative reporter Jodi Kantor, Washington Post contributor Irin Carmon, and Hollywood Reporter editor-at-large Kim Masters. At Business Insider's IGNITION conference, Alyson Shontell, Business Insider's US editor-in-chief, spoke with the journalists about their reporting.\nThe national conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace started with the work of journalists whose reporting led to the sidelining of men like Pixar\u2019s John Lasseter and the firing of powerful stars like Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer .\nAt Business Insider's recent IGNITION conference, US editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell spoke with three of the journalists who have been breaking these stories over the past few months: Jodi Kantor, Irin Carmon, and Kim Masters.\nLatest business videos Kantor is one of two New York Times reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein harassment story . Rumors had been circulating about him for a long time, and she and Megan Twohey finally nailed it. Their investigation started a national reckoning.\n\"It was the moment when we said, as an organization, 'How many of these stories are out there, that are like this? How many other women have been quieted?'\" Kantor said at IGNITION.\nAfter their article published, the floodgates opened. Carmon is a contributor at the Washington Post, and she was first to report on the alleged harassment that led to Charlie Rose\u2019s firing. She spent a lot of nights and weekends on the phone with the alleged victims.\n\u201cWe spent hours talking to them like human beings, not being patronizing to them,\" Carmon said. \"Being professional but also being responsible with the information that they told us, not pushing too hard too soon.\u201d\nMasters is editor-at-large at The Hollywood Reporter, and she\u2019s been breaking harassment stories for years. Most recently, she broke the story of Pixar\u2019s John Lasseter and she also told the story of abuses by Amazon Studios boss Roy Price .\nWe turned that conversation into a special episode of Business Insider's podcast, \u201cSuccess! How I Did It.\u201d They spoke about why they investigated these stories, how they navigated working with sources (and their nondisclosure agreements), and what they think will come next in their reporting.\nListen to the episode:\nSubscribe to \"Success! How I Did It\" on Apple Podcasts , Google Play , RadioPublic , or your favorite app. Check out previous episodes with:\nNBC News host Megyn Kelly Author and investor Tim Ferriss LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman And a \"Master Class\" episode on leadership advice from our guests\nMasters started off our conversation by telling us about the time in the late 1980s when she said to Harvey Weinstein\u2019s face, \u201cI heard you rape women.\u201d\nFollowing is a transcript of the interview, which has been lightly edited for clarity.\nRoy Rochlin/Getty Images\nKim Masters: It was the first time I met Harvey; it was lunch in Beverly Hills. I had written stuff about him that he didn\u2019t like. He came rushing up to the table. It was the first time I had met him face to face, and he\u2019s yelling, very aggressive: \u201cWhy do you write this about me? Why do you write this about me? What have you heard about me?\u201d And I felt like, do it right now, and I said, \u201cI heard you rape women.\u201d\nAnd I thought I\u2019d never be able to tell that story of course. It was an off-the-record lunch, so I\u2019ve never said exactly how he answered. But I will say if not an outraged denial, it was a really quite a feeling to think \"Oh my God\" and know going forward that periodically we would try again, try again, try again. And so it took until these guys, and Ronan Farrow, finally broke the door down, but by then I was happy anybody was doing it.\nRoy Price. I had a source come to me, and I feel like it\u2019s important to say this because there\u2019s been all of this thing about men treating women, but the original sources on that were men who were very disgusted by this behavior.\nSo I heard about it. As you said, I had a very difficult time, and Lasseter, once the Harvey story broke, I got a call about Lasseter, and I have to say, that was the one where I thought, \"Can I just not hear this?\" Like, it was so big. It was Pixar and Disney animation, and I will admit, I didn\u2019t like dive for it, but I knew eventually it was real, and we had to go forward.\nShontell: And, Jodi, you said, you knew this \u2014 there was a graveyard of reporters that had tried to do this Harvey Weinstein story, and had not been able to get enough to publish. So when this was a real story that you were going to try to tackle, and why now, did you think this happened now?\nJodi Kantor: You know, the strange thing about this Harvey story is it kind of entered popular culture, on the one hand, had the Oscar nominations in 2013, the comedian Seth MacFarlane made a joke about it. He announced the five actresses names for some award, and he said: \u201cCongratulations, ladies. You no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.\u201d So on the one hand, it was discussed like that, but there had never been a kind of real story documenting the allegations; nothing had even been nailed down. So it was pretty intimidating.\nBut the way we came into it was The Times made a huge commitment to sexual-harassment reporting this year. I know it sounds like a very long time ago, but it actually wasn\u2019t. My colleagues Emily Steel and Michael Schmidt broke open the Bill O\u2019Reilly story, about the payments he had made to women over the years to quiet these allegations. And internally, their project was obviously very important in terms of the impact the made on the world, but it was important internally at The Times, too, because it was really a wake-up call for us, and it was the moment when we said, as an organization, \"How many of these stories are out there, that are like this? How many other women have been quieted?\" We knew that sexual harassment existed, of course, but what really became clear is that the kind of mechanisms of silencing and cover-up might be far more vast, and elaborate, than anybody had realized.\nAnd it was also a point when we said, \"This is our duty as investigative reporters because we\u2019re in a unique position.\" I mean, I love your story about what you said to Harvey, because, to me it speaks to the social license that journalists have. I mean, your kind of superpower is that you could actually go up to him at a party and confront him about that, which most people can\u2019t, and so we said, \u2018Let\u2019s try to put the puzzle pieces together. Let's try to see if there\u2019s a pattern here.\" And that\u2019s when we started looking at the Harvey story.\nShontell: And, Irin, you hear about Charlie Rose, and it sounds like the story came together pretty quickly \u2014 like 17 days or something.\nIrin Carmon: Yeah, it was an unusual trajectory, and I\u2019ve said that it sort of stands on the shoulders of some of the reporting that was done, including by the women on this stage, and by Ronan Farrow. I first became aware of this story in 2010, when I was a reporter at Jezebel. And at the time it was two women, one a job applicant, one an assistant, who had been sexually harassed, allegedly, by Charlie, and it was so ... You know how people talk about the open secret, but I think if there was an open secret about Charlie Rose it was that he was flirtatious, not that he was a predator, in the same way as Harvey Weinstein. So it was certainly dissonant with the public image.\nI think it\u2019s interesting when you talk about the institutional commitment. At the time, where I was working, we covered sexism and misogyny, and systems that protect them, but we didn\u2019t really have the institutional resources to report on it properly. So I was given time, I was given support to work on it, but when none of the women I had heard about second or third hand would speak to me or go on the record, and I couldn\u2019t really get past the initial thing, I was reassigned to something else. And subsequently even just thinking about this kind of behavior merits the deep resources of a place like The New York Times or The Washington Post or Variety or The New Yorker, or The Hollywood Reporter, I do think there had to be a shift to say we\u2019re gonna but serious investigative resources and editing on this.\nWhen the cultural moment that emerged in the wake of The New York Times reporting, and The New Yorker, and the Amazon Roy Price reporting, I just thought, \"I gotta go back to this.\" I know I\u2019m not the only person that went back to a cold case. And I had a relationship with The Washington Post. I had been writing for the Outlook section, and it\u2019s pretty unusual to have a freelance reporter walk up to you and say \u201ccan I do this piece about this very wealthy, well connected, well-regarded person,\u201d but I immediately got the support that I needed from The Washington Post. I was paired with a reporter named Amy Briton, who I had never met before, who\u2019s an investigative reporter, and two editors on the investigative team, and they just said, you know, \"Tell us what you have,\" and we just started reporting together, form there, and 17 days later it was on the front page of The Washington Post. And I do think that there had to be the readiness for these women also to process what had happened to them or what they said had happened to them. And so I don\u2019t think that the story was ripe before. And a few of them said, \u201cI feel guilty that I didn\u2019t talk to you back then because I have heard of other women that this happened to, but I just wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d\nShontell: So you hear these names, you know that this could be, a big story. Where do you start, how do you start finding people, reaching out the them, and getting them to respond? It\u2019s so sensitive.\nMasters: Well, I\u2019ve been in Hollywood covering Hollywood for quite a while, so one of the good things that I\u2019ve developed is a network of people, and what I\u2019ve found doing this story, in some cases, is, even if I\u2019m calling somebody about something else, it\u2019s worth my while to drop \u201cI\u2019m looking into this\u201d because suddenly here\u2019s a connection I never thought possible.\nIn the case of Amazon, this one particular individual gave me a tremendous road map. I mean, he didn't just give it to me. I had to go meet with him and sit with him, and gradually, try this, try that. I mean, the woman at the center of that, one of the key people was Isa Hackett, one of the daughters of Philip K. Dick, and had had this encounter with him, and it took me forever just to find out which. He kept giving me hints because he felt guilty, honestly, about pulling her in, if she didn\u2019t want to be pulled it. As it turned out, she was a tremendously courageous person. But it still took her forever. You know, with Lasseter, I covered animation off and on back to the days of \"Roger Rabbit.\" I know animators, and even though my connections are a little rusty, there are certain people to call, like, \"Try this,\" and it was waiting to happen at that point, I think, like waiting to happen. So it depends, where it comes from and if that person\u2019s willing to say, \"I'll tell people, give me names to call, even if you\u2019re confident that they won\u2019t talk to me,\" just because that helps me muddy the trail, and protect my sources.\nShontell: And, Jody, I mean, you\u2019ve done some blockbuster pieces for The New York Times before. Amazon is one that stands out, where you interviewed 100 people for that Amazon story, and got Jeff Bezos to respond and all these things, but that\u2019s a very different story than something like sexual harassment in the entertainment world. So how do you come in, without a traditional history on the beat.\nKantor: In some ways I think it might have helped on Harvey, that we were outsiders, because coming new to a subject does afford you, on the one hand, I didn\u2019t have anything like the long history and knowledge that Kim has about Hollywood. But you know reporting\u2019s all about cold-calling anyway, and it enables you to come to something completely fresh, and somebody is not saying, \"Oh, you know, I hated that story you wrote three pieces ago\" or whatever.\nShontell: Were there tactics you used or things that resonated that really made people realize what a big thing this could be? Like Emily Steel went to a yoga class across the country to talk to a source.\nMasters: My strategy is always to go with integrity, and I feel like that projects itself. I had a source with an NDA, in the Amazon thing, and she said, \"I want to go on the record, but what will happen to me? Should I go on the record?\" I said, \"I can't advise you to do it.\" Like, she was not a powerful player, and, in many cases, you know, talking to Isa Hackett as she thought about going public, I would just say to her, \"You absolutely decide. This is your call.\"\nJust to make it clear that we\u2019re not trying to be another person to get something out of them and mess with their heads. And I will say, just quickly, everyone who has come forward, and we\u2019ve had people who have written essays for us, who called me and told me a story, and I\u2019m like, \"Can you write that?\" They feel such catharsis and release. And I feel like it's really important for the sources to know \u2014 potential sources \u2014 that in every case I've dealt with so far, it's just been a weight lifted.\nRoy Rochlin/Getty Images\nCarmon: It's interesting because I've spent hours on the phone, or in person, with the women we wrote about, for the Charlie Rose story, and you learn a little bit about why they might want to talk to you and why they might not want to talk to you, and they have good reasons in both cases. So some of the reasons that I heard were \"I want to support The Washington Post because they're investigating things that I care about\"; \"I don't want this to happen to anyone else\"; or \"I read the Harvey Weinstein story and now I realize that happened to me was similar.\" We even had \"The two of you are young women and we want to support you,\" because Amy and me are in our early 30s.\nSo you hear all the reasons, and then all the reasons about why they don't want to go on the record, which are all valid reasons. We do not have NDAs in Charlie Rose/PBS, but there were lots of good reasons. \"I'm a single mom,\" \"I\u2019m between jobs,\" \"I'm ashamed,\" \"I should have said no,\" \"I should have fought more,\" \"I shouldn't have gone to the apartment,\" \"I have an abusive husband.\" These are all reasons that came up again and again with women who decided to go on the record.\nAnd so what I think about what really made the difference in that piece, first of all, is having names. Because we\u2019re bringing the full integrity of the process here. And then it's also that we spent hours talking to them like human beings. Not being patronizing to them, being professional, but also being responsible with the information they had told us, not pushing too hard too soon. I mean 17 days was very fast, but at the same time compared to the way you have to do other stories, where you're like, \"I need you to go on the record right now,\" Amy and I were both on the phone at, like, six in the morning, different time zones, checking in with them every day to see, you know, \"How are you feeling today?\" Even when you don't want anything. And if you are reporting on this you're talking to people who have credible allegations of harm, right? Where you believe it enough to put it in the paper, and it's substantiated in all of these ways, and yet you're the one nagging them. You need to push past their initial consent. You don't want to re-traumatize anybody, but you also need to make a good argument for why this is an important story, which will be so much stronger if your name is on it and if you tell the world \"This is what happened to me.\"\nKantor: I think Irin hit on a really interesting dynamic, which is that the nature of these allegations is that they felt pressured in the past, and so you don't want to pressure them as a reporter, you don't even want to evoke that dynamic the slightest bit, but it's also your job to move forward with confidence and \u2014\nCarmon: Persistence.\nKantor: Persistence, and a certain amount of proper reportorial aggression. So it's a really fine balance.\nCarmon: Right, and you have to be adversarial at times. You have to say, like, \"I need to ask you tough questions,\" like, \"Why didn't you do this?\" or \"Who else did you tell?\" And, you know, \"What does that person know? Do they know the whole story?' so it's not the same as obviously going to Gloria Allred, where someone will hold their hand and say, \"I believe you no matter what. You don't have to tell me anything.\" So it's kind of a complex relationship in that way.\nShontell: Sometimes when you're reporting these stories you're knocking on a lot of doors and just not getting anywhere, and then all of a sudden there's one source that's so helpful to you. They tell you something you never knew before, maybe like the Lauren O\u2019Connor memo that was cited a lot. Maybe that was a big get when you got it. Was there something that happened that took it from \"This is important but I don't know if I get it\" to \"Oh, my God \u2014 this is happening\"?\nMasters: Roy Price, Amazon. I was all by myself; I didn't hear footsteps of any other publication. So I don't know. I think the key thing was that Isa felt that he was going to keep doing this to people and she couldn't stand that, and the other side of the coin for her was, \"You know, I don't want my whole show, my crew, and my cast, to feel this weirdness being at Amazon, and that\u2019s uncomfortable. So that was a different thing. I really had too much time to be tortured, trying to get the Roy Price thing published. With Lasseter, I knew other people were chasing, and I started feeling like this may be really not fun to do, but you've got to do it, because it's not my job to wait to be scooped.\nKantor: For Megan and me with the Harvey Weinstein story, it was really all about the pattern. It was about the process. We wrote this, and the first story I think says something like, \"Women from all these different places, over a 30-year time span, women who don't know each other, some women were employees, some women were actress, and yet they told such similar stories. They varied in the severity. We know that there's a range of allegations against Weinstein, that range from hotel-room harassment, requests for massages on the one hand, all the way to assault and rape. So the severity varies greatly, but there's also a kind of numbing repetition to the stories, and it's sort of funny because when you're talking to the women, every woman's story is important and should be honored in its own way, and you want to listen to it very carefully. But on the other hand, when you're listening to it \u2014 I've never tried to count, but the number of individual, kind of like, \"Harvey incident\" stories I've heard, it's a really high number, and the pattern is really, really striking. And so the question we started asking in our reporting was, \"How come we're hearing the same story from so many people?\"\nShontell: And it even seems like across stories, like the bathrobe thing, like, \"Oh, my God \u2014 it's a pattern.\"\nCarmon: Yeah, the bathrobe and the hotel room, yeah.\nKantor: Yeah, and when I read your Charlie Rose story, Irin, I was very struck by the idea of him inviting women into private spaces where he allegedly did these inappropriate things, because that was so reminiscent of the Weinstein patterns.\nMasters: I actually completely got chills reading that, because the first time I met Charlie Rose, which \u2014 I don't know him well \u2014 sitting next to him on a couch, and his hand went right there. And then fast forward he called me, which is a pattern you present in your thing, and said, \"What do you think I should ask this guest on my show?\" And I thought, not until I read you story, like, \"Jeez, he had me like two-thirds of the way there.\"\nCarmon: Yeah, when the story came out, other women texted us or emailed us and said, \"I can't believe he used that line on her too,\" you know, the line \"I'm Southern; we're touchers.\" Not everything was quantified in the story. We kind of just focused on the most important and the most serious allegations, but there were certain commonalities. I was going to say exactly the same thing. And this was not a glib or a flip thing, but at a certain point, Amy and I took a piece of paper and we made a chart, and we had each one of the behaviors that we saw, ranging from leg grabbing all the way up to sexual-assault allegations, and we were kind of just checking off each of the women, and so it was a very grim game of bingo, where this came up again and again, and when we started hearing those from people who had not worked at the same time at the show, or have not been referred to us by somebody else, even if they didn't know each other, some people would say, \"Oh, you should talk to this intern or this assistant,\" so it was at the cold-call stage, moving beyond the initial circle, that we realized that there really was a pattern, and that it did involve the bathrobe, and the Bellport house, for example, came up again and again.\nShontell: So one thing that's come up is this NDA culture. Talk about that a little bit.\nKantor: I think there are two forms of NDAs that are important here. There are the NDAs that company employees sign routinely, and Amazon and The Weinstein Company and Miramax have all used those. And then there are confidentiality agreements that come with settlements, and that means that, as I think most people now understand, if a woman has allegations, the sort of routine response is that she goes to a lawyer, and unless she wants to fully go to court, which is very hard, she often will get a settlement. The problem with those settlements is that they come with these really strict confidentiality agreements. Sometimes they are to the woman's advantage. There are women who say, \"I don't want anyone to know about this. I want my life to proceed as usual,\" et cetera. But the confidentiality agreements can also be enabling in way because the women are silenced, and it means that the people who know the most about the problematic behavior, really can't warm other women, you know, or continue to report them, or go public, et cetera. So those are the kind of two silencing elements that we've looked a lot at.\nShontell: And how did you get around them?\nKantor: It's become a pretty routine journalistic conversation to ask people to break NDAs. It's interesting to me that you didn't want that one woman to do it.\nMasters: I wanted her to. She was already telling me what she knew. The question was, would she put her name to it on the record, and that put, I thought, it would be putting her at tremendous risk. I don't know that the law is particularly settled. I think that this is a huge policy issue that needs to be addressed \u2014 covering up wrongdoing with these NDAs. So I couldn't in good conscious say, \"Go ahead.\" Because I called a couple of lawyers. It was muddy, and, I thought, she was young, low of the totem pole. I thought she'd already had enough happen to her. I didn't want to open her up to another round.\nKantor: And then with the confidentiality agreements that come with settlements, you have to figure out a way how to report the settlement, without putting with woman in legal jeopardy. And what I'd say is a lot of people end up knowing about settlements. If you look at the settlements and Miramax and The Weinstein Company, it was not a case where only Harvey and the woman and like one other person knew about them. These settlement are processes, they take a lot of people to be executed, they create mystery, right? All of a sudden a woman vanishes, and you know she's gone from work and what happened? People end up hearing about the settlements. Now the really interesting thing that's happening is that women are breaking those confidentiality agreements. We've had, I want to say two, so far. Zelda Perkins and Ashley Matthau are Harvey Weinstein victims who have broken their settlement confidentiality agreements, because they've essentially said, \"I have to speak out now, in the public interest, about what's happened to me,\" and, as far as I know, they haven't suffered and negative consequences for that.\nMasters: And if somebody's already exposed for what they are, the risk decreases. At that point it's, like, \" You want to sue me ?\"\nKantor: You want to get into a discover process about this.\nCarmon: It's only as good as the enforcement process, right? And once many people have broken it without repercussions it's easier.\nShontell: So talk about getting people on the record, the importance of it. Could you have even published if you hadn't had people on the record? How do you move a source into that direction and get them to put their name on something that will follow them on Google wherever they go, to every future employer. How does that work?\nCarmon: In the case of our story it was really important for us to get people on the record. The feeling, as somebody who is such a public figure, works for three major media companies, has relationships with Bloomberg, CBS, and PBS, you know, you really want this story to be absolutely airtight, nail down every word, and all the names that you can, so there were a few dynamics. One dynamic was the safety in numbers; nobody wants to be the first person.\nSo we were really lucky, Amy and I, that we were working with the same team of investigative editors who had just published the story on Roy Moore, and that had three women on the record. So we were able to draw on their advice, and their resources, on the best way to do this, and also to point our sources to the way that the Roy Moore story had been done, which was with great sensitivity.\nSo part of it was at the beginning of the conversation saying to them, \"There won't be any surprises; you're not going to pick up The Washington Post tomorrow and see your story. This is a long-term thing. I'm not going to rush you, but that is something I'm going to be asking you.\" That was sort of step one, was to make it really clear to be really transparent about the process, that this is not a gotcha game, this is not an \"I need to push publish right this minute; let's talk about what we can do here.\"\nAnd nobody wants to be the first, but you can't coordinate between them, you have to keep the integrity of the process very airtight, and so, at a certain point, what we did was we got permission from some of the women to share their stories with other sources, without their names, or with their names, depending on what their preference was.\nAnd so we both just started reading portions of the transcripts, again, with the women's permission of an off-the record conversation, to the other women. The first person to go on the record was a person who realized that someone had said she was violently assaulted, after she had worked there, after she had been an assistant to Charlie Rose, and so she just said, \"If this is going to make a big difference for you story\" \u2014 and again, people have all kinds of good reasons not to put their names on this kind of story \u2014 that was ultimately what did it. And there was another woman who we describe in the story. She feels like what happened to her wasn't very serious, but she said, \"If my name being in this will help the other women feel less alone, then I will go on the record.\" Then we had two, then we had three.\nMasters: This was a big problem for me with the Amazon story, because everyone who was a key source either worked at Amazon or had their business life depended on a deal with Amazon. And I have to say, I have somewhat unorthodox feelings because I had nobody on the record, but five people agreed that if he were to sue us they would identify themselves and testify truthfully. They agreed in writing. And Amazon acknowledged that he had been investigated. So I felt like that should get into the end zone. That didn't convince every editor. It ultimately kind of worked, with a little bit of a comment from Isa Hackett, and then she finally went all the way on the record.\nBut I think that we don't name rape victims. I feel like we should be able to break these stories. The NPR story was broken with nobody on the record, because NPR did acknowledge the problem. So I think we have to think maybe, not so much like, \"You must go on the record \u2014 you're a victim\" \u2014 I don't find the logic that. I feel like we should find other ways if people aren't willing or can't. I don't think we should ask people to commit professional suicide to do a story.\nShontell: The pressure on you all. You're dealing with the powerful people who have a lot of money and resources. I think Ronan Farrow described it as a \"Hogwarts Moment,\" as with Harvey Weinstein's lawyers, where like letters of threats were coming in from all crevices of his house, windows, and chimneys. And so what was the pressure like on you all, and how did you deal with it?\nRoy Rochlin/Getty Images\nKantor:\nWell, the world has since learned. And, more important, our sources faced significant intimidation in reporting the Harvey story. I don't know if I was more horrified or amused to learn about the attempts that had been made to dupe me. I mean, I knew strange things were going on, but more became clear afterwards, and that a dossier was prepared on me.\nBut actually, in real time, that was not the pressure I faced. What Megan and I really felt over the summer was the pressure not to let this story slip away. It scared us that so many great journalists hadn't been able to land it. And once we understood the material that we were dealing with, the senses of obligation that we felt, as journalists and human beings, so much has happened since then. But remember that when we were doing this story over the summer, very few people knew about it, and I was terrified by the idea of what it would mean to fail. And so I think that was the greatest pressure that I faced.\nShontell: This has created hopefully much more than a movement. It certainly feels like we're at a moment in time when things are changing and people are able to come forward and feel empowered to do so. Are we just at the beginning of this? Is actual change happening? Is it going to be a moment that passes and things are going to continue as they have been?\nCarmon: We're in an amazing moment of reporting, and it feels like reporting is such a good way to talk about this particular kind of abuse of power. Let's put it this way, sexual harassment is not a crime in the workplace, right? It's a violation of someone's civil rights. The reason we have sexual-harassment laws is that they fall under equal-opportunity laws, so they have to do with people's workplace behavior and professional behavior, and so I think that, especially when it comes to sexual assault even, which is under the criminal law, the criminal-justice system is not necessarily the best way for us to understand this as a social problem.\nGossip, where a lot of this lived before, ill-serves all of the people involved in it. Investigative reporting I think can really help us understand just how endemic of a problem this is. It's not specific to any particular industry, so I'm really encouraged by reporting organizations who are putting amazing people like the women who are on this stage, on this story, so that we can keep understanding all the nuances and all the complexity, because one of the women on the record in our story, she felt like, \"Oh, I sent him emails after that fact, that were very sycophantic, like this completely disqualifies my story,\" and I could say to her, \"You know, Asia Argento, in The New Yorker's story, she had a consensual relationship with Harvey after, and people understand her to be a victim,\" and so, this is a really complicated story, and I think that the reporting process in particular, shedding light on all the complex ways this plays out of people's lives, is really important.\nMasters: I knew there was sexual harassment in Hollywood before. I didn't realize how pervasive it really was. And when I look at institutions, studios, certain studios, the agencies, what I realize is, the reason that women don't do better in terms of their representation in the workforce, in the executive suites, in all the jobs in Hollywood, is that these guys have had a culture, in many of these places that is an absolute free for all, and they don't want women spoiling it. And that is the real reason why women are so dramatically underrepresented year after year in what is supposed to be a progressive world.\nI was listening last night to a story about a studio chairman about outrageous conduct, and he doesn't want that spoiled by a woman witnessing that. The only change comes when women are better represented and that club is broken up.\nKantor: The reason why what's happening now is so important is that we're getting this horrifyingly realistic view into what really happens. All of us are shocked and saddened, and riveted and staggered, by what turns out to be the differential between appearance and reality. If we want to take it to the present moment and go back to yesterday and talk about collectively learning about the Matt Lauer allegations, part of what is really disturbing about those allegations is the difference between what was on the surface, of being this kind of genial morning TV host, and then reading these stories in Variety and The Times and other publications about what he allegedly did to women behind closed doors.\nAs long as you have that gap appearance, and then women's private experiences, society can't begin to address those problems if we don't know about them, right? And so I hope that you know, as Irin said, it's kind of a reporting moment, when we sort of need to reboot and learn the truth about what's actually happening. And then hopefully we can move on.\nShontell: Thank you all for you tremendous work. The world is better for it.

President Buhari", "text": "8 hours 27 minutes ago 1 View Comments Moved by the outpouring of affection from the people of Kano State at the beginning of a two-day official visit, President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, vowed to overwhelm any opposition to his undeclared 2019 re-election prospects.\nThe President\u2019s assertion, coming a week after he hinted in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, of the possibility of seeking re-election, has put the camp of possible presidential hopefuls in the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, in palpable confusion. \nAmong the prospective APC chieftains believed to be waiting in the wings on Buhari\u2019s intentions are Senate President, Bukola Saraki; Senator Rabiu Kwankwanso and Governor Aminu Tambuwal, all of who have denied any presidential aspiration in the meantime. Senator Kwankwaso, the immediate past governor of Kano State, who came second in the contest for the 2015 presidential ticket of the APC, was not in town for the first presidential visit to his home state, yesterday. \nKwankwaso, who is enmeshed in an increasingly ugly political conflict with his hand-picked successor, Umaru Ganduje, was said to have travelled to Egypt, purportedly to settle the fees of some Kano State-sponsored students in that country. Comrade Aminu Abdulsalam, who served as Kwankwanso\u2019s commissioner for inter-governmental affairs, told newsmen, last night, that the former governor and his associates were not invited for the functions relating to the President\u2019s visit. Senator Saraki on his part, had last week, affirmed on the sidelines of the launch of a book written by his political disciple, Bolaji Abdullahi, that his political outlook on 2019 would not be made known before next February. \nGovernor Aminu Tambuwal, who had contemplated a presidential run in 2014 before settling for the governorship of his home state, stated that 2019 was still a long way off. President Buhari first gave an indication that he would contest the 2019 presidential election when he met with the Nigerian community in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, last week. \nI\u2019m overwhelmed \u2014 Buhari \nEight days after that hint, Buhari who had run four presidential campaigns, again let slip the possibility of another campaign when emotion came over him at the sights and sounds of the enthusiastic Kano crowd that welcomed him to the Emir\u2019s Palace. \u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed by the sea of heads I see, and by what I see today, if elections are contested, I have no doubt I will win it,\u201d he said at the palace which was the first port of call as soon as he arrived Kano. Don't be deceived, Kano crowd not reflection of 2019 \u2014 PDP Reacting, yesterday, to the president\u2019s seeming inclination, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, spokesman, Prince Dayo Adeyeye said: \u201cThe crowd that supposedly welcomed President Muhammadu Buhari is not a reflection of what will happen in 2019.\nMake no mistake about it. \u201cGovernments come and go all over the world. For the President to continue to blame the PDP for his failure to perform almost three years into his mandate, shows how ill-prepared he is for the leadership of this great country. \n\u201cThey were not elected to blame but to serve the people. What project have they commissioned since they came into power? Nigerians are aware of what the PDP was able to do but can we say the same thing of the APC?\u201d The president, who was received by Emir Muhammad Sanusi II, said he was determined to do the needful, even as he called for patience on the fact that there is a difference between a military regime and a democratic administration. \nHe was accompanied by his host, Governor Ganduje, Governor Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State and the deputy governor of Zamfara State, Alhaji Ibrahim Wakala. Buhari said: \u201cWhen I was military head of state, I arrested many people and jailed them for alleged corruption and in the end, I also ended in jail. \n\u201cSince I joined politics in 2003, I contested for president three times but I could not get it right until the fourth attempt in 2015. \u201cI was in court for 30 months challenging the 2007 election and in 2011, I also spent 16 months in court.\u201d \nHe lamented that from 1999 to 2014, Nigeria earned so much money which, according to him, was frittered by preceding administrations. \n\u201cThe country\u2019s wealth was squandered by those that ruled the nation at that period of time due to corruption and when we came, we said things must change for the better,\u201d the President said. Buhari, however, assured that his administration will not relent in its people-oriented projects. \u201cWe are determined to better the life of our people,\u201d he stated, as he commended the Kano Emirate which he said consistently supported him in all the public offices he occupied. \n\u201cI am commending this royal house, for there was nothing I became without consulting the royal house. \u201cI was a governor, a Minister, Head of State and now the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. But in all that I did, I was making consultations with this Emirate Council. I must, therefore, acknowledge and commend the house,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bukola saraki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabiu kwankwanso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alhaji ibrahim wakala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umaru ganduje", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammad sanusi ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwankwanso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dayo adeyeye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saraki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammadu buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aminu abdulsalam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwankwaso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolaji abdullahi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ganduje", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "badaru abubakar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aminu tambuwal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kano state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "all progressives congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jigawa state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peoples democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pdp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emirate council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kano state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal republic of nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kano emirate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zamfara state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivory coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abidjan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:27.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef89eb4ec60ba1ddfc9f9183e2d88ae511a51659", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p.OPtisgNi8gljwQjwenbMqUgZsP8dxYf", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/qst/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/qst/ - Quests - 4chan", "title": "Stranded Mech Quest", "title_full": "/qst/ - Stranded Mech Quest - Quests - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T07:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 92, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a53ffac18c51b8eaa3e7f5bbc9b7aef29faf7bfc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p.OPtisgNi8gljwQjwenbMg.reRYy9ptphiT0zQ_5Jeg-", "ord_in_thread": 91, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T14:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Rolled 40 (1d100)\n>>2128064\n>>2128065\nseriously? what is it with us rolling so low!?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:27.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf6fdcdf80be582395d672c89d28541f013ca080", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qXsKhPHdwxyOAkUTQqB0C97_aKTrTaEdVtozbXiYhRFb", "site_full": "www.bbc.co.uk", "site": "bbc.co.uk", "site_section": "http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_uk_edition/scotland/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BBC News - Scotland", "title": "Scottish Gossip: Moussa Dembele, Celtic, Derek McInnes, Aberdeen, Rangers", "title_full": "Scottish Gossip: Moussa Dembele, Celtic, Derek McInnes, Aberdeen, Rangers", "published": "2017-12-07T08:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/composite-logo/118CD/production/_97758817_football_gossip_16x9.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 108, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf6fdcdf80be582395d672c89d28541f013ca080", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qXsKhPHdwxyOAkUTQqB0C97_aKTrTaEdVtozbXiYhRFb", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T08:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Scottish Gossip: Moussa Dembele, Celtic, Derek McInnes, Aberdeen, Rangers", "text": "Read more about sharing.

There is a musical version and a radio adaptation but the only hope we had of putting on a stage play was getting permission from the man who had adapted the film into a straight play and held the rights.\u201d \nThe venue managed to track down James W Rodgers to his home in Kentucky. \n\u201cWe got in touch and he was so thrilled that we had asked him that he was more than willing to agree for us to use his adaptation,\u201d said Sophie. \u201cThe problem was that he only had one copy of it and it was all typed up on a typewriter; he didn\u2019t have anything he could email.\u201d \nThe original adaptation also had over 40 different characters in it. So through phone calls and emails, Sophie worked with James on making it into something which would work for a cast of 10. \n\u201cIt took me three weeks to write the final version which I sent to James, so he now has something which he can send out to other theatres,\u201d said Sophie. \nThe stage adaptation - featuring George Bailey, who is visited by his guardian angel on Christmas Eve as he contemplates suicide - remains true to the film which starred James Stewart. \nJohn Kirby is tasked with taking on the role of George with Cassandra Webster as Mary and Richard Quinn as Clarence. \n\u201cIt is such a huge privilege for us all to be able to stage this for the first time in the UK,\u201d said Sophie. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the perfect production for Christmas.\u201d \nIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life, Oswaldtwistle Civic Arts Centre and Theatre, Friday, December 15 and Saturday, December 16.

Just as fast as he withdrew them he re-inserted them into his pocket. \"Now, if you look to your right...\" and Jacob did just that. Hard to believe that this was once flooded with anomalies, just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Vegas. For some reason people decided to return and build here, even though there were probably a million better places to set up in America.\nBut that didn't matter now. He was disembarking the monorail as he recalled facts from the history book he swiped a few weeks back. This realitie's history wasn't that much different than his own, but subtle differences could definitely fuck him over if he wasn't aware. He didn't plan on digging into politics or philosophy, just dates, names, and events. He rattled off the answers to the security questions almost too readily, but the guards just waived it off as an over exited settler. They did a quick search of his bag, and he was almost ready to go.\nWhat they didn't wave off, however, was the pack of smokes he kept in his uniform's breast pocket. \"Hey, motherfucker-\" Spencer started to say as he the guard took the pack of cigarettes out of his pocket. The sound of a baton clicking out of it's holster made his eyes snap front. \"Have a nice fucking day, bitch.\" He said as he swiped up his bag from the counter and walked away, hoping the guard wouldn't hit him in the back as he tried to blend in with the crowd. Thankfully, he didn't get his skull cracked open from behind, and he eventually found his way to the station.\nHe found his way to the Closure Department, a seemingly unspectacular department compared to the other divisions of the DAA. A simple piece of paper with scribbled pen marks labeled his destination, and his guard escort departed after he made contact with the doorknob. He entered the room, and looked around a few seconds before speaking. \"Is this the fuckin' Krusty Krab?\" He asked, half joking, almost half serious. He helped himself to a chair that wasn't facing away from the door as he awaited an answer, observing some of the other occupants of the room.\nTwo other anomalies, hopefully they couldn't tell Spencer apart. A mad scientist looking mothefucker, a pink hoodie in the Nevada heat, three other normal looking people, although normal didn't really mean much anymore. He simply sat quietly, taking in observations of the other people's behavior, not even bothering to be discreet. Discretion was something that didn't mean much in the Zone, and Spencer sure as shit stopped giving a fuck about personal opinions long ago, so he could give a fuck less about what these people thought of him.\nHe was here for one thing though, to learn things.

The South African not yet being fully acclimatized to the somewhat shaky and unpredictable weather.\nOnly in the zone. Only in this godless hellhole.\nMarshall Lanik, that was the guy who she was waiting idly outside for. Marshall Lanik. Certainly an interesting name. What is that? Czech? Polish? She pondered, realizing that she didn't really know all that much about the guy. Sure, she had read his file, a guy in his early forties who had been with the company significantly longer than she had, having somewhat close to twice the experience of herself, sporting some impressive commendations. Although the guy lacked military experience and had never been to the zone before, making her wonder why he was in charge. Sure, he was good at his job, but it was an entirely different ball game out here. Nothing short of a fucking free for all at times. Even within the district itself. Sure, it was \"safe\", safe in comparison to beyond the wall. But the district had some amount of armed protection rolling around. Department of anomalous affair soldiers, static permitted guards, private military contractors. It'd probably only be a matter of time before something kicks off.\nEmily's attention was quickly grabbed by a sudden influx of people coming out of the station, her tired and bored eyes hidden behind a set of Ray Ban sunglasses quickly perked up as she began to scan the crowd for her partner, extinguish the lit cigarette on her boot heel. White guy, mid forties Her head moved on a swivel as she checked over the various people. It wasn't exactly a lot to do on and aside from the picture in his file, she didn't really know what the guy looked like, although when she asked some lads back at the compound she was quickly told that she couldn't miss him under subdued snickers. Leaving her with a feeling that she was being left out of a joke in which she was going to be the punchline.\nFunnily enough, the guys were right. It wouldn't take all that long.\nFrom amongst the crowd she spotted what she could only describe as a fucking cowboy. A forty-something fucking cowboy making a bee-lining right towards here.\nJesus Christ.\nSure the guy was a Texas ranger, but she didn't expect such a walking stereotype. The company had a bit of a reputation for being cowboys and they weren't all that liked here because of it, but she didn't expect them to actually employ real wannabe yee-haw cowboys. Her eyebrows shot up from behind the sunglasses as she stared right at the guy with a confused look, letting off a subdued chuckle as he closed in. Probably the wrong guy. Hopefully the wrong guy. But that was quickly dashed by the fact that he raised his hand to wave at her and promptly introduced himself offering out his hand for a firm shake.\nGreat. Stuck here for six weeks with a spaghetti western extra reject. She wasn't sure if she was supposed to be embarrassed or amused.\n\"Yeah, that's me.\" Emily replied, her South African accent fairly notable as she gave the man's hand a firm shake. \"Who are you supposed to be? John wane bru?\" she joked, a wiry grin popping up on her face before he started going on about being more of a Gene Autry, whoever that was. \"Greetings aside.

Every time his view traveled around the car he and his two friends had occupied they were either casting terrified glances his way, or sending glares towards Boris. The man in yellow for once had removed the mask covering his mouth and chin revealing a five o'clock shadow covering most of his face, as well as the dimpled chin that man had. His glasses still covered his notably green eyes. Though Kowalski had known his eye color for a long bloody time. Of course the Slavic man was talkative as always. Regaling the group with some tale of an encounter with a car sized platypus. If this were 2015 he'd call bullshit immediately, but after everything eh'd experienced, he didn't. Car sized animals were rather commonplace in the world today, as unfortunate as it was.\nKowalski regretted not being able to sigh... Well he regretted a lot, missed a hell of a lot more. It took him so much time to get used to not needing sleep, or food, or air. The amount of times he'd need Nemo to push his ass into a pool to get out of a raging path of a firestorm or an explosion numbered too many, the amount of hours he'd spent alone, in the night, watching over his companions had also numbered in the hundreds, but they were worth it. These two were his family now, and he wouldn't let a goddamn thing happen to them.\nNemo felt rather uncomfortable as the trio moved through the security line, nearly every eye was on either her or Kowalski. Kowalski, for being a two meter tall hunk of metal and carbon. Herself for being roughly the same size and standing within four feet of him. In front of the duo, Boris stood getting patted down because the security agents wouldn't be arsed to believe his claims of simply having a metal rod in his arm. Behind them was about eight feet of free space that everyone left for the scary robot and their amazonian friend.\nAfter Boris was shuffled out of the line and to the far side of the terminal. With no luggage and no other object to be screened, Kowalski simply stepped through the metal detector after a moment of deliberation. As expected to all but the security team it started blaring.\n\"Sir, do you have anything metal on you?\"\nThere was a blatant pause by nearly everyone within ear shot before Kowalski replied, \"Yeah, I got a few fillings when I was 12, teeth never grew out for some reason.\"\nAnother officer took the reigns from there, \"Alright, there's no need to be rude. New guy, just going through the general operation. Don't start any shit or you'll end up in a trash compactor.\" Kowalski shook his head and continued to the other side of the terminal.\nWhen Nemo went through, she paused to releive her back of the hearty ALICE pack she had donned for the trip.

It was an interesting bunch, certainly far more than they'd expected for an operation like this. Contractors from some South African security company, anomalies and a cowboy, for some odd reason. As the room finally began to settle, Ryan straightened his tie, the motioned to Lana.\n\"You wanna start?\"\nShe shrugged, rising from the chair and sauntering over to the front of the table. She wasn't a short woman by any stretch of the imagination, but some of the new recruits seemed to tower over her. The robot and the pink haired chick most especially. She kept a close eye on them as she started. Working with freaks made her nervous. The girl in pink, Brain, flipped an overhead projector on. Behind Lana was displayed the logo of the Department of Anomalous Affairs. A large eye, surrounded by a semicircle. A crosshair, like that of a rifle scope, replaced the pupil. Beneath was a phrase, presumably in latin, reading Certa Tenebrae . There was something uniquely unnerving about it to Lana, and she went out of her way to avoid looking at it as she spoke.\n\"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Closure Department. The second least favorite department of the United States Zone Reclamation Program. My name is Lana, and the two eggheads are Ryan and Brain.\"\n\"For those of you that don't know what we do here, I'll try to be brief. The estimated casualty numbers of the Zone, both physical and psychological, are estimated to be at least one million. In addition to that million, at least fifteen thousand are believed to be missing. The goal here, is to try and find evidence of what might have happened to those missing people. Whether it's a living person, a body or just a blood stain.\"\nThe projector clicked again. This time displaying a map of the containment zone. A series of lines had been drawn marking the areas of highest activity, with a blue zone marking the reclaimed territory. It clicked once more, with the map now showing a thin red line running from Boulder up past the epicenter of the Zone, and towards the comparatively small Ruby Lake. Lana continued.\n\"Under normal circumstances, we don't conduct operations beyond a few miles into the Zone. Safety concerns and all that. The reason we've brought so many of you in is because the next operation is much further out and potentially, more dangerous. The reason for all the pomp and circumstance is this man, Isaac Malone.\"\nAnother click. A photograph of a young man, early thirties. Suit and tie.\n\"Malone was a senator for the state of Nevada. His father had been governor beforehand. Three years ago, Malone went missing just inside the containment wall. He was taking a helicopter to survey the interior containment areas just outside Mesquite. PR stunt, basically. An expansion event occurred not long after and Malone's helicopter went down during the chaos. The wreckage was recovered when the Zone started receding, but only the bodies of the pilot and Malone's security detail were found. Now, it was assumed that Malone had been dead this whole time. It's not that remarkable for bodies to disappear or just go for a stroll on their own around here. What is remarkable is this-\"\nShe motioned to the screen.\n\"When the Senator went into the zone originally, security mandated that he be fitted with a tracking device. It went dark just after his chopper went down. During a routine scan of Zone frequencies, DAA intelligence discovered that Malone's tracking device was not only active again, it was transmitting his location. Ruby Lake National Wildlife Reserve, in one of the Northernmost regions of the Zone.\"\nBrain flicked the projector off while Ryan quickly began collecting his things, eager to present his part of the orientation. Lana continued, trying to ignore her colleagues as they hefted cardboard boxes full of unimaginably expensive equipment around like children at a playground.\n\"Resources are pretty scare as of late, with most of the USPF and the DAA tied down with getting District Five established and under control. That means that we've been asked to make the trip up North and check it out. Malone's disappearance has been huge conspiracy nut fodder for years, so the brass is particularly keen to figure out how he managed to travel, presumably unarmed , across the entirety of the most inhospitable place on Earth.\"\nThe gathered crowd seemed unimpressed. Lana merely sighed.\n\"These two will run you through the equipment you'll be working with. Noah Detectors, MOPP gear, that sort of thing.\"\nRyan chimed in from behind, sneering.\n\"It's Nowak detector.\"\n\"No one cares.\"\nShe turned her attention back to the others.\n\"While we're waiting on them, I'll take questions.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:28.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3541611b8c036e449647e39506d6842ee032a0cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoI8H9WGuuanUUygMN0Cwp4GAAPWKqULvFiBH5MFf7NC26dw1NF5S880U4EWeLrbHBD9NL.fg8bAA--", "site_full": "blogdodjalmalopes.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://blogdodjalmalopes.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BLOG DJALMA LOPES", "title": "REFLEX\u00c3O!", "title_full": "REFLEX\u00c3O!", "published": "2017-12-07T12:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "BR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3541611b8c036e449647e39506d6842ee032a0cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoI8H9WGuuanUUygMN0Cwp4GAAPWKqULvFiBH5MFf7NC26dw1NF5S880U4EWeLrbHBD9NL.fg8bAA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Djalma Lopes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "REFLEX\u00c3O!", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:29.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eeb0d37ffc616e4dc92f70849f2e911a49355974", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7WDAJUSevcP1leT3SG_QSJ1N66IYvZq9y0uSGl4Dp45vFt8YvhoXefpmnlZFNDJU-", "site_full": "www.clubsnap.com", "site": "clubsnap.com", "site_section": "http://www.clubsnap.com/forums/", "site_categories": ["photography", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "ClubSNAP Photography Forums", "title": "INDISCRIMINATE PARKING OF BISCYCLES", "title_full": "INDISCRIMINATE PARKING OF BISCYCLES", "published": "2017-12-07T01:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.clubsnap.com/cs-fb.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 75990, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d6cd18b606f9de55737ecd4c0de35c241656a334", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7WDAJUSevcP1leT3SG_QSJ1N66IYvZq9y0uSGl4Dp45vFt8YvhoXeMT7yyroLgRIj_kahaGAwFdKcoS9oMAI3Iq23Jf_kUbA-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "BBTM", "published": "2017-12-06T22:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Originally Posted by Yappy The vendors make money while providing the service.\nUsers park the bicycles indiscriminately.\nWho is responsible to ensure that the bicycles are parked at the right place.\nVendors, LTA or the police...?

Besides the guy made out of metal and the hermaphrodite, the girl called Brain had pulled out... something, out of a bag. It looked like nothing was in her hand, yet when she slammed it on the table, the wood cracked. Ryan had a device called a \"Nowak Detector\", which looked darn old. He said it could detect anomalous radiation. When he pointed its wand at the \"Empty\", it began to beep so fast he thought it was gonna bust. Arnold stepped back. If it was gonna blow, he didn't wanna get hit.\nIt didn't explode, though. Ryan's explanation on what these were intrigued Arnold. What was this stuff? How'd it end up here? Why was it here?\nArnold had heard many things about what happened here, or at least what the government was willing to share. Arnold was here for a major reason. To find his father, and he knew he had to be here, somewhere. He knew what whatever that was, a lot of other bad things were here, too. He didn't know if his dad was dead or alive, but he wanted an answer, one way or another.\nArnold gathered his equipment, including one of those Nowak devices. His own equipment was rather light, at least in comparison to the rest of the folks here; he had a classic Diamondback revolver, a big ol' assault rife, and a simple flashlight. When he tried out the flashlight, it shined pretty damn far.\nArnold jumped into the truck with the rest of the group. Once they had left the district, everything quickly became silent, and dead. As they drove out of the safety of the district, he grew nervous. He felt vulnerable. The gunfire didn't help. Looking out the truck window, he could see old ruins, not lived in for years. He saw strange men in white uniforms and masks going in and out of houses, some carrying black body bags. Then he thought that his time in this truck might be the only time he could have some peace, so he stopped looking out. He noticed one of the guys sitting next to him. When he walked in the Closure Department, he looked like he came straight from 'Antonio. He recalled his name; Marshall Lanik.\n\"Hey,\" he piqued, \"You look more like a cowboy than I do.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:29.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eeb0d37ffc616e4dc92f70849f2e911a49355974", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7WDAJUSevcP1leT3SG_QSJ1N66IYvZq9y0uSGl4Dp45vFt8YvhoXefpmnlZFNDJU-", "site_full": "www.clubsnap.com", "site": "clubsnap.com", "site_section": "http://www.clubsnap.com/forums/", "site_categories": ["photography", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "ClubSNAP Photography Forums", "title": "INDISCRIMINATE PARKING OF BISCYCLES", "title_full": "INDISCRIMINATE PARKING OF BISCYCLES", "published": "2017-12-07T01:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.clubsnap.com/cs-fb.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 75990, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "82a0a87eaf6c7ff5cb2ffda2c50b754108716e1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7WDAJUSevcP1leT3SG_QSJ1N66IYvZq9y0uSGl4Dp45vFt8YvhoXeMT7yyroLgRIj_kahaGAwFUn7aJND1Q0XtTs01FZKczk-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Edwin Francis", "published": "2017-12-06T21:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Originally Posted by diver-hloc Hard Truth.... sometimes just felt like we just don't deserve good/new things....

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

Simple - kobolds weren't merely existing there, they were living in that crypt. They had a makeshift kitchen, small rug and some bedrolls. And they had their own problem - another monster deep in the crypt. Players were tasked with retrieving something from this crypt, and as you see - their goals were kinda connected. Kobolds wanted mummy gone, players wanted something mummy guards, so by befriending kobolds they could ignore all kobold traps and keep their resources instead of wasting them on unnecessary battle. Fully rested and well armed they defeated old mummy and received two rewards - one from grateful kobolds and one from their original employer. My players took a liking to those small creatures, defending them later from people's accusations and asking them for help in locating another old crypt in the same forest.\n\nThe answer to murderhoboism (treating every living being like a bag of experience points waiting to be killed) is to make all creatures purposeful. In my example kobolds weren't just sitting and waiting for heroes to come and kill them - they were trying to cook come nuts, since they hardly had any food left. This is fairly simple example since kobolds are intelligent creatures, but it's not limited to smart monsters. For example griffins aren't just attacking at random, they are hunting for food and will flee if prey turns out too dangerous for them. If monsters are part of the world, it's quite natural that there will be some unusual examples of cooperation and friendship with them.\n\n\nNot talking about tentacle monsters though...

(Shutterstock/gpointstudio) \nNicole Mortillaro Senior Writer, Science and Technology \nNicole has an avid interest in all things science. As an amateur astronomer, Nicole can be found looking up at the night sky appreciating the marvels of our universe. She is the editor of the Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and the author of several books. Related Stories Do babies show bias? Researchers seek the roots of racism \nA new study out of York University suggests most white children as young as five years old show racial bias in favour of other white children. \nResearchers in Toronto conducted several tests involving more than 350 white children to gain a better understanding of implicit bias, which is bias that is automatic and unbeknownst to the individual. \nThe participants completed a child-friendly version of the implicit association test (IAT), a recognized bias test developed by researchers at Harvard University. \nThey were shown a series of photos on a computer screen, each one featuring either a white boy or a black boy, and for each image the children were asked to choose with their mouse whether it made them feel happy or sad. \nBoth age groups, five- to eight-year-olds and nine- to 12-year-olds, showed greater positivity toward white children than black children. \nAnother test involved what's known as an affect misattribution procedure (AMP). The children were shown either a black child, white child or grey square. Milliseconds later, they were shown an ink blot and asked if the blot was pleasant or unpleasant. Researchers say the answer exposes bias toward the image shown before the ink blot. \nThe researchers found, overall, there was no evidence the children displayed either negative or positive attitudes toward black children. \n\"They were showing positivity toward white kids, but not necessarily negativity toward black kids,\" lead researcher Jennifer Steele told CBC News. Egocentric attitudes \nOne reason for the bias may be the fact that young children \u2014 up to about eight years old \u2014 tend to be egocentric, believing that they are better than others, researchers say. \nThough the children didn't express negativity toward black children, Steele says they were still indicating a preference for other white children. \n\"It's still a racial bias, but it just gives us a little more information about the nature of that bias, which then can allow us to reflect a little bit on what an appropriate intervention might be or what might benefit kids if we're just trying to increase a positive attitude toward a diverse group of kids in a classroom, for example.\" York University researcher Jennifer Steele says teaching children positive attitudes early on could benefit them as they get older. (Shutterstock/Rawpixel.com) \nThe study found that in the AMP test, older children \u2014 aged nine to 12 \u2014 didn't show a positive bias toward white children.The researchers suggest this is because they've developed an appreciation for the differences in others, and have begun focusing on associating with those who share common characteristics, such as social interests. But that doesn't necessarily mean the implicit bias they might have displayed a few years earlier won't return. Increasing positivity \nSteele, who also plans to study bias in black children, says most research suggests trying to eliminate implicit bias by focusing on getting rid of negative attitudes isn't the best approach. \n\"Instead, focusing more on trying to help children acquire positive attitudes to people from ... different racial groups or different ethnic groups or people from different backgrounds, I think, is probably the best approach.\" \nAnd while some experts believe that teaching children to be colour-blind and not place people into racial groups might be a way to eliminate racial bias, Steele and others argue this could leave children unable to identify discrimination when they witness it. 'Through positive role models we can point out that there are successful, interesting people who come from all sorts of different backgrounds.' - Jennifer Steele, York University \n\"It's that lack of discussion that can lead to increases in bias,\" said Sarah Gaither, an assistant professor in Duke University's department of psychology and neuroscience. \nHowever, having those discussions is a delicate matter with its own challenges, she says. \n\"If you're not taking the colour-blind approach ... that leads to the question: do you teach white children that perhaps they're privileged in our society instead? It's this awareness of privilege that we need to figure out how to talk to kids about,\" she told CBC News. \"No one likes to be told that they're biased or privileged.\" \nAnd doing so, she says, could increase that bias accidentally. Police must acknowledge racial bias to fix it \nSteele says exposing children to a variety of races and cultures at an early age is important. \n\"Fortunately, now with the internet there are so many different ways we can expose children to diversity, and through positive role models we can point out that there are successful, interesting people who come from all sorts of different backgrounds,\" Steele said. \n\"And exposing them to that so they're aware of that is valuable and important.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicole", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicole mortillaro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer steele", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah gaither", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steele", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cbc news kids", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "york university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duke university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbc news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "science and technology  nicole", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "journal of the royal astronomical society of canada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:30.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "697b1360cecf767b54a6c54dd7338053fb2a5a44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7OKJaXAXqLNWTM2Jb9Z8m4roLnTmXF75LPRSvnzlMqgSfbHUEYg_TuJR8uVHUwpmwltFrRVagqy24DvIwApUNk0-", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/json?page=1&sort=newest&pagesize=15&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'json' Questions -

Of course, many airlines have upped their game over the last few years offering premium customers luxurious comfort in the form of gourmet onboard meals and other \u201cwow\u201d factor perks but Singapore Airlines is taking it one step further with the introduction of double bed suits on the Airbus A380 . \nSingapore Airlines recently revealed its forward-facing double beds and double suit to share on the Airbus A380, and we all pretty much responded with shock and awe. The lavish offering is available for Business Class passengers and is indeed something well worth the splurge. \nThe new offering will debut on five new A380s to be delivered this year and next year with the aircraft retrofit work expected to start in late 2018, with all 14 aircraft scheduled for completion by 2020. And, even Economy passengers will benefit from the aircraft overhaul with Singapore Airlines\u2019 promising that the new A380 cabin will offer more personal space in all classes. \nCheck out Singapore Airlines\u2019 new offering here: Want more great travel reads?

People on Medicaid are prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But a new survey says that\u2019... \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington.

After the match Trickett said to Blom, \"Viktor got me in a $200k pot with just four outs on the flop. That one hurt because I was already buried\", before adding philosophically, \"It's the life I choose...haha\" \nToo bad for host Trickett, the game ended as him being one of the biggest losers, dropping $230,000. Of course, this amount may not put a significant dent in his vault, because in the past seven years he has cashed almost $20 million from live tourneys. His biggest live cash is from 2012 WSOP, when he got 2nd place in the $1 million buy-in Big One for the One Drop tournament for $10,112,001. This achievement put him on the poker world map as Great Britain's all-time most successful poker player. \nThe evening's biggest loser so far was Tsoukernik, as Blom snatched another 6-figure pot from him, and at the final stretch of the match, the King's Casino owner was losing a lot from both Blom and especially Zhang, who was able to come strong in the later stages of the game, finishing with more than $300,000 (but he still lost $75,000 in the game). Tsoukernik's loss cost him $250,000 that evening. \nClever Rob Yong was able to walk away as the second big winner from this match as he decided to call it quits halfway throughout the match, since he's already satisfied with the $290,000 profit he made. \nSource: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "viktor blom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tsoukernik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viktor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob yong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trickett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam trickett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leon \u2018kingsofleon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "plo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "low flops partypoker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dusk till dawn poker club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wsop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king's casino", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tsoukernik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:34.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6c3499b3aed42c73cccde6dca4db45d20c89c9d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRb.vZWGoXpxCVGZBrm75m86y7L7EcCX9G6Hui_yMZ7MvB048pRU72CJD9TGUs1mz0HOYxpWnmV6JISCYYiipa5L.FLeJ6vjmzUCh_gES3wh7F4kSSArqKZpU.AcKrHZs8brAVKWB2Ttg--", "site_full": "demockerycy.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "EU to Sue Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic Over Asylum Policy \u2013 DeMockeryCy", "title_full": "EU to Sue Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic Over Asylum Policy \u2013 DeMockeryCy", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.999, "main_image": "http://ift.tt/2BIh9Wk", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6c3499b3aed42c73cccde6dca4db45d20c89c9d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRb.vZWGoXpxCVGZBrm75m86y7L7EcCX9G6Hui_yMZ7MvB048pRU72CJD9TGUs1mz0HOYxpWnmV6JISCYYiipa5L.FLeJ6vjmzUCh_gES3wh7F4kSSArqKZpU.AcKrHZs8brAVKWB2Ttg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Author", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "EU to Sue Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic Over Asylum Policy \u2013 DeMockeryCy", "text": "EU to Sue Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic Over Asylum Policy via The Wire http://ift.tt/2iBwNvf A barbed wire is seen in front of a EU flag at an immigration reception centre in Bicske, Hungary June 25, 2015. Credit: Reuters/Laszlo Balogh \nBrussels: The EU\u2019s executive will sue Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic in the bloc\u2019s top court for their refusal to host asylum-seekers, two EU sources said on Wednesday. \nThe Eu ropean Commission will announce the decision on Thursday, the sources said, stepping up a legal case it opened against the three last summer. \nThe countries have declined to shelter asylum-seekers despite an over all drop in arrivals due to tighter borders and projects beyond the EU \u2018s frontiers to discourage migration to Eu rope. \nThey say the mainly-Muslim refugees have no place in their homogeneous, predominantly Christian societies and cite security concerns given deadly attacks by Islamist militants in Eu rope. \nTheir reluctance to help host migrants from Africa and the Middle East who came to Eu rope mainly in 2015 has opened a rift with many other Eu ropean g over nments. \nThese include Greece and Italy, two countries that have been the first port of call for refugees and migrants, as well as Germany and other wealthy Western nations that are frequently their preferred final destinations. \nThey say the post-communist countries have failed to show sufficient solidarity with their peers and have threatened retribution, including siphoning away some of the funds the bloc contributes to their development. \nThe eastern states have already lost one case on the matter at the Luxembourg-based Eu ropean C ourt of Justice. The new case heralds months of legal wrangling on an is sue that has undermined the EU \u2018s ability to tackle other problems. \nThe dispute has also blocked reform of the bloc\u2019s broader asylum system, which collapsed under the 2015 influx as g over nments struggled to control the situation. \nThe number of new arrivals has fallen sharply since then. This has made finding a policy solution less pressing.

Is it better to fight or to confront to anything definitely? Is there any fear to be isolated or to be a village odori? An inquiry by some 13 years old girl, \" Why is it wrong to escape, any beasts go away from things unpleasant or dangerous?\" moved me so much. The cultural society has a tendency not to recommend evasion, for example, a soldier who escaped from strategy front is easily killed by rife shooting done not by the enemy but by friendly force. Are we obliged to obey blindly the unexplainable manners and customs in peaceful days here now? Of course I know that, in order to keep some group in peaceful condition, there must be any decisions to be followed, person who cannot accept the Law would be isolated or be bounced off. We often stand on the point to choose, stay or escape. A safest way of living in a group is obeying and following the Law, thinking, saying and behaving the same as others. A person who do not accept decided manners and customs should leave the group. Incidents and conflicts happen in a Family Society in the World. Probably, he or she would see another comfortable world outside after that. So, we don't have any reason to deny to run away, to leave or to escape however difficult to do that in a settlement society. \u6295\u7a3f\u8005", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "world", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:34.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d727b4e2ff27995382f59cce7398a1e08b890be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYifT1Cb4KH43DMdjEDkOe6xXgJLiwecEFn84ADellLumkuanj4S1smCtGA3.dsPasQ--", "site_full": "www.adverts.ie", "site": "adverts.ie", "site_section": "http://www.adverts.ie/for-sale/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Adverts.ie - Recent Ads All 824,848 listings", "title": "Sports watch. with light", "title_full": "Sports watch. with light", "published": "2017-12-07T11:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://a0.amlimg.com/NDY4Yjk5Y2MxOWQyYjljNmY3ZDMyMjFlY2YyODgzYzjWFXiQsWIbGSGtJVCTvN3paHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmFkc2ltZy5jb20vODk5ODNhMGE2MzI3ZjdjZTNjMmRhYmI1MDU4MjMyM2VlNDFhY2NhZThhMGQ3ZmU4M2ViYjYyOTgyZmVkZGJhMS5qcGd8fHx8fHwzOTN4Mjk0fGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuYWR2ZXJ0cy5pZS9zdGF0aWMvaS93YXRlcm1hcmsucG5nfHx8.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d727b4e2ff27995382f59cce7398a1e08b890be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYifT1Cb4KH43DMdjEDkOe6xXgJLiwecEFn84ADellLumkuanj4S1smCtGA3.dsPasQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sports watch. with light", "text": "You must be logged in to contact advertiser.
