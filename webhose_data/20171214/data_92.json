And I've never even heard of it until today. Edit: Wow it even costs $12.99 per month - and the domain calm.com couldn't have been cheap. Do developers just buy these awards or something?

Rating: 2 Votes 1 day ago at 08:51 am I've developed my own \"Calm\" app. This is how it works: First, I shut off my computer and my phone. Then I go for a walk, or read a book. Or sometimes, I relax and enjoy an old record, without any distractions. And I simply repeat as desired. Neat, huh? :) naturalstar 1 day ago at 02:03 am Interesting. I\u2019ve had Calm for a few weeks. I find it to be a useful meditation app, especially being able to control how much guided meditation you need. No complaints so far. I obviously can\u2019t compare against thousands of apps in the App Store, but I do like that something focused on a person\u2019s well-being was chosen. I\u2019ve only recently heard about The Witness, will have to check it out. So many apps, so little time. Just looked at Affinity Photo. Added to list. It\u2019s half off right now as well.

I like the stories even though I don\u2019t know how it ends [doublepost=1512659579][/doublepost] Why did they revoke your license? I too hate these monthly subscriptions. The company that I bought CS6 from closed down, so Adobe decided to revoke all the licenses people PAID for. I work for myself, and I couldn't face those kinds of overheads month to month for software when I've got a biz to run and a family of five to feed. I'm sad to see PS and AI go, but I'm loving Affinity so far. Rating: 1 Votes jonnysods 17 hours ago at 05:22 pm Ouch that sucks!

Get inspired with holiday recipes here and purchase your own MI-DEL Pie Crust at Walmart stores nationwide! \nThis year, we will be spending the holidays with my sister. This Christmas is an extra special one because we are expecting a brand new niece. Isn\u2019t that the ultimate gift?! Since everyone\u2019s focus will be centered around the arrival of this little angel, I need to step in and prep for Christmas dinner! You don\u2019t have to ask me twice. I already have a dessert in mind. \nBecause this Christmas will be different than all the rest, I\u2019ve decided to make a pie I\u2019ve never made before: Chocolate pecan pie. The crust for this particular pie is very important. A good, thick graham crust is needed to balance out the layer of chocolate and pecan mixture in this recipe. \nMI-DEL Graham Style Pie Crust is 30 grams thicker than other brands, which means more flavor in each crumbly bite. As an added bonus, MI-DEL Graham Style Pie Crust is gluten free, non-GMO, kosher, and free from allergens. It\u2019s a great crust to use for gatherings where you just don\u2019t know if any of the guests have food allergies. \nBecause I want to spend lots of time with my new niece as well, this deliciously sweet chocolate pecan pie is prepared as fast as it takes for chocolate to melt. This treat is made in layers: The first layer is the crust, and that is ready to go with MI-DEL Graham Style Pie Crust. The second is a layer of chocolate and the third, is the sweet pecan filling. To save time, prepare the pecan filling while the chocolate melts. The pie will be ready and assembled in 10-12 minutes. Bake and enjoy.

In some places, it's already snowing and freezing, and in other areas, it still feels like summer (my place of residence). But, who cares if the weather doesn't match the month on your calendar, it's winter time! \nThis time of year can be stressful with the pressures of finding all your family and friends presents, trying to get home for the Holidays, and the weather just being a huge jerk can take a toll on a person. Well, I encourage you to take a break from this joyous, yet demanding time, and think about yourself for a day. Take one day to Pamper yourself, and I am going to give you a few suggestions on how you can do that. \nHere is what I think a Dream Pamper-Me Winter Day will consist of : \n1. Take a Hot Shower/Bath \nThere is no better way to start a frigid morning than to take a hot and relaxing shower/bath (not too long though). It can help relax you and your muscles, and ease some of that end of the year stress. You have time to use your new body exfoliator, sing your favorite Holiday songs at the top of your lungs, and everything else you can't do on a regular day when everything is hectic. \n2. Food of the day \nI usually eat like a bagel and banana for breakfast (if I eat at all), but I noticed during the winter I crave hot breakfast more. So, since this is your day to treat yourself, make those pancakes, grits, eggs, and bacon! An excellent warm breakfast can make a chilly morning so much better. Also, the best meal to me on a lovely winter's day would have to be a grilled cheese with tomato soup (name a better duo). These food choices will make your insides warm and satisfied. \n3. Hair, Nails, Body \nAs I said before, this a Pamper Yourself type of day, so catch up on everything you wanted/need to do. You've noticed your feet and nails have been looking rough lately, give yourself a manicure and pedicure. You haven't had the time to do your hair in a while; so wash it, condition it, moisturize it, do it! You have had that face mask sitting in the medicine cabinet for a few weeks, now is the time to try it out. Start that skin care routine that supposed to help your body stay moisturized during the Winter. Do things that'll make you and your body feel amazing and stress-free. You never have time to do these things any other day, take advantage of your Pamper-Me Day. \n4. Entertainment \nPamper-Me Day is your day! No TV show compromises, no feeling guilty for being on social media all day, and no headphones! This is your day to wrap yourself up in a huge blanket and binge watch the two seasons of The Fosters you've missed without worrying about anything else.

But when the captain of his ship tries to kill him on the way home from a raiding excursion, he must confront his stepfather's betrayal, and find a way to protect his birthright. It is no easy feat in Viking-Age Norway, where a hundred petty rulers kill over parcels of land, and a prophesied high king is rising. But where Ragnvald is expected to bleed, and even die, for his honour, Svanhild is simply expected to marry well. It's not a fate she relishes, and when the chance to leave her stepfather's cruelty comes at the hand of her brother's arch-rival, Svanhild is forced to make the ultimate choice: family or freedom. Drawing from the Icelandic Sagas, The Half-Drowned King takes inspiration from the true story of Ragnvald of Maer, the right hand man of King Harald Fairhair, first king of all Norway, and his sister, Svanhild, as she tries to find freedom in a society where the higher her brother rises, the greater her worth as a political pawn.

Just as it supported apartheid South Africa's brutality, it now unashamedly supports Apartheid Israel and its ongoing genocide in occupied Palestine.\" \nMandela says the decision has reduced the peace process to a mockery in which the expansion of illegal settlements continues unabated. \n\u201cOnly the extremely insane and seriously delusional can construe such dastardly acts of aggression against UN recognised Palestinian rights as contributing to peace.\u201d \nThe chief has called upon the Parliament of South Africa to outrightly condemn the move. \nHe has also called upon delegates at the upcoming ANC National General Council to demonstrate indignation and call for a special resolution in condemning \u201cTrump's illegal declaration.\u201d eNCA", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mandela", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mandla mandela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trumps", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "anc national general council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:48.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "47ebd11485dc0e626e80c28f9775d6f9902ac6fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVEdfjH5jkHHv3kumQkSJK_Sh2TpDVbBOM3H.YNVWJssG7JLHp4pFI5YhTTfZCAZok-", "site_full": "news.discuss.com.hk", "site": "discuss.com.hk", "site_section": "http://news.discuss.com.hk/forumdisplay.php?fid=1136", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "\u7acb\u6cd5\u6703\u4e8b\u52d9 - \u9999\u6e2f\u8a0e\u8ad6\u5340 Discuss.com.hk - \u9999\u8a0e\uff0e\u9999\u6e2f No.1", "title": "\u00a4\u010e\u0160\u00d4\u013d\u0179 \u017a\u013e\u00ad\u00d7\u00adq - \u013d\u00df\u015ek\u02c7|\u00a8\u0106\u00b0\u010c - \u00ad\u0165\u00b4\u00e4\u00b0Q\u02dd\u00d7\u00b0\u010e \u00ad\u0165\u00b0Q\u0104D\u00ad\u0165\u00b4\u00e4 No.1", "title_full": "\u00a4\u010e\u0160\u00d4\u013d\u0179 \u017a\u013e\u00ad\u00d7\u00adq - \u013d\u00df\u015ek\u02c7|\u00a8\u0106\u00b0\u010c - \u00ad\u0165\u00b4\u00e4\u00b0Q\u02dd\u00d7\u00b0\u010e Discuss.com.hk - \u00ad\u0165\u00b0Q\u0104D\u00ad\u0165\u00b4\u00e4 No.1", "published": "2017-12-06T17:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "HK", "spam_score": 0.5, "main_image": "http://n2.hk/d/images/logo/discuss_fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1271, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "133e3ba7f6e6d86de1b72ec432c0780dbed01ed0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVEdfjH5jkHHv3kumQkSJK_Sh2TpDVbBOM3H.YNVWJssG7JLHp4pFI5OoCu0c6owXqzpAN0P.i0ag--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\u0142\u0165", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:48.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce848776fa5816a579a932b5729e616810c87b0a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOS_5hBLgIvVODnMAzo_bojTbHaWxEE.QPiVmL4YkkXXYdLCHJhq9gQvNxDok7Kpa6klDu802Lyb2M5yauA88wAwg8LOOU_fBxj0NEuGhjC_EUY2BMbgdlZeuhJ2l_DDbpKe1H01yYvWots9lhZJHa1", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g190455-i550-Norway.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Norway Forum, Travel Discussion for Norway - TripAdvisor", "title": "Will the whales be back for the 7th season..?

While keeping an eye on the Steam charts, we noticed that the game's number of users was climbing higher and higher, and we were interested in learning about the game's success. \nAs it turns out, Brawlhalla has proven to be a unique case study for games that have a free-to-play audience on PS4, and a chance to learn how developers manage their in-house competitive events. We were lucky enough to be joined by executive producer Zeke Sparkes, who shared a lot of insight on how Brawlhalla has built such a loyal following. \nWe've transcribed some of the more relevant parts of our conversation below. You can also watch the stream embedded above, or click here to see it on Twitch. \nAnd for more developer insights, editor roundtables, and gameplay commentary, be sure to follow the Gamasutra Twitch channel ! Stream Participants \nBryant Francis, editor at Gamasutra \nAlex Wawro, editor at Gamasutra \nZeke Sparkes, executive producer on Brawlhalla at Blue Mammoth The difference between PS4 and Steam free-to-play communities \nWawro : On PS4, I want to get a dev's perspective on what the difference is in terms of community. You've been on Steam for awhile, so I know there's a lot more time there, but how has the reception been on console versus when you put this game out on PC? \nSparkes : It's been really good. One of the things that surprised us the most was, the community is immediately embracing of free-to-play games. And that kind of took us by surprise. The first time we were invited out to PSX for the last two years. And the first time we went there, we'd done plenty of conventions, we had our pitch and our patter down, we could explain the game, that it's a free-to-play game, it's all cosmetic-based, there's no paying for power or anything like that, you know it's like League of Legends , or Smite , and then people kind of get it. \nWe started that when we went to PSX, when we started talking about it like that. But that perception just doesn't exist on the PS4 platform, because there's not any other kind of free-to-play games. So as soon as you say it's free-to-play, people say, \"Oh wow, really? That's great!\" So you don't have to explain what your approach is, because that's just the assumed approach for that console. So it's been a really good, welcoming community. \nWe don't have as long of a history with that community, so we're still building it up, like our personal relationship with it. It's been great so far, we've had really good reception. People enjoy the game, they're having a lot of fun with it. \nWe're getting way more PlayStation users than we had originally projected, which is great for us but our server engineers are on high-alert. Mid-October is when we launched. We're still watching, each weekend is still kind of new. We take all of the data we got from the previous weekend, we analyze it and figure out how to optimize the server from what we're seeing, during the week, then we watch the next weekend and see how it goes. We're still in a very new and exciting period for that. \nWawro : Free-to-play games became a thing on PS4 a couple of years ago. I remember DCUO and a couple of other things being there I think. I didn't check in with it since then, and I didn't return to that part of the store until Epics' Fortnite put out its free-to-play Battle Royale game on console. And there's so many games in the market these days that it can be very hard as a player to make time to go look at the free-to-play section of the store, because there's already so much stuff being put in front of you right away. \nBut when I checked in on it to take a look at Brawlhalla , I saw all these free-to-play games that looked really compelling. And I remember being in school and not being able to afford games, and I was excited about games like Gunz , with a 'Z,' which was a free-to-play. Yeah, that game was \"interesting,\" but I got really into it because I had a lot of time but I didn't have a lot of money. I'm curious to know how there are so many games in the free-to-play section of the PS Store, and presumably so many people looking for games, because there's over 40 million consoles sold at least. \nYou don't have to give me rates if you can't, but I just want to get a sense of how has the monetization rate of this game on console compared to it on Steam? As I mentioned before you don't have to buy currency, there's the option to buy currency to buy cosmetics. \nSparkes : There's the Founder's Pack of sorts. \nWawro : Yeah. Has that outpaced the Steam version already, is it below pace, is it matching up to what your expectations were? \nSparkes : It's hard to say, because platforms are so different in terms of userbase and installs and how people interact with it. But I would say in general it is outpacing what we had projected. I think it is fair to say it's a little bit stronger than what we're seeing on Steam? Steam is still great, we were good and happy on Steam. \nYou said there's a lot of free-to-play games on PS4, so now that it's sort of coming into its own, how does that compare? And I think that there's still a lot of space. I mean, if you look at it comparatively, how many there are on PS4 versus PC, it's just...a lot of free-to-play games that we have to be in the pack of on PS4 is a much smaller set, and there's not really another one like us. So, for us, it's been great. Like I've said, we're getting more players than had originally been projected, and they're seemingly loving the game as much as we hoped, so everything's really good. Building a community from the ground up \nWawro : We talked a bit about how you started on the Steam forums and went from there. I want to expand upon that and ask, was it entirely grassroots, and all community management working in forums, or did you guys do marketing and promotion outside of that? I know you guys did events obviously, but did you go to any YouTubers, did you do any ads, that kind of thing? \nSparkes : Most of it was organic, most of it was our interactions with whoever, that doesn't necessarily mean just our interactions with community, we got to know the folks at Twitch, and any time we had an opportunity we'd jump on it. The game is meant to be played in short sessions, it's very easy to get into. Because we worked on making it so accessible, that increased the number of things we could do. \nSo if somebody was looking for something, like we were in a Loot Crate . That was a nice help for us to get viewership, users, and also a sense of legitimacy. You get a big brand like that that says \"This is really cool, they did a cool thing for us! Everybody that's in Loot Crate can be a part of this.\" Being in Loot Crate is a fun, awesome thing. We built it in a flexible way so that we can do weapon skins, we can do K.O. effects, we can do color schemes. So any time there was any opportunity to work with somebody to do a collaboration, we were able to jump on it in a meaningful way. So a lot of the organic growth wasn't just us with the community, it was us working with partners as well. \nWe've done some paid stuff, it's been pretty small. We've found Twitch is a much better platform for us than YouTube, so we've stuck mostly with Twitch. We do our YouTube channel to put stuff out there, but we've had better success dealing with Twitch influencers than YouTube influencers, for instance, I think because it's easier to get into an immediate game when you're watching it in real-time when you're interacting with someone and talking about it, it's easy for you to participate in that as well, and that immediacy, because there's no barriers there, the game itself, we can tell a difference when there's a barrier in time. This is our best guess. \nSo we just try to be active everywhere we can, we try to take every opportunity we can with our partners, and that's how we've driven it. We've done a few traditional ad campaigns as well, to help out, but really that beginning growth was organic. Some advice for devs who want to run their own competitive events \nWawro : If you're capable, can you share any lessons learned from running competitive events, that other devs maybe dipping a toe into this could learn from? \nSparkes : Yeah: it's really hard! (laughter) There is so much more than you will ever think of. I cannot recommend enough that you talk and learn with somebody, hire somebody, contract with somebody who has done it before. Because there's so many things going on, and if you've never put on one of these events there's things you've never thought about. \nWhen we first started doing events, I was like, \"What do you mean I have to tell you how much electricity I'm going to use?\" I'm going to use whatever comes out of the plug, I don't know! And the difference between getting your power done right or wrong could be five thousand dollars! It's crazy! So get somebody who has done it before. We've been going to conventions since PAX East 2014. We do RTX and we do TwitchCon, PSX and all sorts of stuff, and we always learn something new at each one. \nThe costs can escalate very quickly as well, and the more you put into it the more you can stay on the downlow. We're a very, \"Everybody, all hands on deck, and get in and do it ourselves\" kind of studio. If you see our big Brawlhalla sign, whenever you go to a convention, especially PAXes, it's this big, huge, cool sign--we just built it. We didn't get anybody to build it. We built it. Out of a closed-cell foam board that we cut with a hot knife, and print a fifteen-foot-long sticker, and very nerve-wrackingly stick the whole thing on all the way across the sign. \nSo there's a lot of things you can do to make it a little bit easier and more achievable. But the they're hard work, so it's constantly this trade-off between how much can we pay attention to, how much we can handle on our own, and what is it going to cost to handle the rest of it. So you're always balancing that. \nThere are always options. There is always a different way to approach it or think about it. Even if all you can do is spend two hours talking to someone who has put on events or done conventions. Even that will make your experience much better when you do it. \nFor more developer interviews, editor roundtables, and gameplay commentary, be sure to follow the Gamasutra Twitch channel.

Photo: Flickr / GovernmentZA \nJOHANNESBURG \u2013 Presidential contenders are dominating conversation as the ANC hurtles towards its national elective conference on 16 December. \nThe governing party must also decide on which policies it will pursue over the next five years. \nPolicy talks and implementation are often stymied by competing interests and even cold, hard cash. \nThe decisions government takes in the short-to-medium term should be guided by conference resolutions, but things don\u2019t always work out that way. \nWits School of Governance\u2019s Ivor Sarakinsky said: \u201cMoney distorts a democratic policy decision in that you circumvent popular mandates and decision making.\u201d \nThe controversial Gupta family stands accused of manipulating government policy for its own needs and pockets. \nThe contentious mining charter - with a special consideration for naturalised South Africans to benefit from BEE - is a case in point, and more recently, the Naspers set-top box encryption saga with chairperson, Koos Bekker, allegedly meddling directly with the communications department\u2019s mandate. \nPolitical Economist Iraj Abedian said: \u201cWe have corrupted the term policy framework, so we need to sanitise it and clean it in order to ensure policy credibility so that when the president or cabinet makes an announcement, the nation knows its policy.\u201d \nThis is not a South African phenomenon, Sarakinsky pointed out. \n\u201cIt's not uncommon around the world for this to happen. You agree on a whole set of wish-lists on what you want to do, then you confront reality in terms of what you can achieve.

A slight deceleration to around 2% is forecast for 2018. \nResponsible for 1.1% of the EU\u2019s GDP and employing 1.2 million people, the EU chemical industry supplies virtually all sectors of the economy and is the third largest investor in EU manufacturing industries. \nThe recovery of the chemical sector follows the overall economic growth in the EU in the first three quarters of 2017, driven by a robust consumer demand as well as investments in new production capacities. The growth of the EU manufacturing production, primarily in the automotive, construction, metal production and electronics sector, has led to an increased domestic demand for chemicals. Furthermore, the exports of the EU-produced chemicals to, among others, Asia and Russia have increased. \nMarco Mensink, Cefic Director General: The momentum is growing for the EU chemical industry to achieve its maximum production volumes. This will not only help economic growth but will also drive innovation as the solutions provided by the chemical industry help develop cutting-edge technologies and processes in nearly all sectors of the EU economy from consumer electronics to medicines. The chemical industry\u2019s contribution is also key in shaping the transition to a resource efficient, low-carbon and circular economy.\u201d \nAlthough the 2018 industry outlook looks rather positive, the chemical industry remains at risk of investment leakage due to high energy and feedstock prices as well as carbon costs under the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS). \nThe EU chemical industry is facing fierce competition from China and NAFTA countries who currently dominate the global chemicals market. To this end, Cefic will continue working with the European Commission and Member States to further develop the Renewed EU Industrial Policy Strategy in order to improve the EU\u2019s competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis other regions, attract more investments into the sector and create more jobs. \nThe 2017 Facts & Figures of the European Chemical Industry are available here EU #chemical industry is recovering! @Cefic is expecting a 3% growth in chemicals production in 2017 \u2013 highest in t\u2026 https://t.co/DYcD9EfbYL an hour ago from Cefic Great job @Trade_EU , we are glad to see new #EUtrade rules that will provide for a level playing field for EU busin\u2026 https://t.co/sPECDFRRBW 18 hours ago from Cefic RT @ExxonMobil_EU : In 2016, the EU #chemicals industry provided 1.2 million jobs & sales of \u20ac507bn \u2013 so what does the future of the sector\u2026 20 hours ago from Cefic Duty and quota-free access to #bioethanol is essential for the EU #chemical industry to increase its use of renewab\u2026 https://t.co/8Ij01KSpfl yesterday from Cefic Regulatory Framework \nGetting responsible chemicals management recognised throughout the entire supply chain of the chemical industry under a \u201cproportionate framework\u201d \u00bb Learn more about Regulatory Framework Facts and Figures \nThe 2017 Cefic European Facts & Figures provides an analysis of the latest competitive trends in the European chemical industry.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marco mensink", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cefic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european chemical industry council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cefic rt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cefic european facts & figures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cefic regulatory framework  getting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nafta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu industrial policy strategy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cefic duty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cefic great", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:52.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f630101b308736e71abe81cb1dea71e9933cc5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMuarVrhAhMnz95MyOLRiZ0nz48fiMFbkQNTxyaUfkmX1cVrZ2jKEi_nW.urpgj7kM0rKwM7_O1WQeyJA6ZgmAvbdK7EaITkHRDCmGzxzBtmLNabRMuAnaVjd27NBx0GB23dXH.SL8_AY4gV2dvei5UB", "site_full": "vapingunderground.com", "site": "vapingunderground.com", "site_section": "http://vapingunderground.com/forums/vapesourcing-china.753/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "VapeSourcing (China) | Vaping Underground Forums - An Ecig and Vaping Forum", "title": "SMOK G-PRIV 2 Luxe Review | Luxurious box mod meet the TFV12 Prince tank", "title_full": "SMOK G-PRIV 2 Luxe Review | Luxurious box mod meet the TFV12 Prince tank | Vaping Underground Forums - An Ecig and Vaping Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T18:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "http://vapingunderground.com/data/avatars/m/46/46595.jpg?1467352445", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33506, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f630101b308736e71abe81cb1dea71e9933cc5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMuarVrhAhMnz95MyOLRiZ0nz48fiMFbkQNTxyaUfkmX1cVrZ2jKEi_nW.urpgj7kM0rKwM7_O1WQeyJA6ZgmAvbdK7EaITkHRDCmGzxzBtmLNabRMuAnaVjd27NBx0GB23dXH.SL8_AY4gV2dvei5UB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Vaper_girl", "published": "2017-12-06T18:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "SMOK G-PRIV 2 Luxe Review | Luxurious box mod meet the TFV12 Prince tank", "text": "SMOK G-PRIV 2 Luxe Review | Luxurious box mod meet the TFV12 Prince tank\nFollowing the hot SMOK G-priv 2 kit , SMOK just released the newest SMOK G-PRIV 2 Luxe edition , with the upgrade tank from SMOK TFV8 X baby to SMOK TFV12 prince tank, it do have lots of new features.

Theology has misrepresented the teaching of Scripture about the mission of Jesus. Some have portrayed an angry God; others a racist God. Today, to be \u201cpolitically correct\u201d (which is usually Biblically incorrect), we are being offered a genderless God. In each case the \u201cgospel\u201d and \u201cJesus\u201d presented are false both doctrinally and morally. \nThe Bible is very clear about the purposes of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, which basically were to atone for the sin of mankind4 and destroy the works of the devil. Fallen man is lost because Adam and Eve believed the devil\u2019s lie instead of God\u2019s truth. The Son of Man, Jesus Christ, came to save that which was lost. He came to give us life, and that more abundantly. Jesus came to bruise the head of Satan, not man. When Jesus ministered here on earth, He was performing the will of Heaven. \nThe professional religion of the day was off-limits to those whom society rendered unclean or ungodly. Jesus, as recorded in John 8:2-11 and Mark 1:40-42, reveals a blessed truth, and that is that He didn\u2019t come to condemn sinners, but to save and cleanse them. Of course coming to Him involves repentance and a commitment to sin no more. As stated earlier, any \u201cgospel\u201d that perverts grace isn\u2019t presenting the true message of Jesus. \nJesus Christ knows you very well. He knows your struggles, your griefs, your pains, your hidden fears. In fact, He bore all your grief and carried your sorrows, and suffered for your sins on His cross. He\u2019s the One to turn to when you get bruised. His will is to cleanse you, not \u201cclock\u201d you; help you, not hurt you; strengthen you, not smite you. \nWhen Jesus walked on this earth, He was the Hero of the \u201cuntouchables\u201d. And He hasn\u2019t changed one bit! Submit a Comment Your email address will not be published.

They state that 11 of the 26 crappiest school districts in the country are in California. It should be noted however that CA state law requires that students be taught about the contributions of LBGT persons to the wonderfulness that is CA, so they probably have that down good. The plaintiffs want to create a system to monitor literacy levels within the CA school system. Personally I don't see the need. The system is turning out under-educated students. A high school diploma in CA only means that you weren't in prison for the final exam and you tested at the 8th grade level for a 12-year diploma, mostly, kinda-sorta. Everybody knows it. Nobody cares that has any juice to do anything about it. The schools are politically correct, and hand out free condoms. Everything else is secondary.

They couldn't be in better form ahead of this weekend's Merseyside derby and look an absolute banker to beat an Everton side who have failed to win any of their last 15 away matches in the Premier League. The Reds are also unbeaten in the last 14 Merseyside derbies against the Blues in all competitions so this looks a tough assignment for new boss Sam Allardyce. However, while Liverpool have looked imperious going forward they can still be found wanting defensively from time to time so the shout here is backing a Reds win with both teams finding the net. \nSelection: \u00a34 on Liverpool to win and both teams to score at 7/4 with bet365 The Tasty Treble \nManchester City are out to make history this weekend as they look to make it a record straight 14 Premier League wins. Standing in their way are arch rivals Manchester United, who are in decent form themselves and will be desperate to cut the gap in the title race. United's chances have been hampered by the suspension of star man Paul Pogba but even without the influential Frenchman they are good enough to halt the runaway leaders' perfect sequence of Premier League results and the draw looks a play here at 5/2. Elsewhere, Newcastle have shipped 12 goals in their last four games and look destined for a rough winter given their squad limitations. Leicester's recent form has been OK and they could be worth a punt at 9/5 to win on Tyneside. Adding Crystal Palace at a shade of odds on to beat a Bournemouth side who have lost four of their seven matches on the road offers a treble paying over 18/1 with bet365. \nSelection: \u00a32 on the treble at 18.1/1 with bet365 The Euro Wager \nBarcelona looked suspect at the back as they drew 2-2 at home to Celta Vigo last weekend and on Sunday face a tough trip to Villarreal. The Yellow Submarine have scored against the Catalan giants in three of their last four meetings so both teams to score looks a fair price at 5/6. \nSelection: \u00a33 on both teams to score at 5/6 with bet365 The Wildcard Tip \nAnthony Martial has scored eight goals so far this season and the classy Frenchman could be worth nibbling to score first at Old Trafford. You can get 25/1 on Martial finding the net first and the match ending in a draw. \nSelection: \u00a31 on Martial first goal and draw at 25/1 with bet365 The Bookie Basher \nPhilippe Coutinho bagged a hat trick as Liverpool battered Spartak Moscow 7-0 on Wednesday and having scored five in his last five games he looks a tempting price at 6/4 to score any time against Everton. Alvaro Morata is a 5/6 chance to notch against a West Ham side who are second bottom and shipping goals for fun while Alexandre Lacazette is a 6/5 poke to score against Southampton. The anytime goal-scorer treble is paying better than 9/1 and may go very close. \nSelection: \u00a31 on anytime goalscorer treble at 9.08/1 with bet365", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alvaro morata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "basher  philippe coutinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pep guardiola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam allardyce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul pogba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "villarreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandre lacazette", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "everton", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "espn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "catalan giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merseyside", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newcastle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "euro wager  barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southampton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premier league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spartak moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "celta vigo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wildcard tip  anthony martial", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bournemouth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merseyside", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west ham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leicester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyneside", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old trafford", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:53.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d906dc1c6cc70deffcf6f082948e9f090227132c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRif1ko5ATqgb22qezNmu_.RLPz7eo9mLaCPyVFkhWekb.3JJ4ViFiyVNvU_RurTs9N_EuJwp71VZMP8b5P8dEkB8ItqU2RGAc-", "site_full": "manofmany.com", "site": "manofmany.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/manofmany", "site_categories": ["mens_health", "health"], "section_title": "Man of Many", "title": "The Royal Enfield Twins Take Us Back", "title_full": "The Royal Enfield Twins Take Us Back", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://manofmany.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Royal-Enfield-Twins-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d906dc1c6cc70deffcf6f082948e9f090227132c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRif1ko5ATqgb22qezNmu_.RLPz7eo9mLaCPyVFkhWekb.3JJ4ViFiyVNvU_RurTs9N_EuJwp71VZMP8b5P8dEkB8ItqU2RGAc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Man of Many", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Royal Enfield Twins Take Us Back", "text": "> The Royal Enfield Twins Take Us Back The Royal Enfield Twins Take Us Back December 7, 2017 The Royal Enfield Twins Take Us Back December 7, 2017 Man of Many The Royal Enfield Twins Take Us Back By Man of Many in Motorcycles on December 7, 2017 Pin 8 \nRoyal Enfield isn\u2019t looking to break new ground. The reintroduction of the Royal Enfield Twins\u2014the Interceptor and the Continental GT\u2014is proof of that. The bikes are iconic, and hearken back to simpler times. The Interceptor was originally designed in the California style to appeal to young Americans toward the end of the \u201960s when motorcycle riders were viewed as slightly rebellious and even antisocial. The GT, on the other hand, was meant as more for the caf\u00e9 racing crowd of the UK in the \u201950s and \u201960s. \nThe Twins are being brought back as easily accessible bikes for any rider, with the idea of \u201cthe ability to have fun on a motorcycle every single day,\u201d states Royal Enfield President Rudrtej Singh. Both bikes are no-frills. The motor for both is an air-cooled 650cc parallel twin with four valves and a 270-degree crank. The originals of these bikes featured a single engine with lots of torque and low RPMs. This new imagining stayed true to that vision. These aren\u2019t crotch-rockets, but they\u2019ve got enough kick to make your ride enjoyable. But that\u2019s not the only way that Royal Enfield has stayed true to its history. The sound of these bikes is distinctive, with a rhythm that you\u2019ll easily recognize as it comes down the highway. \nThe Royal Enfield Twins do exactly as billed\u2014they take us back to an easier time when riding was about the pleasure of the open road.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rudrtej singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "royal enfield twins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motorcycles    royal enfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "continental", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enfield twins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal enfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:53.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d25b358659c64a2b22c5527a9a00f6733841ced4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9soV4T7Mg_PVxn4lLvCXOWP93RidcbOMvD69TzhxTkrjL.oGDMmdifQ9D_1WXBiIAJuTf_GH_Tw71W4KEhim.y", "site_full": "www.therepublic.com", "site": "therepublic.com", "site_section": "http://www.therepublic.com/feed/cat/2460", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "North Carolina \u2013 The Republic", "title": "North Carolina county\u2019s ransomware recovery will take days", "title_full": "North Carolina county\u2019s ransomware recovery will take days", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://d1bdhkmqqz901h.cloudfront.net/1200x630/smart/http://s3.amazonaws.com/new-smedia/e9ec661a7ba64107b360f95f48905584/e8480e2095a14b1280e0697361be7e9c.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 79823, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d25b358659c64a2b22c5527a9a00f6733841ced4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9soV4T7Mg_PVxn4lLvCXOWP93RidcbOMvD69TzhxTkrjL.oGDMmdifQ9D_1WXBiIAJuTf_GH_Tw71W4KEhim.y", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "North Carolina county\u2019s ransomware recovery will take days", "text": "After cyberattack, much of county\u2019s business done on paper By TOM FOREMAN Jr. and JONATHAN DREW - 12/7/17 6:47 PM \nCHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina\u2019s largest metro area was discovering just how hard it is to conduct business without county computers that handle numerous transactions on Thursday, a day after local leaders refused to pay hackers who froze their system. \nMecklenburg County computer systems that collect property taxes, handle building permits and process jail inmates were out of commission while technology workers made digital repairs with backed-up data. Officials say the fixes will take days. \nCounty officials were also taking new precautions against fraudulent emails because hackers have launched a new attack in response to their refusal to pay ransom. No further damage to the system was reported. \nIn the meantime, a variety of transactions with county government were being done on paper. \nDarryl Broome, a contractor who does remodeling and demolition work, went in person to a county office to retrieve land information he normally could look up on his home computer. He had to drive 10 miles and spent about a half-hour looking through paper records. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit frustrating because you learn that you really need certain things online,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get used to doing certain things online, and when you have to slow down, it costs you time and time costs you money.\u201d \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government said its separate computer system wasn\u2019t affected by the attack. Nor were the computers that handle 911 calls and dispatch for the city and county, said Charlotte Fire Department Deputy Chief Richard Granger. \nMecklenburg County manager Dena Diorio told staff in an email Thursday that the county was disabling employees\u2019 ability to open attachments generated through Dropbox and Google Docs because of renewed attacks. \nShe said that because the county refused to pay ransom to unlock dozens of frozen servers, \u201cthe cyber criminals are redoubling their efforts to penetrate the County\u2019s systems, primarily through emails that contain fraudulent attachments with viruses that could further damage our systems.\u201d \nMany county-run services have been delayed. The sheriff has said it\u2019s taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, while code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nCyberattacks on local government are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated. Security experts say Mecklenburg County followed the right steps before and after the cyberattack, including declining to pay the ransom. \n\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s become all too common,\u201d said Lawrence Abrams, who runs the cyber security site bleepingcomputer.com. \u201cIt\u2019s smart not to pay the ransom if you can avoid it. In paying these ransoms, it\u2019s obviously encouraging others.\u201d \nCounties in Indiana and Alabama are among those that have paid to regain access to data frozen by cyberattacks since late last year. The Montgomery Advertiser reported that Montgomery County, Alabama, faced disruptions to some operations even after paying hackers in September. \nOther public organizations have chosen to rebuild instead of paying hackers. In November 2016, a ransomware attack on San Francisco\u2019s transit system resulted in officials shutting down ticketing machines, allowing free rides for much of a weekend. But transit officials didn\u2019t pay a ransom. The St. Louis library system said it took days to restore electronic services for patrons and weeks more to fix all of its computers after it refused to pay hackers behind a ransomware attack this year. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said Mecklenburg County appears to have done a good job of backing up its data if it\u2019s able to restore the system without paying the hackers. \n\u201cIt seems like the county was fairly well-prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, this is not as bad of a story as it could have been.\u201d \nMecklenburg County revealed Tuesday that it was facing a computer outage after an employee opened an email attachment containing malicious software. Hackers had sought digital currency worth more than $23,000 to unlock the data. \nA forensic examination shows 48 of the county\u2019s 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn\u2019t able to gain access to individuals\u2019 health, credit card or social security information. Without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system using the backup data. \nDrew reported from Raleigh, North Carolina. \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

Her mother has embraced the Puritan cause and yet her beloved brother, Sir Allen Apsley chooses to fight for king and country. As England falls into bloody civil war, Luce embraces Parliament's radical views and confronts the very core of the family's beliefs. And when their influential Villiers cousins raise the stakes, King Charles demands loyalty. Allen and Luce face a devastating challenge. Will war unite or divide them? In the dawn of rebellion, love is the final battleground. Based on surviving memoirs, court papers and letters of Elizabeth St.John\u2019s family, By Love Divided continues the story of Lucy St.John, The Lady of the Tower. This powerfully emotional novel tells of England\u2019s great divide, and the heart-wrenching choices one family faces. Characters: There are a lot of characters, but the main ones include Lucy Apsley who is a healer and is trying to move on with her life and get rid of the debts her late husband left her with. Lucy is courageous, resourceful and is trying her best to be a peacemaker. She also preffers simple pleasures in life to living and being part of the court. Allen is Lucy's oldest son who is charged by his late father to take care of the family. He is resourceful and will do what he can to fulfill his father's promise. He is dutiful, and loves the life at court. Luce is the eldest daughter who is serious minded, very bookish and cares more for common folk than royalty. Like her mother Luce is learning medical and herbal skills and also like her she prefers simple pleasures to a life at court. Other characters, albeit minor included Lucy's family members; her brother and his children as well as her older sister Barbara and her two children and some love interests as well as royalty and parliament, although to be fair the parliament didn't receive as much notice as the royalty. Theme: Blood should be stronger than water Plot: The story is in third person narrative from Lucy's, Allen's and Luce's points of view. While I do feel that its necessary to read the previous book, for those who haven't read The Lady of the Tower, this book can be a good stand-alone novel because the author does a good job at moving forward and making it seem as if the first book is optional. In other words, although the past influences the main characters, ultimately they make their own destinies. Author Information: AVAILABLE ON AMAZON About the Author Elizabeth St.John was brought up in England and lives in California. To inform her writing, she has tracked down family papers and residences from Nottingham Castle, Lydiard Park, and Castle Fonmon to the Tower of London. Although the family sold a few castles and country homes along the way (it\u2019s hard to keep a good castle going these days), Elizabeth\u2019s family still occupy them \u2013 in the form of portraits, memoirs, and gardens that carry their imprint. And the occasional ghost. But that\u2019s a different story\u2026By Love Divided, Elizabeth\u2019s sequel to The Lady of the Tower, follows the fortunes of the St.John family during the English Civil War, and is out now.For more information, please visit Elizabeth St. John\u2019s website . You can also find her on Facebook , Twitter , and Goodreads . Opinion: Ever since last year when I read The Lady of the Tower, the characters from that novel wouldn't leave me alone; for I often wondered how things will for Lucy and her children, especially since the ending of the story. (I also couldn't help comparing these stories to Mistresses of Versailles Trilogy by Sally Christie and how eerily similar the two periods are!) thus I was pretty excited about the sequel and already wondered if it was worthy of The Lady of the Tower. (It is, I am happy to report,) and if the author can keep up the pacing and momentum begun in The Lady of the Tower.

After 74 minutes of frustration against Leicester City, caretaker manager David Unsworth decided that Everton would have more chance of getting back into the game without their veteran attacker on the pitch. England's top goalscorer of all time appeared to say something before accepting his fate and trudging back to the dug-out. \nWas Unsworth making a public play for the job on a permanent basis, proving to the live television audience that he had the courage to make the big calls? Was Rooney's disappointment at least partly fuelled by a quiet voice inside telling him that Unsworth might have a point? It's all speculation. But what was clear, on that Sunday evening in late October, was that Rooney's much vaunted return to Merseyside was looking increasingly like a mistake for both parties. \nRooney was hooked against Watford the following week and his replacement, Dominic Calvert-Lewin brought Everton back into a game they would eventually win. For the Blues' next two league games, he was an unused substitute. And then Sam Allardyce arrived. \nWith Allardyce in the stands and Unsworth in the dugout for one last game against West Ham at the end of November, Rooney was restored to the team in a central midfield position, his weary legs covered by the effervescence of Tom Davies and Idrissa Gueye. He scored a hat trick, his treble completed with an outrageous effort hit first time from inside his own half. \nFor Allardyce's first official game in charge, Rooney remained in the centre of the pitch. It has been the story of his season so far, from that bright hopeful first day in August, that Rooney's best contributions have been in unexpected areas. He hit the headlines that day with a perfectly executed headed winning goal against Stoke, but he won the supporters over with his tigerish efforts in the middle against former Manchester United teammate Darren Fletcher. The pairing of veteran player Wayne Rooney and veteran boss Sam Allardyce could be a perfect match at Everton. \nAs Everton's season collapsed, Rooney was often responsible for the creation of their few chances, or at least moments that should been chances. He lacks mobility, he can't do the things he used to do, he can get easily frustrated, but he can open a defence with one deft pass, one sudden shift of balance, the split-second identification of a gap that could be exploited. \nYou can see Rooney's future in both of Everton's goals against Huddersfield last weekend. He makes the second with two touches, one to bring it under control when Gueye presses and wins the ball in Everton's half, one to thread a perfect ball into Calvert-Lewin. But in the first goal, Rooney is deep, withdrawn from the action. He starts the move with a neatly wedged pass, but there are five Everton players in front of him by the time it goes in. The notion that Rooney's future lies up front, or in the hole, or on the flanks seems to have been discredited. He's a ferocious quarter-back now. \nYou get the sense that Allardyce is delighted with the immediate improvement in his fortunes. Was he behind the decision to pull Rooney back in from the cold and play him in the centre against West Ham? If he was, it has paid dividends. Allardyce, for all that people diminish his achievements, has a good record with relighting the fire in veteran footballers, as well as those who have been considered difficult. At Bolton, he worked with Ivan Campo, Fernando Hierro, Youri Djorkaeff and Jay-Jay Okocha, as well as Nicolas Anelka, who was considered damaged goods when he turned up at Bolton in 2006. After two years of Allardyce's tender love and care, he'd earned himself a move to Chelsea. \nAllardyce has already spoken of his wish to bring a psychologist into Goodison Park, but for the moment he's doing the job himself, behind the scenes and in public. He certainly couldn't have been more positive about Rooney. \n\"He produced a good performance Saturday and a brilliant one on Wednesday,\" he said. \"So we have to really make sure we get him ready for every game from a physical point of view because he is catching up in years. If we get the physical side of Wayne right, that ability never ever leaves you.\" \nNeither Rooney nor Allardyce will make the trip to Cyprus for this week's meaningless Europa League tie, an unorthodox decision from the manager, but one that makes a certain amount of sense given the prospect of a trip to Anfield on Sunday. Allardyce, knowing that a win over Liverpool is worth more than a win against anyone, is playing his cards accordingly. \nIt remains to be seen if he can continue to coax these performances out of Rooney, and whether or not he himself has the ability and the drive to repair Everton after he \"retired\" in the summer to spend more time with his family.

A great deal of money has been spent on walls and fencing to keep migrants away from lorries.\nAn extra 1,200 police keep the estimated 400 to 500 migrants under close scrutiny and make boarding a lorry much more difficult. Yet this has just forced migrants into the hands of people smugglers paying to board lorries in Paris or Brussels or desperately trying to stowaway aboard a UK bound lorry.\nThe migrants receive no support from the local authority and are harassed by the police. Some move to Paris or elsewhere in France but nothing will force them back to their native land or crush their desire to come to the UK.\nA survey carried out earlier this year asked migrants why they did not want to seek asylum in France.\nSome 33 per cent felt unsafe in France; 21 per cent wanted to join family and friends elsewhere; and a further 23 per cent were put off by the treatment they had received in France.\nThey have no option but to live outdoors. They have no shelter from the weather. It is left to voluntary agencies such as Secours Catholique to supply food, clothing and sleeping bags.\nThe police remove tents, confiscate sleeping bags and have even tried to stop the aid agencies distributing food.\nAmong these migrants are unaccompanied minors. It had been hoped that the Dubs Amendment would enable 3,000 unaccompanied minors to come to the UK. Only a few hundred have been allowed in.\nLord Dubs had said \u201cThe way that unaccompanied refugee children are being treated in Europe is a disgrace. Governments must take action to ensure their safety\u201d.\nSadly, the treatment of minors in Calais remains a disgrace.\nThe Dublin III regulation allows those with close family in the UK to enter and have their asylum claim heard, although the process is very slow and cumbersome.\nWithout official assistance, it is left to voluntary agencies such as Safe Passage to help.\nIn Calais, I met a group of Ethiopians and Eritreans, orthodox Christians and deeply religious, welcoming and friendly.\nBrother Johannes from the Catholic Workers House was asked for a cross and he gave out rosary beads.\nAs we sat in front of a makeshift camp fire, on a bitterly cold morning, I was reminded that the people we label as \u201cmigrants\u201d, \u201crefugees\u201d or \u201casylum seekers\u201d are, first and foremost, our fellow human beings who should be treated with dignity, welcomed and given shelter as they wait for asylum.\nThe numbers in Calais are small compared to the worldwide refugee crisis and those who wish to come to the UK should be able to apply from Europe.\nThe British policy of doing all we can to reject these migrants demeans our country and undermines our humanity and the humanity of those in need.\nThe memory that I take with me from Calais is of the cold seeping into my bones as I stood on the street talking to migrants, followed by the relief that comes from going indoors and the warmth and heat.\nI left with feelings of sadness, guilt and shame. There was sadness that the migrants I left behind are without warm homes.\nIn addition, there was guilt, from knowing that an accident of birth left me privileged to live in the country they wish to enter.\nAnd there was shame, that my country was so unwilling to share that privilege with others.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "briti", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "johannes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubs", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "secours catholique", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic workers house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "calais", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:54.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb6674609a76578b89ac7f4ff3373b5887134e0a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRheeYS1OHGD4A31AvgAGZUe1p_FLTafVH5R.5EiKVxviMPvnSc5N_EnAfzucvMEAo-", "site_full": "www.sammyboyforum.com", "site": "sammyboyforum.com", "site_section": "https://www.sammyboyforum.com/forumdisplay.php?f=39", "site_categories": ["sexuality", "health", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "FL Dome L - Fine Dining with a Local Flavor - The Asian Commercial Sex Scene", "title": "lost & found help help", "title_full": "lost & found help help - The Asian Commercial Sex Scene", "published": "2015-12-26T06:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 36626, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "39ab2be24b038b1a1cfed0bccd380995820f2f4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRheeYS1OHGD4A31AvgAGZUe1p_FLTafVH5R.5EiKVxviMPvnSc5N_EVw2QsH8MLoGyySoBdRQoQg0AEri13plj", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "ILoveSI", "published": "2017-12-06T19:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "U r not alone bro.\nI'm looking for Tiffany from Butterfly babes.
