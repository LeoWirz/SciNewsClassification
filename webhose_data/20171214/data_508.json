People on Medicaid are prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But a new survey says that\u2019... \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.

That didn\u2019t prevent Ron Meyer from being fired by the Patriots during one of their zany periods and later by the Indianapolis Colts, but that\u2019s a coach\u2019s fate, and if there\u2019s one thing Ron Meyer always believed he was, it was a coach.\nSay what you want about Meyer, who passed away Tuesday at the age of 76, but don\u2019t leave this out: The man won everywhere he went. In the end, wasn\u2019t that what his job was?\nMeyer won at then Division 2 University of Nevada-Las Vegas, inheriting a team that was 1-10 the year before he arrived and going 8-3, 12-1 and 7-4 with the Running Rebels before running off to SMU.\nHe won at SMU, inheriting a losing program that was in a bowl game within five years and won 18 of his final 21 games and the Southwest Conference title for the first time in 15 years in his last season there, albeit with a little help from some deep-pocketed alumni. The Mustangs later got so out of hand under Meyer\u2019s successor, Bobby Collins, that the school got the death penalty but that didn\u2019t happen on Meyer\u2019s watch. He just got the dollars flowing.\nHe won with the Patriots, who were 2-14 the year before he arrived in 1982, and never had a losing record here (18-15 overall)while he had the whistle around his neck. Sure he once used a snow plow to beat Miami but who in these parts cared about hurting the Dolphins\u2019 feelings?\nHe won with the Colts, too, and they hadn\u2019t had a winning season in nine years before he arrived at the end of 1986. They were 0-13 when he walked through the door and won their final three games followed by three straight winning seasons and a division title before it fell apart and he was fired after losing the first five games in 1991. He never returned to either the NFL or big-time college football, although he did do short stints in the XFL and the CFL and served as a studio analyst on CNN and The Score, but he had plenty of hardware to show for his time as a head coach.\nRon Meyer turned losers into winners and he did it with a wry sense of humor and the kind of malapropos that can make a man a legend if he wins enough. He went 61-40-1 in college and 54-50 in the NFL, was named Div. 2 Coach of the Year in 1974, Southwest Conference Coach of the Year in 1981 and twice was AFC Coach of the Year, with the Patriots in 1982 and the Colts in \u201986.\nNot bad for a guy who lost a player rebellion in New England midway through the 1984 season when he fired popular defensive coordinator Rod Rust after a 44-24 loss to the Dolphins.\nTwenty-four hours to the minute later, then general manager Pat Sullivan fired Meyer, rehired Rust and imported Raymond Berry, who had been let go when Meyer arrived with seven assistants from his SMU staff, to coach. One of those seven assistants was longtime offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia, who remembered Meyer fondly yesterday even though Meyer fired him in Indianapolis after the 1990 season, allowing him to land back in New England for the next quarter of a century.\n\u201cHe had a great talent of knowing who should play where,\u201d Scarnecchia said. \u201cHe acquired good coaches. Ron was a really good coach and a good guy to work for. Even though he let me go we resolved our differences. I saw him at the Super Bowl a few years later (1996) and he said, \u2018See, it wasn\u2019t so bad. I fired you and you went to the Super Bowl.\u2019\n\u201cThat was Ron being Ron. He had a great ability to laugh at himself, which a lot of people don\u2019t have. He could be tough now but he was comfortable having fun with the moment. He knew how to win and he knew what players could help you win.\u2019\u2019\nOf the assistants he imported from SMU, five \u2014 Scarnecchia, Bill Muir, Steve Sidwell, Tommy Brasher and Steve Walters \u2014 had long and successful NFL careers. Yet despite winning and a keen eye for both player and coaching talent it didn\u2019t quite work with the Patriots for Meyer because he was viewed as an interloper by veterans like John Hannah and Stanley Morgan, who, along with others, believed he was a college coach who didn\u2019t understand the NFL.\nThe first season, for example, he ordered one bus for offensive players and another for the defense on the road. His players felt they could ride to road games with whomever they chose. It was a small thing but it and many other minor incidents began to fester.\nTo some he just seemed a little too slick. A tad too slippery. No one shared those feelings more than Don Shula, whose Dolphins were the Dec. 12, 1982, victim of the infamous \u201cSnowplow Game.\u201d\nMeyer directed a convicted burglar on work release named Mark Henderson to divert his plow from clearing off the yard lines in the midst of a blizzard and sweep out a dry place for John Smith to kick the winning field goal. He did and got a game ball for his efforts. What Shula got was high blood pressure after losing 3-0. He refused to ever say Meyer\u2019s name again.\nAfter it was over Meyer laughed, as he often did. He laughed when he said, \u201cI want my defense to be a rolling ball of butcher knives.\u201d He laughed when he walked into the press room and informed us all it was time to get synchronized by announcing, \u201cIt\u2019s time to simonize our watches.\u2019\u2019\nWhen he fired Rust, Meyer consulted no one. He had the authority to hire and fire, as Sullivan conceded, and he felt what he was doing was right. As Meyer put it, \u201cI discussed it with no one because one man with courage is a majority.\u2019\u2019\nSullivan, personnel director Dick Steinberg and GM Bucko Kilroy disagreed. The trio had already decided the situation had grown so dysfunctional that Meyer had to go and formed a short list of candidates to replace him when the season concluded. When Meyer fired Rust without speaking to any of them, Steinberg proclaimed, \u201cIt was absolutely the stupidest move I have ever seen made at this point in a season.\u2019\u2019\nThe next day, Meyer was gone but he couldn\u2019t leave without one last Meyer Moment. With a smirk on his face and a glint in his eye, he said, \u201cThe only difference in Ron Meyer now is yesterday (when still employed) I was a Ronald Reagan fan. Today, I\u2019m a Walter Mondale (the Democratic presidential nominee) fan.\u201d\nThat was Ron Meyer.\nHe left with a winning record and a laugh and the same could be said right to the end. When he died Tuesday of an aneurism, he was playing golf in Texas, laughing and winning still.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://embed.sendtonews.com/player3/embedcode.js?fk=KG5SCeOG&cid=4407&offsetx=0&offsety=0&floatwidth=400&floatposition=bottom-right"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ron meyer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "borges", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mustangs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don shula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanley morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond berry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steinberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dick steinberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill muir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rod rust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarnecchia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve grogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald reagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john hannah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve walters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bobby collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tommy brasher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bucko kilroy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dante scarnecchia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat sullivan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve sidwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron borges", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sullivan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walter mondale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark henderson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "southwest conference", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of nevada-las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indianapolis colts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xfl", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indianapolis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:52.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d19e1dc2c9b5ec476687a39fffeb8fdefba39fef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCnE1NY5uyHL1bpi_s8TC.X1Gz9E5bhyIjD01k6LVauF9QRexkuuIEjmqWBCHl_UbwCxP7dprO4cQbL3yGdAHgKXpg9rDQrtu6e0ewm2sKZ3L_GoXxL9XDjxE2sIocG28gSOlHvtcIZt_zdQCL3Gd22.2YfpIhEbM-", "site_full": "passionford.com", "site": "passionford.com", "site_section": "https://passionford.com/forum/main-area-3/", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Main area - PassionFord - Ford Focus, Escort &amp; RS Forum Discussion", "title": "Retro fitting Air Con to 3dr Cosworth", "title_full": "Retro fitting Air Con to 3dr Cosworth - PassionFord - Ford Focus, Escort & RS Forum Discussion", "published": "2017-12-06T03:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37d539a2d7021e9a1f678c1a3cc1dcf5020bf912", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCnE1NY5uyHL1bpi_s8TC.X1Gz9E5bhyIjD01k6LVauF9QRexkuuIEjmqWBCHl_UbwCxP7dprO4cQbL3yGdAHgKXpg9rDQrtu6e0ewm2sKZ3L_GoXxL9XDjxE2sIocG28gSOlHvtcIZt_zdQCL3Gd2JqZ4gydc062zH1VwxphvRw--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "cossynut2", "published": "2017-12-07T10:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : Hi all I'm new to this site and just bought my school boy poster car a 1987 3 door Cosworth that's had a nut and bolt restoration, its like brand new.

Attorney-General George Brandis has asked the Senate's powerful privileges committee to investigate whether Labor's Sam Dastyari broke the rules that govern MPs' conduct. Aa Senator Brandis wrote to the Senate President Scott Ryan on Thursday to request the referral, while suggesting the under-pressure Labor senator may have breached paragraph 6(3) of the privileges resolutions. The referral follows Fairfax Media revelations that Senator Dastyari gave counter-surveillance advice to Chinese Communist Party-linked political donor Huang Xiangmo that his phone was probably tapped by government agencies when the pair met last year. That meeting occurred more than a month after media reports in early September that ASIO's top spy, Duncan Lewis, had warned Labor \"that some of their donors had strong links to the Chinese Government\". In addition, Fairfax Media revealed last week an explosive tape recording that showed for the first time that Senator Dastyari delivered a scripted, deliberate and detailed defence of the Chinese government's aggressive land grab in the South China Sea. Paragraph 6(3) states that: \"a senator shall not ask for, receive or obtain, any property or benefit for the senator, or another person, on any understanding that the senator will be influenced in the discharge of the senator's duties\". It states that a senator should not enter into a contract, understanding or arrangement which could have the effect of \"controlling or limiting the senator's independence or freedom of action as a senator, or pursuant to which the senator is in any way to act as the representative of any outside body in the discharge of the senator's duties\". Referral to the eight-senator privileges committee is a serious matter as the committee investigates conduct which could obstruct the work of the Senate. The committee has the power to call witnesses and it can impose a prison sentence of up to six months, or a fine of up to $5000 for an individual if it believes an offence has been committed. A final decision on the referral of Senator Dastyari will probably be delayed until early in 2018, as Parliament was due to finish sitting for the year on Thursday evening. The Turnbull government has attacked Bill Shorten and Labor all week over Senator Dastyari's actions, pressing for the backbench senator to quit the Parliament.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brandis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dastyari", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "huang xiangmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill shorten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam dastyari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duncan lewis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "james massola aa fairfax media", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairfax media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south china sea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:52.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8e9aadcf4314b0b897e638ab9ccd84209e317b3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYifT1Cb4KH43w7OlwDq3GZfLbSqdV4V6h2uEHQk1FN5frta5rQ3XM17DmDN5nI0WWWgLTSztdIVw", "site_full": "www.adverts.ie", "site": "adverts.ie", "site_section": "http://www.adverts.ie/for-sale/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Adverts.ie - Recent Ads All 827,243 listings", "title": "Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus 64GB", "title_full": "Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus 64GB", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://a1.amlimg.com/Y2QxOWU3MDZkMjM4ZDlkNDFiNTYwODc5OGZhNTQ0ZTnZivvOnjbDt98K5zsJp9LyaHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmFkc2ltZy5jb20vMDI0N2Y4ZTkxNWZlNTUwNDMwMjA1NmVkZTMwYjY3ZDdjYzQ1OGM0M2Q3ZGI0N2Q1ODcxMTJlNzMyZWNlZTc5MS5qcGd8fHx8fHwzOTN4Mjk0fGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuYWR2ZXJ0cy5pZS9zdGF0aWMvaS93YXRlcm1hcmsucG5nfHx8.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e9aadcf4314b0b897e638ab9ccd84209e317b3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYifT1Cb4KH43w7OlwDq3GZfLbSqdV4V6h2uEHQk1FN5frta5rQ3XM17DmDN5nI0WWWgLTSztdIVw", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus 64GB", "text": "You must be logged in to contact advertiser.

Palestinians play cards during U.S. President Donald Trump's televised speech in the West Bank City of Nablus, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. Defying dire, worldwide warnings, President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke with decades ... \nJERUSALEM (AP) - The Latest on the fallout from President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital (all times local): \n11:35 a.m. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says President Donald Trump \"bound himself forever\" to the history of Jerusalem by recognizing the city as Israel's capital. \nNetanyahu claimed other states are considering following the U.S. lead and recognizing Jerusalem. He spoke on Thursday at the Foreign Ministry. \nNetanyahu says that \"we are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition.\" \nHe says the \"time has come\" and expressed confidence that others will follow suit and move their embassies to Jerusalem. \nMeanwhile, the Israeli military said it will be deploying additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when mass Palestinian protests are anticipated in response to Trump's move. \nThe army statement on Thursday says it will deploy several battalions to the territory while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" \nPalestinians went on strike across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip on Thursday and protests are expected on Friday after midday prayers. \n___ \n11:25 a.m. \nThe top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas is calling for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nIsmail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip on Thursday and called the U.S. decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries.\" \nHe says the uprising should begin Friday, the Muslim holy day. \nHaniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nHamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \n___ \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.

Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" - women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Juliet Linderman in Washington and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report.

Obama\u2019s overtime rule was not enforced after an August 2017 ruling out of a federal district court in Texas blocked it. \nU.S. Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Patty Murray (D-Wa.) and U.S. Reps. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Mark Takano (D-Calif.) introduced the bill Nov. 30 to address the overtime salary threshold, which the Trump administration has signaled it would lower. \nThe legislation aims to increase the salary threshold by creating a statutory basis, says Michelle Lee Flores, partner at law firm Cozen O\u2019Connor practicing labor and employment in Los Angeles. There is currently no minimum. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting way to solve the problem,\u201d she says. \u201cPurely on those party lines, my concern is that it will be viewed as supporting an Obama administration effort.\u201d \nSee also : DOL appeals decision on overtime rule \nFifty-one organizations, including the Center for American Progress and the Economic Policy Institute, endorsed the bill. The Society for Human Resource Management was not on the list, though. \n\u201cSHRM is participating in DOL\u2019s current rulemaking on the overtime exemptions and salary threshold for overtime,\u201d says Nancy Hammer, SHRM\u2019s senior government affairs policy counsel. \u201cAs SHRM has stated in the past, when updating the threshold, DOL should use the same methodology they used for the last update in 2004 .\u201d \nThe House of Representatives referred the bill to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, where it is unlikely to see movement, Flores says.

That often leads to the understaffing of correctional officers, hiring unqualified workers, offering limited health care, etc.\nHigh recidivism is also clearly profitable for these companies. After all, CoreCivic (then operating as CCA) once wrote letters to 48 state governors offering to buy their prison facilities as long as the states signed 20-year contracts with guarantees of 90% occupancy rates.\nHowever, CoreCivic\u2019s executives now claim that their company is moving in a new direction and that it wants to be \u201cpart of the solution\u201d for our nation\u2019s mass incarceration problem. The recent article by the AP mentioned that CoreCivic is now advocating to \u201cBan the Box,\u201d i.e. pressuring employers to remove questions about criminal history on applications. The company also claims that it will lobby for government initiatives that reduce the prison population, such as re-entry programs. Furthermore, CoreCivic promised to provide political donations to candidates who are focused on criminal justice reform.\nClearly, these are all commendable decisions and this sounds like a positive development. It would be nice to believe that a historically corrupt company has changed its ways, but talk is cheap. Therefore, let\u2019s examine the company\u2019s political contributions and see if there are signs of progressive change.\nLast election cycle, the company donated nine times more funds for Republicans than Democrats. Obviously, not every Republican on Capitol Hill views criminal justice reform as being \u201csoft on crime,\u201d but they are in the minority.\nTake for example, Sen. Rand Paul whom has never received a penny from CoreCivic. He introduced S. 827, the REDEEM Act , which would allow nonviolent offenders to petition to seal their records and the automatic sealing of records for nonviolent juveniles, among other forward-thinking measures.\nWith that said, CoreCivic\u2019s top recipient last election cycle in the Senate was John Portman (R-OH). He\u2019s one of the Senate\u2019s most moderate Republicans. He has sponsored multiple bills intent upon criminal justice and prison reform. That includes the Recidivism Reduction and Public Safety Act, the Second Chance Act, and the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.\nThe problem is that CoreCivic political donations send a mixed message, at best. The top recipient in the House provides a better indicator of the company\u2019s overall donations. Last election cycle, that person was Rep. John Culbertson (R-TX) who has been an adamant opponent to prison reform. Case in point, Culbertson once drafted a bill to eliminate funds from the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, which addresses many of the issues that lead to mass incarceration.\nFurthermore, Culbertson has also drafted multiple bills to give more penalties for illegal immigrants, which has been a pivotal issue for the private prison industry. In fact, he once criticized the director of ICE for not keeping the detention centers perpetually full with prisoners.\nThe GEO Group, the largest private prison corporation in America, also contributes heavily to Culbertson and other like-minded candidates. However, contrary to CoreCivic, their company seems to have abandoned its attempts at building public goodwill. Then again, the GEO Group has been down this road before and attempts to resurrect the company\u2019s image were disastrous.\nIn 2013 the GEO Group entered into a sponsorship deal with Florida Atlantic University to name the school\u2019s football stadium after its company. However, the students and faculty reacted vehemently to this decision with protests and the agreement was quickly nullified. Ever since then, it seems that the GEO Group has decided to no longer waste its time making public overtures.\nIn fact, the GEO Group apparently has doubled down on its unapologetic, good old-fashioned brand of crony capitalism. Both CoreCivic and the Geo Group pay for high-power lobbyists and make significant political donations. However, the GEO Group has gone the extra mile. That includes using its subsidiary to make a $100,000 donation to Trump\u2019s Super PAC (a potential violation of federal law).\nTheir company also hired three politically-connected lobbyists, two former aides of Jeff Sessions and a representative of the Trump Organization. Also, the company even chose to host its annual leadership conference at Trump\u2019s resort in Doral, FL.\nAs mentioned earlier, CoreCivic also throws its money around for political purposes. For instance, both CoreCivic and the GEO Group provided $250,000 for President Trump\u2019s inauguration. In fact, this cronyism has been a cornerstone of the company\u2019s success.\nCorrections Corporation of America (CCA) was founded in Nashville, TN in 1983 with a co-founder, Tom Beasley, who was also the head of the Tennessee Republican Party. Cozy political relationships helped create a mulita-billion company, along with insulating it from accountability.\nThere are many lawsuits and scandals associated with this company, one of the most notable being the \u201cGladiator School.\u201d Idaho\u2019s largest prison, the Idaho State Correctional Center, acquired that nickname while being operated by CCA due to its high violence rate, which was encouraged by the guards.\nIn fairness, there is a violence and corruption problem in both public and private prisons. However, this corporation clearly prioritized profits over rehabilitation because it understaffed that facility by thousands of hours. The employees also falsified documents to make it appear that CCA was upholding proper correctional standards.\nCorrections Corporation of America changed its name to CoreCivic last year in an attempt to reshape the company\u2019s image. That decision was on the heels of a major announcement two months earlier by the Department of Justice, i.e. federal contracts would no longer be issued to private prison companies. The decision was based upon a report by the Inspector General\u2019s Office that found that there was more violence in private prisons than government-run prisons.\nCoreCivic would like you to believe that its scandals are all part of the far-distant past. However, a report from last year by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice showed a disturbing trend of willful negligence.\nThat report detailed CoreCivic\u2019s performance in the Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, MS. There was an inmate riot in 2012 that led to a murder and several injuries while this prison was operated by CCA. Understaffing and a lack of Spanish-speaking staff were noted as the key contributing factors. However, the audit by Inspector General\u2019s Office from last year found that CCA had less staff in 19 of the 38 months following the riot. Also, only 4 out of 367 members of CCA\u2019s staff spoke fluent Spanish in this prison of predominantly Mexican nationals.\nAnother Inspector General\u2019s report from April of this year highlighted CoreCivic\u2019s understaffing issues in Leavenworth, KS. The prison was at times understaffed at levels so low that the company decided to cut various security posts and forced staff members who were not corrections officers to perform security duties. Also, CoreCivic had a policy of triple bunking inmates in cells designed for two people and the company concealed this information from American Correctional Association, which conducts audits of prison facilities.\nCoreCivic was also fined $43,750 two months ago for improperly counting the inmates in its Hartsville, TN facility. An audit later found that the same facility was severely understaffed and didn\u2019t provide adequate healthcare services.\nJim Casey, an award-winning drug and alcohol counselor, ran a rehab program in this same prison. He publicly and privately forewarned of these and other issues. According to Casey, CoreCivic had several inmates who were officially enrolled in his program but weren\u2019t actually participating. That helped to artificially inflate the company\u2019s compliance records. Some of the names on the roll had actually already been released from prison.\nAre you noticing a trend? CoreCivic\u2019s representatives are saying all of the right things in public, but the company\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t suggest that a real cultural change has taken place. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the progressive rhetoric from CoreCivic\u2019s representatives will eventually match the company\u2019s actions.\nBrian Saady is a freelance writer and author of four books.

Racism they would vigorously oppose if applied in the United States is welcomed in Israel.\nReports at the weekend suggested that Donald Trump is about to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, throwing a wrench in any peace plan. If true, the US president will have decisively prioritised support for Israel \u2013 and pro-Israel lobbies at home \u2013 over justified outrage from Palestinians and the Arab world.\nBut paradoxically, just as American Jews look close to winning the battle domestically on behalf of Israel, many feel more alienated from a Jewish state than ever before.\nThere has long been a minority of American Jews whose concerns focused on the occupation. But until now their support for Israel itself has been unwavering, despite its institutionalised racism towards the one-in-five of the Israeli population who are Palestinian.\nA Law of Return denies non-Jews the right to migrate to Israel. Admissions committees bar members of Israel\u2019s Palestinian minority from hundreds of communities. A refusal of family reunification has torn apart Palestinian families in cases where one partner lives in Israel and the other in the occupied territories.\nMost Jews have justified to themselves these and many other affronts on the grounds that, after the European holocaust, they deserved a strong state. Palestinians had to pay the price.\nGiven that half the world\u2019s Jews live outside Israel \u2013 the great majority in the US \u2013 their support for Israel is critical. They have donated enormous sums, helping to build cities and plant forests. And they have lobbied aggressively at home to ensure diplomatic, financial and military support for their cause. But it is becoming ever harder for them to ignore their hypocrisy.\nThe rift has grown into a chasm as Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing government widens its assault on civil rights. It now targets not just Palestinians but the remnants of liberal Jewish society in Israel \u2013 in open contempt for the values of most American Jews.\nThe peculiar catalyst is a battle over the most significant surviving symbol of Jewishness: the Western Wall, a supporting wall of a long-lost temple in Jerusalem.\nJews in the US mostly subscribe to the progressive tenets of a liberal secularism or Reform Judaism. In Israel, by contrast, the hard-line Orthodox rule supreme on religious matters.\nSince the 1967 occupation, Israel\u2019s Orthodox rabbis have controlled prayers at the Western Wall, marginalising women and other streams of Judaism. That has deeply offended Jewish opinion in the US.\nTrapped between American donors and Israel\u2019s powerful rabbis, Netanyahu initially agreed to create a mixed prayer space at the wall for non-Orthodox Jews. But as opposition mounted at home over the summer, he caved in. The shock waves are still reverberating.\nAvraham Infeld, a veteran Israeli liaison with the US Jewish community, told the Haaretz newspaper this week that the crisis in relations was \u201cunprecedented\u201d. American Jews have concluded \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t give a damn about them\u201d.\nNow a close ally of Netanyahu\u2019s has stoked the fires. In a TV interview last month, Tzipi Hotovely, the deputy foreign minister, all but accused American Jews of being freeloaders. She condemned their failure to fight in the US or Israeli militaries, saying they preferred \u201cconvenient lives\u201d.\nHer comments caused uproar. They echo those of leading Orthodox rabbis, who argue that Reform Jews are not real Jews \u2013 and are possibly even an enemy.\nAccording to a report in the Israeli far-right newspaper Makor Rishon, which is owned by Sheldon Adelson, a US casino billionaire and Netanyahu\u2019s patron, the Israeli prime minister set out his rationale for sacrificing the support of liberal Jews overseas at a recent closed-door meeting with officials.\nHe reportedly told them that non-Orthodox Jews would disappear in \u201cone or two generations\u201d through low birth rates, intermarriage and more general assimilation. Liberal Jews were a \u201clost cause\u201d in his view, and wedded to a worldview that was incompatible with Israel\u2019s future.\nBoth on demographic and ideological grounds, he added, Israel should invest in cultivating stronger ties to Orthodox Jews and Christian evangelicals.\nNetanyahu\u2019s demographic predictions may turn out to be faulty, but they are clearly now driving his policy towards liberal Jews at home and abroad.\nIn fact, as Israel\u2019s attacks on liberals in Israel echo Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policies towards minorities in the US, American Jews are gradually being forced to reassess their longstanding double standard towards Israel.\nFor some time the Netanyahu government has tarred Israeli anti-occupation organisations like B\u2019Tselem and the soldier whistle-blowing group Breaking the Silence as traitors. Last week it widened the assault.\nThe education minister, Naftali Bennett, accused the veteran legal group the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) \u2013 Israel\u2019s version of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) \u2013 of \u201csupporting terrorists\u201d. Forty years of ACRI programmes in schools are in jeopardy.\nThe move follows recent decisions to allow pupils to provide racist answers in civics exams and to expand gender-segregation to universities. Meanwhile, two new bills from Netanyahu\u2019s party would crack down on free speech for Israelis promoting a boycott, even of the settlements. One proposes seven years in jail, the other a fine of $150,000.\nNew guildelines have empowered the police to bar media access to incident scenes to prevent critical coverage, especially of police violence.\nDefence minister Avigdor Lieberman is seeking stronger powers against political activists, Jews and Palestinians alike, including draconian restraining orders and detention without charge or trial.\nAnd for the first time, overseas Jews are being grilled on arrival at Israel\u2019s airport about their political views. Some have signed a \u201cgood behaviour oath\u201d \u2013 a pledge to avoid anti-occupation activities. Already Jewish supporters of boycotts can be denied entry.\nThe Netanyahu government, it seems, prefers as allies Christian evangelicals and the US alt-right, which loves Israel as much as it appears to despise Jews.\nIsrael is plotting a future in which American Jews will have to make hard choices. Can they continue to identify with a state that openly turns its back on them?\nA version of this article first appeared in the National, Abu Dhabi.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

It\u2019s almost going to be an imperative.\u201d \nMercer partnered with AI startup Pymetrics to launch Mercer Match, a job-matching app that uses machine learning to pre-qualify candidates and pair them with open positions. The app uses gamification to determine cognitive and social-emotional traits of applicants and puts the results up against the behaviors of top performers. Meanwhile, recruiters have restricted access to the results and can only see an applicant\u2019s fit score against the model, or high-performing employee. They don\u2019t have access to names, gender or race, Marder says, so it\u2019s a \u201cfirst touchpoint\u201d for companies to keep the talent pool open and eliminate initial biases on the recruiter side. \n\u201cWe know based on demographics in our database that our trait model will recommend men and women and all ethnic groups,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are able to check that before the model is released. A lot of [algorithms] are more opaque. How can you prove that those systems are being made in an unbiased way?\u201d \nSee also : Employers slow to incorporate benefits technology \nLikewise, SAP\u2019s SuccessFactors\u2019 job analyzer, which is in the testing phase with a closed beta group of 10 companies, will help hiring managers and recruiters write and amend job descriptions to eliminate gender bias. The cloud-based tool analyzes readability, length, aggregated average salaries and linguistics for gender biases, says Gabriela Burlacu, human capital management researcher at SAP Success Factors. \nImplicit biases, such as using gendered words like \u201capply\u201d and \u201cassist\u201d \u2014 which often deter men \u2014 and phrases like \u201ccrush the competition\u201d \u2014 which often deter women \u2014 may not be erased in the person writing the job posts, but the technology will be able to flag them before applicants view the listing. \nGlobal computer security software company McAfee says it will integrate SAP\u2019s job analyzer function to complement its anti-bias recruiting strategy, which includes interview panels with a diverse interviewer and the option to enter equal employment opportunity information. \n\u201cOrganizations are seeing that if they want an increase in their effectiveness when it comes to talent acquisition, they have to invest,\u201d says Robin Erickson, vice president of talent acquisition, engagement and retention research at Deloitte Consulting. \u201cTalent acquisition systems will put [employers] on top.\u201d Employer coalitions are using analytics to drive convergence of employers, payers and providers Partner Insights", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barbara marder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabriela burlacu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robin erickson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "deloitte consulting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercer match", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcafee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sap success factors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercer", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mercer", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:58.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ca3f01aedabc4b3fbd170c5e30f0906ec37b3e0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTA8_uO46SEPG9oENxPifs_yjZy2NRUDUbuCOvwuG1jGvCFCzU6hH1n", "site_full": "www.earnforex.com", "site": "earnforex.com", "site_section": "https://www.earnforex.com/forum/", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex Forum -
