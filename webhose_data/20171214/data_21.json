I accept my own responsibility for going for an Android TV. I don't think I will do that again.\nThe embarrassment to me for Sony is the simply fact same years models (XE70) in the lower end of the same range have the support when the mid-range to higher end don't. I do blame Sony for this, I never expect anyone else to share my views. I do feel a bit mislead but, ce la vi.\nI also don't expect to see any TV updates once we click over to 2018 as Sony will be on to its next product line. Click to expand... I agree.

The room we finally got (after several back and forth trips to get the keys activated) had a strange odour in the bathroom, and there must have been construction happening very close by because the noise was unbearable. I went to the lobby to ask for a room change and the person I spoke didn't check into the computer and responded right away that they were \"fully booked and to try again tomorrow\". After 20 minutes of listening to the deafening drilling and banging, we called the lobby again from the room and the person I spoke to this time actually bothered to check and found us another room. They said they would send the bellman up right away for our bags. We waited 25 minutes and no one showed up so we lugged our luggage to the new room ourselves, only to find out again that our keys did not work and have to travel to the lobby a third time. We had a nice stay overall but at checkout the rate we were Quote: d by expedia was much less than our bill.

(and a sumo wrestling match if possible this time of year).\nAny advice will be much appreciated, our budget is about \u00a31800 each for the duration.\nThank you for your time.\nOne destination mentioned in this post 1 Osaka Osaka Prefecture, Kinki, Japan", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:38.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0304151d2e9082afcd18c3136e1d9373c1ec7875", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7aVAQaWNrqL2D5XJz_NRY3tCyFmWJNVeykG6dyr4j6mjcesNYw2y2C71HvHvsoPEMckueKDMAcK9sDS2So2mUPqTZYrWDBAVfjF7EJOmijPNO0m6Cu451Z", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "Jimi Hendrix Both Sides of the Sky - new album coming March 9, 2018 | Page 5", "title_full": "Jimi Hendrix Both Sides of the Sky - new album coming March 9, 2018 | Page 5 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-05T23:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.352, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/1/1356.jpg?1505953477", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ef82b981ed973a51f769ddd1b1a6fde1871fcf31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7aVAQaWNrqL2D5XJz_NRY3tCyFmWJNVeykG6dyr4j6mjcesNYw2y2C71HvHvsoPEMckueKDMAcK9sDS2So2mUPqTZYrWDBAVfjF7EJOmijPLdweEIiNjVju3VmzPiSfbo-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "bluesbro", "published": "2017-12-05T23:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I buy pretty much anything Hendrix.

His drastic reduction of the Utah monuments is a direct attack on the proud natural, historical and cultural heritage of the Southwest, and it ignores critical voices of tribal leaders and local stakeholders on these lands. If the President chooses to continue these attacks and comes after either Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks or Rio Grande del Norte, I will fight him every step of the way.\u201d\nAttorney General Balderas wrote a letter to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in May expressing deep concern over the Administration\u2019s \u201creview\u201d of national monuments. In September, reports showed Zinke recommended changes that would scale back protections for the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks and Rio Grande del Norte National Monuments.\nThe Antiquities Act was passed specifically to protect Native American artifacts and cultural history in New M\u00e9xico and the Southwest. The second national monument established is El Morro in New M\u00e9xico. Republican President Teddy Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act into law in 1906, giving presidents the authority to designate\u200a\u2014\u200abut not to terminate\u200a\u2014\u200anational monuments. Over the last 111 years, millions of Americans and tourists from around the world have witnessed the breathtaking beauty of our country\u2019s national monuments.\nThe power to revoke or modify existing national monument designations rests exclusively with the Congress. Any power a President has to revoke or modify a national monument therefore must be based on a delegation from Congress. Congress eliminated any ambiguity on this point when it passed the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, which says withdrawals of federal land should be reserved to any congressional delegation of this power must be specific.\nFor More New Mexico News: elsemanarionewmexico.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hector balderas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balderas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan zinke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zinke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "teddy roosevelt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ag balderas pledges to protect new m\u00e9xico national monuments new m\u00e9xico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio grande del norte national monuments", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "southwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el morro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new m\u00e9xico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio grande del norte", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:38.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0304151d2e9082afcd18c3136e1d9373c1ec7875", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7aVAQaWNrqL2D5XJz_NRY3tCyFmWJNVeykG6dyr4j6mjcesNYw2y2C71HvHvsoPEMckueKDMAcK9sDS2So2mUPqTZYrWDBAVfjF7EJOmijPNO0m6Cu451Z", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "Jimi Hendrix Both Sides of the Sky - new album coming March 9, 2018 | Page 5", "title_full": "Jimi Hendrix Both Sides of the Sky - new album coming March 9, 2018 | Page 5 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-05T23:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.352, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/1/1356.jpg?1505953477", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9852cf7d3343dbc64f4f6c602157ac9cd7958411", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7aVAQaWNrqL2D5XJz_NRY3tCyFmWJNVeykG6dyr4j6mjcesNYw2y2C71HvHvsoPEMckueKDMAcK9sDS2So2mUPqTZYrWDBAVfjF7EJOmijPLdweEIiNjVj0Vpk3tM2YYs-", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "sons of nothing", "published": "2017-12-06T00:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I'm sure I have a majority of this material.

But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point.

Hendrix, Cox & Miles shared a love for the blues as this driving, uptempo reworking of \"Mannish Boy\" by Muddy Waters makes clear.\nLover Man - Just two weeks before their triumphant New Year's concerts at the Fillmore East in NYC [yielding both 1970's Band Of Gypsys and 2016's sequel Machine Gun], Hendrix gathered with Cox and Miles to cut this dynamic rendition of what had become a favorite concert staple.\nStepping Stone - A totally unique take on this Hendrix favorite, with Jimi showcasing both blues and country styled licks atop a relentless, galloping beat.\n$20 Fine -Stephen Stills joined Jimi, Mitch Mitchell and Buddy Miles Express keyboardist Duane Hitchings at this September 1969 session. With Stephen handling lead vocals and organ, Jimi added multiple guitar parts to this rollicking Stills original.\nPower Of Soul - This 1970 studio session came three weeks after the Band Of Gypsys concerts at the Fillmore East. While a live version remains one of the highpoints of Band Of Gypsys, Jimi never released a studio version during his lifetime. For this album, we present the mix that Hendrix and Kramer prepared of the complete song at Electric Lady on August 22, 1970.\nJungle - The influence of Curtis Mayfield can be heard here as Jimi expands on the \"Villanova Junction Blues\" theme he made famous by its inclusion in the 1970 Woodstock documentary.\nThings I Used To Do - Jimi is joined for this rendition of Guitar Slim's blues classic by Johnny Winter. Jimi's trademark guitar work and Winter's deft slide playing weaves in and around the foundation set by bassist Billy Cox and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young drummer Dallas Taylor.\nGeorgia Blues - Jimi reunited with some old friends from his pre-Experience days. Lonnie Youngblood, with whom Hendrix played in R&B groups like Curtis Knight & The Squires, voiced this superb twelve bar blues neatly underpinned by Hendrix's sublime rhythm and lead guitar work.\nSweet Angel - With Axis: Bold As Love only just released, Jimi immediately turned his focus to recording what would become Electric Ladyland. This gorgeous, instrumental reading of \"Angel,\", features Jimi on guitar, bass and vibraphone joined by Mitch Mitchell.\nWoodstock - Stephen Stills came to this session fresh from having visited Joni Mitchell, who had a new song that Stills was excited to try and record. Long before CSNY's version, Stephen, Jimi and Buddy Miles recorded this amazing rendition.\nSend My Love To Linda - A superb new Hendrix original composition recorded with Cox and Miles in the aftermath of their successful Band Of Gypsys performances at the Fillmore East.\nCherokee Mist - Together with drummer Mitch Mitchell, Jimi created this moody, evocative original complete with his playing of a sitar to complement his traditional electric guitar.\nHear My Train A-Comin - (No info listed yet for this song on Amazon) Click to expand...
