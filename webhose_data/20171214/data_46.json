Our view from our Royal Towers room was breathtaking, the grounds were well kept & the beach was clean and crystal clear waters. Staff were extremely friendly & welcoming. If you stay at the Royal Towers you\u2019re literally right in the middle of everything! Major plus! They give you free water vouchers to use during your stay which helped!! The only thing that didn\u2019t please me was the food, being we came at off season, the lunch options were limited to overly priced fried foods or sandwiches & food in general here is very expensive. You can look at spending anywhere from $100-250 a day alone per couple. Some restaurants that I would recommended is Bahamian Club or Mosaic for dinner & Poseidon\u2019s for breakfast buffet, both were very tasty. Do not eat at Nobu, you pay for ambiance only. Service wasn\u2019t that great & they messed up our steak twice! They did however remove it off the bill & dessert was good. Aura nightclub was fun, and if you like to gamble the casino was very nice too! Relax by the pool and enjoy the water slides & lazy river!

I mean at this point I had texted her for a couple days, not some random person I bumped into at a Walgreens for the first time.\nThe phone thing drives me nuts. I actually believe it is because sometimes they are nervous, and use the phone as a blocking device for the situation.\nThe women who think they deserve to be bowed down to is pretty amusing. My friend is on POF and he screen shotted me a pic of this one chick's profile. She included \"riding in expensive cars, going shopping, laying out on yachts\" as her interests.

I was commuting to college, working full-time, etc so it was hard to meet someone.\nI learned that 99% of the women who are online are nuts in one way or another. Many of the profiles are scams (Tinder is full of that) or the women think extremely highly of themselves or have social issues. Self-confidence is important, but so is self-awareness. Many of them are also not single, and are either looking to cheat, or are in abusive relationships they don't know how to get out of.\nI went on a date with a 24 year old who actually wore her wedding ring to the date. She was very attractive, but I didn't want to get involved with that at the time, I have enough headaches in my life.\nAnother one failed to mention she had a kid until the second date. I don't need a kid right now, sorry, and lying about that makes me wonder what other shit you are hiding.\nI also met a few really nice women online, but those seemed far and few between, and many of them were like me and were on there because they had busy schedules, which didn't make things any easier.\nI found a lot them had social issues, and it was very apparent on the first date. I'm very outgoing, I like to have fun, play sports, etc, and many of these women seemed to have a hard time communicating or being exposed to social situations.

I was commuting to college, working full-time, etc so it was hard to meet someone.\nI learned that 99% of the women who are online are nuts in one way or another. Many of the profiles are scams (Tinder is full of that) or the women think extremely highly of themselves or have social issues. Self-confidence is important, but so is self-awareness. Many of them are also not single, and are either looking to cheat, or are in abusive relationships they don't know how to get out of.\nI went on a date with a 24 year old who actually wore her wedding ring to the date. She was very attractive, but I didn't want to get involved with that at the time, I have enough headaches in my life.\nAnother one failed to mention she had a kid until the second date. I don't need a kid right now, sorry, and lying about that makes me wonder what other shit you are hiding.\nI also met a few really nice women online, but those seemed far and few between, and many of them were like me and were on there because they had busy schedules, which didn't make things any easier.\nI found a lot them had social issues, and it was very apparent on the first date. I'm very outgoing, I like to have fun, play sports, etc, and many of these women seemed to have a hard time communicating or being exposed to social situations. It takes guts, but I found the best thing to do is go to a social event and approach someone. Talk to them, and within the first few minutes you can get a good idea of who you are dealing with and if the person is worth it or not. Pictures online can also be deceiving (good or bad) compared to in person. No doubt that most of these women think that men owe them the world and they are the hottest thing since sliced bread. Meanwhile, they have multiple kids, are 30s or older & have a 20 year's old job of cashier or something, don't have their own place, live like pigs, etc. I always get a kick out of the obese ones that think men should bow to them. Bitch please.\n& yes to the zero social skills part too. Here is another fun story...I get to the bar before the chick I'm supposed to meet. I'm playing on my phone outside & she walks up. What does she do? Not comes up to me & says hi like a normal person. She texts me from 3 feet away with \"I'm looking at you.\" WTF?!?!\nI should have left then, but I went in with her & she proceeded to literally play with her thumbs & not speak.

I mean at this point I had texted her for a couple days, not some random person I bumped into at a Walgreens for the first time. Nice work. I could have tried that if I did not look up & see her 1st lol. This kind of bs is why I make them come to my town where I can walk to the bars & then walk home after I wasted time on the date. I get to pre-game before the date. Less time wasted & no worries of a DUI FTW.\nQuote: : The phone thing drives me nuts. I actually believe it is because sometimes they are nervous, and use the phone as a blocking device for the situation. Technology & social media have ruined this world.\nQuote: : The women who think they deserve to be bowed down to is pretty amusing. My friend is on POF and he screen shotted me a pic of this one chick's profile. She included \"riding in expensive cars, going shopping, laying out on yachts\" as her interests.

Ice skating is fun too but you have to have a good sense of humor. I'm terrible at skating but that actually worked to my advantage. I had a bunch of little kids come up to me and tell me I fall a lot, which I joked around with them and she thought was cute. Yea, I used to pick fun things to do, but just ends up a waste of time most times. So just get a drink so I can get out quick with minimal funds and time lost when it really goes bad.

I was living an hour north of NYC at the time and there were some good one's and some no bueno:\nGirl from The Bronx - white chick, maybe a few years younger than I was. Cool chick, down to Earth and was fun outside of the sheets as in the sheets. Lasted for maybe a few months.\nGirl from Yonkers - another white chick, younger and we had sex in one of my e34's down by the Metro North Station in Yonkers lol. Met a few more times at her parents house in her cramped room and she didn't want a condom on so I was maybe 24-25 yrs old and said fuck it, lets do it. She didn't want me to bust up in her so I had to pull out and spray her stomach. Fun times leaving on the edge. Lasted a few months IIRC\nGirl who lived maybe 15 minutes north of me - another white chick, was 18 when I was about 24. Was mad as we never had sex as she only let me eat her out and that was it. She did play with my Johnson once but after a few times of eating her out, I ended it. Wanted more but I passed on as there was no ass involved.\nGirl near Rockaway Beach - Met her with no pic involved. BIG MISTAKE\nI posted this story before on here but I'll give the short version here: Had a close friend by the name of Tina who is full blow lesbian now but I was around when she began exploring maybe 2001/2002. She wanted me to go with her out in Long Island to meet this chick. We all went to a club and this chick had a friend with her. We all go back to a hotel room and I showered with her friend, sex on the bed, blah blah blah. Actually was a 3some when Tina was in the shower and I had two girls with me on the bed. Phun tymes.\nThis chick who lived 30 minutes north of me - another white girl (not really cute and a lil' chubby but I said fuck it). Banged her once as I was turned off by the fact she left her socks on and she was making strange moaning sounds.\nGirl lived 20 minutes north of me - Met at a Red Lobster and she wanted to come home with me. I wasn't really into her (5 out of 10, slim white girl) and wanted sex but I DECLINED. Just wasn't into her.\nSome more that I don't remember off hand....\nOh wait, boy I was bad\nI was 24 and this girl was still in HS but claimed to be 18 (maybe she was 17). Lived 30 minutes west of me, white chick, kinda thick but in the right places. Sex for about 2 months and I had to end it as she was getting too attached. She hated me for that. Called her up a month later and it lasted for another 2 months IIRC.\nAnother white girl in my town of Beacon, NY (for those keeping score at home) was a few years younger. She only came to my place to bang and hang out. No condom as well so had to pull out numerous times. She eventually moved to GA.

I'm located in Washington State.\nIf anyone has a project pair laying around they don't need, I'd love to chat with you.

Contrary to popular belief, there are clauses that state the insurance company can use aftermarket or equivalent parts. I went through this recently with State Farm and Liberty Mutual. We were not at fault and the car was never in a wreck before this incident. You have to work with a good body shop. They know how to \"work\" the system. The body shop I took our car to followed the rules and came up with justifications on why OEM was necessary. And because they have a relationship with the dealer we bought our car from, they were able to match aftermarket pricing with OEM parts. The insurance company was happy, they're happy because they still made a profit, and we're happy because we have OEM new parts.\n2) I've never heard of this issue with the rental car. My understanding is rental car coverage is only for situations where you the insured have to get a rental car because your car is in the shop for body work. In your situation, rental car coverage should be charged against the at fault person's liability coverage. The only time rental car coverage becomes an issue is if the fault isn't determined early and you have to use your own coverage to get your car fixed while the insurance companies battle it out.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:49.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "30ff46ac57bba9b694a6b105f32c91db76441a5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_uv3caaKxwF3F0y_ykU6DA8m2tTHnAOZCyfRyh_9R.WWFprMfghv_kjx1wHDI0nLc-", "site_full": "www.thlog.com", "site": "thlog.com", "site_section": "http://www.thlog.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "THLOG", "title": "Tinker Bell Christmas Blanket", "title_full": "Tinker Bell Christmas Blanket", "published": "2017-12-06T21:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "30ff46ac57bba9b694a6b105f32c91db76441a5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_uv3caaKxwF3F0y_ykU6DA8m2tTHnAOZCyfRyh_9R.WWFprMfghv_kjx1wHDI0nLc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "George", "published": "2017-12-06T21:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Tinker Bell Christmas Blanket", "text": "This site contains affiliate links.

Coupled together with the mental side, their attitude and their ability was devastating.\"\nMark Milligan's availability is another bonus as Victory searches for a first home win this campaign.\nBut Muscat warned their recent record of domination didn't \"guarantee a result\".\n\"In Wellington we created an abundance of chances and opportunities, which is what we are about and how we want to be seen by other teams,\" he said.\n\"This week has been a refocus to make sure we reproduce that type of performance. If we do we give ourselves a great chance.\"\nAfter three games on the road, Victory have just one trip outside Victoria - a visit to John Aloisi's struggling Brisbane - in the next month.\nIn contrast, United have away days against Victory, Newcastle, Perth and Western Sydney in the same run.\nThe Reds will be without Karim Matmour, who left the club on compassionate grounds this week, and injured Danish winger Johan Absalonsen.\nBut Vince Lia is poised to return from a knee injury, for the first time since a double in Adelaide's 2-2 draw with Victory in October.\nEx-City fullbacks Michael Marrone and Ben Garuccio are also available after serving suspensions.\nSTATS THAT MATTER\n* Victory have a super record against Adelaide, with just one loss in a decade at Etihad Stadium against the Reds.\n* But Kevin Muscat's side is drawing blanks at home.
