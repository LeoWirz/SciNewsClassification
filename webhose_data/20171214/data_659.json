Defying dire, worldwide warnings, President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke with decades ... \nJERUSALEM (AP) - The Latest on the fallout from President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital (all times local): \n11:35 a.m. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says President Donald Trump \"bound himself forever\" to the history of Jerusalem by recognizing the city as Israel's capital. \nNetanyahu claimed other states are considering following the U.S. lead and recognizing Jerusalem. He spoke on Thursday at the Foreign Ministry. \nNetanyahu says that \"we are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition.\" \nHe says the \"time has come\" and expressed confidence that others will follow suit and move their embassies to Jerusalem. \nMeanwhile, the Israeli military said it will be deploying additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when mass Palestinian protests are anticipated in response to Trump's move. \nThe army statement on Thursday says it will deploy several battalions to the territory while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" \nPalestinians went on strike across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip on Thursday and protests are expected on Friday after midday prayers. \n___ \n11:25 a.m. \nThe top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas is calling for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nIsmail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip on Thursday and called the U.S. decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries.\" \nHe says the uprising should begin Friday, the Muslim holy day. \nHaniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nHamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \n___ \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.

Image for representation only \nWhile the deadline for verifying bank accounts and income tax Permanent Account Number (PAN) by providing Aadhaar is December 31, for SIM cards it is February 6. \nRefuting social media messages, the UIDAI said as on date there is no stay from the Supreme Court on Aadhaar and its linking to various services. \n\"That Aadhaar Act being in force, all notifications for requiring Aadhaar for various welfare programmes, verifying bank account, PAN card and SIM card with Aadhaar stand valid and lawful,\" it said in a statement. \n\"Today's legal position is that there is no stay as on December 7, 2017, from the Supreme Court on Aadhaar and its linking to various services,\" it added. \nThe government has made it mandatory for verifying bank account and PAN to weed out black money and bring unaccounted wealth to book. The same for SIM has been mandated to establish identity of mobile phone users. \n\"The mandatory requirements of Aadhaar for PAN, bank accounts, welfare programs, and SIM cards have been challenged in the Supreme Court and no stay has been granted. Therefore, it is clear that the video is outdated because it does not reflect the latest legal position as of today (December 7, 2017),\" the statement said. \nUIDAI said the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 was passed by the Parliament on March 16, 2016, and notified in the Gazette of India on March 26, 2016. \n\"Therefore, subsequent notifications issued under section/s of Aadhaar Act for requiring Aadhaar as primary identifier by various ministries and departments of Government of India and States/UTs Governments for various services, benefits and subsidies hold the field today,\" it said. \nUIDAI asked people not to get misled by an outdated video doing rounds in the social media and Whatsapp and said: \"people should instead verify their banks accounts, investment accounts, SIM cards, etc as per the current laws and deadlines as early as possible to avoid any inconvenience.\" \n\"UIDAI has clarified on a video circulated purportedly out of context of a lady lawyer on WhatsApp, Twitter and Social Media and said that the video refers to an order passed by the Supreme Court on August 11, 2015 when the court had restricted use of Aadhaar to only few programs,\" the statement said. \nThe video, it said, does not reflect \"true legal position\" as it stands today because, after the said Supreme Court order of 2015, Aadhaar Act was passed by Parliament in 2016. \nSubsequent to the Act, notifications have been issued making Aadhaar mandatory for availing various welfare benefits such as public distribution services (PDS), cooking gas LPG, MNREGS, scholarships and pensions. \nThe Income Tax Act was amended in March 2017 to make Aadhaar mandatory for PAN cards. On June 1, 2017, PML Rules have been amended to make Aadhaar mandatory for linking all bank accounts, insurance, pension, mutual funds and DMAT accounts. \n\"Supreme Court too in Lokniti Foundation case through an order passed in February 2017 has approved verification of all SIM cards with Aadhaar,\" UIDAI said. \nThe Apex Court has upheld the linkage of Aadhaar with PAN in the case of Binoy Viswam vs Union of India which mandates Aadhaar for income tax returns and PAN. \nPTI", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aadhaar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uidai", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "unique identification authority of india", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "supreme court on aadhaar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lokniti foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apex court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uidai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter and social media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "binoy viswam vs union of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pds", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "aadhaar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:50.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1e7566e9c208b6ea7b7b2ad05c15aa14e479d71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRu_5f5nYIAte7xno_kFmQph9jeID2F4Pk46jlfDfk4_j6miHgXpmdVNl3My7G4Xws8xbi04.1shLXdsNI7OX7MM4amB89CQKp7iE361Yt._Q--", "site_full": "forums.ea.com", "site": "ea.com", "site_section": "https://forums.ea.com/en/the-simpsons-tapped-out/categories/game-discussion", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Game Discussion \u2014 EA Forums", "title": "Sitting this one out", "title_full": "Sitting this one out \u2014 EA Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T15:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1289, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1e7566e9c208b6ea7b7b2ad05c15aa14e479d71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRu_5f5nYIAte7xno_kFmQph9jeID2F4Pk46jlfDfk4_j6miHgXpmdVNl3My7G4Xws8xbi04.1shLXdsNI7OX7MM4amB89CQKp7iE361Yt._Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Johnny2bd", "published": "2017-12-07T15:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sitting this one out", "text": "I've always rated events by both content and interface.

Social Democratic Party, SPD, chairman Martin Schulz addresses the media during a news conference after a board meeting at the party's headquarter in Berlin, Germany, Monday, Dec. 4, 2017. \nBERLIN (AP) - Germany's center-left Social Democrats are discussing Thursday whether to open talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on extending their governing coalition, or at least backing a minority government. \nThe Social Democrats' leadership insisted the party would go into opposition after a disastrous election result in September. It reinforced its refusal to join a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. \nHowever, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear that he doesn't want a new election, and Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz reversed course. \nAt a previously scheduled party congress Thursday, Schulz is seeking members' approval for a resolution approving talks on \"whether and in what form\" the Social Democrats can support a new government. \nHowever, some members - including the party's youth wing - want to specifically rule out another coalition, leaving only a minority government or a new election as options. Merkel has said she is \"very skeptical\" about leading a minority government, which hasn't yet been tried in post-World War II Germany. \nSocial Democrat parliamentary group chief Andrea Nahles said the collapse of Merkel's talks with other parties produced an unexpected new situation. \n\"We can't play the ostrich and stick our heads in the sand,\" she said. \nThe Social Democrats have been part of Germany's government for 15 of the past 19 years - first leading a center-left government under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder from 1998 to 2005, then twice governing in a \"grand coalition\" under Merkel, from 2005 to 2009 and again from 2013 until now. \nThe party suffered historically poor election results after both Merkel coalitions, with support slumping to a post-war low of 20.5 percent in September.

Pha Lina Amid accusations of bias in favour of the ruling party \u2013 and following the removal of the main opposition party from the electoral field \u2013 the National Election Committee has announced the creation of a new press reaction team to \u201cattack back at negative points\u201d. \nThe ostensibly independent electoral body \u2013 which was reformed after the 2013 national elections to include four members appointed by the ruling party and four by the opposition, with one \u201cneutral\u201d member \u2013 appeared to tilt in favour of the ruling party last month following the Supreme Court\u2019s widely condemned decision to dissolve the Cambodia National Rescue Party.\n\nIn response to that ruling, three NEC members nominated by the CNRP resigned. They were replaced by picks from two minor parties and Dim Sovannarom, deputy director of the government\u2019s human rights council and, a former colleague said last week, a previous campaign manager for the ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party. \nAccording to the NEC statement, the press reaction team is under the command of CPP-nominated Chairman Sik Bun Hok. The head of the unit is Som Sorida, another ruling party-nominated member of the board. The body\u2019s official spokesman and \u201cneutral\u201d member, Hang Puthea, was not listed as being involved. \nAmong the group\u2019s tasks are \u201ccollecting information published on public media to analyse the negative points which defame the reputation of the NEC, making the public confused\u201d, and \u201creplying in writing in case there are negative points in news relating to the NEC\u201d.\nThe committee will also suggest to the chairman \u201cways to take action to block and prevent negative news\u201d. \nThe team\u2019s first public statement, before the creation of the body was announced, hit back at accusations of bias while parroting ruling party officials\u2019 frequent warnings of \u201ccolour revolution\u201d \u2013 a narrative used to target the opposition \u2013 even though the committee is by design supposed to avoid politicisation.\nYesterday election monitors expressed concern that the election body could simply become another government institution wielded to attack critics. \nSam Kuntheamy, director of election monitor Nicfec, saw the move as an overreaction to criticism, and an attempt at intimidation.\n\u201cI think they are putting pressure on the media,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthe media should have freedom to release information\u201d.\n\u201cIn the past they had a spokesman, so they don\u2019t need a new group,\u201d he said. NEC spokesman Puthea could not be reached yesterday. Rong Chhun, one of the CNRP-nominated members of the committee who resigned in protest, also questioned the purpose of the group.\n\u201cIn my view, it is not necessary for the NEC because it already has an information department .\u2009.\u2009. We don\u2019t know the real intention for making this group,\u201d he said.\nYoeurng Sotheara, legal expert at election watchdog Comfrel, said the NEC should \u201copen up to whatever criticism, suggestions and recommendations that are to improve the NEC to operate independently\u201d.\n\u201cIf they create this unit and just fight back against criticism and try to create reasons to fight back against civil society .\u2009.\u2009. that would be bad,\u201d Sotheara said.\nWhen asked if the NEC is still independent, he replied: \u201cThere is no more balance of power.\u201d\nThe dissolution of the CNRP has also raised questions about international support for the elections, funding for which goes through the NEC. The US pulled its funding immediately after the ruling to dissolve the CNRP, but no other countries have done so. \nEuropean Union Ambassador George Edgar said yesterday that cutting funds to the NEC was under consideration, but \u201ca formal decision has not yet been taken whether we will continue or suspend\u201d. \nAdditional reporting by Leonie Kijewski \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew nachemson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niem chheng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yoeurng sotheara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sik bun hok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leonie kijewski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rong chhun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pha lina amid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam kuntheamy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hang puthea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sotheara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicfec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george edgar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puthea", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambodian people\u2019s party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambodia national rescue party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnrp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "som sorida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national election committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chamkarmon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phnom penh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:51.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "407ec79812fd00a8d67c5d2121ba835175f70fe6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_UI0PlzfyPHQIkp3RzzQLrodFsirO6QO3cpHfXEjX4kQ2CDAmNW3.VOeVJFaFotSl16fVTTFeRLSk6CbBW756YjvAHqHhrTpxLLPWGgEiKz6ZO_047wix1Y-", "site_full": "forums.att.com", "site": "att.com", "site_section": "https://forums.att.com:443/t5/Apple/bd-p/apple", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Apple iPhone / iPad Support - AT&amp;T Community", "title": "I moved back to Italy and I need to unlock my iPho...", "title_full": "I moved back to Italy and I need to unlock my iPho... - AT&T Community", "published": "2017-12-07T07:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "https://forums.att.com/html/assets/att_globe_rgb_pos2.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 335, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "407ec79812fd00a8d67c5d2121ba835175f70fe6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_UI0PlzfyPHQIkp3RzzQLrodFsirO6QO3cpHfXEjX4kQ2CDAmNW3.VOeVJFaFotSl16fVTTFeRLSk6CbBW756YjvAHqHhrTpxLLPWGgEiKz6ZO_047wix1Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Smeli2", "published": "2017-12-07T07:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "I moved back to Italy and I need to unlock my iPho...", "text": "I've worked in the US for a Company 10 months and when I terminated my contract they gave me the corporate iPhone saying I could keep it.

The Mavericks will be back in action on Friday and Saturday with a WCHA series at Lake Superior State. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to play games and get a taste out of our mouth that we have had for some time,\u201d coach Mike Hastings said. \nThe Mavericks played games in each of the first eight weekends of the season, going 9-5-0, but they dropped their last two games, including the single nonconference game at UMD after Thanksgiving, a 3-1 loss. \nSo was the weekend off just what the doctor ordered? \n\u201cWe\u2019ll find out,\u201d Hastings said after practice Tuesday. \nSaid junior Max Coatta: \"We had some things we went back to work on. It's been a tough week of practice. There were a lot of things we needed to touch up on.\" \nHastings said one nice thing about the bye weekend was that it also gave players a chance to focus on academics. This week is final-exams week at the university. \n\u201cFor us right now, it\u2019s about getting back to playing,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cThe preparation has been good, the effort and the attitude have been outstanding.\u201d \nFollowing the series at Lake Superior State, Minnesota State will host Alabama Huntsville on Dec. 16-17 before taking another break for Christmas. A week after that, Dec. 29-30, they\u2019ll be back home against Northern Michigan. \n\"The focus is on us, our game and our play \u2014 all aspects,\" Hastings said. \nMr. November \nMavericks freshman center Jake Jaremko was named WCHA Rookie of the Month for November after scoring a team-high nine points in seven games during the month. The nine points led all conference freshmen in scoring over that time. \nThrough all 14 games, Jaremko has 13 points, including 10 assists. By comparison, teammate Marc Michaelis, who led MSU in scoring and was the league\u2019s Rookie of the Year last season, had 14 points through the team\u2019s first 14 games of 2016-17. \nJaremko is on a five-game point-scoring streak heading into this weekend. \nSwapping spots \nWith Minnesota State idle last weekend, Bowling Green moved into first place in the WCHA standings after taking 4 of 6 points from Bemidji State. \nThe Falcons defeated the Beavers 3-1 then tied 3-3 before losing the shootout to leapfrog the Mavericks. \nBowling Green (6-2-4, 24 points) has a three-point lead over MSU (7-3-0, 21 points) atop the standings, but the Mavericks have two games in hand. Minnesota State has four games in hand over Michigan Tech (5-5-4, 20 points), which sits one point back in third place. \nAll 10 WCHA teams will be in action against each other this weekend. \nOne-timers \nMinnesota State came in at No. 8 this week in both the U.S. College Hockey Online and USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine polls. The Mavericks remain the only WCHA team in the rankings, however, Bowling Green is receiving votes. \u2026 WCHA players of the week are: Ferris State\u2019s Craig Pefley (offensive) and Justin Kapelmaster (goaltender); Northern Michigan\u2019s Jordan Klimek (defensive); and Bowling Green goalie Eric Dop (rookie). Gustavus Adolphus, which is 6-1-1, moved up to No. 6 in the latest USCHO Division III women\u2019s rankings. \nFollow Shane Frederick on Twitter @puckato React to this story:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jake jaremko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig pefley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan klimek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shane frederick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gustavus adolphus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hastings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric dop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wcha rookie of the month", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaremko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max coatta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike hastings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin kapelmaster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marc michaelis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "november  mavericks", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mavericks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bowling green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beavers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wcha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bemidji state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake superior state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "falcons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan tech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa today/usa hockey magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. college hockey online", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ferris state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mankato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota duluth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama huntsville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uscho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern michigan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:52.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4214cd692bed8503b1ec9cdacd1e812d9db70c3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYm8wzU274mCtAzXqVSlC_OCBKIuy1AxS8gUxajAsHhocoyv_2_lO9QI-", "site_full": "www.adverts.ie", "site": "adverts.ie", "site_section": "http://www.adverts.ie/for-sale/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Adverts.ie - Recent Ads All 824,848 listings", "title": "Evening Wear", "title_full": "Evening Wear", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://a0.amlimg.com/NjM3MmQ3YjA5OWE4NmY0NWRmOGY2NDhhMDVlNWY5YTn7hp6f1BZHG8aNCZV1Au_HaHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmFkc2ltZy5jb20vZjU0NzI5MDhmYzJhMDIyZGM2NDc5YTMzZjkwZDQyMzNkNjRkMjY3ODYwMTlmZGMxZjYwNTY4Mjg3ZWViZGMzMC5qcGd8fHx8fHwzOTN4Mjk0fGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuYWR2ZXJ0cy5pZS9zdGF0aWMvaS93YXRlcm1hcmsucG5nfHx8.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4214cd692bed8503b1ec9cdacd1e812d9db70c3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYm8wzU274mCtAzXqVSlC_OCBKIuy1AxS8gUxajAsHhocoyv_2_lO9QI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "Evening Wear", "text": "You must be logged in to contact advertiser.

Up until I used his settings I thought I had my 780 (Im in Australia) looking good but bloody hell, those settings from BW have made my TV outstanding. Only difference I have is the backlight is up a bit more but thats just me. Foxtel HD is amazing and so to is free to air.

Glad you found them useful, I'm hopefully get a calibration for 4k UHD [ BT 2020/ HDR-10] done over the weekend, and if I have time, a separate calibration for 3D Bluray.\nI used the previous REC 709 adjustment settings as a base for a HD calibration test the other day to just have a quick look at what might be amiss, but using a UHD Test disc, and the colors are all way to over saturated, especially the RED [Rather ironic since if you see the Panasonics readings straight out of the box, there is NO RED ].\nSo I might as well do a new HD calibration from scratch [It shouldn't take me as long now since Im's slowly getting my calibration 'Chops' back. ]\nAlthough this over-saturation isn't as noticeable using the PS4 Pro on games.\nIf a gamer and using a PS4 Pro, and you have inputted my my original adjustments for REC 709 in the 'True Cinema' settings, then try this\nOnce the PS4 Pro has fired up with a 4K game [I use Horizon Zero Dawn], it usually goes straight away to the 'Normal' preset but at BT 2020.\nChange the view mode to my 'True Cinema' adjustments [which will change the colour balance to Warm], then change color balance back to Normal....the difference is truly dramatic....best gaming picture I've even seen.\nsmoothsac said: \u2191 just a quick question...\nwhat happens if you try and play a dolby vision movie from say apple tv,does it switch to another mode or not play at all?\nthanks Click to expand... If your TV doesn't support Dolby Vision, it will use a default 'Static Meta Data' as current 4K programs do.\nDolby Vision and HDR -10+ are versions of basically the same thing, and that is a way for a movie or program to be encoded with meta data that is tailored to each scene, and tells the TV how bright any scene should be at any one, and subsequently allows better graduation, and a more dynamic picture.\nCurrently HD material contains 'Static Meta Data', meaning the TV is told only once at the beginning of movie what the brightest scene in the program is going to be, then it's up to the way the TV uses it's inbuilt 'Tone Mapping' on how good the picture is.\nEach manufacturer uses their own variation of Tone Mapping, hence the different looks of the same movie played on different TV's.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:53.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ecd1e488171d8b3257291b05f2d01def7070e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kWTFmHec1c6myXrZSSWfZ4hFm4Jq1ot2szZP3sKiDw1s0GxwoOKSLQ.zmUYLAaqXULFDrIieRaeFhjonwjYDS", "site_full": "www.visajourney.com", "site": "visajourney.com", "site_section": "http://www.visajourney.com/forums/forum/161-us-citizenship-case-filing-and-progress-reports/", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "immigration"], "section_title": "US Citizenship Case Filing and Progress Reports - VisaJourney", "title": "interview (merged)", "title_full": "interview (merged) - US Citizenship Case Filing and Progress Reports - VisaJourney", "published": "2017-11-20T08:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://static.visajourney.com/images/uploads/monthly_2017_04/visajourney-logo-social-media.jpg.6e6b1b83deab742607adb9d8628f8e88.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27019, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08d17d7fe568a417d34898ba218de39df3cb984c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kWTFmHec1c6myXrZSSWfZ4hFm4Jq1ot2szZP3sKiDw1s0GxwoOKSLQ.zmUYLAaqXULFDrIieRaVXmGrDUAuce", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "amalivie", "published": "2017-12-02T03:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "My 67-year-old mum had her second civic test yesterday, 11/29/2017. she has been in the US for 6 1/2 years. out of those years, she visited her country and spent almost a year due to falling ill and was adviced by the doctor to complete treatment before traveling back which we all agreed too and that was 4 years ago. we go a general letter from a doctor saying yes she was seen on multiple times for extreme High blood pressure etc.\nA decision wasn't made nor any document requested at this time.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "catherine lucey", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:53.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ecd1e488171d8b3257291b05f2d01def7070e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kWTFmHec1c6myXrZSSWfZ4hFm4Jq1ot2szZP3sKiDw1s0GxwoOKSLQ.zmUYLAaqXULFDrIieRaeFhjonwjYDS", "site_full": "www.visajourney.com", "site": "visajourney.com", "site_section": "http://www.visajourney.com/forums/forum/161-us-citizenship-case-filing-and-progress-reports/", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "immigration"], "section_title": "US Citizenship Case Filing and Progress Reports -

Staff photo by Patrick Whittemore. comments The MBTA is searching for a senior executive to manage a private bus maintenance contract it has yet to even award, sending a strong signal that it intends to pursue an \u201cupcoming\u201d deal to run three bus garages despite heavy union opposition.\nThe position, posted in the past two weeks, comes as the chairman of the T\u2019s Fiscal & Management Control Board has called on officials to show board members how they\u2019d manage a deal to cover bus maintenance at the Arborway, Quincy and Lynn garages.\nThe T, however, has shed little light on what interest it has received to outsource the work, nor have officials denied a mechanic union\u2019s claims that just one company, First Transit, has actually submitted a bid. Also unclear is when officials intend to present a proposal for the board to vote on.\nBut the T is clear about what type of \u201csenior\u201d director of contract management it wants overseeing a potential deal. In the job posting \u2014 which doesn\u2019t set a salary range \u2014 officials refer to the proposal as an \u201cupcoming contract\u201d and note the executive could help in negotiations.\nThe post reads that the T wants a new hire who can \u201cdefine and articulate a vision for the successful implementation\u201d of the private contract.\nBoard Chairman Joseph Aiello had specifically asked officials at the Nov. 27 board meeting for a plan on how they would oversee a private bus maintenance company, noting the T has \u201cstruggled with oversight of outsourced contracts.\u201d\nMike Vartabedian \u2014 the business agent of IAM Local 264, which represents T bus mechanics \u2014 described the job posting as a thinly veiled move to \u201cjustify\u201d jumping into a private deal. The union plans today to launch a TV, radio and print ad campaign railing against First Transit and the potential contract.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to have someone watching over it and making sure it doesn\u2019t go wrong.\u2019 But they have someone doing that at Keolis right now, and there\u2019s still problems,\u201d Vartabedian said in reference to the T\u2019s private commuter rail operator. \u201cI do believe they\u2019re going to use this as a justification.\u201d\nT officials said that the job posting doesn\u2019t require them to fill the role, and framed it as \u201cbeing prepared and flexible\u201d for any decision the board makes on a contract.\nJoe Pesaturo, a T spokesman, emphasized its search is \u201cpending the ongoing procurement process\u201d and a board vote.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patri", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "matt stout", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "patrick whittemore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph aiello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quincy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vartabedian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike vartabedian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lynn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe pesaturo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whittemore joseph aiello", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "union", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mbta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "t\u2019s fiscal & management control board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "first transit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "arborway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keolis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:54.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46f323a24f953e6981f5f46389ff1c4c3746c1f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdqDBwwJYyF7KAvMSnpokE0WTxR8eRn95Ky.ytW5SD6est2MGFim0ZpCLsE3xoyQGShfXT02ESX1Q--", "site_full": "chaski.org", "site": "chaski.org", "site_section": "http://chaski.org/homemachinist/viewforum.php?f=15", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "The Junk Drawer - The Home Machinist!", "title": "Mystery Shingle Structure Under my Yard", "title_full": "Mystery Shingle Structure Under my Yard - The Home Machinist!", "published": "2017-12-03T00:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9e623e60fe7f5fd72f9bfbf9e0cffe6e763bd35f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdqDBwwJYyF7KAvMSnpokE0WTxR8eRn95Ky.ytW5SD6est2MGFim0ZpCLsE3xoyQGSp7HLpc5NvKNR1VWgjTLOy", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "stephenc", "published": "2017-12-04T00:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If you don't want to do the lawnmower and rubber hose trick .

Former Russian Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev waits for a hearing at a court in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017. Ulyukayev who is on trial for allegedly taking a $2 million bribe is expected to deliver... \nBy NATALIYA VASILYEVAAssociated Press \nMOSCOW (AP) - Wrapping up one of Russia's most high-profile trials of the year, a former economic development minister charged with bribery on Thursday accused an oil executive of setting him up and apologized for \"turning back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nAlexei Ulyukayev, the highest-ranking Russian official to be arrested since 1993, was detained last year at the headquarters of Russia's largest oil producer, the state-owned Rosneft, after a sting operation by Russia's main intelligence agency. Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared - what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" \nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you're doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nUlyukayev asked for \"people's\" forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \"defending people's interests.\" \nThe court is expected to deliver the verdict next week.

Updated: Thursday,   More >> \nJERUSALEM (AP) - The Latest on the fallout from President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital (all times local): \n11:45 a.m. \nIraq's government has decried the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, calling it \"unjust\" and urging the United States to revoke it. \nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in a statement on Thursday warned of \"dangerous consequences\" for the region's stability and the world. \nHe says the U.S. should \"retreat from that decision in order to stop a dangerous escalation that leads to extremism and creates an atmosphere which helps terrorism.\" \nMeanwhile, hundreds of Iraqis are gathering in Baghdad to protest President Donald Trump's move. \nThe protest leader, Abdul-Latif al-Himaim from Iraq's Sunni Religious Endowments, told the protesters: \"Jerusalem is our identity, Jerusalem is Arab.\" \nHe says: \"You can uproot a palm tree from a grove, but you will not be able to uproot Jerusalem from our hearts and from Palestine.\" \nIraq is a key U.S. ally in the region, with more than 5,000 American troops remaining in Iraq, according to Pentagon. With the backing of the U.S.-led coalition, Iraqi forces have retaken nearly all territory held by the Islamic State group since 2014. \n___ \n11:35 a.m. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says President Donald Trump \"bound himself forever\" to the history of Jerusalem by recognizing the city as Israel's capital. \nNetanyahu claimed other states are considering following the U.S. lead and recognizing Jerusalem. He spoke on Thursday at the Foreign Ministry. \nNetanyahu says that \"we are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition.\" \nHe says the \"time has come\" and expressed confidence that others will follow suit and move their embassies to Jerusalem. \nMeanwhile, the Israeli military said it will be deploying additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when mass Palestinian protests are anticipated in response to Trump's move. \nThe army statement on Thursday says it will deploy several battalions to the territory while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" \nPalestinians went on strike across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip on Thursday and protests are expected on Friday after midday prayers. \n___ \n11:25 a.m. \nThe top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas is calling for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nIsmail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip on Thursday and called the U.S. decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries.\" \nHe says the uprising should begin Friday, the Muslim holy day. \nHaniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nHamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \n___ \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.

The Senate seemed ready to follow. Without legislation, many agencies would run out of money after midnight Friday and grind to a close. \nThe two-week spending measure is aimed at giving both parties' bargainers more time to reach longer-term budget decisions. To jumpstart that negotiating, Trump and congressional leaders were meeting Thursday to try reaching agreements. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., prompted the two Democrats to skip a bargaining session that was planned then. \nThis time, the White House smoothed the waters by following up with a more peaceable, written statement. It praised Pelosi and Schumer for choosing to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\" \nLater, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension. It also laid out administration budget goals, saying money for the military including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\" \nFor Republicans, a shutdown would put a humiliating bookend on a year in which they've controlled the White House and Congress with little to show for it. They want the public to focus instead on the GOP's prized $1.5 trillion tax bill, which party leaders hope to send Trump by Christmas. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nEven the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have been threatening to oppose the temporary spending measure, predicted passage. \n\"No one wants a shutdown, including Freedom Caucus members,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters. \nThe roughly 30-member caucus has been trying to win promises from leaders of spending curbs and quick passage of a full-year defense budget in exchange for backing the short-term bill. Without support from many of them, Republicans would need votes from Democrats to push the temporary spending measure through the House. \nWhile many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the short-term bill, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there. They know they'd still have leverage on subsequent bills needed to keep the government running. \nRepublicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes for passage. \nDemocrats have been using their leverage to insist on spending boosts for health care, infrastructure and other domestic programs that would match increases Republicans want for defense. \nDemocrats are also seeking an agreement to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. Trump ended safeguards against deportation three months ago but has expressed an openness to restoring them. \n___ \nAP reporters Andrew Taylor and Ken Thomas contributed.
