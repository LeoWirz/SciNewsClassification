About 8 million people are on the brink of famine with outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria. \u201cI have directed officials in my administration to call the leadership of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to request that they completely allow food, fuel, water and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it,\u201d Trump said in a statement, without elaborating. \u201cThis must be done for humanitarian reasons immediately,\u201d Trump said. \nThe Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said the first food and fuel had arrived in Hodeidah and Saleef ports, but supplies were at a trickle compared to what was needed, since Yemen\u2019s population of 27 million was almost entirely reliant on imports for food, fuel and medicine. \nOxfam International applauded Trump\u2019s statement, calling it \u201clong overdue but hugely important.\u201d Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who has called for restrictions on US arms sales to Saudi Arabia, said he expected the Kingdom to heed Trump\u2019s call. \nTrump\u2019s brief, one-paragraph statement is one of the clearest signs of US concern over aspects of Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign policy. Saudi Arabia has also split with Trump over his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nWarmer ties \nPublicly, Trump, his top aides and senior Saudi officials have hailed what they say is a major improvement in U.S.-Saudi ties compared with relations under former President Barack Obama , who upset the Saudis by sealing a nuclear deal with their arch-foe Iran. \nEven as ties improve, however, US diplomats and intelligence analysts privately express anxiety over some of the more hawkish actions by Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, especially toward Yemen and Lebanon, as Saudi Arabia seeks to contain Iranian influence. \nIn turn, Saudi Arabia has been unusually public about its concerns over U.S. policy on Jerusalem. \nKing Salman told Trump ahead of his Jerusalem announcement on Wednesday that any decision on the status of Jerusalem before a permanent peace settlement was reached would \u201charm peace talks and increase tensions in the area,\u201d according to Saudi state-owned media. \nA White House official said Trump\u2019s statement on aid to Yemen did not represent retaliation for the Saudi position on Jerusalem. \u201cIt has to do with the fact that there is a serious humanitarian issue in Yemen and the Saudis should and can do more,\u201d the official said. \nThe fuel shortages caused by the blockade have meant that areas hardest hit by war, malnutrition and cholera lack functioning hospital generators, cooking fuel and water pumps. It also makes it harder to move food and medical aid around the country. \nThe Saudi-led military coalition stepped up air strikes on Yemen\u2019s Houthis on Wednesday as the armed movement tightened its grip on Sanaa a day after the son of slain former president Ali Abdullah Saleh vowed revenge for his father\u2019s death. \nSaleh, who was killed in an attack on his convoy, plunged Yemen deeper into turmoil last week by switching allegiance after years helping the Houthis win control of much of northern Yemen, including the capital. \nUS Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday that the killing of Saleh would likely worsen an already dire humanitarian situation in the country in the short term. \u201cThis is where we\u2019ve all got to roll up our sleeves and figure out what you\u2019re going to do about medicine and food and clean water, cholera,\u201d Mattis said.

From Bholi Punjaban's mean act to Choocha's funny antics and the entire fiasco around 'jugaad,' the 2013 Fukrey had given movie-goers a number of things to remember the film by. Now, returning after four years, will the Fukrapanti continue? Here are five reasons why you should give Fukrey Returns a watch this weekend. 2 / 6 Sequel to a hit film If anything, the Fukrey gang had got one thing right in 2013 which was leaving their audience in splits. Now, coming back after four years with the same director Mrigdeep Singh Lamba and with pretty much the same cast, Fukrey Returns picks up right where Fukrey left. So, one reason to watch Fukrey Returns is definitely its legacy of a previous hit franchise film. 3 / 6 Comedy The latter part of 2017 has been all about comedies. More than serious dramas, the audience have showered their love on masala entertainers like Judwaa 2 and Golmaal Again which went on to break several records at the ticketing counters. Also, worth considering is the fact that both of them are sequels/remakes. Looks like the time is favourable for Fukrey. Let's see what happens. 4 / 6 Ensemble cast Another selling point of Fukrey is its surprisingly wonderful cast. With Richa Chada, Pulkit Samrat, Varun Sharma, Ali Fazal, Manjot Singh, Priya Anand, Vishakha Singh and Pankaj Tripathi all reprising their funny roles, Fukrey Returns looks like a promising watch. Though most of these actors have been involved in more serious roles as well, the audiences would love to see them back in their quirky avatars. 5 / 6 Bholi Punjaban and Choocha The characters of Richa Chadha and Varun Sharma aka Bholi Punjaban and Choocha deserve special mention in Fukrey as well. Not just because of the actors' fantastic portrayal but because of Mrigdeep's interesting screenplay. Their powerful one-liners and funny antics are already making the internet go gaga over the film's release. 6 / 6 Deja Choo Fukrey Returns also boasts some chucklesome dialogues that have already become the catch-phrase of India's youth. Remember how Fukrey played around jugaad? The word even ended up becoming a part of the Oxford dictionary. Now they have Deja Choo. Will it become a part of the lingo?

The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals hearing in Seattle came two days after the US Supreme Court allowed Trump\u2019s travel ban to take effect while litigation over its ultimate validity unfolds. \nThe ban targets people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen seeking to enter the United States. The Republican president has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism. The state of Hawaii, however, challenged it in court, and a Honolulu federal judge said it exceeded Trump\u2019s powers under immigration law. Trump\u2019s ban also covers people from North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela, but the lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect. \nThe same three judge 9th Circuit panel which limited a previous version of Trump\u2019s ban heard arguments on Wednesday. Some of the judges appeared more cautious toward the idea of blocking the president\u2019s policy. Judge Michael Daly Hawkins asked Hawaii\u2019s lawyers whether Trump\u2019s latest proclamation is more sound than prior versions. The current one, he said, is based on specific findings that some foreign governments do not share enough information to properly vet immigrants. \n\u201cYou would trust Kim Jong Un to say this person is this person, you gotta let him in?\u201d Hawkins said. Judge Ronald Gould said the court would issue a ruling \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d \nTrump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, which caused chaos at airports and mass protests. He issued a revised one in March after the first was blocked by federal courts. That expired in September after a long court fight, and was replaced with the current version. The ban has some exceptions. Certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and any applicant can ask for an individual waiver. \nThe 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals is set to hear a separate challenge to the ban on Friday, and the US Supreme Court is expected to ultimately decide the issue in the coming months.

Pogba managed to avoid surgery but was still sidelined for 10 weeks, severely denting the momentum the Red Devils were hoping to build, with the club's medical staff undecided what was then the best course of action to take. Carrington insiders now claim the \u00a389million man had to convince his manager he would return even quicker by recovering over in the United States, even though Mourinho wanted to keep a much closer eye back in Manchester on the 24-year-old. United do believe they have finally got to the root of the hamstring problem which has plagued the France international on and off for the last couple of years. The former Juventus star even had his walking gait and running style analysed, with a series of new exercises implemented to combat the massive loads he puts through his quads when suddenly changing direction in games.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mourinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose mourinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pogba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul pogba", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la trip united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clubcall united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juventus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arsenal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red devils", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:02.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e57e751e24ffba3816642561712fc8607ba28328", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjKETTmcQmnvKaGDS6kPaQJerE1HYzx4f5Lsq5tHHOCUY8KC6zqTHY2W8UgNRH1pttt_aZ1xLGU9h7qd3uizfN4_nhOGrYg1slv9n3uAZa0Oh", "site_full": "www.startribune.com", "site": "startribune.com", "site_section": "http://www.startribune.com/opinion/index.rss2", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Opinion", "title": "Star Tribune Editorial Board: Franken should resign", "title_full": "Star Tribune Editorial Board: Franken should resign - StarTribune.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 52, "participants_count": 41, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1512580696_27franken120617.jpg?h=630&amp;w=1200&amp;fit=crop&amp;bg=999&amp;crop=faces", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4035, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "86ccec20c2eccd98fee8c00b402ab36f1000ad61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjKETTmcQmnvKaGDS6kPaQJerE1HYzx4f5Lsq5tHHOCUY8KC6zqTHY2W8UgNRH1pttt_aZ1xLGU9h7qd3uizfN4_nhOGrYg1slmwXtj2GeL7f7xnvkO5bcDg-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "raygar", "published": "2017-12-07T00:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Mark this event.

Past U.S. presidents have insisted that the status of Jerusalem \u2013 home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions \u2013 must be decided in negotiations between the two sides. Palestinian factions called a general strike on Thursday throughout the occupied West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Palestinian areas of Jerusalem and for rallies to be held at midday in protest at Trump\u2019s move, raising the chances of violent clashes. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video message that Trump\u2019s decision had made for a \u201chistoric day\u201d and was \u201can important step towards peace\u201d. He added that any peace deal with the Palestinians would have to include Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and he urged other countries to follow the US lead by also moving their embassies to the city. He said there would be no change to access to Jerusalem\u2019s holy sites. \u201cIsrael will always ensure freedom of worship for Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike.\u201d \nBut Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Trump\u2019s move was \u201ctantamount to the United States abdicating its role as a peace mediator\u201d and declared Jerusalem as the \u201ceternal capital of the State of Palestine\u201d. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. It later annexed it, declaring the whole of the city as its capital, a move not recognized internationally. \nPalestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state which they want to establish in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. \u201cWith this announcement, the American administration has chosen to violate all international and bilateral agreements and resolutions and it has chosen to violate international consensus,\u201d Abbas said. The move, he said, would serve \u201cthe extremist groups which try to turn the conflict in our region into a religious war that will drag the region \u2026 into international conflicts and endless wars.\u201d \nIsraeli-Palestinian peace talks have been frozen since 2014. Trump\u2019s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is leading Trump\u2019s efforts to restart them but those efforts have shown little progress. Israel\u2019s West Bank settlement building has been one of the main obstacles. Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip, said Trump\u2019s move was \u201cflagrant aggression against the Palestinian people\u201d and urged Arabs and Muslims to \u201cundermine the U.S.\u2019s interests in the region\u201d and to \u201cshun Israel.\u201d For all the latest World News , download Indian Express App More Related News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:02.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "392921c1c406508e1e57d9f2566817f43efc1adc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSttB_hD1IIFV0WQfwfOfgB_kH5GpBQuW7RZgyXLLOLkqjqMVmmwYtQdRvTcNKeAqCTidazpwkzOv9GO4BojR0kFN6UIpF51XelDhBCW8Hp8R.zQJowkgtmA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/IOTA", "title": "Maybe Steam will think about IOTA because of dem bitcoin fees", "title_full": "Maybe Steam will think about IOTA because of dem bitcoin fees : Iota", "published": "2017-12-07T08:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45582375aa7bcc57faa0b717eb46371370dded90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSttB_hD1IIFV0WQfwfOfgB_kH5GpBQuW7RZgyXLLOLkqjqMVmmwYtQdRvTcNKeAqCTidazpwkzOv9GO4BojR0kFN6UIpF51XelDhBCW8Hp8TaAxDUNumnOkjEIMo_X70dsqaV1wYFQfA-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "oceansk", "published": "2017-12-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You are kidding right.

For years, the Tadvis, listed as a Scheduled Tribe, were farmers. Like the Vasavas, Tadvis call themselves indigenous people. Updated: December 7, 2017 8:12 am Tadvi at his shop near the Patel statue site. (Express Photo by Sandeep Dwivedi) \nThe product placement on the cash counter of Kanu Tadvi\u2019s roadside convenience kiosk shows his business acumen. Arranged neatly, under the usual retail-outlet door hangings of flavoured chips, are used one-litre \u2018Bisleris\u2019 refilled with petrol. \nBottled fuel is one of Tadvi\u2019s best-selling items. Most of his customers, almost everyone from Gora village\u2019s 80 houses, invariably give in to the impulse to buy this extremely essential commodity. As Tadvi pours petrol into the empty tank of a self-start gearless two-wheeler owned by a regular, he checks how far the latter needs to go. \u201cJust about 2 km down the road,\u201d says the helmet-less driver. That\u2019s where most of Gora heads these days. \nTadvi likes to talk to his clients. His second question is slightly cryptic, at least to outsiders. \u201cHow far has it reached?\u201d he asks. The man points to his knees and looks around, before he spots a mini-truck parked by the road. \u201cThe toe nails are as big as that truck,\u201d he says. \nEyes widen, jaw drops. Thankfully, Tadvi recovers fast to share his surprise. \u201cSardar nu putdo (Sardar\u2019s statue)\u2026 Statue of Unity,\u201d he drops the 600-feet hint. A less-shocked and more informed bystander, a young Goraite, fishes out a smartphone. He volunteers to show a WhatsApp forward, of a picture of a massive bronze head of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel tied to a fork-lift. Not many believe it\u2019s real; they say it\u2019s too small a bust for \u201cthe world\u2019s tallest sculpture\u201d \u2014 a showpiece project of the BJP governments in the state and the Centre. \nGora is good with measurements. They know their milimetres, metres and kilometres pretty well here in this hamlet of the Narmada district of south Gujarat. They need to. They also have a fear of heights, and distances as well. It\u2019s in their DNA. For generations, their life has revolved around the height of the Sardar Sarovar Dam on \u201cMa Rewa (as they call the Narmada)\u201d and the acres they have lost because of that. Of late, the narrative has changed. These days the dream is 600-ft tall. \nAs more villagers flock around the rundown shed, that sells everything from vegetables and cooking oil to spices \u2014 and if you wish, all put together in a meal and served at a smaller dilapidated hut next door \u2014 Gora\u2019s several kilometres\u2019 long complaint list rolls out. \nThe nearest petrol pump from the dam/statue site/Gora is about 12 km at Garudeshwar; closest school after Class VII a further kilometre away still. A well-equipped government hospital is at Rajpipla, all of 25 km away, and the same is true for a cinema hall. \u201cMiscalculating distances or the mileage of your vehicle can mean the difference between life and death,\u201d says Raipal, who spent his youth in Gora but is now stationed at Rajpipla, where he is an educator. Politicians don\u2019t quite inspire confidence among the locals. BR5-UNITY6: The Statue of Unity, taking shape, has reached a height of 117 meters from the mean sea level, which is 59 meters of the actual height of the 182 meter statue. Express Photo by Bhupendra Rana \nBJP\u2019s Shabdsharnbhai Tadvi is the sitting MLA, with Gora falling in Nandod constituency. The villagers say they haven\u2019t seen him in a while. Meanwhile, as our Tadvi replaces the bottled fuel on the cash counter, you know that Gora\u2019s Biyani knows his retail. \nThe 41-year-old wasn\u2019t always into selling kirana items. For years, the Tadvis, listed as a Scheduled Tribe, were farmers. Like the Vasavas, Tadvis call themselves indigenous people, the original inhabitants of the plains next to the Narmada. They grew jowar, gram, cotton and vegetables. Land was fertile, life wasn\u2019t complicated. \u201cIn 1961-62, the Sardar Sarovar project started and the government asked my grandfather to give his land. We had 16 acres, and we got Rs 36,000 for it,\u201d says Tadvi. \nThis patch of family holding, like 20 other separate land masses belonging to different Gora families, wasn\u2019t to be submerged by gated water. It was for storing the sea of building material wheeled in for dam construction. \u201cWe were told once the project got over, we would get our land back,\u201d says Tadvi, who was given a job at the site as an added incentive. \u201cWith no land, I worked at the site after completing Class 10. My education was wasted though since I was a labourer there doing manual job.\u201d \nAfter 25 years of work, his last salary was Rs 3,000. Cut to 2017. The dam project is over, the steel rods and cement bags are no longer stacked on land, and the godowns that once held them are empty. The 20 families now want their land \u2014 a total of 105.66 hectares, as mentioned in last month\u2019s Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited\u2019s land-for-land demand to Kevadia Colony collector \u2014 back. \n\u201cThe work was over long back. Now they are saying take Rs 5 lakh and let us keep the land. We want land, not money,\u201d says Tadvi. He fears that his land will now be used to beautify the surrounding of the Giant Sardar so that it can be promoted as an international tourist destination. \nWouldn\u2019t he benefit if Gora gets a piece of the tourist trade, with his strategically placed \u201c24X7\u201d, \u201cask for anything\u201d shop? Wouldn\u2019t he make a killing with his first-mover advantage? Tadvi isn\u2019t even listening. He is someone whose ears have become deaf to promises; he has been sold dreams before. \u201cYou see that handpump\u2026 That\u2019s where I get my water from,\u201d he says. There is a collective shake of heads around. Everyone around gets the sarcasm of the man who spent 25 years building a dam. \n\u201cDo you think my shop will survive once this becomes a tourist place?\u201d Tadvi adds. It\u2019s the cynicism of a defeated man who doesn\u2019t have it in him anymore to put up a fight. \u201cI went with Medha Patkar to the Supreme Court three times. Remember Deve Gowda (the former prime minister), we were taken to him. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Those whose lands were submerged by water were better. At least they were compensated,\u201d laments the tiny man with a booming voice. \nHe points a finger to the horizon ahead, where his land lies. \u201cSince it\u2019s empty now, we farm it. There\u2019s an empty godown on my patch, we house our livestock there. Around it I have grown vegetables and tuvar. But with the land not in my name, I don\u2019t have kisan card, crop insurance and I can\u2019t get loan on it,\u201d Tadvi\u2019s voice trails off as he gets distracted by a man who is dragging his scooter to his shop. \nBut as he picks up another bottle from the counter, he smiles. It\u2019s the smile of a self-made man, an enterprising Gujarati, whose vikas has been subject of many debates this election and whose identity stolen by actors in promotional videos.

All the accused were involved in a case of money laundering related to drug smuggling worth several crores. The case was being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). \nAll the accused had applied for bail for the first time since they were named in the case. Special Prosecutor Jagjeet Singh Sraon, while contending the bail pleas of the accused, pleaded in court that when Phillaur was the jail minister during the previous SAD-BJP government\u2019s tenure in Punjab, he had bought property in the name of his son Damanvir. After hearing the arguments of the prosecution and defence, the CBI court rejected the bail applications of all the seven persons. \nThe names of Phillaur, his son and Chandra cropped up after Jagdish Bhola, the main accused in the multi-crore drug case, named Damanvir in February 2014. So, Phillaur had to resign as the jail minister in May 2014 following the allegations against his son. \nLater, Phillaur\u2019s role also came under the scanner in the case and he was even named as the accused in the money-laundering case by ED. \nThe multi-crore drugs case was registered in 2013 in which several high-profile people, including former Punjab police officer and Rustm-E-Hind Jagdish Bhola, and businessmen Jagjeet Singh Chahal were booked by the Punjab Police.

Before that I didn\u2019t do any sports. I was a sedentary kid and I did arts & craft as an ECA (extra curricular activity). I only took up running because I was not happy that I was always last in class in the NAPFA (National Physical Fitness Award) test. So I thought I would do something about it. That was the catalyst.\u201d \nIn secondary school, she joined NPCC (National Police Cadet Corps) as her ECA and was made a PTI (physical training instructor) for her final two years. \nSaid Baoying, \u201cThat meant that I had no choice but to keep fit so I started running there. But I only picked up running more seriously in junior college though.\u201d Running helps to clear her mind \nToday she loves running. Said Baoying, \u201cRunning gives me space to think about what I want and helps me to clear my mind. It is an outlet for me to diffuse stress from work too.\u201d Memorable running races \nOne of Baoying\u2019s most memorable running races had been when she broke the four hour mark in a marathon for the first time. That was at the Tokyo Marathon in 2010. She said, \u201cIt was the first time I was totally wrapped up, in a long sleeve top and gloves for a marathon.\u201d \nShe added, \u201cThe finish was also very hilly and I was constantly checking the time to beat the clock. I knew I could get a sub four hour finish but it was not easy. So when I finished, I was crying at the end.\u201d \nToday her full   is 3hr 13min 55sec. Does triathlons too \nBut besides running these days, Baoying also does triathlon, and she unexpectedly won her age group at the Ironman 70.3 race in Putrajaya, Malaysia a couple of years ago too. \nSaid Baoying, \u201cI did a horrible swim and took almost 50 minutes. Then my bike leg was not strong either and my run was not good as well but I ended up being faster than the other people and I came first. I did not expect it. In fact I went home and it was nice of Ironman to send me the trophy all the way from Putrajaya.\u201d Her Training \nBaoying\u2019s training is evenly split up between her swimming, biking and running. She does not train with a club but she has a coach who draws out an online programme for her. She said, \u201cSo that means I need lots of discipline on my own to train. Sometimes I have a running buddy though.\u201d \nFor her running, she clocks about 50 plus kilometres per week, doing about two to three sessions. \nBaoying admits that she has been neglecting her long runs and that she doesn\u2019t like using the track, but she does a lot of tempo runs and speed run interval sets. She clocks about 10km on her tempo runs and roughly five to six kilometres on her speed interval sets. \nAdditionally, her swims and bike rides are also about two or three sessions each week. She said, \u201cThat is enough for me to do double sessions on some days. I take a rest day once in every few weeks.\u201d \nHer bike sessions last a minimum of one hour, and she clocks at least 30km. When she is training for an Ironman race though, her rides can be as long as 180km. \nAs well, she also incorporates body weight training into her bike and run sets, but admits that she does not do this regularly enough. Running is all about consistency \nTo get faster at running, Baoying stresses that it is all about consistency. She said, \u201cI have been running for 10 \u2013 20 years and have never stopped. So consistency is the word.\u201d \nShe also pointed out that discipline is important too, in order to be able to clock those running sessions on a regular basis. \nSaid Baoying, \u201cYou have to be disciplined to train, unless you are talented of course, but then talent runs out too, so consistency is still the most important thing.\u201d \nBaoying added, \u201cBut you also need to be able to train fast too, in order to get fast. But be careful not to do too much fast training too soon, because you will need to improve your aerobic base first. Speed sessions on the track or tempo runs are important to improve your timings.\u201d Need to spend time on family and career as well \nBut Baoying feels that runners generally plateau out in terms of improving their running times after a while because there is only so much that recreational runners can train, especially with a full time job and family commitments as well. \nShe said, \u201cYou cannot always focus on training; you need to spend time with your family and building up a career as well.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lim baoying", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "said baoying", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baoying", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "changi general hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "napfa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npcc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "junior college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national police cadet corps", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tokyo marathon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putrajaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baoying", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:03.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2ef000d7de0e0f36f95cf97842a53bc847d636a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.uz_5wQNFKlXFOO3T5dH71HHtHPa5O4dmN45K1L9p0deYpFzhY1srToKhdX4XXQe95NRdwbzt6OQ--", "site_full": "www.agacentral.com", "site": "agacentral.com", "site_section": "http://www.agacentral.com/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=2", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "agacentral.com \u2022 View forum -

He also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable. \n\u201cWe cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past,\u201d Trump said, brushing aside the appeals for caution from around the world. \nHarsh objections came from a wide array of presidents and prime ministers. From the Middle East to Europe and beyond, leaders cautioned Trump that any sudden change on an issue as sensitive as Jerusalem not only risks blowing up the new Arab-Israeli peace initiative led by Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, but could lead to new violence in the region. \nNo government beyond Israel spoke up in praise of Trump or suggested it would follow his lead. \nIsraelis and Palestinians reacted in starkly different terms. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Trump\u2019s announcement as an \u201cimportant step toward peace,\u201d and Israeli opposition leaders echoed his praise. But Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Trump\u2019s shift serves extremist groups that want religious war and signals U.S. withdrawal from being a peace mediator. Protesters in Gaza burned American and Israeli flags. \nRead | What US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital means \nTrump\u2019s declaration of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital is a powerfully symbolic statement about a city that houses many of the world\u2019s holiest sites. Trump cited several: the Western Wall that surrounded the Jews\u2019 ancient Temple, the Stations of the Cross that depict Jesus along his crucifixion path, the al-Asqa Mosque where Muslims say their Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. \nAnd there are major ramifications over who should control the territory. The United States has never endorsed the Jewish state\u2019s claim of sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem and has seen the city\u2019s future as indelibly linked to the \u201cdeal of the century\u201d between Israel and the Palestinians that Trump believes he can reach. Beyond Kushner, Trump has dispatched other top emissaries to the region in recent months in hopes of advancing new negotiations. \nAlso Read | Top quotes from Donald Trump\u2019s historic announcement \nTrump said he wasn\u2019t delivering any verdict about where an Israeli-Palestinian border should lie. Instead, he described his Jerusalem declaration as recognizing the reality that most of Israel\u2019s government already operates from the city, and he suggested the US ally should be rewarded for creating a successful democracy where \u201cpeople of all faiths are free to live and worship.\u201d Palestinian burn a poster of the US President Donald Trump during a protest in Bethlehem, West Bank, Wednesday. (Source: AP Photo) \n\u201cToday we finally acknowledge the obvious,\u201d he said, emphasizing that he wouldn\u2019t follow past presidents who tiptoed around Jerusalem out of diplomatic caution. violent protests. In Jordan, home to a large Palestinian population, the US said it would close its embassy to the public on Thursday and urged children of diplomats there to stay home from school. \nThere was little in Trump\u2019s statement to encourage the Palestinians. Although he recited the longstanding US position that Jerusalem\u2019s borders must still be worked out through negotiation, he made no recognition of the Palestinian claims to east Jerusalem. \nFor the first time, Trump did appear to endorse the concept of an independent Palestine existing alongside Israel. Yet even that idea appeared conditional, as he said he\u2019d promote the \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d if both sides agreed. Netanyahu\u2019s government is dominated by hardliners who oppose Palestinian independence. \nAlso Read | UN Security Council to convene Friday on Jerusalem, eight member nations call for meeting \nTrump made no reference to signing a waiver that officially delays any move of the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but the White House confirmed he signed the waiver Wednesday. It means there will be no embassy move for at least another six months. Establishing a Jerusalem embassy was a major campaign promise of Trump\u2019s and one that officials said he focused on in discussions with top advisers in recent weeks. \nOn Wednesday he focused on his directive to the State Department to begin a process of moving the embassy as required by US law, however many years that might take. After his speech, he signed a proclamation to that effect. \nIn Germany, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said work will begin immediately to identify a site. A non-governmental expert on the Middle East who consults regularly with the White House said the Trump administration had opted against an earlier plan of converting the existing US Consulate in Jerusalem to an embassy. Instead, it\u2019s looking to construct an entirely new facility, said the individual, who wasn\u2019t authorized to disclose private conversations with US officials and requested anonymity. \nIn making his decision, Trump overruled more cautious counsel from Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, who voiced concern about endangering US diplomats and troops in Muslim countries, according to officials briefed on internal administration deliberations. Those officials were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n\u201cThere will of course be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement _ but we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a place of greater understanding and cooperation,\u201d Trump said. He said he intends \u201cto do everything in my power to help forge\u201d a peace agreement.

He was arraigned on a five-count charge of attempting to commit felony, obstruction, assault, slapping and kidnapping of two police officers. The Prosecutor, Sgt. Sunday Osanyintuyi, told the court that the accused committed the offences on Nov. 14 at about 8:35 am at OAUTHC area of Ile-Ife. Osanyintuyi said the accused assaulted two officers, Omopo Idowu and Oderinde Zacheus, by slapping them while performing their lawful duties. He further said that the accused attempted to kidnap the duo. The prosecutor also said the accused obstructed one police officer, Tajudeen Agbaje, attached to \u201cA\u201d Division in Ile-Ife by forcing him into his car while performing his lawful duty. The offences, he said, contravened Sections 356 (2) and 509 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Osun, 2003. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The defence counsel, Samuel Judge, who applied for the bail of his client, pledged to produce reliable sureties. Magistrate Olalekan Ijiyode, however, rejected the oral bail application and asked defence counsel to produce a written application.
