The Supreme Court granted him bail on the condition that he would not enter Gujarat. However, on December 1, the Gujarat High Court granted Jadeja 10 days \u2014 December 6 to December 16 \u2014 relief to enter the state to campaign for his wife, Gitaba, who has been fielded by the BJP from his constituency.

Justin Aluya, Lamont Mitchell and Will Jones each had 7 boards to lead the way. \n\u201cRebounding was the difference,\u201d said Knox coach Kevin Walden. \u201cWe hung with them for awhile and they made a lot of tough shots in the beginning, but they have some really good athletes with the rebounding portion of it. We did not attack the rim as much in the second half.\u201d \nAdded MC coach Todd Skirvseth, \u201cIn the second half, we did a much better job on the glass. And defensively, I thought we did a much better job with the ball screens. I felt that we got back to the defensive team that we have seen during the season.\u201d \nKnox played an aggressive 2-3 zone on defense the majority of the game to try and quiet the outside shooting of Monmouth College. However, Lamont Mitchell broke loose for a game-high 29 points on 5-of-10 shooting from 3-point range. The steady Will Jones turned it up a notch in the second half with 15 of his 20 points. \nMonmouth College climbed to 6-2 on the season and 3-0 in the Midwest Conference. The Fighting Scots will travel to Jacksonville on Dec. 18 for a big game against Illinois College. \u201cThis was big,\u201d Skirvseth said. \u201cWe just came off two road wins with a couple of road trips and this was a rivalry game. It had all the makings of a trap game to say the least. I\u2019m just glad how we responded in the second half.\u201d \nThe game started out with Aluya throwing down a two-handed dunk and Mitchell hitting a 3 for a quick 5-0 Scots lead. Mitchell later responded with four 3-pointers for a 35-28 Scots advantage. \nKnox, though, bounced back as Blake Godbold started hitting from the outside for their first lead of the game at 38-35. Godbold had the lone double-double of the night with team-highs of 20 points and 13 rebounds. \nAt halftime, Knox held a 43-39 advantage. Mitchell kept Monmouth in the game in the first half with 17 of the team\u2019s 39 points at halftime. \nMC senior Paul Engo III had 8 points and 4 assists in the victory and took some time to reflect on the victory. \n\u201cWe put it together on the defensive end and that led to our offense,\u201d Engo III said. \nAnd about the 29-point effort of Mitchell, Engo II said, \u201cHe was hot. We just kept feeding him the ball. He\u2019s a good athlete and it is fun playing with him. We had to get the W.\u201d \nLow-post player Justin Batterton also played a key role for the Scots with a 4-for-4 effort from the field and 8 points. With 4:25 left in the game, Batterton delivered a jump-hook in the paint for a 64-60 lead. MC guard Austin Holman later added a huge tip-in with 2:35 left in the game for a Scots 69-62 lead. \nKnox slipped to 0-6 on the season. \n\u201cWhat it comes down to is that we don\u2019t know how to win,\u201d Walden said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in some tight games this year. We have to continue to find ways to win. We are a young team, but I really like our team and we have to continue to be positive. Work hard and good things will happen.\u201d \nIn the women\u2019s game, Knox defeated Monmouth 69-63 at Glennie Gym. \nMorgan Potter led the Prairie Fire with 18 points, Jarrelyn McCall had 17 and Karlie Thorn added 15. The Prairie Fire go to 5-1 on the season. \nThe Fighting Scots (3-4, 1-2) were led by Jeni Crain\u2019s 16 points and Carley Turnbull\u2019s 14 points.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeff holt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd skirvseth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karlie thorn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skirvseth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carley turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin holman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "batterton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeni crain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan potter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin aluya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul engo iii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "godbold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin walden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aluya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "engo iii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin batterton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jarrelyn mccall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lamont mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blake godbold", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "knox college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glennie gym", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fighting scots", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monmouth college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scots", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "glennie gym", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:19.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "271696c9c4b077bd30cca370c5a6d176981f2c49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZiVdtTnvH6ktWHTenKaEGGr6Hah66hT2rJ", "site_full": "www.beyondblue.org.au", "site": "beyondblue.org.au", "site_section": "http://www.beyondblue.org.au/connect-with-others/online-forums/relationship-and-family-issues", "site_categories": ["health", "panic_anxiety_disorders", "depression"], "section_title": "Relationship and family issues ", "title": "When you know it's hopeless but you keep trying.", "title_full": "When you know it's hopeless but you keep trying.", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.beyondblue.org.au/App_Themes/standard/images/BB_FB_logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e6d6c7c0698eb7006a4ade5b41bd611a8965ce0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZiVdtTnvH6ktWHTenKaEGGr9lsei.7ZcRtVWGkNFhLYZv9KUgQikCnXg082_Uxw526", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "white knight", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi Lolue, welcome\nThat hollow feeling I know too well.

These structures are customizable in that they can be site-specifically functionalized or constructed to exhibit machine-like or logic-gating behaviour. Their use has been limited to applications that require only small amounts of material (of the order of micrograms), owing to the limitations of current production methods. But many proposed applications, for example as therapeutic agents or in complex materials, could be realized if more material could be used. In DNA origami, a nanostructure is assembled from a very long single-stranded scaffold molecule held in place by many short single-stranded staple oligonucleotides. Only the bacteriophage-derived scaffold molecules are amenable to scalable and efficient mass production; the shorter staple strands are obtained through costly solid-phase synthesis or enzymatic processes. Here we show that single strands of DNA of virtually arbitrary length and with virtually arbitrary sequences can be produced in a scalable and cost -efficient manner by using bacteriophages to generate single-stranded precursor DNA that contains target strand sequences interleaved with self-excising \u2018cassettes\u2019, with each cassette comprising two Zn2+-dependent DNA-cleaving DNA enzymes. We produce all of the necessary single strands of DNA for several DNA origami using shaker-flask cultures, and demonstrate end-to-end production of macroscopic amounts of a DNA origami nanorod in a litre-scale stirred-tank bioreactor. Our method is compatible with existing DNA origami design frameworks and retains the modularity and addressability of DNA origami objects that are necessary for implementing custom modifications using functional groups. With all of the production and purification steps amenable to scaling, we expect that our method will expand the scope of DNA nanotechnology in many areas of science and technology.

Advisors and investors expect that trend to continue. \nIn its year-end ETF market observations, done in conjunction with ETF.com, ETF custodian Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. revealed ETF users have enthusiasm for smart beta strategies, but that more education is needed. \n\u201cThe 2017 survey polled 360 financial advisors and institutional investors on their ETF selection process and criteria, including their comfort with newly launched ETFs, portfolio construction strategies, and plans for investing in emerging ETF strategies,\u201d according to Brown Brothers Harriman . \nNearly two-thirds of the survey's respondents said they like the versatility offered by smart beta strategies, but over a third (34%) said they are unfamiliar with smart beta, according to the survey. Year-to-date, each of the top 10 ETFs in terms of new assets added are cap-weighted funds. \nThere are other promising data points regarding market participants' use of smart beta strategies. For example, multi-factor ETFs, widely regarded as one of the primary sources of future smart beta growth for smart beta, are expected to see increased adoption. \n\u201cDemand is up for multi-factor ETFs: 60% are currently using or most likely to use a multi-factor strategy and 32% plan to increase their allocation,\u201d according to Brown Brothers Harriman. \nMulti-factor ETFs are catching on with advisors and investors as more market participants realize timing the success of individual investment factors, such as growth and value, from year-to-year is difficult. ETFs in this genre typically combine several factors and weight stocks accordingly. For example, the fast-growing JPMorgan Diversified Return U.S. Equity ETF ( JPUS ) combines the momentum, quality and value factors. \nThere is also greater interest in ETFs that adhere to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing principles. \n\u201cThis year's survey, which measures the expectations and preferences of sophisticated ETF investors in the US, found greater interest in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ETFs, with 51% of investors finding ESG at least somewhat important vs. 37% last year,\u201d according to Brown Brothers Harriman. \nThere is ample room for growth for ESG ETFs. In the U.S., the world's largest ETF market, there are approximately 50 ETFs that are classified as ESG funds and only one has close to $1 billion in assets under management and only eight have more than $100 million in assets.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "todd shriber", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brown brothers harriman & co.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown brothers harriman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "esg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:19.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c5f54143559b852e53f0511a4bc7d176737750b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r28LWebNy8kOUQQS1J4.rTRuOJwgDC77vs4CHtM6fO7o8ogkRswksiuNYBEbJ0iu03RMtmYD2yzN9zhXidSuRdgV.mX0W68kK..8ll7eV4fERro.46KQQXxdwkbA7.pYQdd9sPqdDLrknQUUIZyCllQi6spw0w1XpQmQVSPp8fugF", "site_full": "www.chennaiclassic.com", "site": "chennaiclassic.com", "site_section": "http://www.chennaiclassic.com/feed/1/posts", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Chennai  - ChennaiClassic.com", "title": "Hiring for Python Developer with Automation Testing in Chennai, for Exp. 3 - 8 yrs at Quess Corp Ltd (Chennai Job)", "title_full": "Hiring for Python Developer with Automation Testing in Chennai, for Exp. 3 - 8 yrs at Quess Corp Ltd (Chennai Job)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 64302, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c5f54143559b852e53f0511a4bc7d176737750b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r28LWebNy8kOUQQS1J4.rTRuOJwgDC77vs4CHtM6fO7o8ogkRswksiuNYBEbJ0iu03RMtmYD2yzN9zhXidSuRdgV.mX0W68kK..8ll7eV4fERro.46KQQXxdwkbA7.pYQdd9sPqdDLrknQUUIZyCllQi6spw0w1XpQmQVSPp8fugF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hiring for Python Developer with Automation Testing in Chennai, for Exp. 3 - 8 yrs at Quess Corp Ltd (Chennai Job)", "text": "Hiring for Python Developer with Automation Testing in Chennai, for Exp. 3 - 8 yrs at Quess Corp Ltd (Chennai Job) Reply to: (Not Shown) (Please mention ChennaiClassic.com when contacting) Job Description: Looking for the candidates with exp in Python developer with automation testing Exp: 3.5-8 Yrs Work Location: Chennai (Looking for the candidates with short notice) If you are interested please share your updated resume along with the following details: Full Name: Tot Exp: Rel Exp in Python developer with automation testing: Rel exp in: Current Company: Permanent / Contract: Payroll Company Name : Current CTC: Expected CTC: Notice Period: Alternate Mobile Number: Date Of Birth: Ready to work under the payroll of Magna (Yes/No): Mode of Interview will be F2F Technical (Yes / No) : Looking for the candidates who can join immediately Awaiting for your positive response. tags: 5 To apply for this job Click here http://spanjobs.com/india/jobs/581303 \u00bb Posted on: Thursday, 07 December, 2017 09:42 Expires On: Tuesday, 03 April, 2018 18:30 Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Contact us | Post Free Ad | Chennai Classifieds | Jobs in India | Copyright \u00a9 2006 - 2017 ChennaiClassic.com Free Chennai Classifieds - The Number 1 Chennai Free Classifieds Ads Portal.

The school doesn't have electricity, so it lets out at 12:30 p.m. Jeff Cohen / WNPR Children do crafts during the after-school program. Organizers hope the activities will give kids a sense of normalcy and routine. Jeff Cohen / WNPR \nThe Puerto Rican effort to advance from response to recovery after Hurricane Maria continues. For some, water and electricity are still elusive. And that makes it hard to get back to normal \u2014 especially for children. \nAn after-school program is designed to pick up when school lets out. The program \u2013 which has no formal name \u2013 is organized by volunteers and the nonprofit Save the Children. In a territory still lacking basic utilities in some places, Facebook access and YouTube videos are a lower priority. But kids need something to do. \nSchool started again in mid-November in the mountain town of Orocovis \u2013 two months after Maria passed. Even now the school building doesn't have electricity, so theday ends at 12:30 p.m. \nBut one day last week, 51 children stayed behind for more. Before splitting up for activities, they began with songs that got them moving \u2014 practicing their lefts and rights, and smiling. Parents say the after-school opportunity is a safe place for them to send their children. It gives adults time to work and to try and deal with the daily stress of living without basic services. That stress affects the kids, too. \nWanda Medina, a science teacher in Orocovis, said she decided to use the situation as a teachable moment in her classroom. She posed a question to her students: \"Nature has been affected, and human beings have been affected. Which [will] replenish more quickly?\" \nAll of them said nature. The children spoke from their own observations. They told her that trees have already grown new leaves. Their families and friends, however, lost things they can't get back, like valuables their parents gave them. Three of Medina's students lost their entire home. \nParent and volunteer Giovanni Caballero Fuentes was luckier. His family didn't lose their house, but his kids watched the storm rip off their neighbor's roof. He said he's hoping they soon forget the sound of the wind and rain, and learn to deal with life without electricity, without water, and without technology. \n\"Back to basic,\" Caballero Fuentes said. \nHe and his kids plays board games at home, and they look for other ways to distract themselves. Still, his 10-year-old daughter Nadjah said she is happy to be in the after-school program. \n\"Because it is very fun,\" she said. \nLuis Santiago's grandson, Janiel, participates in the program. Santiago said his grandson often stays with him because his daughter works two jobs. He's a retired elementary school teacher, and he knows how important routine is for kids. \n\"It's a little bit difficult, you know, [to] have normality,\" Santiago said. \"We don't go to the movies, we don't go to the places where before we can go. But before was great. But now it's very difficult.\" \nEugenio Soto Santiago teaches during the day and leads some of the after-school activities. He said many of his students thought that their island would never be the same after Hurricane Maria. However, small bits of regular life are coming back into view. \n\"Even though we don't have electricity, and sometimes we don't have water, they're turning back to that ... this is our new normal,\" Soto Santiago said. \"And they're able to handle it.\" Copyright 2017 WNPR News.

By Doha Madani , Nick Visser , and Dominique Mosbergen 1.8k Marriage equality has become the law of the land down under.\nAustralia\u2019s Parliament passed a bill on Thursday to legalize same-sex marriage following a long push for marriage equality. The House of Representatives approved the legislation without amendments after hours of emotional speeches and debate. Only four members of parliament voted against the the legislation.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a supporter of marriage equality, had committed last month to passing the bill before Christmas.\n\u201cThis is Australia: fair, diverse, loving and filled with respect. For every one of us this is a great day,\u201d Turnbull said on Thursday.\nAustralia\u2019s Senate already passed the bill without amendments in a 43-12 vote in late November .\nThe law will likely take effect in about a month \u201cafter royal assent and other formalities,\u201d AP reported. The first same-sex weddings are expected to take place in early 2018.\nIt's a YES! Simply and fairly, #MarriageEquality is now law! Today our country can be truly proud. We did it together! \ud83c\udf89 pic.twitter.com/lGZgUgSmyL\n\u2014 AU Marriage Equality (@AMEquality) December 7, 2017 Parliament\u2019s quick passage of the bill reflects the country\u2019s majority support of the issue. In a survey released in November, 61 percent of Australians agreed that the government should legalize same-sex marriage. The poll results were met with praise from LGBTQ advocates around the world.\nMore than 100 members of Parliament gave speeches on the bill, with a majority in support of changing the definition of marriage, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported . MP Tim Wilson used his portion of the debate time to propose to his partner on the floor of Parliament.\n\u201cIn my first speech I defined our bond by the ring that sits on both of our left hands,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThey are the answer to the question we cannot ask. So there\u2019s only one thing left to do: Ryan Patrick Bolger, will you marry me?\u201d\nThe proposal, and Bolger\u2019s answer (he said yes), are now part of the official debate record .\nConservative legislators tried to tack religious freedom amendments onto the bill but could not get enough support. The amendments were consistently rejected by other MPs, who have called the suggestions \u201c superfluous \u201d and argued that the existing freedom of religion laws would protect Australia\u2019s religious institutions. Even still, debates and votes to the amendments delayed the final passage.\nThe amendments, noted AP, could still be considered at a later date.\nDownload ALSO ON HUFFPOST PHOTO GALLERY BEFORE YOU GO Australia Gay Marriage Rally PHOTO GALLERY Australia Gay Marriage Rally Doha Madani Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Nick Visser Reporter, HuffPost Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Suggest a correction", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://wdo-m.tlnk.io/serve?action=click&publisher_id=353714&site_id=125341&my_placement=b_page&site_id_android=125343", "https://m.facebook.com/msg/huffpost/?show_interstitial=0&mdotme_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fm.me%2Fhuffpost&handler=m.me&referer&refsrc=http%3A%2F%2Fm.me%2Fhuffpost&_rdr", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-07/same-sex-marriage-bill-looks-set-to-pass-parliament/9233818", "https://www.twitter.com//DohaMadani", "https://twitter.com/AMEquality/status/938661842641043456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://apnews.com/e53630c6ab8d412eab7aae0449f87f69?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/politicsnow-ssm-bill-decided-today-citizenship-saga-continues/news-story/642ba787fcb52a24f08d61be8ac650d7", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarriageEquality?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/06/superfluous-same-sex-marriage-bill-amendments-headed-for-defeat", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansardr/72ab0aa3-c3f2-48e1-b365-7e7ac525ceb6/&sid=0091", "https://www.twitter.com/nvisser", "https://www.twitter.com/dmosbergen"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doha madani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick visser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffpost dominique mosbergen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan patrick bolger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominique mosbergen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffpost nick visser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "au marriage equality", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lgbtq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian broadcasting corp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:19.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "981440fbde18f5454cf22a3704eef038e24d2810", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2eOpN__abbg9iRwMQpTw4ZXv8YZtFJqX3VwKlvmaoZiBne7CV7QzWbPnAqTKopY8taqMoSEcHmDVT6KLdobZ9n6b8wnUDFu0WaseO0VLsLr4y8fQ6u6dtBg2yPnpaCX2x9XPYsQn.IgPm_UXGnPW5nRhNldN44Fgl", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Gujarat elections: Non-Patels weigh their choices, many of them unmoved by quota stir | The Indian Express", "title_full": "Gujarat elections: Non-Patels weigh their choices, many of them unmoved by quota stir | The Indian Express", "published": "2017-12-07T04:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/12/cats45.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5, "comments": 0, "shares": 5}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "981440fbde18f5454cf22a3704eef038e24d2810", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2eOpN__abbg9iRwMQpTw4ZXv8YZtFJqX3VwKlvmaoZiBne7CV7QzWbPnAqTKopY8taqMoSEcHmDVT6KLdobZ9n6b8wnUDFu0WaseO0VLsLr4y8fQ6u6dtBg2yPnpaCX2x9XPYsQn.IgPm_UXGnPW5nRhNldN44Fgl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ravish Tiwari", "published": "2017-12-07T04:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Gujarat elections: Non-Patels weigh their choices, many of them unmoved by quota stir | The Indian Express", "text": "Gujarat elections: Farmer Patel vs industrial Patel, over farm issues and social work \nThe Patidar quota agitation may be one of the central themes for parties in this election, but not necessarily for voters of non-Patel communities. Many voters from numerically strong communities \u2014 Kolis, Durbars, Bharwad, Ahirs and others \u2014 have indicated that the agitation will have no effect on their traditional voting choices. \nThis came across in interactions with voters in constituencies from Dhandhuka (Ahmedabad) to Bhavnagar Rural, Mahuva and Talaja (Bhavnagar); Rajula (Amreli); Una, Kodinar and Talala (Gir Somnath); Manavadar and Visavadar (Junagadh); Jetpur and Gondal (Rajkot). This was in spite of occasional criticism for the BJP government and its MLAs. The few who did say they would change their choice, in fact, appeared to be guided by the candidates in their seats. \nThis tendency, if widespread, would go against the BJP\u2019s hopes that the Patidar assertion may result in counter polarisation among other communities. \nMembers of the Koli community, the largest chunk of the 40% OBC community, seemed inclined to go with their previous choice in most places visited by this reporter. Kolis constituted over 24% of Gujarat\u2019s population according to the 1931 caste census; Patidars constituted under 15%. \n\u201cI will vote for the Congress as I did last time,\u201d said A S Makwana in Una, sipping morning tea at the town corner shop. Both the Congress and the BJP have fielded a Koli candidate in Una, which shot into prominence nationally following atrocities on Dalits by cow vigilantes. Makwana said he might have considered voting BJP if they had fielded another Koli, one hailing from the town itself. \nSitting with Makwana are others of the Koli community, such as Bharat Solanki, who declare they would vote for the BJP as they did last time. On the way from Vavuri village in Gir Somnath to Junagadh, The Indian Express came across a few Kolis who did say they would move from the BJP to the Congress. While being OBCs themselves, none of these Koli voters The Indian Express spoke to mentioned the OBC quota demand by Patidars led by Hardik Patel. The few who claimed they would change their choice, in fact, said this was because of low prices for their cotton and groundnut produce. \nOBC Ratharia Rajputs, pastoralist sphepherds Bharwads and Ahirs across Bhavnagar, Gir Somnath and Junagadh, too, did not refer to the Patidar agitation when they spoke of their preference. Nor did upper-caste Rajputs, who call themselves Durbars and are not entitled to a caste quota. So, Bharat Chudasma, a Rajput of Dholera region where farmers have agitated against land acquisition for a special investment region, expresses his apprehensions about the acquisition but still affirms his preference for the BJP. \nA number of Durbar community members who run autorickshaws from a stand outside an engineering college in Bhavnagar Rural, on the other hand, declare their preference for the Congress. From both these camps, it emerges that they voted for the same option last election too. \nAhirs are not a dominant community but have a sizeable presence across Gir Somnath and Junagadh and some other districts. While most indicated they would stick to their earlier preferences, a few BJP voters said they would go with the Congress \u2014 because the party has fielded more Ahir candidates than the BJP. \n\u201cThe Congress has fielded 8 Ahir candidates, the BJP 2. Otherwise, Modiji is good for Gujarat and the country,\u201d said Vinu Bhai, an Ahir in his mid-30s, in Datrana of Junagadh. Bharwads, such as Oghad Bhai of Rajabra village in Talaja of Bhavnagar, populate the arid regions of Saurashtra. \u201cI had voted for the BJP and will vote for them again,\u201d he said.

investors nervous? What is the yield curve, and why is it making investors nervous? 1 Comment US Federal Reserve: short-term interest rates are going to rise \nThe \u201cyield curve\u201d has been creeping up the headlines in the last week or so. What is it, and why is it worrying some people? \nYield curve sounds a bit technical. But the concept is pretty simple. Let\u2019s start with the very basics. \nA bond is an IOU. Some of these IOUs pay out (\u201cmature\u201d) next week, and some of them don\u2019t pay out for 30 years or more. In the meantime, they pay interest to the holder of the IOU. \nThe annual interest paid out, expressed as a percentage of the price of the bond, is the \u201cyield\u201d. In effect, this is the interest rate on the bond. \nA yield curve takes a look at bonds from the same issuer, and compares the yields across different maturities, starting with the shortest-term bonds. \nThe most important yield curve in the world is the yield curve for US Treasury bonds. US government debt is generally deemed the safest in the world. The US won\u2019t default on its debt (probably) although it might repay you in dollars that aren\u2019t worth as much as you had hoped they would be. \nSo US debt is effectively used as a reference price for most other assets. If you can get a 2% annual interest rate on US debt, for example, then you\u2019ll need a better prospective return than that to convince you to buy something much more risky. \nThe yield curve on US debt gives us an idea of what investors expect for the future. Usually, the yield curve goes up from left to right. In other words, long-term interest rates are higher than short-term ones. \nThat\u2019s logical. If you ask me for a loan for ten years, then I\u2019ll expect a higher interest rate than if you say you\u2019ll give me the money back in six months\u2019 time. Even if I entirely trust you to repay me, I still have to account for the fact that inflation might soar over that time \u2013 I need you to pay me to take that risk. \nWhat\u2019s grabbing everyone\u2019s attention right now is that the US Treasury yield curve is flattening. \nWhat this means is that the gap between long-term interest rates and short-term ones is getting narrower. In other words, investors will accept almost the same level of interest rate for lending out their money over two years as they will for ten. \nIndeed, the gap between the two is now at its lowest level since 2007. Which was, of course, directly prior to the biggest financial crisis in recent history. What if the yield curve goes pear-shaped? \nThis is significant. A flat yield curve is unusual. It implies a few things. Firstly, investors expect interest rates in the short term to rise, because the Federal Reserve has basically said that this is going to happen. But it also implies that they don\u2019t think rates will rise in the longer-term. \nNow, why might that be? \nWell, if investors are sceptical about rates rising in the medium term, then it suggests that they don\u2019t see inflation taking off. In turn, that suggests that they\u2019re sceptical about growth. In other words, they see no reason for interest rates to rise. \nYou might think that this sounds fine. After all, who wants higher rates when we all own so much debt? \nUnfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple. If the economy isn\u2019t growing fast enough to spark inflation or interest rate rises, that generally means one thing \u2013 that the economy is in fact, in recession. \nIn other words, a flattening yield curve indicates that investors expect tougher economic times ahead. And once the yield curve \u201cinverts\u201d \u2013 ie long-term rates fall below short-term ones \u2013 that is a reasonably reliable recession indicator (it\u2019s happened before every recession over the last 30 years or so). \nIs there a benign explanation for all this? Bill Gross, formerly the \u201cbond king\u201d, reckons that the yield curve, down at these levels, is indicating that markets are more sensitive to rising interest rates. He thinks the current curve is sustainable but that investors need to watch out if the Fed raises rates to above 2%. \nHe also reckons that money flooding in from around the world is keeping long-term US yields down (the higher that bond prices go, the lower yields go, and vice versa). The yield on longer-term US debt is still a lot higher than that on German bunds or Japanese bonds. \nAll else being equal, that should make it attractive to overseas investors. There\u2019s a logic to that, although the issue of currency risk makes it much trickier \u2013 many have pointed out that once you account for the cost of \u201chedging\u201d (ie making sure that if the dollar falls, you don\u2019t lose out as an overseas investor), then Treasury yields are no longer as appealing as they might seem on the surface. \nAnyway, that\u2019s one explanation. Another is that investors are simply very sceptical about economic prospects, and are starting to price in a slowdown, and perhaps a recession. \nI\u2019m not so sure. I suspect that investors might simply have grown too used to the idea that long-term interest rates will remain low. This might represent end-of-bubble complacency rather than any accurate forecast for the future. But we\u2019ll keep an eye out to see what happens next. \nI look at the yield curve in more detail in the forthcoming issue of MoneyWeek magazine ( get your first four issues free here ).

He noted that the word \u201cmafia\u201d for organised crime orignated in Italy, the country of maternal grandfather of Rahul. \nAddressing a rally at Gariyadhar in Bhavnagar district, Adityanath said: \u201cRahul and his party in 2005 had questioned the existence of Lord Krishna and Lord Ram\u2026 then what is he trying to prove by visiting temples in Gujarat? Rahul is being a hypocrite by visiting temples and his party had proved it yesterday\u2026 when the hearing about the Ram Janmabhoomi was to start in the Supreme Court, Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that the hearing should be delayed\u2026\u201d \nSibal, while appearing for the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Wakf Board \u2014 a litigant in the Ayodhya dispute \u2014 urged the Supreme Court to postpone the hearing into the dispute till July 2019, by when the Lok Sabha polls would be over. \n\u201cI want to ask the Congress today, do they want the Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya or not? The Congress has to answer if it wants a solution to the controversy\u2026 And if the case is open, then why does Congress leader Kapil Sibal want to postpone the hearing?\u201d Adityanath said at the gathering. \nAccusing the Congress of believing in dynastic politics and casteism, he said: \u201cBapu was right about dissolving the Congress after Independence. They only believe in dynastic politics and casteism. They believe in dhong (pretence). When Modiji inaugurated the bullet train in Gujarat, Rahul opposed it. When Modiji gets water, electricity in every house, they oppose it. This state has four and eight-lane roads\u2026 what has Congress given? It has given gundarraj, gangwar and antakwaad.\u201d \nLater at a rally in Savarkundla taluka of Amreli, the UP chief minister said: \u201cThe Congress was in power in Gujarat before 1995. There was no electricity, roads or water. But, there certainly was gundaraj, and gang wars.

The tax was eliminated in 2010 but was reinstated a year later. Alex Wong / Getty Images \nRepublicans in Congress are on the verge of fulfilling their long-time dream of eliminating the federal estate tax, and they could do it in a way that is even more generous to heirs than previous repeal efforts. \nBills passed by the Senate and the House recently would reduce or scrap the taxes heirs now pay on estates larger than $5.5 million. And the bills would do so without repealing the so-called \"stepped-up basis\" provision. \nOrdinarily, people have to pay taxes when they sell off assets that have appreciated in value, like shares of stock or real estate. But heirs are exempted from that tax. That's because they already pay the estate tax. \nThe bills approved by Congress recently would eliminate or reduce the estate tax, while leaving the exemption in place. \nIn other words, you would be able to pass on assets that have gained a lot in value \u2014 like those Apple shares you bought years ago \u2014 and, unlike everyone else, your heirs never have to pay tax on the appreciation. \nTo put it another way: Someone could inherit her grandfather's large beachfront mansion without paying estate tax, and sell it off right away without paying any capital gains tax. \nIt's a much more generous policy than previous tax overhauls, says Lily Batchelder, a professor of law and public policy at New York University Law School. \n\"We've never seen a proposal like this,\" she says. \"I don't recall ever seeing a proposal that would both fully repeal the estate tax and fully exempt from tax all the accrued gains on these giant estates.\" \nThe bill passed by the Senate early Saturday would double the exemption on large estates, allowing people to pass on estates worth $11 million to their heirs tax-free. \nThe exemption for married couples would be $22 million. The House bill would gradually reduce the estate tax and then scrap it altogether in 2023. \nHouse and Senate leaders are now trying to reconcile the two versions of the tax overhaul, with a vote expected by the end of the month. \nThe estate tax has long been the bane of conservatives. Congress briefly eliminated the tax in 2010, but it came back the following year and remains in place today. \n\"We just think it's unfair. Death should not be a taxable event. And we should not be stopping people from being able to pass their life's work on to their kids,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox News recently. \nThe estate tax brings in a relatively small amount of money to the federal Treasury, about $19 billion a year, even as it hurts the large economy, says Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation. \nBecause of the tax, people end up pouring money into tax shelters and paying hefty bills to tax lawyers, he says. \nThe tax is especially onerous for assets that may be worth a lot on paper but are cash poor, such as certain kinds of businesses, Hodge says. In some cases, heirs have to break up or sell businesses to pay taxes, he says. \nPeople who want to keep the tax say such cases are extremely rare. They also say that at a time of growing income inequality, the estate tax plays an important role in making the economy fair. \n\"The estate tax is basically a way of partially leveling the playing field, so that these heirs of massive estates don't have quite as gigantic a leg up in life,\" Batchelder says.

The acronym stands for \"Savings Investment Match Plan for Employees.\" And IRA is, of course, \"Individual Retirement Account.\" \nThe SIMPLE IRA allows eligible employees to contribute part of their pretax compensation to the plan. This means the tax on the money is deferred until it is distributed . This contribution is called an elective-deferral or salary-reduction contribution. \nEmployers are required to make either matching contributions \u2013 based only on elective-deferral contributions made by employees \u2013 or nonelective contributions , which are paid to each eligible employee regardless of whether the employee made salary-reduction contributions to the plan. For a matching contribution, the employer's contribution may match the employee's elective-deferral contribution dollar for dollar, up to a maximum of 3% of the employee's compensation. \nLike other employer plans, the SIMPLE IRA allows employers a tax deduction for contributions they make to the SIMPLE IRA plan. \nContributions to a SIMPLE IRA are not taxed, but distributions from a SIMPLE IRA are. Why Establish a SIMPLE IRA? \nUnlike qualified plans, a SIMPLE IRA plan is easy to administer. The start-up and maintenance costs for SIMPLE IRAs are very low compared to qualified plans . Because the responsibility of funding the SIMPLE IRA is shared between the employer and employee, employees have some degree of control over how much and when (the years in which) their SIMPLE IRAs may be funded.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ira", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:22.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "09fe18eecfea865c983d47fc5045f5e8b9c3285f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBt.zJBM7pyqAnpFZ8mbo7DspoLXjBnUZLxPoYYiL7pILm3YJQDinQvzu.sKRqMEAT7l24mFKF1K2BbYD1a1hwvXzZaZy41aHOnePy_s1TCkquiY5QfdD_uJcq72C_QUTMVH2XRIq9LD2XQKkuzz.HA65._OtnaOFfop2Yb99_nfDZ6_oQk5DapGfGAa_6AXq8GTJqo8GiiQ--", "site_full": "forums.macrumors.com", "site": "macrumors.com", "site_section": "http://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macrumors-com-news-discussion.4/", "site_categories": ["mac_support", "tech"], "section_title": "MacRumors.com News Discussion | MacRumors Forums", "title": "Apple Releases macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 With Compatibility Improvements for Third-Party USB Audio Devices 7", "title_full": "Apple Releases macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 With Compatibility Improvements for Third-Party USB Audio Devices | Page 7 | MacRumors Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T09:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.macrumors.com/data/avatars/m/0/3.jpg?1433105889", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1213, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b181ae77c1b639d839bc616ee1b9e0da0fd3fcd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBt.zJBM7pyqAnpFZ8mbo7DspoLXjBnUZLxPoYYiL7pILm3YJQDinQvzu.sKRqMEAT7l24mFKF1K2BbYD1a1hwvXzZaZy41aHOnePy_s1TCkquiY5QfdD_uJcq72C_QUTMVH2XRIq9LD2XQKkuzz.HA65._OtnaOFfop2Yb99_nfDZ6_oQk5DapGfGAa_6AXrD4ALT9NE_3o_fHnOiJsDgoJ9Zfw8_4tg-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "HowieIsaacks", "published": "2017-12-07T10:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "joueboy said: \u2191 I was looking for USB devices and got excited for a second then saw the audio.

This will be the first election under the country\u2019s new constitution that came into effect in September 2015, and the campaign has been shot through with a strong sense of history in the making, the panic triggered by over a hundred small and large terrorist attacks tragetting high-profile candidates notwithstanding. \nThe first phase of polling on November 26, when votes were cast for 37 parliamentary and 74 provincial legislature seats, saw a turnout of 65%. Nepal\u2019s Parliament will have 275 seats, 165 of which will be decided by direct voting in which the winner will be chosen by the \u2018first past the post\u2019 system that is in vogue in India; the remaining 110 seats will be decided by a system of proportional representation. The seven provincial legislatures will together have 330 members; each of these Houses will have a different strength. \nThe final outcome of the election will take about a month to be declared. The exercise is being watched with great interest by the world, and especially China and India, who played very significant roles in the peace process that has brought sweeping political change in Nepal since April 2006. For the three biggest parties \u2014 the Nepali Congress (NC) and the Left Alliance comprising the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) and the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre (CPN-MC) \u2014 the election is the vehicle for the irreversible constitutional endorsement of Nepal\u2019s transformation into a secular Republic from a Hindu Kingdom. \nDeep suspicions \nAbout eight parties worked closely with India, visibly since 2005, to bring the Maoists, then engaged in an insurgency aimed at establishing a communist state, on to a peaceful, democratic, anti-monarchy platform. Following the first election to the Constituent Assembly in April 2008, the 240-year-old monarchy was abolished, but at that moment also began the parties\u2019 drift away from their public pledge to pursue politics through \u201cconsensus\u201d. \nToday, the friends-turned-foes are deeply suspicious of each other. \u201cIf the communists come to power, our freedoms will be snatched by a totalitarian regime,\u201d Prime Minister and NC chairman Sher Bahadur Deuba has been saying repeatedly. The Left Alliance has scoffed at this, but its leaders have shied away from talking about a plan to bring about sweeping amendments in the constitution to create two power centres \u2014 a consolidated ruling party after unification, and an Executive President in place of the ceremonial Head of State. \nCampaign for boycott \nThe series of still-unexplained bombings indicates action by underground militant groups to disturb the polls. The Rastriya Janata Party Nepal, based in Madhes, the eastern Terai primarily inhabited by Maithali- and Bhojpuri-speaking people, agreed to participate in the election only after prodding by India \u2014 but attracted, in the process, strong criticism from a section of the radical elite. A senior advisor to the UK government\u2019s overseas aid arm, the Department for International Development (DFID), put out an abusive post on social media against the top three Madhesi leaders. European Union diplomats have been in touch with C K Raut, a campaigner for an independent Madhes, who has been asking people in the Madhes area to invalidate their votes, which could then be claimed as proof of support for secession. A large EU election observers team has been camping in Nepal for the past three weeks, and monitoring the behaviour of state agencies towards campaigning for a boycott. Kathmandu and some other parts of the country have also witnessed large rallies to demand the restoration of the monarchy and of Nepal\u2019s Hindu status. \nNeighbours and the elections \nIndia has frequently been accused of \u201cmicro-managing\u201d Nepal\u2019s politics, and China has gained at India\u2019s cost in popularity and acceptability in Nepal. Foreign Direct Investment flows from China have increased, including in the crucial tourism and hydropower sectors, and Nepal has ignored India\u2019s advice to not join President Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. \nChina does not seem happy with the current NC-led government in Kathmandu. Following the cancellation of the contract for the 1,200 MW Budhi Gandaki hydropower project that had been awarded to China\u2019s Gezhouba Group, Zhang Shubin, the influential director of the Nepal Centre at the Hebei University of Economy and Business, wrote in the communist party mouthpiece Global Times that the \u201ccapricious backtrack on agreement of the current Nepali Congress government did not just harm the legitimate right of the Chinese corporation, but showed an unfriendly attitude towards China\u201d. After Chinese Ambassador Yu Hong suggested to the government that handing over the Budhi Gandaki contract to India, as was being speculated in a section of the Indian media, would be seen as an \u201cunfriendly act\u201d, the government announced hastily that Nepal would build the project itself. K P Oli, the projected Prime Minister of the Left Alliance, has said that in the event of his victory, the Chinese company would get back the project. \nHaving burnt its fingers in Nepal, India appears to treading cautiously, indicated by an unusual silence over the elections. It has huge stakes in Nepal, but can clearly no longer treat its Himalayan neighbour as part of its sole sphere of influence.

For accepting payments via QR (quick response) code based transactions, the charge will be 0.30 per cent subject to a cap of Rs 200 per transaction. \nIn case the annual turnover of a merchant is over Rs 20 lakh, the MDR charges would be 0.90 per cent with a cap of Rs 1,000 per transaction. If transaction is through QR code, the charges will be 0.80 per cent with a similar cap subject to a cap of Rs 1,000 per transaction. These charges will come into effect from January 1. It\u2019s the duty of the banks to ensure the MDR levied on the merchant does not exceed the prescribed cap, it said. \u201cBanks are also advised to ensure that merchants on-boarded by them do not pass on MDR charges to customers while accepting payments through debit cards,\u201d the RBI said in a notification. \nMDR is the rate charged to a merchant by a bank for providing debit and credit card services. \nThe RBI said rationalisation of the charges is being undertaken with a view to achieve the twin objectives of promoting debit card acceptance by a wider set of merchants, especially small traders, and ensuring sustainability of the business for the entities involved. \nFollowing demonetisation, the RBI had in December last year capped the MDR charges at 0.25 per cent for transactions up to Rs 1,000. For transactions above Rs 1,000 and up to Rs 2,000, it was capped at 0.5 per cent of the transaction value. Before that, the MDR was capped 0.75 per cent for transaction up to Rs 2,000 and not exceeding 1 per cent for payments above Rs 2,000. The central bank has tweaked the fee levels to widen the network of merchant establishments which will accept the card payments and also to incentivise banks to invest more into cash-less or less-cash payment systems.

The Tigor EVs are being manufactured for Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), an entity under the Ministry of Power. \nThe first batch was flagged off in presence of Tata group chairman N Chandrasekaran, group patriarch Ratan Tata, and Tata Motors Managing Director and Chief Executive Guenter Butschek. \n\u201cAs we work together to build the future of e-mobility, I am confident that our customers will respond very favourably to this electric model,\u201d Chandrasekaran said. \nTata Motors had qualified as L1 bidder in midst of stiff competition and won the tender for manufacturing 10,000 electric cars, floated by EESL in September 2017. The other bidder, Mahindra, had quoted Rs 2.3 lakh more. The EESL had placed the order in October, which mandated supply on/before November 30, but was later postponed to December-end. \nFor Phase-I, Tata Motors is required to deliver 250 Tigor EVs, for which it has received a letter of agreement. For an additional 100 cars, the agreement is expected to be issued shortly by the EESL, the company said. \nThis is part of central government\u2019s plan to have only electric cars by 2030, in an effort to reduce both oil imports and reduce carbon emissions. \n\u201cWith e-Tigor, we\u2019ve begun our journey in boosting e-mobility and offering a full range of e-vehicles to customers.

If it wasn\u2019t for Patel, the temple wouldn\u2019t have been reconstructed,\u201d Modi said. \nWhat exactly happened in those years immediately after Independence? Was India\u2019s first Prime Minister, indeed, uncomfortable about reconstructing the temple? Why? \nBy most accounts, the ancient Shiva temple at Somnath, close to Veraval in Gujarat\u2019s Gir Somnath district, was ravaged in 1026 by Mahmud of Ghazni, who looted its riches and broke the idol \u2014 the best known among multiple attacks by a series of raiders who were drawn by the temple\u2019s legendary wealth over the centuries. These raids by Muslim invaders do not, however, appear to have triggered a sense of Hindu trauma until at least 1842, when Lord Ellenborough, Governor-General of India, issued his famous \u2018Proclamation of the Gates\u2019. Ellenborough, historian Romila Thapar recorded, asked the British army in Afghanistan to return via Ghazni, bringing back the \u201csandalwood gates of Somnath\u201d that the medieval conqueror was believed to have taken away. What his forces brought to India, however, turned out to have nothing to do with Somnath. (Somnatha: The Many Voices of A History, 2004) \u201cThe British saw this as an act of attracting certain colonial citizens. There was a political motive behind this, quite obviously. If they had been the gates of Somnath, there would have been a great appeal to Hindu conservatism \u2014 that we brought back the gates of Somnath. There was politics there,\u201d Thapar told The Indian Express. In the years leading up to Independence and Partition, however, the narrative of \u201cHindu pride\u201d found many takers, among them K M Munshi, a Congress leader from Gujarat with strong Hindu nationalist leanings. Somnath, whose destruction had until then been of largely regional interest, was elevated into the consciousness of a deeply divided nation as a symbol of Muslim intolerance and iconoclasm. \nThe first major articulation of the intention to rebuild the ruined temple is believed to have been made by Sardar Patel, Nehru\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, at a huge public meeting in Junagadh on November 12, 1947. The nawab of Junagadh had fled to Pakistan, and the Indian Army had moved into the estate. \nIn one of several blogs written between 2009 and 2014 (later compiled into a book, My Take, 2014), L K Advani, the leader of the BJP\u2019s modern Somnath movement, said: \u201cAfter returning to Delhi, (Patel) secured Gandhiji\u2019s blessings for the (temple reconstruction) and had Pandit Nehru have it endorsed by his Cabinet. The Cabinet\u2019s decision implied that the Government would incur the expenditure. But that evening itself, when Sardar Patel, Dr Munshi and N V Gadgil went to Gandhiji to apprise him of the Cabinet\u2019s decision, Gandhiji welcomed it but added: Let the people and not the Government bear the expenditure.\u201d Accordingly, a Trust was set up, with Munshi as chairman. The next few years were traumatic for the fledgling nation. With Gandhi\u2019s assassination by a Hindu extremist, the Congress lost the glue that bound a set of patriots with disparate ideologies and aspirations, but who shared the one dream of a free India. The wounds of Partition were raw, and Nehru, stridently secular, had open differences with several partymen, including Patel, on issues ranging from the treatment of minorities to the choice of President (Nehru rooted for C Rajagopalachari; Patel wanted Dr Rajendra Prasad ). L K Advani at the temple at the beginning of his 1990 Ram Rath Yatra . (Express Archive) \nIn December 1950, Patel died. The \u201cone Congress leader who was of equal standing to Nehru\u201d, was removed, historian Ramachandra Guha wrote in his magisterial work, India After Gandhi: The History Of The World\u2019s Largest Democracy. One other opposing power centre now remained: Rajendra Prasad. The differences between the President and the Prime Minister came to the fore once again in 1951, when it was time to inaugurate the rebuilt Somnath temple. \nIn his Pilgrimage To Freedom, Munshi wrote that after a Cabinet meeting in early 1951, Nehru called him and said, \u201cI do not like your trying to restore Somnath. It is Hindu revivalism.\u201d Munshi, then the Food and Agriculture Minister, wrote to the Prime Minister in reply: \u201cYesterday you referred to Hindu revivalism. You pointedly referred to me in the Cabinet as connected with Somnath. I am glad you did so; for I do not want to keep back any part of my views or activities\u2026 I can assure you that the \u2018Collective Subconscious\u2019 of India today is happier with the scheme of reconstruction of Somnath\u2026 than with many other things that we have done and are doing.\u201d \nHe then went ahead with his plan and approached President Prasad to inaugurate the rebuilt temple. Madhav Gobole, who was home secretary when Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister, and the author of The God Who Failed: An Assessment Of Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s Leadership (2014), told The Indian Express that this incident alone \u2014 when a Minister was able to go ahead with his plan despite the PM\u2019s obvious displeasure \u2014 shows Nehru was a true democrat. \u201cWe all consider Nehru to be this all-imposing, supreme leader, but the truth is, he had his limitations. In his Cabinet, he had people with all kinds of opinions, but he believed he would be able to persuade them to come around to his view. Sometimes he was successful, sometimes he was not,\u201d Godbole said. The ruins of the temple before its reconstruction. (Express Archive) \nNehru persisted, writing to the President, asking him to reconsider his decision to inaugurate the temple. He wrote to Prasad: \u201cI confess I do not like the idea of your associating yourself with a spectacular opening of the Somnath temple. This is not merely visiting a temple\u2026 but rather participating in a significant function which unfortunately has a number of implications.\u201d (Sarvepalli Gopal, Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru) \nWhat did Nehru have in mind when he said that? \nIt was not some \u201chardline secularism\u201d, said Guha. \u201cIt\u2019s important to look at what happened in those times, since we live in similar times. Partition had just happened. Millions of Muslims had stayed back in India and Nehru said that was enough affirmation of their citizenship; they don\u2019t need to go through some kind of loyalty test. He was very conscious of their vulnerability and insecurities. Hindus and Muslims had been at each other\u2019s throats only a couple of years earlier, and Nehru didn\u2019t want to polarise communities again, reopen old wounds just when India was settling down. Those were fragile times, and Nehru thought it was unnecessary for the President to associate himself with a temple that was destroyed by a Muslim invader hundreds of years ago, when Muslims of India have nothing to do with Mahmud of Ghazni.\u201d \nBut Prasad decided to inaugurate the temple anyway. On May 2, 1951, a distressed Nehru wrote to Chief Ministers: \u201cIt should be clearly understood that this function is not governmental and the GoI has nothing to do with it\u2026 We must not do anything that comes in the way of our state being secular. This is the basis of the Constitution and governments, therefore, should refrain from associating themselves with anything that tends to affect the secular character of our State.\u201d \nPrasad wrote back, saying, \u201cI believe in my religion and cannot cut myself away from it.\u201d (Durga Das, India: From Curzon To Nehru And After, 2004) \nOn May 11, 1951, the President inaugurated the grand, rebuilt Somnath temple. uma.vishnu@expressindia.com For all the latest Explained News , download Indian Express App More Related News ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

across the board quarterly returns filing for the goods and services tax (GST) were the key suggestions put across by various trade and industry groups in their pre-Budget consultation with finance minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday. Jaitley asked business leaders to invest in infrastructure sector, saying that private investment along with public and foreign investment is the key to boost growth and create job opportunities, a finance ministry release quoted him as saying. \nThe industry groups also suggested allowing purchase of banks\u2019 recapitalisation bonds by institutes and the public, reducing government stake in Public Sector Banks, allowing banks to securitise their loans and sell the same, setting-up of Land Bank Corporation for monetisation of government land including the land belonging to Army, Railways and public authorities, the finance ministry said. \nOther suggestions included setting-up of National Power Distribution Company and creation of National Innovation Fund with initial corpus of Rs 10,000 crore to promote innovation and out of box ideas along with setting-up of empowered group of state agricultural ministers to implement agricultural reforms, it said. \nFederation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) suggested an across the board cut in tax rate for businesses and individuals, especially in backdrop of US tax reform. \n\u201cThere is a need to consider across the board tax rate cuts for businesses and individuals in India to spur domestic investment and demand, and to retain India\u2019s overall competitive environment globally. In fact, many key global economies are opting for significant rate cuts, for instance, the US is on the verge of historic tax reform that proposes to cut the corporate tax rate from a top rate of 35 per cent to 20 per cent as well as provide relief to individuals\u2026.it is expected that this reform proposal would spur economic growth and increase overall tax collections. A similar approach should be followed by India,\u201d FICCI President Pankaj Patel suggested in the meeting. \nConfederation of Indian Industry (CII) suggested a cut in corporate tax rate to 18 per cent at the earliest with withdrawal of tax incentives and exemptions and surcharges and cesses. CII also suggested the government to consider levying three rates, with one rate for \u2018standard\u2019 or items of mass consumption in the range of the convergence of 12 per cent and 18 per cent; \u2018merit\u2019 goods including items used by the poor to be shifted to 5 per cent or the nil slab and the highest tax rate for \u2018demerit\u2019 goods at 28 per cent along with bringing in petroleum, alcohol and real estate in its ambit. \n\u201cIn terms of the taxation requirement, if we see corporate taxes across the world, the trend is that people are reducing corporate taxes. India is among the highest\u2026\u201d CII President Shobana Kamineni said.

An exception applies to an employer whose business is established after October 1. Such an employer is allowed to establish a SIMPLE IRA plan as soon as administratively feasible. \nFor the Employee An eligible employee's SIMPLE IRA must be established in time to receive the first contribution being made on the employee's behalf. Documentation Requirements for Establishing a SIMPLE IRA \nFor Employers An employer establishes a SIMPLE IRA by properly completing all the sections of IRS Form 5304-SIMPLE or IRS Form 5305-SIMPLE. \nAn employer who wants to allow each participant to choose the financial institution with which to establish his or her SIMPLE IRA should use the Form 5304-SIMPLE. The employer is then required to send contributions on directly to that financial institution on the employee's behalf. \nAn employer who wants to make contributions for all employees at the same financial institution should use the Form 5305-SIMPLE. All contributions for all employees will be made to SIMPLE IRAs at the same designated financial institution (DFI); however, employees may establish SIMPLE IRAs with other financial institutions to which their SIMPLE IRA balances may be transferred. SIMPLE IRA contributions may not be made directly to the SIMPLE IRA established at another financial institution. \nEmployers should consult with their financial institution regarding the proper SIMPLE IRA paperwork, as not all financial institutions use the same version of the SIMPLE form. \nFor Employees Each eligible employee must complete a SIMPLE IRA adoption agreement to establish their individual accounts. \nNotification Requirements for Establishing a SIMPLE IRA The election period is the period during which an employee may elect to participate in the SIMPLE IRA. The election period starts usually at least 60 days before the first day the employee would be eligible to participate in the plan.

The summary description must include the following information: the name and address of the employer and the trustee/custodian the requirements for eligibility for participation the benefits provided with respect to the arrangement the time and method of making employee elections with respect to the arrangement; this information indicates when and how an employee may elect to defer contributions or change their deferral-contribution elections. the procedures for \u2013 and effects of \u2013 withdrawals (including rollovers) from the arrangement Eligible Compensation \nFor common-law employees, compensation is based on W-2 wages.

With heavy drinking promoted every 5 feet you walk many people will partake.\nAs far as entitlement is concerned yes you will get the ugly tourist once in awhile but with all my travels to Isla in 11 years i have yet to see such blatant drunk behavior. Maybe that is because i avoid centro during the day? I am also positive it happens but with reading some of these posts it makes it sound like tourists are driving golf carts into bushes and crashing them into condos! LOL! I have yet to see any of that either and i drive a golf cart ALL OVER isla while i am there.\nAs far as lasting impressions i have many of Isla that i like and don't like. It goes both ways!

Dwarka is the 133rd. In each and every place, there is a huge wave in favour of the BJP. This wave will wipe the Congress away\u2026 They are seeing dreams (of winning) in Gujarat. I do not understand where they get the courage to see such dreams.\u201d \nHitting out at the Congress over the corruption issue, he said that in three and half years of the Modi government at the Centre, the Opposition cannot accuse the BJP of being involved in \u201ccorruption of even 10 paise\u201d. \n\u201cIn the 10 years of your rule (UPA government regime), you did scams and corruption amounting to Rs 12 lakh crore, while in the three and half years of Modi government, even our rivals cannot accuse us of corruption of 10 paise,\u201d Shah said and narrated how after Modi became the Prime Minister in 2014, the Congress lost states like Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand, Assam and Manipur to the BJP. \nWith Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi asking the BJP to give accounts of the work done in the last 22 years, Shah hit back at him, saying, \u201cWhenever, Rahul Gandhi questions us about the work done by our government, I say, the first thing that we did is to give the country a Prime Minister who can talk.\u201d \nMocking former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , Shah said, \u201cNobody else, except you (Rahul) and your mother ( Sonia Gandhi ) could hear the voice of the person whom you had made the Prime Minister.\u201d \n\u201cSince 1995, the people of Gujarat have always blessed BJP by voting for the party. We have been in power since 1995 and we have not been involved in a single issue that will force the BJP workers to hang their heads (in shame),\u201d Shah said, emphasising how the BJP was fighting the Assembly polls on development plank, while he accused the Congress of \u201cspreading the poison of castetism on the soil of Gujarat\u201d. \u201cVikas (development) is not the character of the Congress. Their character is corruption. Vikas is the character of the BJP,\u201d Shah said, countering the Opposition\u2019s constant attack on the BJP over the issue of development in the state. \nShah said that the BJP government undertook several development works in Dev Bhoomi Dwarka district, including a Rs 1,000-crore-cable-stayed bridge betwen Dwarka and Beyt Dwarka, Mudra loans to 3,000 youths, planned spending worth Rs 1,000 crore on SAUNI yojana, Rs 2,000 crore worth road, linking Dwarka and Porbandar. He said the Modi government has launched 106 schemes for different segments of the society. \nThe BJP chief also raised the issue of border skirmishes with Pakistan, saying, \u201cDuring Sonia-Mamohan Singh\u2019s government of 10 years, Pakistan-supported terrorists used to cross the border and behead our soldiers\u2026 But PM Modi had hit back at Pakistan by ordering surgical strikes,\u201d Shah added. \nFor all the latest Elections News , download Indian Express App More Related News ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amit shah", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "manmohan singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beyt dwarka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahul gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vikas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mudra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonia gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dwarka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonia-mamohan singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "indian express congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "upa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haryana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porbandar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manipur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dev bhoomi dwarka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maharashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dwarka", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:24.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dde6d0b664431818b91ac57e93985451f6e749f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QCjJMm01ny0hSGaU8FgAEjOotfg_dAVJ1l1t50TLsnljuLeQNmosr5tgjnhNPIynPvHTfRVm.2XjG1XwrO9iMOb0W7hQCnENiaWaQfP7XrUi9A3UgBVMZRE8.zL4Yx2UllN1ncNRA3iBaJLOm7.jhuByta0yEIxs-", "site_full": "www.politicaljack.com", "site": "politicaljack.com", "site_section": "http://www.politicaljack.com/forums/latest-political-news-and-current-events.2/", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Latest Political News and Current Events | PoliticalJack.com", "title": "Actually, authorities say Devin Kelley killed himself.

As I have never made that prediction, I'm not certain what you reference.\nIn any case, I've provided you with the logic behind my POV as well as the results so far in Colorado. Clearly, in the last four years, there has been no slippery slope in evidence...a large number of ineligible people have been prevented from buying guns and a few hundred have been taken off the streets for warrants outstanding for their arrest on felony crimes. Click to expand... Neither is there evidence of any reduction in crime. There's simply been more prosecution of ineligible purchase attempts, but there's no sign that murder or assault are lowering as a result of hassling legitimate gun sellers and legitimate gun buyers.\nYou continue to argue in favor of maintaining loopholes in the law, in spite of the fact that you acknowledge that criminals do get guns by buying them from private sellers... Click to expand... You argue that gun sellers are willfully breaking the law by selling to criminals and children -- when there is little or no evidence that this is happening, or if it is happening, that it is at all common.\nYou want to argue about whether or not there would be a sufficient decline in gun crime to justify your inconvenience. Getting shot is pretty inconvenient...getting killed would have to be worse...doncha think? I'm in favor of trying to reduce the gun violence. You've offered nothing, not one single idea, that would contribute to that reduction in the mayhem. You don't think it is a problem. Click to expand... Odd, as I don't think I was arguing about it, merely asking for evidence. There's no reason to pass a law if it isn't efficacious -- if it doesn't do what it is intended to do.
