No asset is in a trust unless it has a title document that says that it is in the trust.\u201d To further educate people about revocable living trusts and estate planning , Diran shares the following two tips, which are not to be taken as legal advice and are only meant for public service.\nNo. 1: Transfer all financial assets into the trust. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered that the majority of people who come into my office, about 60%, have made an error that ruins their estate\nplan,\u201d noted Diran. \u201cMost people never fund their trusts. For example, for a house typically held as \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Smith, husband and wife,\u2019 what their deed needs to say is \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Smith as trustees for Mr. and Mrs. Smith trust...\u2019\u201d\nPeople need to transfer not just their homes, but all their financial assets into the trust. For example, brokerage accounts. \u201cThey realize their house has a deed, they don\u2019t think their bank account has a title doc, and it does,\u201d added Diran. \u201cIf you have a trust, all of your assets need to be titled in the trust, otherwise it does nothing for you.\u201d\nNo. 2: Fund the revocable living trust in the future. \u201cFunding doesn\u2019t just mean the accounts you have now; it also means the accounts you open next week, next year, or ten years from now,\u201d stressed Diran. \u201cThe issue is not just trusts that aren\u2019t initially funded but trusts that aren\u2019t maintained. We all go through life opening and closing financial accounts, buying cars, and hopefully buying real estate. This is a very simple issue to deal with. A brief call to your financial institutions to make sure your assets are properly titled could potentially save your children many thousands of dollars in legal fees.\u201d\nThink about creating a trust as creating a big box. \u201cIf you don\u2019t put your assets in the box, the big empty box doesn\u2019t do you any good,\u201d concluded Diran. \u201cSadly, I frequently see people that come in with beautifully written trusts that were never properly funded.\u201d\nAbout Adam Diran, Diran & Grey\nAdam Diran is a J.D. and an M.B.A. Adam uses his financial expertise to advise clients in estate planning.

The platform can help you rocket to success and stand out like the majestic unicorn you know yourself to be. But, you'll only get out of this world results if you truly know how to release its potential. \nChances are, you aren't getting everything out of Twitter that you could, and you may even be wasting valuable time, or even losing followers, by performing the wrong actions or focusing on the wrong places. \nYou might also be missing out if your content isn't engaging your audience. \nTo really see what is and isn't working, you need access to hard data. It also helps to be able to find your older messages, in case you need to access the content of some of the highest performing tweets you've ever sent out. \nAnd, luckily, Twitter has you covered - so long as you know where to look. \nTo help you truly become the unicorn user you know yourself to be, here are six Twitter tools you've probably never used before, but can provide significant benefit. 1. Find Your Old Tweets \nMaybe you're feeling a bit nostalgic, or you simply want to locate some information you sent out in a tweet way back in the day. Regardless of the reason, finding your old tweets doesn't seem like an intuitive process. \nTwitter only shows your last 3,200 tweets in your timeline, so if you've been using the service for just shy of a decade and have crossed that threshold, you aren't going to find your old messages there. \nLuckily, you can use advanced search operators to hunt down your old messages. \nHow do you do it? Using Twitter's advanced search operators , you can filter your results by date. \nFor example, using a search command like this, within Twitter's Search bar, would uncover all your tweets from the chosen time period: \nfrom:[your Twitter @handle] since:2009-05-12 until:2009-06-12 \nFor an example in action, click here to view my first 2 tweets from 2008 (notice the use of the \" since \" and \" until \" advanced search operators). 2. Get Your Stats for Any Tweet \nWhile viewing your tweet gives you some basic stats (like the number of comments, retweets, and likes), you might want to dig a little bit deeper to find more valuable metrics. \nThe Tweet Activity view lets you do just that - just click on the bar graph icon and you'll be presented with a wealth of information. \nNow you can see data about the number of impressions and total engagements, as well as a breakdown of the various interactions, as you can see here. \nThis lets you learn important details about how your tweet performed, and can provide you with valuable insights about how to increase your engagement in future. 3. Promote Your Tweet for Increased Exposure \nYou may have noticed a section in the image above which enables you to promote your tweet. This Twitter service allows you to increase the number of impressions, getting your message in front of the eyes of more users. \nIf you press the 'Promote Your Tweet' button, you'll be presented with a panel where you can select a target location, choose a spending budget, and an estimated reach if you decide to go forward. \nWhile you don't need to promote every tweet, investing in the right ones can really pay off (if you want to learn more, check out this article: 6 Big Reasons You Need to Use Twitter Ads ). \nAnd, if you select your top performing posts, the true unicorns in the bunch, the cost per click can actually be very low. Twitter uses an algorithm to determine the price, and engaging content is rewarded with lower costs. \nTo find your top performing tweets, head over to the Analytics section, select the 'Tweets' tab and click the 'Top Tweets' button. 4. Gain Super Valuable Insights About Your Audience \nYou know your audience is special, but do you actually know much about who they are? \nAnother feature in the Analytics section is the ability to view demographic information about the people who read your tweets, including their various interests. \nBy gaining a deeper understanding of what your audience is interested in, you can create content that speaks to these areas. This can help you avoid getting stuck in a restrictive niche, while still allowing you to cover topics your audience wants to read about. 5. Download ALL the Data \nIf you want to take your data offline so you can really analyze the results of your activities, then downloading it is your best option. \nThis will give you your full Twitter data in a format that makes research a breeze. Then you can figure out what's working (so you can do more of it) and what isn't (so you can stop doing that). \nWhile in the Analytics section, head to the Tweets tab and click the 'Export Data' button located on the upper right-hand side. 6. Create a Twitter Moment Worth Remembering \nTwitter also gives you the ability to create 'Moments', a sort of slideshow collection of a set of tweets that makes it easier to tell a more compelling story. \nYou have to use the desktop version of Twitter to access the Moments feature. \nBegin by entering the Moments section (the icon on the upper left that looks like a lightning bolt) and click on the button on the upper right-hand side that says 'Create new Moment'. \nFrom there, you can enter a title, a short description, and choose a cover image or video. Make sure your title is captivating, but do try to keep it short. \nYou then select the various tweets you want to add to the collection. They don't have to all be your tweets, so you do have some power to create a stunning Moment using a mix of your content and tweets from other accounts that you admire. \nOnce completed, you can share your Moment through a tweet to get the word out. \nThere's a range of Twitter features that are not as well known, and can better enable you to share your message. Hopefully these tips provide some inspiration for your strategy. \nA version of this post was first published on Inc . \nFollow Larry Kim on Twitter ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "larry kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "twitter super power user tricks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "twitter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "analytics", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:26.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "718a0dfc406dcde540025e71461a9fd7881c9215", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaUuykzeLb6_.7x6yAu5i4LX1gsRRut1h00CgsCmsdl3fUURIaOGot2vLtoYdpSwFLCdq4vlLn.jLQgGKnEJ2qcangMM3EnwvBkkxykt_da69gxJI2ISszBA--", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/Nassau-Hoteis.d601784.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Nassau: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Warwick Paradise Island Bahamas - All Inclusive:", "title_full": "Warwick Paradise Island Bahamas - All Inclusive: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-11-14T07:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e5f22e6aee646fdf86c6711a374bc7326da03bfc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaUuykzeLb6_.7x6yAu5i4LX1gsRRut1h00CgsCmsdl3fUURIaOGot2vLtoYdpSwFLCdq4vlLn.jLQgGKnEJ2qcangMM3EnwvBkkxykt_da68qA5_CcgsC_fTKB27VAdv7EzTL4azYB50ftRQjryNHdtJY.vQ3se_P", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-21T00:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The food was not as expected.

Air Strike Reported Near Somalia\u2019s Capital, Official Says Shabaab Targeted \n06 December \u2013 Source: Reuters \u2013 295 Words \nAn air strike hit a village south of Somalia\u2019s capital Mogadishu on Wednesday and a local official said the attack targeted Islamist al Shabaab militants fighting to topple the country\u2019s central government. It was not immediately clear who had carried out the air strike but the United States frequently conducts such attacks to bolster Somalia\u2019s army in its fight against al Shabaab. \nA local government official told Reuters the strike occurred in Ilimey village, about 130 km (80 miles) southwest of Mogadishu. The area is mostly controlled by al Shabaab. The target, he said, was a car used by the militants to transport supplies to a squad preparing bombs. \u201cThe strike hit the car \u2026 but we do not know details of casualties,\u201d Ali Nur, deputy governor of Somalia\u2019s lower Shabelle region told Reuters. \nBut Mohamed Abu Usama, al Shabaab\u2019s governor for the same region, denied that al Shabaab personnel had been attacked and instead said the strike had killed civilians. \u201cThe strike hit a makeshift tea shop and thus killed 7 civilians and injured three others,\u201d he said. Somalia has been trapped in chaos and lawlessness since 1991 when dictator Siad Barre was toppled. Al Shabaab wants to topple the Western-backed central government and establish its own rule based on its strict interpretation of Islam\u2019s sharia law.

Witnesses and security sources confirmed to Garowe Online that Ali Ibrahim Ali [Ali Magafe], a senior State Police official dead after a bomb fitted into his vehicle went off near the city\u2019s administrative headquarters. \nThe late Ali was the head of Police department in Galkayo market. He sustained serious wounds in the blast resulted from an explosive device concealed under his car\u2019s seat, but, he was pronounced dead moments later on the spot. Puntland forces sealed off the scene near the explosion site, and launched an investigation into the incident, but no arrest was reported. Ali was on his way to the workplace at the time of the explosion. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the car bombing; however, government officials often blame Al Shabaab for such attacks in Galkayo, targeting security personnel and state officials. \nLocal authorities are yet to comment on Wednesday\u2019s blast which occurred at a time of heightened tension between rival clan militiamen from Puntland and Galmudug in the conflict-riddled city. The incident is the latest in series of assassinations against government officials of Somalia\u2019s northeastern semi-autonomous region of Puntland in Galkayo. A member of state Parliament member was killed in a similar car bomb in this year. Ministry Of Water Launches $11m Rural Water Access Project \n06 December \u2013 Source: Goobjoog News \u2013 169 Words \nThe Ministry of Energy and Water Resources today launched an $11 million rural water development programme funded by the African Development Bank. Speaking during the launch of the three year project, Federal minister for Energy and Water Resources Salim Aliyow said the project will expand access to clean water to several rural areas in the country. \u201cThis program we are launching today is aimed at facilitating and improving the access of water by the communities living in rural areas under the sponsorship of the African Development Bank (ADB),\u201d said Aliyow. \nThe Minister said the project is part of socio-economic support from the ADB adding his ministry prioritized the water programme. The project to be implemented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) will involve the renovation of 20 boreholes and well and piping of water from areas which have access to rivers. It will utilize solar energy to purify water for consumption. The event was attended by several officials from the ministry and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). PM Kheyre Hails Development Agreement With The U.S. \n06 December \u2013 Source: Allbanaadir.com \u2013 111 Words \nPrime Minister Hassan Ali Kheyre praised the U.S. government\u2019s support and development projects in Somalia following his administration\u2019s signature of a landmark development agreement with USAID. PM Kheyre termed the agreement as a positive step forward in rebuilding and the recovery of Somalia, praising the U.S. government for its commitment and unwavering support for the Somali people. \n\u201cToday is another historic and meaningful day for our future and I extend my appreciation to Somalia\u2019s partners who help the Somali people,\u201d Prime Minister noted. He also noted that the government will ensure transparency in managing the developmental projects and ensuring that all regions across the country take advantage of them. INTERNATIONAL MEDIA Uganda begins Somalia troop withdrawal \n06 December \u2013 Source: BBC \u2013 234 Words \nUganda\u2019s military says it has begun the withdrawal of 281 troops serving in the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia. This is part of a UN plan that will see African Union (AU) soldiers\u2019 numbers reduced by 1,000 by the end of this year. At the moment there are more than 20,000 soldiers serving in the AU mission (Amisom). \nUganda, which first sent troops to the country in 2007, is the biggest contributor with more than 6,000 soldiers in the force. Kenya, Burundi, Djibouti and Ethiopia are also expected to reduce their numbers by 31 December . Pulling out 1,000 soldiers will not be immediately significant but it shows the international backers of Amisom want to see a handover of security to Somali soldiers and police. \nAfrican countries have been praised for bringing increased stability to Somalia but there is frustration about corruption among their forces and the failure to secure an adequate victory. Efforts to develop Somalia\u2019s national army are gaining ground. The US has already increased its troop numbers in the country to more than 500 and stepped up airstrikes \u2013 boosting its co-operation with the Somali military. \nBut defeating the militant Islamist al-Shabab group will not be easy. A massive bomb attack blamed on the al-Qaeda-affiliated militants killed more than 500 people in the capital, Mogadishu, two months ago \u2013 the deadliest in its campaign against various UN-backed governments. OPINION, ANALYSIS AND CULTURE \n\u201cSo far, about 10% of Ari.Farm\u2019s transactions are traded through bitcoin, and the company hopes to integrate Blockchain technology for a trading platform in the future. Part of that might come as Ari.Farm looks to close seed funding of up to 2 million Swedish Krona ($237,000) in the coming months.\u201d Crowd Farming Is Being Used To Bring Somalia\u2019s Livestock Market Into The Digital Economy \n06 December \u2013 Source: Quartz \u2013 510 Words \nSomalia is a global leader in the export of goats and sheep, and livestock trade generates about 40% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Yet almost every other year, recurring droughts and water scarcity take a toll on local pastoralists\u2019 ability to keep their animals live and healthy. In 2017 alone, livestock loss has ranged from 20%-40% in the southern regions and 40%-60% in the north, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization. This threatens the livelihood of the animal farmers and hinders their ability to regularly trade in markets. \nBut a Sweden-based startup wants to change this by creating a tech-powered livestock market that is open all year round. The goal of Ari.Farm (\u201cAri\u201d means \u201cgoat\u201d in Somali) is to get investors to purchase livestock from locals, injecting much-needed cash into the market and potentially making a profit. \nOnce a purchase is made, an investor is able to name his animals, follow their progress online, and even gift or donate them. Ari.Farm takes care of the animals in two farms, one located outside Galkayo town in south-central Somalia and the other outside the capital Mogadishu. As the number of animals one owns grow from breeding, they can decide to sell them at the local market price. That amount could then be used to re-invest in more livestock or be withdrawn by the financier. \nAri.Farm founder Mohamed Jimale says since beginning operations in 2016, people from 26 countries across the world have bought almost 1,000 goats, sheep, and camels through Ari.Farm. \u201cThe Somali livestock owners are not poor, they have wealth,\u201d Jimale told Quartz. But if they are to survive \u201cthey need to find a market for their livestock.\u201d \nAcross Africa, Ari.Farm is hardly the only start-up committed to crowd farming as an avenue for investment, tackling unemployment, increasing social impact, and unlocking multi-million-dollar markets. Livestock Wealth in South Africa, Mifugo Trade in Kenya, and Ani Track in Ghana are but some of the applications bringing livestock trade into the digital economy. In Nigeria, agro-tech start-ups like Farm Crowdy and Thrive Agric have also enabled middle-class Nigerians to fund existing farms for between $200 and $750 for a harvest cycle. \nAri.Farm has now gone a step further and introduced cryptocurrencies as a payment method. Jimale says this was necessitated because customers and financial institutions kept asking about the risks of investing in Somalia. For decades, Somalia has had a freewheeling economy with the majority of the currency in circulation considered fake. But as the price gain for Bitcoin surges past $11,000 and also gains ground in the developing world, Jimale says it allows them to attract more customers and sidestep some of the conventional central banking requirements. \nThe opinions expressed herein do not necessarily reflect those of AMISOM, and neither does their inclusion in the bulletin/website constitute an endorsement by AMISOM.",

Speaking on the occasion, RN Choubey, Secretary, Civil Aviation, said, \u201cThe National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) tries to address the gap. As per the new NCAP, helicopters are free to fly from point to point without prior ATC clearance in airspace below 5000 feet. The aviation agencies should start exploring the option to start helicopter taxi services between Delhi-NCR and other north Indian states.\u201d He added that India has achieved a growth rate of about 20% in domestic air travel section in the last three years, which is the highest growth rate in the world civil aviation sector. He said that however, this growth rate is confined to fixed-wing traffic only and the helicopter traffic is much lesser in India. Inaugurating the event, Satpal Maharaj, Tourism Minister, Uttarakhand said that the helicopter taxi services have a huge potential for enforcing law and order, operate air ambulance services, to check forest fire and can provide better connectivity to religious and tourist destinations located in the rough terrain of hilly areas.

Unfortunately, sexual harassment is common and has been a problem well before the recent nationwide dialogue on the issue surfaced after countless women have come forward. \u201cSexual harassment is a form of gender discrimination. It is unwelcomed sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal (i.e. sexual jokes), physical (i.e. battery), visual (i.e. graphic sexual photos) or written conduct (i.e. text messages) of a sexual nature,\u201d said renowned civil and workers\u2019 rights attorney Toni Jaramilla , who was recently interviewed by CBC Player about sexual harassment in the film industry.\n\u201cSexual harassment is often about power, especially in \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 harassment, where an employee is expected to provide sexual favors in exchange for job benefit or avoidance of job detriment.\u201d\nIn order to further educate California employees on sexual harassment, Jaramilla, who was also featured in Law360 discussing how lawyers are challenging Weinstein-style contracts, lists the following three tips:\nNo. 1: Report the conduct in writing to management. \u201cIf you are being sexually harassed, report the conduct to HR or anyone in management in writing. Although employers are obligated to promptly investigate all reports, including verbal reports, it is best to document your report in writing so that there is a written record which shows the date and nature of your report. Once your report is made, the employer\u2019s obligation to conduct a prompt, unbiased investigation is triggered,\u201d stressed Jaramilla.\nIf the harassment rises to the level of criminal conduct like sexual assault or rape, report it to law enforcement. \u201cRemember that the laws protect you from being retaliated against for reporting sexual harassment in the workplace,\u201d added Jramilla. \u201cThus, if you are demoted or terminated after reporting sexual harassment, you may have an additional claim for retaliation.\u201d\nNo. 2: Preserve the evidence. Keep track of dates of incidents, individuals involved and possible witnesses. Save emails, text messages or phone messages that evidence sexual advances or other inappropriate conduct. \u201cYou will need this when an investigation is conducted and in the likely event that the harasser denies the allegations,\u201d noted Jaramilla.\nNo. 3: Protect your emotional and mental health. Being sexually harassed is humiliating and frightening. \u201cThe residual embarrassment and psychological and emotional trauma can be debilitating for the victim,\u201d concluded Jaramilla. \u201cSeek mental health treatment or confide in a trusted friend or family member for emotional support.\u201d\nAbout Toni Jaramilla, A Professional Law Corporation\nToni Jaramilla is committed to achieving the best possible results for employees who have experienced problems in the workplace.

She will be deported once the manslaughter case is resolved, officials said. The agency lists her name as Carmen Sosa-Bonilla.\nThe fatal crash occurred Nov. 29 in the 1500 block of North Graham Street when the Sosa\u2019s 2005 Toyota Corolla swerved into traffic to avoid hitting the back of a dump truck that had stopped on the road.
